Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong \nopposition to the administration's proposal to renew most-favored-\nnation status for China, and I rise as an original cosponsor of Senate \nJoint Resolution 31, the resolution of disapproval of MFN.\n  First and foremost, I want to recognize my good friend and colleague \nfrom North Carolina, Senator Jesse Helms. Over the years, Senator Helms \nhas dedicated himself to making this body and the American people aware \nof China's human rights record of abuse. I sincerely thank the Senator \nand his staff for their leadership on this very important issue.\n  Mr. President, yesterday, June 4, 1997, was the eighth anniversary of \nthe violence in Tiananmen Square. It has now been 8 years since the \nsuppression of prodemocracy protests in China; 8 years since the \nkilling of hundreds of unarmed civilians by the army in Beijing. In \n1989, we all watched with amazement as these courageous Chinese \nstudents marched in Tiananmen Square. Today, they are all gone.\n  During their struggle, they defied the tanks, they looked to the \nUnited States for inspiration, they quoted our Declaration of \nIndependence and, through it all, Mr. President, United States \npolicymakers have responded that economic engagement would stop China's \nabuses of human rights. As far as I can tell, it is, in fact, profit \nprojections that are primarily driving our foreign policy.\n\n  How can the United States consider renewing MFN for China when the \nChinese authorities still have taken no steps to publicly investigate \nthe circumstances of the killings and bring to justice those found \nresponsible for human rights violations? Instead, the families of \nvictims and people attempting to gather information about those killed \nare themselves subjected to harassment and intimidation in a continuing \nattempt by authorities to conceal the facts of what occurred 8 years \nago.\n  The Chinese Government defines the 1989 protest as a \n``counterrevolutionary riot.'' I believe this definition has been used \nsince 1989 to justify the imprisonment of many people who are the \nvictims of human rights violations. Thousands of political prisoners--\nthousands--arrested during the crackdown, including prisoners of \nconscience, are\n\n[[Page S5294]]\n\nbelieved to be imprisoned today. How can this Congress accept the \nadministration's proposal to renew MFN for China? How can we stand here \nin good faith and look the other way? By turning a blind eye to this \noppression in the interest of trade opportunities, I believe the United \nStates is sending a clear and unmistakable message. It is the wrong \nmessage. The message to the Government of China is one of commendation \nrather than one of condemnation.\n  It has been almost 3 years since the United States formally delinked \nAmerican trade with China for its human rights performance of abuse. So \nI say to my colleagues, much has changed in China in the last 3 years, \nbut the changes that have occurred in China have not been changes for \nthe better. We now see a human rights situation in China that is worse \nby every measure--persecution of Christians, forced abortions, \nsterilizations of the mentally handicapped, kangaroo courts for \nDemocratic dissenters, incarceration of political dissidents, and, Mr. \nPresident, the near extinction of the expression of any opinion \ncontrary to that of the Communist regime.\n  I am deeply concerned with the mounting campaign of religious \npersecutions waged by the rulers of China. Regarding China's \ndeprivation of fundamental human rights and religious aspirations, \ncontinuing MFN to China is effectively equivalent to a policy of \nappeasement.\n  The Roman Catholic Church has been made, for all practical purposes, \nillegal in China. Priests, bishops, and people of faith have been \nimprisoned and harassed. For example, Zheng Yunsu, the leader of a \nJesus family, a Protestant community in Shadong Province, is one of \nmany people who are behind bars simply for practicing their faith. He \nwas arrested during a police raid on the community in 1992. He was \nlater sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for disrupting public order \nand ``swindling.'' His four sons and other members of the group were \nalso imprisoned. I believe that they are all prisoners of conscience.\n  Mr. President, such persecutions of religious groups has followed a \nsubstantial religious revival in China over the past 15 years. In the \nChristian community, much of the expansion has been in religious groups \nthat conduct their activities outside the Protestant and Catholic \nchurches still recognized by the government, though they are greatly \nrestricted.\n  Many peaceful but unregistered religious gatherings have been raided \nby police, and those attending those services have been beaten, \nthreatened, or detained, and many of those detained are required to pay \nheavy fines as a condition for their release. Those regarded as leaders \nare usually kept in custody and either sentenced to prison terms or \nadministratively detained without charge, without trial. And this, Mr. \nPresident, is the regime to whom we would grant most-favored-nation \nstatus.\n  In January 1994, two national regulations on religious activities \ncame into force. Notably, Mr. President, they banned religious \nactivities which undermine national unity and social stability. Under \nthe broad rubric of these two regulations, any activity could be \nconstrued as undermining the Chinese Government and, therefore, \nconstitute a threat punishable by arrest, prosecution, imprisonment and \nbodily harm.\n  These regulations also require that all places of religious \nactivities be registered with the authorities according to rules \nformulated by China's Religious Affairs Bureau, an innocuous-sounding \nagency. This means, in effect, that religious groups that do not have \nofficial approval may not obtain registration and that those involved \nin religious activities in unregistered places may be detained and \npunished. Provided in these new regulations are detention and criminal \npenalties for any violation. And this is the regime to whom we would \ngrant normal trade relations and most-favored-nation status.\n  During this past year, police raids on religious gatherings organized \nby independent groups have continued, with hundreds of Protestants and \nCatholics reportedly detained as a result. More than 300 Christians \nwere reported to have been detained in what appears to be a crackdown \nby police on unregistered Protestant houses and churches. And this is \nthe Government to whom we want to extend MFN.\n  I believe there is evidence of an intensified Chinese repression of \nreligious liberty. This repression ranges from ransacking homes in \nTibet in search of banned pictures of the Dalai Lama to destroying or \nclosing 18,000 Buddhist shrines last spring. Ministers, priests and \nmonks are routinely arrested, imprisoned, tortured and sometimes killed \nfor the mere expression of their faith. For example, let's take the \ncase of Pastor Wong, who runs 40 evangelical churches. He was released \nin December after a fourth arrest for spreading the Gospel. This time, \nMr. President, the government captors broke several of his fingers with \npliers. This is the government to whom we would like to extend, again, \nMFN.\n  I believe it is the obligation of the American Government to uphold \nthe principles of democracy and freedom that we claim to espouse. By \nrenewing MFN status to China, we are turning a blind eye to the \noppressed in the interest of expanded trade opportunities. There must \nbe some things that are even more important than the almighty dollar.\n  Mr. President, in Paul Marshall's critically acclaimed book, ``Their \nBlood Cries Out,'' an authoritative book of religious persecutions \naround the globe, the case of Bishop Su is documented. During Bishop \nSu's 15 years in China's prison system, he was subjected to various \nforms of torture. One beating was so severe that the instrument of the \nbeating actually splintered. Then the police ripped apart a wooden door \nframe and used it to continue the beating until it, too, disintegrated \ninto splinters. The bishop was then hung by his wrists from a ceiling \nand beaten around the head.\n  As appalling as this story is, in another encounter, this bishop was \nplaced in a cell containing water at varying levels from ankle to hip \ndeep where he was left for days unable to sit and unable to sleep. And, \nagain, this is the regime to whom we would give most-favored-nation \nstatus.\n  Every year, countless numbers of people are detained without charge \nin breach of the law or sentenced without trial to years of reeducation \nthrough labor at the discretion of police and local officials. For \nthose who are charged, sentences are frequently imposed after unfair \ntrials, with the verdict decided beforehand. In many cases, such \nverdicts even carry the death penalty.\n  The Chinese legal system, like, I suppose, all legal systems, \nsupports the established political and governmental institutions. \nHowever, it does not do so in a way that is consistent with the rule of \nlaw and fundamental human rights. The rule of law becomes subordinate \nto higher political goals, including the defeat of perceived political \nenemies within the nation of China.\n  The vagueness and contradictory provisions of the law in China lead \nconsistently to Chinese arbitrary enforcement and provides an open \ninvitation to abuse of power. Repressive criminal legislation and the \nextensive system of administrative detention means that virtually \nanyone can be detained at the whim of individuals who happen to be in a \nposition of power.\n  As we discuss MFN for China, a vast array of laws and regulations \ncontinues to be used to detain or imprison political opponents or to \nwarn political dissidents against opposition.\n  The Chinese say over and over again that there are no political \nprisoners in China. Such an assertion is absurd on the surface and it \nflies in the face of overwhelming evidence. People are routinely \nimprisoned because of their political views or beliefs, but are \ncategorized simply as counterrevolutionaries, administrative detainees, \nor criminals. In January 1995, for instance, a Ministry of Justice \nofficial was cited as stating that 2,678 prisoners convicted of \ncounterrevolutionary offenses were currently in jail. I believe, Mr. \nPresident, that this figure represents only a fraction of the real \nnumber of political prisoners held in China today.\n\n  Furthermore, I believe that this figure excludes many thousands of \npeople who are jailed for political reasons but convicted of other \noffenses or held under various forms of administrative detention who \nhave not even been charged or tried.\n  We all know that grave human rights violations have continued in \nChina\n\n[[Page S5295]]\n\nsince 1995. They range from the arbitrary detention of people who \npeacefully express their views to gross violations of the physical \nintegrity of the person and their very right to life. Dissent and any \nactivity perceived as a threat to the established political order \ncontinues to be repressed.\n  So as we debate MFN for China, thousands of political prisoners, \nincluding members of religious and ethnic groups, are in jail simply \nfor expressing their views. Torture and ill-treatment continue to be \ncommon practices during arrest in police stations, detention centers, \nlabor camps, prisons, and this often results in the death of these \nvictims.\n  It is my understanding, Mr. President, that at least a thousand \npeople have been executed in China since the launch of a nationwide \nanticrime campaign in 1996. I call out to my colleagues that we must \nput pressure on China to stop these mass executions, many of which are \ncarried out after only show trials.\n  The political authorities in China have instructed the judiciary to \nspeed up procedures to sentence offenders, including those liable to \nthe death penalty. And I believe the result is untold miscarriages of \njustice.\n  If we grant MFN to China in view of these practices, then we too are \nguilty of a miscarriage of justice. If we renew China's MFN status, as \nthe administration wants us to, then I think we are derelict in our \nduty, this Congress' duty to uphold the principles of dignity and \nfundamental freedoms.\n  If we really want to engage the Chinese, we have to show that we are \nwilling to confront them when they break the rules. We have not done \nthat. And we will not do that by granting them most-favored-nation \nstatus.\n  For 4 consecutive years, from 1991 to 1995, the Chinese Government \nhas successfully used a procedural motion to block any resolution \ncritical of its human rights record being debated by the U.N. \nCommission on Human Rights. Mr. President, no government should be \nallowed to choose the extent to which it will abide by international \nhuman rights laws. No government should be allowed to manipulate human \nrights issues to further its political aims.\n  Newspapers in early April reported that China has been selling Iran \nthe components of chemical weapons for several years. This was one in \nan ongoing series of reports about the Chinese military. The Chinese \nare also said to be dealing in nuclear weapons with Pakistan, buying \nadvanced jet aircraft from Russia, and contracting for Russian-made \naircraft carriers equipped with surface-to-surface missiles.\n  This is the nation, this is the government, this is the regime that \nwe say, ``You deserve again to have most-favored-nation status \nrenewed,'' a nation that has a growing military capacity, that is \nincreasing its military defense spending, has an expansionist view of \nits own territorial goals and has snubbed us at every turn in our \nseeking conciliation and moderation in their foreign policy?\n  It seems while the administration would like Congress to renew MFN to \nChina, they were and are fully aware of China's supplying Iran, Iraq \nand other enemies of the United States with deadly weapons--\nconventional, chemical, and nuclear.\n  Robert Einhorn, Deputy Secretary of State for Nonproliferation, has \nrecently stated:\n\n       These dual-use, chemical-related transfers to Iran's \n     chemical weapons program indicates that, at minimum, China's \n     chemical export controls are not operating effectively enough \n     to ensure compliance with China's prospective obligation not \n     to assist anyone in any way to acquire chemical weapons.\n\n  Mr. Einhorn has also confirmed reports that China has been providing \nIran with advanced C-802 cruise missiles capable of threatening United \nStates warships in the Persian Gulf. Moreover, Mr. President, he \ntestified to a Senate panel that:\n\n       We have information of discussions between Iran and China \n     about additional conventional weapons sales. We expect there \n     will be more.\n\n  That is what our State Department is saying about China's export \ncontrols.\n  Mr. President, as for still other reports that China has been running \na brisk sale of mobile, nuclear-capable M-11 nuclear components to \nPakistan--2 years after it pledged not to do so--Mr. Einhorn said those \nreports are, in fact, correct.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues, can China, under the current \nregime, be trusted to honor its treaty obligations? If China, our \npartner in engagement under the Clinton administration policy of \nconstructive engagement, if China, our partner in engagement, supplies \nIran, Iraq, and other enemies of the United States with deadly weapons, \nwhat in reality does that make China?\n  Mr. President, the biggest question of all in this year's MFN debate \nshould be, is United States trade with China in effect subsidizing a \nmilitary buildup that will soon threaten not only Taiwan, Japan, and \nChina's other Asian neighbors, but even our own national security?\n  Mr. President, militarily, the administration has sought to \nstrengthen Taiwan. We have shipped Patriot missiles to Taiwan, and \nTaiwanese pilots are at this moment in the United States being trained \nto use the F-16 jet fighters that America has also pledged to send to \nour ally.\n  When the Chinese in effect blockaded Taiwan during a missile-testing \nexercise off its coast in March of last year, the President--and I \ncommend him--responded with a firm show of America's force dispatching \nthe Independence in the area.\n  I ask, why, even though we deplore the Chinese military buildup in \ndiplomacy and counter it in strategy, do we continue to help to finance \nit in trade?\n  Mr. President, these are some very serious questions that go \nunanswered by the administration in their attempt to renew MFN to \nChina. I am very concerned with the administration's obvious neglect \nand disregard for the United States Department of State's ``China \nCountry Report on Human Rights'' for 1996. Mr. President, the findings \nare absolutely horrific. I urge my colleagues to listen closely as I \nread one passage from this report. I quote:\n\n       Overall in 1996, the Chinese authorities stepped up efforts \n     to cut off expressions of protest or criticism. All public \n     dissent against the party and government was effectively \n     silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison \n     terms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No \n     dissidents were known to be active at year's end.\n\n  I repeat, ``No dissidents were known to be active at year's end.''\n  I continue the report:\n\n       Serious human rights abuses persist in minority areas, \n     including Tibet and Inner Mongolia. Controls on religion and \n     other fundamental freedoms in these areas have also \n     intensified.\n\n  This report debunks the logic of engagement. We were told that the \nsituation in China was going to get better. That is what I was told \nwhen I first came to Congress in 1993, that if we will grant MFN to \nChina, if we will extend that again, that this policy of engagement \nwould result in better human rights conditions in China. But they have \nnot improved. The situation has only grown worse.\n  I am astonished that the administration can justify renewal of MFN \nstatus for China, with what is provided in the report: the sale of \nwomen, religious persecution, forced abortions, forced sterilizations, \ncontinued disappearances of political rivals, et cetera. This important \nand vital report, overlooked by the administration, clearly states \nthere are no free dissidents left in China today--not one, none.\n  I understand the importance of trade. It is important to Arkansas. It \nis important to America. It is important to our farmers. It is \nimportant to our manufacturers. But, Mr. President, I am convinced \neither the President has not read the State Department's report and/or \nthe administration has ignored its findings.\n  Furthermore, China's human rights abuses, as described by the State \nDepartment, should be met with a heavy price, not a prize. Granting \nChina special status only perpetuates their illegal and indecent \nactions toward the Chinese people.\n  Some would say, you cannot talk that way about China. Some would say \nthat this will offend China. But then Ronald Reagan had many critics \nwhen he called the Soviet Union the ``evil empire.'' Our goal is not to \nisolate China, but to awaken China to its inhumanity to its own people.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I just want to make one more \nplea to my colleagues not to turn a blind eye to the oppressed in the \ninterest of trade opportunities. I urge my\n\n[[Page S5296]]\n\ncolleagues to stand up and voice their opposition to the treatment of \nthe Chinese Government toward their own people. Mr. President, I urge \nthis administration to rethink a narrowminded, nearsighted, and \nunengaging solution to human rights abuses.\n  For 16 years--for 16 years--the United States has extended MFN status \nto China, and in doing so, we have tacitly endorsed everything from \nforced abortions to the sale of dangerous weapons to our enemies.\n  I was talking to one of my colleagues early this week, and I told him \nthat I have looked for 3 years for some scintilla of evidence that \nengagement has worked, I would like to vote for MFN, but I have not \nseen any evidence at all that this policy has improved the condition of \nthe Chinese people or improved the human rights situation for those \nbeing oppressed in China. His response to me was, ``Tim, it takes \ntime.''\n\n  Mr. President, time has run out for the thousands and thousands, who, \ntoday, find themselves in prison, and the families who have lost loved \nones because of the oppressive regime that rules China.\n  The United States must stand for something once again. The debate is \nabout more than dollars and cents. It is about our values as a nation. \nOthers of my colleagues have said, ``Well, we can't tell them what to \ndo domestically.'' I would simply raise the question that it seems to \nbe that the evidence is mounting daily that they have sought to tell us \nwhat to do domestically through influencing American elections.\n  Eight years ago, the world looked on in awe and admiration for those \nthousands of students who stood with courage in Tiananmen Square. \nTiananmen Square must not become a haunting but fading memory to the \nworld and to the American people.\n  So I ask my colleagues this question: Does not a little part, a \nlittle piece of the soul of this Nation die every time we turn away and \nallow freedom to be extinguished anywhere on this globe?\n  Let us make a difference. We must confront China's abuses. The price \nof not doing so is simply too high.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5293-6", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--CONFERENCE REPORT TO ACCOMPANY H.R. 1469\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON.

Mr. President, I rise today to advise my colleagues \nthat yesterday, unfortunately, we were not in morning business so I \ncould not make this statement, but yesterday marked the 100th \nanniversary of the passage of the 1897 Organic Act which created the \nForest Service. On that day, June 4, 100 years ago, Congress passed the \nForest Service Organic Act which allowed the first on-the-ground \nmanagement of the forest reserves.\n  Prior to this date 100 years ago, forest reserves totalling \napproximately 17 million acres had been established in 1891 and 1893. \nIn the spring of 1897, another 21 million acres of forest reserves were \nadded to the system. This latter addition was the result of a \nPresidential Commission on National Forests established in 1896. The \ncommission included notable scientific and conservation leaders at that \ntime.\n  However, the addition of the second round of reserves was \nsufficiently controversial that Congress moved in early 1897 to attach \nan amendment to the 1898 general appropriations bill to eliminate the \nreserves and transfer the 21 million acres back into the public domain \nfor disposal. Outgoing President Grover Cleveland pocket vetoed the \nbill on his last day in office. This created a situation in which the \nGovernment had no money to operate and the new President, William \nMcKinley, quickly called Congress into an extra session on March 15, \n1897, to reconsider eliminating the reserves.\n  In this special session of Congress a compromise was framed which \ntook the form of the Forest Service's 1897 Organic Act and which \nrestored the 21 million acres of forest reserves. I think it is rather \nironic, Mr. President, as we consider today various and sundry \nconflicts over salvage riders and the management of various forests, \nincluding the Tongass National Forest in my State, that 100 years ago \nCongress had the same kinds of conflicts. But the national forests that \nwe have today serve as a living testimony to our ability to resolve \nthose conflicts.\n  My understanding is that other Members will join me today, Senator \nSmith and probably Senator Craig, with regard to further statements on \nthe significance of this particular date, June 4, 100 years ago, 1897, \nand further elaborate on the circumstances and conditions of the \nforests and the transition that has occurred in that 100 years.\n  However, I think it noteworthy that there are many changes in the \nnames, many changes in the boundaries of the national forests in the \nyears that have followed that event 100 years ago, but the basic land \nareas that were set aside in the Western States between 1891 and 1907 \nare still with us today. From 1907 until today another 44 million acres \nhave been added to our national forests, mostly in the Eastern States. \nThese lands, for the most part, were old, worn out farms, lands that \nwere cut over, but today represent some of the most important forested \nrecreation and timber producing areas that we have in the Eastern \nUnited States.\n  The Organic Act of 1897 allowed for the organization and active \nmanagement of the reserves by forest rangers rather than no management \nat all, which had been the case from 1891 until that time. The well-\nknown and revered Gifford Pinchot was hired on June 25, 1897, and he \nrecommended the adoption of three basic goals for the management of the \nforest reserves. The first was permanent tenure of forest land; the \nsecond was continuity of management; and the third was the permanent \nemployment of technical trained foresters. Because the tradition within \nthe Department of the Interior was to hire political appointees rather \nthan technically trained foresters, Pinchot was successful in 1905 in \nsecuring the transfer of the forest reserves to the Department of \nAgriculture where it is today.\n\n  I think it is a little bit ironic that today the new Chief of the \nForest Service is a political appointee who most recently served in the \nDepartment of the Interior. Nevertheless, technically sound management \ncontinues within the Forest Service.\n  The major section of the 1897 act was a statement of reason for \nestablishing the forest reserves. The act stated, ``no public forest \nreservation should be established, except to improve and protect the \nforest within the reservation, or for the purpose of securing favorable \nconditions of water flows, and to furnish a continuous supply of timber \nfor the use and necessity of citizens of the United States.'' Let me \nrepeat that: ``securing favorable conditions of water flows, and to \nfurnish a continuous supply of timber for the use and necessity of \ncitizens of the United States.'' That was the purpose.\n\n[[Page S5297]]\n\n  Mr. President, for the most part of 100 years of management of the \nreserves, the Forest Service has relied extensively upon the double \nprovisions of water flows and timber. Today, however, with ecosystem \nmanagement as the Forest Service envisions it, improving and protecting \nthe forests seems to have taken the forefront. I, for one, believe that \nall three criteria are important to assure that we can continue the \nbalanced, predictable, and sustainable management of our national \nforests.\n  One interesting difference from the way the world seems to work today \nis the way the Forest Service was able to complete the implementation \nregulations for the Organic Act by June 30, 1897. Today it is difficult \nfor the agency to produce regulations in 25 months, let alone get the \njob done in 25 days, which is what they did in 1897.\n  Pursuant to the provisions of the Organic Act, which established the \nphilosophy of active management of the forest reserves, the first \nnational forest timber sale occurred in the Black Hills National Forest \nin South Dakota in 1899. This sale was offered in the spirit of the \nthen recently passed Organic Act because Gifford Pinchot believed that \nthe science of forestry could be applied to manage the forest reserves \non a sustainable basis.\n  We will be displaying a photograph as I speak. I think it is \nnoteworthy, Mr. President, to recognize the significance of what this \nrepresents, because I have here for my colleagues' attention an \nenlarged photograph of the first timber sale that occurred in the \nUnited States on national forest lands. This is how it looks today, Mr. \nPresident. I think you will agree that this photograph shows a healthy, \nwell-managed forest, which 100 years later confirms Pinchot's belief in \nforestry and the renewability of the resource. Since the time of that \nfirst sale, forestry and forest practices have progressed \nexponentially, reflecting modern knowledge and technologies and a \nheightened concern for ecology and all of the ecological functions of \nthe forest.\n  This picture is an actual portrayal of the area in question today. \nThis area in the Black Hills National Forest in South Dakota was cut in \n1899. I am going to have an easel put up so that during the remainder \nof my remarks it can be viewed.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the Organic Act of 1897, although modified \nmany times by the Congress, set the standards for the management of the \nnational forests for an entire century. The vast national forest lands \nwere set aside, and they are still in existence to this day. \nControversy about the management of those forest lands, of course, \ncontinues, much as it did a century ago. The national forests are still \nunder attack from some quarters. Management is being pressured to \nchange. Special-interest groups are highly polarized. But the fact is \nthat there are national forests, and I think it speaks well that 100 \nyears ago a young country with vast resources would save and manage \nmillions of acres for the people, and that is just what we have done. \nWere we less forward-thinking people then, as some people seem to \nbelieve we are today? If we were, there would be nothing left to argue \nabout. But that is not the case.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, for the most part, the legacy of the \nForest Service for the last 100 years has been responsible stewardship \nby dedicated professionals within the Forest Service.\n  Finally, as a commemoration of today's anniversary, I am sharing with \neach of my colleagues a most important book on forest ecology called \n``Pacific Spirit: A Forest Reborn.'' This book, which was written by \nDr. Patrick Moore, is going to be given to each Member of this body. \nDr. Patrick Moore is a forest ecologist and is one of the cofounders of \nGreenPeace. That is a rather interesting reference. Here is a cofounder \nof GreenPeace writing a book on forest ecology--``Pacific Spirit: A \nForest Reborn.'' It is interesting that Dr. Moore now advises the \nForest Alliance of British Columbia, an industry-sponsored organization \nin Canada. Some Members might think it ironic that I would send my \ncolleagues a work by a former GreenPeace activist and founder of \nGreenPeace. But Dr. Moore sums up his position in this way:\n\n       As a lifelong environmentalist, I feel the need to speak \n     out because I cannot agree with claims made to the world by \n     some of my environmentalist colleagues about the total \n     destructive impact of forestry in general and clear-cutting \n     in particular.\n\n  It is the final irony today, I guess, that it takes a founder of \nGreenPeace to speak to us on the proposition that clear-cutting has \nvalue and is an adequate and recognized means of timber harvesting.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Am I correct that I am to be recognized under a previous \nunanimous consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The Senator has 30 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5296-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5297-S5300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I don't think I will use the entire 30 \nminutes. I wanted to come to the floor of the Senate today to speak \nagain about a piece of legislation that we will take up in about an \nhour and 45 minutes. It is a supplemental appropriations bill to \nprovide resources and money to help those who have been victims of a \ndisaster in our country--especially, and most importantly, the disaster \nthat has occurred in our region of the country, the Red River region, \nNorth Dakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota.\n  There are moneys in this bill for other regions as well, and there \nhave indeed been other disasters, although none quite as substantial as \nthe one that has occurred along the Red River; that is why this bill is \nso critically important to us.\n  I was a conferee on the conference committee and, last evening, the \nconference committee reported out the bill, H.R. 1469, an act making \nemergency supplemental appropriations for recovery from natural \ndisasters and for overseas peacekeeping, and so on. It is emergency \nsupplemental appropriations for recovery from natural disasters. That \nis the purpose for this bill. Congress will consider that, as I \nindicated, in about an hour and 45 minutes.\n  I want to make two points today. The first is short, and the second \nis a bit longer. The first is this: Inside this piece of legislation is \na substantial amount of help, an enormous amount of additional \nresources that will go to a number of regions of the country, \nespecially our region, to try to help the victims of the disaster that \nvisited our region. We are enormously grateful for that. There are many \nMembers of the U.S. Senate, on both sides of the political aisle here, \nwho pulled together and rolled up their sleeves and said, ``Let us \nhelp.'' The help in this bill is substantial. It is very substantial, \nand it will help our region in a manner that I can hardly describe. So \nwe are enormously grateful to every Member of this Senate and this \nCongress who helped us get to this point. That is the first point. \nThanks to everyone who helped.\n  The second point is this: The resources inside this legislation are \nonly going to be available when the President signs the bill. Time is \nurgent to deal with the needs that exist in our part of the country and \nto respond to the victims of the massive flooding that occurred in the \nRed River Valley. The reason I mention that time is a serious problem \nis because, 14 days ago, the Congress left for the Memorial Day recess \nand left this bill unfinished, and so 14 days have elapsed since that \ntime. Now it appears that Congress will pass this bill this afternoon, \nand it contains unrelated, controversial items that almost certainly \nwill be vetoed by the President because he has said time and time again \nthat if it contains especially the central item dealing with Government \nshutdowns, he will be constrained to veto the bill.\n  I rode with President Clinton on Air Force One to Grand Forks Air \nForce Base one morning, and he visited with several thousand people who \nwere then living and sleeping in an airplane hangar, a series of four \nhangars, sleeping on cots because they had been evacuated from their \nhomes. Two cities, Grand Forks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN, were \nnearly totally evacuated due to the flood waters that destroyed the two \ncommunities. Thousands of people were in airplane hangars sleeping on \ncots, wondering what would come next. President Clinton came that day. \nOne of the points he made was that the\n\n[[Page S5298]]\n\nCongress and the President certainly will help. He said, ``I hope very \nmuch that in the construction of a disaster relief bill, Congress will \nnot add unrelated amendments, controversial, extraneous amendments that \nwill slow down or derail the bill.'' He made that point in the airplane \nhangar to the thousands of people who were there for good reason --\nbecause there is a tendency in Congress to add unrelated things to \nother pieces of legislation. I don't expect that that habit will \ndiscontinue. But it is unusual for that to happen on a disaster bill. \nIt is not the usual course of events for someone to seize a disaster \nbill like this and say, oh, by the way, I have an unrelated issue that \nis very controversial and I think we can force the President to sign it \nby including it in a disaster bill.\n\n  That is not the way most Members of Congress have treated disaster \nbills in the past. Disaster bills deal with disasters. They have \nresources that are needed by victims. The Congress, by and large, has \ndecided that they will not toy with or play with or play political \ngames with a disaster bill. Yet, today, despite my enormous gratitude \nfor all of the wonderful resources that are in this bill, this bill \ncontains a couple of--especially one--totally unrelated, very \ncontroversial items that the President certainly will veto.\n  So what happens as a result of that? More delay. Probably another \nweek's delay, at least. What happens to the victims of the flood along \nthe Red River during that week? They will wait, they will wonder, and \nthey will not have answers about their future.\n  It is unfair to them to do this. Now, some say--and I read in the \npapers in the last few days--that delay doesn't matter; there is money \nin the pipeline. FEMA has money and they are helping the victims of \nthis disaster. Why are you saying that delay is a problem here?\n  To anyone who says that, they must be saying it without the facts. \nThe facts are this. In Grand Forks, ND, a city with which I am well \nfamiliar because I have been there many, many times prior to, during, \nand since the flood, about 600 homes were totally and completely \ndestroyed as a result of the flood and probably another 800 were \nseverely damaged. The people who lived in those 600 homes are not ever \nmoving back. The question is, what happens to them? They are going to \nhave to describe a new flood plain up in Grand Forks, and those homes \nare going to have to be bought out, and the money will hopefully be \nused to build new homes somewhere else. But there isn't money in the \npipeline to buy out those homes. The HUD money in this bill is not \navailable until the bill is signed. The result is that the city can't \nmake decisions until the money is there, and the result is that all of \nthose citizens and families, many of whom are now split, wake up in a \nbed that is not theirs, in the home of a stranger that took them in, or \nin a motel, or in a shelter someplace, or in a city 100 miles away, all \nof those people will continue to wait because the city can't give an \nanswer because they don't have the money. And the city doesn't have the \nmoney because this is delayed.\n  Now, let me, if I might, go through a couple of charts to describe \nthis point. The Grand Forks Herald runs this editorial every day. It is \na city of 50,000 people, 90 percent of whom were evacuated. I have said \nthat 600 homes were totally destroyed and another 800 were severely \ndamaged. The Grand Forks Herald says in its editorials, ``10 Days Since \nthe Congress Let Us Down.'' That was actually a few days ago. But, \ntoday, they will have had a different number. Every single day, the \nnumber of days ``since the Congress let us down.'' The Fargo Forum, 70 \nmiles down the road, wrote ``Act Now on Flood Relief Bill.'' It is a \nlong editorial saying ``don't delay and add extraneous amendments to \nthis kind of legislation.'' The Grand Forks Herald, again, wrote: ``11 \nReasons to Pass Federal Disaster Bill Now.'' It describes the urgency \nand the need for the legislation.\n  Now, let me, just in case my colleagues don't recall--and I assume \nmost of them do--review again how we got to where we are now. In our \nregion of the country, we had nearly 10 feet of snow, 3 years worth of \nsnow in 3 months. The last quantity of snow was nearly 2 feet--the \nworst blizzard in 50 years, we are told. This illustrates what happened \nduring that blizzard. Telephone poles snapped like toothpicks and \n80,000 people were out of power. In many cases, the power wasn't \nrestored for some long while, despite the fact that day and night crews \nwere working on poles. You can see these poles that were put in. These \npower poles were snapped off like toothpicks and 80,000 people were \nwithout power. In the middle of that, the Corps of Engineers is \nfuriously building dikes because the Weather Service says we will now \nhave a severe flood.\n  So the snow begins to melt. We have a 500-year flood.\n  This is farmland. It doesn't look like it. It looks like an ocean. \nAll you can see is the barn and a silo, and water for as far as the eye \ncan see.\n  This is a poster that shows one of our communities along the Red \nRiver. All of this is farmland. It now looks like a lake. This is \nbefore all of the snow had melted. This little Red River became a lake \nnearly 150 miles long and anywhere from 20 to 30 miles wide. That is \nwhat the citizens of this region face.\n  What did that look like? When that came through our town, it looked \nlike this--a river that had no bank, a river that became part of the \ncommunity in every home, in every business; Grand Forks, ND, and East \nGrand Forks, MN, totally inundated. In East Grand Forks, 9,000 people \nevacuated, most of them with only the shirts on their backs, totally \nevacuated. In Grand Forks, ND, 90 percent of the 50,000 population had \nto evacuate, many of them with no notice at all.\n  So here is what the Grand Forks neighborhoods looked like--all \nthroughout the town with water reaching the tops of automobiles.\n  In the downtown area we had severe flooding. Then we had a severe \nfire. In the middle of the flood a fire destroyed 11 buildings; parts \nof three blocks in downtown Grand Forks.\n  These courageous firefighters fought that fire in some cases working \nonly with fire extinguishers in ice cold water up to their waists and \ntheir chests, suffering hypothermia; and parts of three blocks of \ndowntown Grand Forks burned down.\n  Here is what it looks like. Here was a block. There is nothing left. \nIn the middle of the flood it looks like Dresden.\n  Here is another view of downtown Grand Forks flooded and destroyed \nand ravaged by fire; the fire skipped throughout the downtown.\n  I might say to the Presiding Officer that this downtown is still \nuninhabited. If you go there today--and I have been there very \nrecently--there is almost nothing going on here because there is almost \nnothing left. Every one of these buildings was severely destroyed, and \nthe new floodplain in any event when it is drawn, will take a major \npart of the downtown and destroy it further because the buildings will \nbe uninhabitable.\n  The Grand Forks Herald in the middle of all of this says, What kind \nof flood is this? ``Red Cross Tops 1 Million Meals.'' How bad was that \ndisaster: People in shelters, people evacuated all across the region, \nand the Red Cross serving 1 million meals.\n  The water is gone. That water stayed a long, long time. The National \nWeather Service predicted a severe flood with a record 49 feet which \nwould have been a record of all time on the Red River; 49 feet. But it \nwasn't 49 feet. It was 54 feet. And it inundated everything, and \nliterally brought both of those communities to their knees; to a \nstandstill.\n  What has happened in Grand Forks now? These are some pictures that \nare not quite as clear. But Grand Forks now has streets. When you drive \ndown the street, there is only a narrow path to drive down because in \nall of these homes that were destroyed or severely damaged by this \nflood homeowners are ripping all of the things out of these homes that \nneed to be taken out; the streets are littered as far as you can see up \nand down the street with just this kind of scene.\n  The citizens who go back and take a look at what they have see this. \nThis is a home that I stopped at not too many days ago. This is a home \nthat is sitting on top of a car. Incidentally, I was on a Coast Guard \nboat. And this is in an area called Lincoln Park. We were on a boat \nthrough this area. All of these homes were completely under water. It \ntook those homes right off the foundation. And this home now comes back \nand sits on top of a car. It and 600 of the neighboring homes are \ndestroyed and will never ever be inhabited again.\n\n[[Page S5299]]\n\n  In the same neighborhood, this is what happened when the flood \ninundated the home.\n  The reason I am showing these pictures, Mr. President, is some say \nthat there is not an urgency here at all. I don't know how many have \nseen what happens in a flood. But here is what Grand Forks residents, \nwhen they went back to homes that are now uninhabitable, see. They see \npersonal belongings that are unrecognizable. They see all of the \nappliances that are destroyed. And they see the job of taking them out \nto the street and putting them on the sidewalk.\n  Then we have people now in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks--\nthousands of them--who this morning didn't wake up in their homes \nbecause their homes aren't available to them. They are destroyed. They \nwake up in a neighbor's home, a friend's home, or a stranger's home who \ntook them in; a motel, a shelter, in a town 10 miles or 20 miles or 50 \nmiles away, and in some cases 100 miles away. And they are asking the \ncity of Grand Forks, ``What next?'' The city leaders of Grand Forks say \nto them, ``Well, what we are going to do is we are going to help you. \nThe Federal Government is going to give us the resources to help you. \nWe are going to buy out some of these homes. We are going to help some \nof those businesses restart. We will help some of those folks in \nrebuilding a new home.''\n  I talked to a couple down at the Lincoln Park area. They lived in \ntheir home for 43 years, and had a half-hour notice as the flood waters \ncoursed through the dikes and destroyed their entire neighborhood. Now \nthey are living in travel trailers, wondering about their future. \n``What next?''\n  Every one of those lives is on hold at this moment waiting and \nwatching and wondering when Congress will pass the disaster relief \nbill. The answer is, this afternoon.\n  That is the good news.\n  The bad news is that what Congress passes this afternoon has in it \nunrelated, extraneous amendments put there, in my judgment, only for \npolitical purposes--only to bait the President; only to say to the \nPresident, ``Sign this.'' We are going to shove it right down that \nnarrow alley and dare him to sign it. The President has already said \nthat he won't sign this. This is an amendment that deals with \nGovernment shutdowns on October 1. It doesn't have merit.\n  I don't know. Maybe we should debate that. It ought not be debated on \na disaster bill. And Members of this Congress know it. If any other \nMember of this Senate was faced with the same circumstance with their \nconstituents whose lives are on hold and who are waiting day after day \nafter day--if anyone else were in the same situation, they would be \nhere to do what I am doing to say this makes no sense.\n  Those who have visited my State and the Northern States in our \ncountry know that we have a very short construction season. We don't \nhave 12 months out of the year to rebuild. We have a very short \nconstruction season. Every single week you lose means that part of your \ncommunity begins to bleed to death. That is why this week and last week \nwas so important. It is why next week is so important. It is why I am \nso upset with those who insist on putting unrelated amendments that \nthey know will require a veto of this bill.\n  Mr. President, we are not the first region of the country to suffer a \ndisaster--earthquakes, fires, flood, tornadoes all over this country. \nAnd in all of the years that I have been in both the U.S. House and the \nU.S. Senate I have been one who said my constituents in North Dakota \nwant to be there to help. You are not alone when you suffer a disaster. \nWe want to help you. I do not recall a time since I came to the \nCongress when in the middle of a disaster bill people said, ``Oh, by \nthe way, we are going to play this like a fiddle. We have an agenda \nhere.'' This isn't about victims. It is about politics. I do not recall \na time when that has happened on a disaster bill. It has happened on \nother bills, and it has happened on both political sides of the aisle--\nboth Republicans and Democrats. We will probably never change that \nbecause of the rules of the Senate probably are never going to change. \nBut, generally speaking, in most cases Members of the Congress and the \nSenate have not done this with disaster bills.\n\n  We are going to vote on this bill this afternoon. It contains \ncritically needed aid for this region of the country.\n  There are thousands and thousands of people who are not back in their \nhomes. Seven-thousand apartments in Grand Forks, ND, are uninhabitable \nright now. So the 7,000 people in the apartment complexes aren't back \nand won't be back until they get some answer; until some moneys are \navailable, until the construction begins, until the money is in the \npipeline to get that done. And there are those who say, ``Well, gee, \nnothing is being held up. FEMA has money.'' They just do not understand \nit. They are plain flat wrong. Yes. FEMA has money. FEMA has money to \ndeal with the day-to-day needs of someone who tomorrow needs money to \nbuy a meal, or needs money to rent a hotel room. But FEMA does not have \nthe money that gives a community the ability to make the decisions to \nbuy out the neighborhoods, or to describe the new floodplain and help \npeople rebuild homes and businesses. FEMA doesn't have that money. That \nmoney is not available. That money is only available when legislation \nof this type passes and is signed by the President of the United \nStates.\n  So, if I hear one more time anyone in this Senate say, ``Well, gee, \nthere is money in the pipeline, no one is disadvantaged,'' I urge them \nto do this. Buy an airplane ticket, and I will go with you. And let's \ngo to Grand Forks, ND. There is probably going to be a city council \nmeeting the night that you get there, and there will probably be 500 or \n1,000 people there. And every single one of them will ask you the \nquestion: ``If there is money in the pipeline, show us where. Where is \nthe money that will allow us to make the decisions to get on with our \nlife? Where is it?'' If anyone who alleges that, again, buy a ticket, \nand come to East Grand Forks, MN, or Grand Forks, ND, or Watertown, SD, \nand tell those citizens where the money is. They won't do that because \nthey can't. This are dead flat wrong.\n  They are playing a game on this bill, and they ought not play a game \non this bill. They know it.\n  I raised the question yesterday: ``Why don't you pass this bill, and \nthen extract the emergency portions of this bill; just the emergency \nportions alone?'' Extract that, and pass it as a separately enrolled \nbill. And if the President vetoes it, then at least enact the emergency \nportions of it so people who have been victims of a flood and fire and \nblizzards are not going to be victimized again by delay.\n  But it fell on deaf ears because that is not what people want. There \nare some--not all--who want something more than this. They want \npolitical points. They want a political issue. I guess they will get \nit. Not from me, but they will get it because they will have a veto in \na day or two, I suppose. And then people will go home for the weekend \nhaving not passed the disaster relief, and then come back next week and \nstart juggling all of this again. In the meantime, 3 weeks will have \ngone by at a time when it is critical for the people of North Dakota \nand South Dakota and Minnesota to make decisions about their future.\n  Mr. President, I regret taking so much time of the Senate today. I \nknow other Members wish to speak on other issues. We will also have a \nchance to discuss for 2 hours the disaster bill itself in the middle of \nthe afternoon. But I wanted those who watch these proceedings to know \nwhat the facts are.\n  The facts are that there have been thousands--tens of thousands--of \nvictims of a natural disaster. That disaster was visited on them \nthrough no fault of their own; jerked out of their school; pulled out \nof their homes. The homes destroyed; the schools are closed.\n  The timing is urgent that this get done.\n  Let me end the way I began with two points.\n  One, we are enormously grateful for what is in this bill for disaster \nrelief. We are enormously troubled by the time and the delay it has \ntaken and will take to get this to the President for signature. My hope \nis that very soon all Members will understand the urgency of disaster \nrelief for those victims who need it today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n[[Page S5300]]\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Campbell pertaining to the introduction of S. 837 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend and colleague from \nColorado for his courtesy in securing my recognition after him.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bryan and Mr. Bond pertaining to the introduction \nof S. 838 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, yesterday was the 100th anniversary of the \npassage of the Forest Service's Organic Act, so it is an appropriate \ntime to reflect on how recent Congresses have addressed Forest Service \nissues.\n  Let me also say to my colleagues, yesterday had sent to each one of \nyour offices a book by Douglas MacCleery called ``The American Forests: \nA History of Resiliency and Recovery.''\n  During the 104th Congress, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee conducted the first extended series of oversight hearings on \nthe management of our Federal forests in almost 20 years. As these \nhearings proceeded, we also consulted with experts in the field of \nforestry management, participated in and evaluated the results of the \nSeventh American Forest Congress, and asked the General Accounting \nOffice and others to evaluate the current state of the management of \nour national forests. As a consequence of these efforts, we have formed \nsome conclusions about the management of our national forests, and \ntoday I would like to share these with my colleagues.\n  Notwithstanding considerable contemporary controversy, the Forest \nService remains a top performer among Federal agencies. The breadth of \ncontemporary controversy over Federal forest management and the \ncacophony of interest group outcries from all ends of the spectrum tend \nto obscure the simple fact that much of the time the Forest Service \ncarries out its duties quite effectively.\n  Over the decade, the quality of management employed on our Federal \nforests have been reflected in the integrity of the resources involved. \nSince the turn of the century, and particularly over the last several \ndecades, the science of resource management has improved dramatically. \nOur federally owned forests are arguably managed under the most \nadvanced scientific principles and the most stringent environmental \ncontrols that have been applied to any managed ecosystem in the world.\n  In a historic context, the return on this investment in scientific \nmanagement is striking. Many Federal forests which some view today as \npristine ecological preserves were, earlier in this century, little \nmore than worn-out farm lots. Species of megafauna which were \ndangerously close to extinction at the turn of the century are now \nflourishing on our Federal forests.\n  The National Forest System provides more recreation opportunities \nthan any other land ownership category in the country. Wood from our \nnational forests made a significant contribution to the American dream \nof affordable housing for post-war America, and must still continue to \nmake an important contribution to our national fiber needs today.\n  The heat generated by present-day conflicts over Federal forest \nmanagement makes it easy to forget that our national forests are \ncentury-long success stories. But this perspective is essential to \nretain as we go about the task of addressing contemporary problems and \nimproving on our performance in forest resource management.\n  Notwithstanding the barrage of negative publicity generated by the \npleadings of special interests, I remain highly impressed by the \ncommitment of Forest Service professionals of all disciplines and at \nall levels. Moreover, after more than 15 hearings on an array of \nrelated subjects, I am convinced that the majority of people--those not \nvested in a particular resource management outcome--are, after a \nreasonable opportunity to offer their thoughts, prepared to defer to \nthe judgment and expertise of the Forest Service in resource management \ndecisions. In this regard, I have reached four specific conclusions \nfrom our oversight.\n  First, budget reductions and downsizing have left the agency with \nsignificant management problems. Throughout the system their are \nnational forests with critical gaps in resource management expertise \nand/or personnel shortages. I have come away from our oversight \nconvinced that we simply must find a way to provide the agency with the \nresources to do the job we want done. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin this search.\n  Second, despite these current fiscal constraints and various and \nsundry controversies, the spirit of Forest Service employees remains \nsurprisingly strong. This spirit shone through in much of the testimony \nreceived from agency employees, particularly during field hearings. I \nbelieve we must act now to avoid squandering this endangered resource.\n  Third, the breadth and quality of resource and environmental \nexpertise within the Forest Service, even stressed by budget \nconstraints, is nonetheless unique among related Federal agencies. For \nexample, I have come to conclude that the Forest Service's specialists \npossess: as much or more expertise in endangered species conservation \nas the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; as much or more expertise in \nmanaging anadromous fish habitat as the National Marine Fisheries \nService; and as much or more expertise in maintaining or restoring \nwater quality in rural, forested watersheds as the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  Fourth, in response to probative questions, we finally began to hear \nthe acknowledgment, from other Federal agencies that this expertise \nexists and that the Forest Service could, in their view, be trusted to \nuse it. I am not convinced that their actions yet reflect these words, \nbut I was glad to hear them, nonetheless.\n  Most people still strongly support multiple-use management despite \nwell publicized assertions to the contrary. After listening to over 200 \nwitnesses from all quarters, I have come away convinced that we should \ncontinue to use our federally owned forests for a wide variety of \npurposes as long as these activities do not damage the lands. I believe \nthat the majority of the populace agrees that we should protect \nwildlife habitat, allow recreation, permit harvesting of trees, grazing \nof animals, and development of minerals on these lands, and that these \nactivities--if conducted judiciously--can be compatible. I do not \nbelieve that the ``zero harvest,'' or ``cattle free'' philosophies are \nas widely supported as their proponents maintain. For example, at the \nseventh American Forest Congress, the 1,500 participants voted 91 \npercent to 4 percent to defeat an extremist proposal to eliminate \ncommercial harvest on public lands.\n  Moreover, I also strongly suspect from what we heard that most people \nbelieve that the way to decide the best mix of uses on Federal forests \nlands is to give the Forest Service--particularly the resource \nprofessionals on the ground--as broad and independent a responsibility \nas possible to conduct studies, develop comprehensive plans, consult \nwith the public, and then implement the results. Unfortunately,\n\n[[Page S5301]]\n\nmost of the developments in contemporary resource policy over the past \n15 years have worked to reduce the forest Service's responsibility.\n  That is why last December, I began circulating comprehensive \nrevisions to the 1976 statutes that govern the management of our \nFederal forest lands. These statutes have not been changed since \nCongress passed them two decades ago and are in dire need of \nmodernization. The world that we face today is much different than the \none we faced in 1976, even as it is different than the one that we \nfaced in 1897.\n  Over the course of the last 4 months I have held a series of six \ninformal workshops on the draft that was circulated for the first time \nlast December. These workshops included representatives from all points \nof view, and were conducted to be as informal and discoursive as \npossible in hearing all points of view. Since concluding these \nworkshops a few weeks ago, we have been reworking our proposal for \nintroduction this summer. I hope that we can, in this centennial year \nof the passage of the original Organic Act, make some positive \nchanges--in a bipartisan fashion--that will provide a mandate to carry \nsustained and enlightened forest stewardship forward for another \ncentury.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous unanimous-consent \nagreement, the Chair recognizes the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Idaho. I commend \nhim on the work he does in forestry, an area in which I have great \ninterest. We have seen tremendous developments in this area. Agri-\nforestry and many related concepts are very important new ways in which \nwe cannot only benefit our environment, but maintain profitable \nrevenue-producing opportunities for landowners, and we think that \nupdating the law is very important.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague. I appreciate his \nleadership.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, we have just heard about the \nhistory and origins of the 1897 Organic Act of the U.S. Forest Service. \nI would like to describe what our forests were like a century ago and \ncompare this to where we are today as a nation of enlightened forest \nstewards. Consider the following turn-of-the-century snapshot of the \ncondition of the Nation's forests and wildlife that confronted our \nearly conservation leaders:\n  Wildfires commonly consumed 20 to 50 million acres annually--an area \nthe size of Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware combined.\n  There were about 80 million acres of cut-over land that continued to \nbe either idle or lacking desirable tree cover.\n  The volume of timber cut nationally greatly exceeded that of forest \ngrowth.\n  There were no provisions for reforestation in our system of laws. \nAside from a few experimental programs, long-term forest management was \nnot practiced.\n  Also at the turn of the century, wood was still relatively cheap. \nBecause of this, large quantities were left behind after logging. \nSawmills were inefficient. The use of wood in buildings was based on \ncustom, rather on sound engineering. Huge volumes of wood simply \nrotted.\n  Massive clearing of forest land for agriculture continued. In the \nlast 50 years of the 19th century, forest cover in many areas east of \nthe Mississippi had fallen from 70 to 20 percent or less. In the last \ndecade of the 19th century, America's farmers cleared forests at the \naverage rate of 13.5 square miles per day. And much of this land \nincluded steep slopes that were highly erodible.\n  Formerly abundant wildlife species were severely depleted or nearing \nextinction.\n  Now compare the unfortunate realities that the country faced at the \nturn of this century with a snapshot of how our forests look today as \nwe prepare for a new millennium:\n  Following two centuries of decline, the area of forest land has \nstabilized. Today, the United States has about the same forest area as \nin 1920.\n  The area consumed by wildfire each year has fallen 90 percent. And \nthis trend is continuing even with some severe fire seasons over the \nlast couple of summers.\n  Nationally, the average volume of standing timber per acre in United \nStates forests is about one-third greater today than in 1952. In the \nEast, the average volume per acre has almost doubled.\n  Populations of whitetail deer, wild turkey, elk, pronghorns, and many \nother wildlife species have increased dramatically.\n  Tree planting on all forest lands rose significantly after World War \nII, reaching record levels in the 1980's. Many private forest lands are \nnow actively managed for tree growing. 70,000 certified tree farms \nencompass 95 million acres of privately-owned land.\n  The tens of millions of acres of cut-over land that existed in 1900 \nhave long since been reforested. Many of these areas today are mature \nforests. Others have been harvested a second time, and the cycle of \nregeneration to young forests has started again. Eastern forests have \nstaged a major comeback. We are seeing an increase in forested acreage \nthroughout the Eastern States.\n  Finally, forest growth nationally has exceeded harvests since the \n1940's, with each subsequent decade generally showing increasing \nmargins of growth over harvests. By the early part of this decade, \ngrowth exceeded harvest by 34 percent and the volume of forest growth \nwas 360 percent greater than it had been in 1920.\n  Recreational use on national forests and other public and private \nforest lands has increased manyfold.\n  The efficiency of wood utilization has improved substantially since \n1900. Much less material is left in the woods. Many sawmills produce \nmore than double the usable lumber and other products per log than they \ndid in 1900. Engineering standards and designs have reduced the volume \nof wood used per square foot of building space. Preservation treatments \nhave substantially extended the service life of wood. These \nefficiencies have reduced by millions of acres, the area of annual \nharvest that otherwise would have occurred.\n  These comparisons demonstrate what huge strides have been made in \nforest management between the turn of the century and today. It is \nimportant that we recognize the Forest Service for its contributions to \nthis progress. In my home State of Oregon, which has some of the most \nproductive forest land in the world, the Forest Service has been a \nresponsible partner in managing our Federal lands.\n  In fact, Forest Service employees in Oregon last year endured several \nphysical attacks against their operations. Not only did arsonists burn \nthe Oakridge Ranger Station to the ground, but they also destroyed a \nForest Service truck at the Detroit Ranger Station. I want to thank \nthose Forest Service employees in Oregon for enduring such deplorable \nacts of terrorism, and also recognize the agency's hard work all over \nthe State.\n  Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to commend the U.S. \nForest Service for helping improve the stewardship of our natural \nresources over the last 100 years. The agency's efforts to use sound \nscience and its ability to look forward have become a worldwide model \nfor balancing the growing needs of our land. While we may not agree on \nevery issue, I look to the Forest Service for equally successful \nleadership in the next 100 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work of \nsomeone who is rightly referred to as the dean of the New York press \ncorps, Alan Emory, Washington bureau chief of the Watertown Daily \nTimes. This Saturday Alan marks his 50th year with the Times, the last \n46 have been spent here in Washington.\n  But more important than the length of Alan's service is the manner in \nwhich he has served his community. He has been a thoughtful, candid, \nand thoroughly professional reporter who has given the readers of the \nWatertown Times a clear view of the work of their elected officials in \nWashington.\n  Alan is tough but fair, and his influence extends far beyond \nWatertown. Never content to just follow the pack, Alan is constantly on \nthe lookout for stories that may not make the network evening news, but \nwhich have a real impact on the lives of his readers.\n  Born in New York City, Alan was raised on Long Island and educated at\n\n[[Page S5302]]\n\nPhillips Exeter Academy, Harvard University, and the Columbia Graduate \nSchool of Journalism. A World War II veteran, he arrived in Watertown \nin July 1947 and was one of three Columbia graduates hired that summer \nby Harold B. Johnson, the editor and publisher of the Watertown Times.\n  Alan's first beats included the Boy Scouts and the local railroad \nstation, but he was soon assigned to cover the city of Massena where he \ngot his day-to-day newspaper training.\n  It was also during this time that Alan began covering politics and \nhis impressive work led to his editor assigning him to the St. Lawrence \nCounty political beat.\n  In October 1948 he was appointed State editor and the following year \nhe was named Albany correspondent. During his time in Albany he met his \nwife of 47 years, Nancy, and they have two sons, Marc and John, and a \ndaughter, Katharine.\n  In 1951, Alan was asked to go to Washington. For 46 years and the \nadministrations of 10 Presidents, Alan has kept his readers informed \nabout what's going on down here and how it affects them.\n  Alan has always been an example of the best in professional \njournalism and he has proudly served as president and director of the \nSociety of Professional Journalists and as president of the Gridiron \nClub.\n  Mr. President, I want to extend congratulations to Alan Emory on 50 \nyears of providing journalistic excellence to the readers of the \nWatertown Times.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I commend the work of Federal District \nCourt Judge Richard Matsch, the judge in the Oklahoma City bombing case \ntried in Denver, CO, as well as the prosecution team led by Special \nAssistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Hartzler.\n  I do not want to do anything that might prejudice the legal process \nand sentencing phase of this trial. However, on behalf of all of \nColorado, I would like to recognize the outstanding work done thus far.\n  Prior to the trial, I took some time out and Judge Matsch took me \nthrough the Federal district court and explained to me the security \nmeasures that they had taken and explained to me how he wanted to \nproceed with the trial. I was very impressed with the forethought that \nhad gone into making the proper setting for this very important trial \nin Denver, CO.\n  I realize that the success of something like this is not one man. I \nrealize that a lot of very dedicated people had a role in the progress \nof this particular trial. But I believe that Judge Matsch has \ndistinguished himself as a jurist and deserves our praise for \noverseeing the proceedings in this very high-profile case which brought \njustice for the victims and survivors of the worst act of terrorism \never to hit U.S. soil.\n  Confidence in our legal system has been renewed, thanks to the very \ntight ship run by Judge Matsch, who took a commonsense approach toward \nthe courtroom. Judge Matsch appropriately protected the jurors in his \ncourtroom from distraction and allowed the completely intact jury to \nreach a unanimous verdict in less than 6 weeks.\n  Judge Matsch did a good job because he focused on what was important \nand not television reaction, prime-time interviews, or book deals. \nInstead, Judge Matsch focused on justice--justice for the victims of \nthe bombing, justice for their survivors, and justice to the defendant.\n  I hope that this commonsense approach is a model for future high-\nprofile cases, and that Judge Matsch does an equally fine job during \nthe sentencing portion of this trial.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, In the past few months my Democratic \ncolleagues have attempted to paint the picture of a national emergency \nregarding unfilled vacancies in the Federal courts. We hear talk of a \njudicial crisis, of justice suffering at the hands of overworked and \nover-burdened judges, and of the Senate Judiciary Committee creating \nthis situation out of political motivation. A recent example is an \narticle in the Washington Post which interviewed only one Texas \ndistrict judge who described how he was plowed under with work ever \nsince Congress decided to get tough on drug smuggling and illegal \nimmigration. And because his district has three open seats, he can't \nkeep up with the caseload. Unfortunately this one judge has been used \nin an attempt to reflect some kind of a national crisis. Maybe some \nclarifying remarks regarding the central issues of this article will \nshed some light on this matter.\n  As the chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative \nOversight and the Courts, I sent a comprehensive questionnaire to \narticle III judges last year. This extensive judicial survey addressed \nthe very concerns raised by the May 15 article in the Washington Post. \nThe judge in question was kind enough to respond to the questionnaire, \nas were most of his colleagues. As a matter of fact, 12 out of 17 \nactive judges over 70 percent of the southern district of Texas \nfurnished my subcommittee with detailed replies. Of those 12 judges, \nonly 2 other judges complained of an unmanageable caseload and of a \ngrowing backlog. That means that 9 out of 12 judges found their \ncaseloads to be manageable. As a matter of fact, one judge even stated \nthat: ``there is absolutely no backlog whatsoever.''\n  Of the three judges who did complain of not being able to keep up \nwith their workload, one had been on the bench less then 2 years, and \nthe other two were the only two judges in the southern district \ninvolved in extensive outside work activities beyond occasional\n\n[[Page S5303]]\n\nspeaking engagements. You would think that before judges complain about \nneeding more help, they would be devoting 100 percent of their working \ntime and energy to their caseloads. Unfortunately, it appears that is \nnot the case here.\n  One must also keep in mind the organizational set-up of the district \nin question. The southern district has the highest number of judges in \nall of Texas, one of the highest in the Nation for that matter. Right \nnow a total of over 30 active judges, senior judges, and magistrate \njudges are handling cases in that district. All but three of the active \njudges last year found their caseloads were manageable. Therefore, when \none throws statistics and numbers around, we must be careful how to \ninterpret those figures. For example, we must factor in the number of \ncases which are handled by staff attorneys. Prisoner petitions, for \nexample, are rarely handled by a judge, but are routinely included in \ncaseload statistics. As another Texas judge has told me, once prisoner \npetitions are factored out, the southern district's docket has actually \ndecreased, not increased over the last 10 years. In addition, numerous \njudges have contacted me and praised the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act \nas having had a substantial and dramatic impact on the number of \nprisoner filings and as having caused that number to decrease \nenormously. I have asked the judge in question for more information on \nthese issues.\n  We must also keep in mind that many senior judges are hearing cases. \nIn the southern district of Texas there are at least three senior \njudges. In order to be certified, a senior judge must carry, at a \nminimum, a 25 percent caseload. And many senior judges maintain a full \ncaseload. Yet, senior judges are not factored into the weighted \ncaseload statistics when ascertaining whether new judges are needed. In \nother words, senior judges are not even counted, even though they make \nconsiderable contributions. Again, beware of the numbers you read in \nthe paper.\n  As a matter of fact, nationally there are 48 seniors judges certified \nat 25 percent workload, with another 86 senior judges who are doing at \na minimum at 25 percent workload. In addition, there are 206 senior \njudges certified at a 50 percent or more workload. Now lets add up the \nnumbers: if you take 25 percent of the 48 senior judges, 25 percent of \nthe additional 85 senior judges, and 50 percent of the 206 senior \njudges, you would have 136 full time judges, which more than makes up \nfor the 100 or so vacancies nationwide. Now, while I would agree that \nthere may be pockets of districts around the country that need some \nhelp, the overwhelming majority of the judges in the district named by \nthe Washington Post, and across the Nation for that matter, are working \ndiligently to serve justice and are doing so with a manageable caseload \nand without a backlog.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the Washington Post \narticle printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 15, 1997]\n\n               Cases Pile Up As Judgeships Remain Vacant\n\n                         (By Sue Ann Pressley)\n\n       Laredo, Tex.--The drug and illegal immigrant cases keep \n     coming. No sooner does Chief U.S. District Judge George Kazen \n     clear one case than a stack of new cases piles up. He takes \n     work home at night, on weekends.\n       ``It's like a tidal wave,'' Kazen said recently. ``As soon \n     as I finish 25 cases per month, the next 25 are on top of me \n     and then you've got the sentence reports you did two months \n     before. There is no stop, no break at all, year in and year \n     out, here they come.\n       ``We've already got more than we can say grace over down \n     here,'' he said.\n       This is what happens to a federal judge on the southern \n     border of the United States when Washington cracks down on \n     illegal immigration and drug smuggling. It is a situation \n     much aggravated by the fact that the Senate in Washington has \n     left another federal judgeship in this district vacant for \n     two years, one of 72 vacancies on federal district courts \n     around the country.\n       As Border Patrol officers and other federal agents swarm \n     this southernmost region of Texas along the Mexican border in \n     ever-increasing numbers, Judge Kazen's docket has grown and \n     grown. He has suggested, so far unsuccessfully, that a \n     judgeship in Houston be reassigned to the Rio Grande Valley \n     to help cope.\n       In Washington, where the laws and policies were adopted \n     that has made Kazen's life so difficult, the Senate has made \n     confirmation of federal judges a tedious process, often \n     fraught with partisan politics. In addition to the 72 federal \n     district court vacancies (the trial level), there are 25 \n     circuit court vacancies (the appellate level) and two vacant \n     international trade court judgeships across the country, \n     leaving unfilled 99 positions, or 11 percent of the federal \n     judiciary. Twenty-six nominations from President Clinton are \n     pending, according to Jeanne Lopatto, spokeswoman for the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee, which considers nominations for \n     recommendation to the full Senate for confirmation.\n       Of those 99 vacancies, 24 qualify as judicial emergencies, \n     meaning the positions have been vacant more than 18 months, \n     according to David Sellers of the Administrative Office of \n     the U.S. Courts. Two of the emergencies exist in Texas, \n     including the one in Kazen's southern district.\n       Lopatto said the thorough investigation of each nominee is \n     a time-consuming process. But political observers say \n     Republicans, who run the Senate, are in no hurry to approve \n     candidates submitted by a Democratic president. The pinch \n     is particularly painful here in border towns. The nominee \n     for Brownsville, in Kazen's district, has been awaiting \n     approval since 1995. Here in Laredo, Kazen's criminal \n     docket has increased more than 20 percent over last year.\n       ``We have a docket,'' he said, ``that can be tripled \n     probably at the drop of a hat. . . . The Border Patrol \n     people, the Customs people at the (international) bridges \n     will tell you, they don't catch a tenth of who is going \n     through. The more checkpoints you man, the more troops you \n     have at the bridges, will necessarily mean more stops and \n     more busts.''\n       And many more arrests are expected, the result of an \n     unprecedented focus on policing the U.S.-Mexican border. \n     Earlier this year, Clinton unveiled a $367 million program \n     for the Southwest for fiscal 1998, beginning Oct. 1, that \n     includes hiring 500 new Border Patrol agents, 277 inspectors \n     for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 96 Drug \n     Enforcement Administration agents and 70 FBI agents.\n       In Kazen's territory, the number of Border Patrol agents \n     already has swollen dramatically, from 347 officers assigned \n     to the Laredo area in fiscal 1993 to 411 officers in fiscal \n     1996. More tellingly, in 1993, agents in the Laredo sector \n     arrested more than 82,000 people on cocaine, marijuana and \n     illegal immigration charges. By 1996, arrests had soared to \n     nearly 132,000, according to data supplied by the INS.\n       All of which is keeping Kazen and the other judges here \n     hopping. ``I don't know what the answer is,'' said U.S. \n     District Judge John Rainey, who has been acting as ``a \n     circuit rider'' as he tried to help Kazen out in Laredo from \n     his post in Victoria, Tex. ``I certainly don't see it easing \n     up anytime soon. There still seems to be such a demand for \n     drugs in this country, and that's what causes people to bring \n     them in. Until society changes, we won't see any changes down \n     here.''\n       In a letter to Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.) in February, \n     Kazen outlined the need for a new judge in the Laredo or \n     McAllen division, rather than in Houston, where a vacancy was \n     recently created when then-Chief Judge Norman Black assumed \n     senior status. ``The `border' divisions of our court--\n     Brownsville, McAllen and Laredo--have long borne the burden \n     of one of the heaviest criminal dockets in the country, and \n     the processing of criminal cases involves special pressures, \n     including those generated by the Speedy Trial Act,'' he \n     wrote.\n       On a recent typical day, Kazen said, he sentenced six \n     people on drug charges and listened to an immigration case. \n     His cases tend to involve marijuana more often than cocaine, \n     he said.\n       ``The border is a transshipment area,'' he said. ``The fact \n     is, a huge amount of contraband somehow crosses the Texas-\n     Mexican border, people walking through where the river is \n     low, and there are hundreds and hundreds of miles of \n     unpatrolled ranchland.\n       ``In some cases,'' Kazen continued, ``we're seeing a \n     difference in the kind of defendant. We're almost never \n     seeing the big shots--we're seeing the soldiers. Once in a \n     while, we'll see a little bigger fish, but we're dealing with \n     very, very smart people. We see some mom-and-pop stuff, too. \n     There was a guy who came before me who had been in the Army \n     umpteen years, and he needed the money, he was going \n     bankrupt, so he did this 600-pound marijuana deal. He said he \n     stood to pick up $50,000, and now he's facing five to 40 \n     years.\n       ``We see kids 18 and 19 years old,'' Kazen said. ``We see \n     pregnant women. We see disabled people in wheelchairs. This \n     is very, very tempting stuff.''\n       In Washington, the argument over court vacancies continues. \n     On April 30, Attorney General Janet Reno told the Judiciary \n     Committee, ``Chief judges are calling my staff to report the \n     prospect of canceling court sittings and suspending civil \n     calendars for lack of judges, and to ask when they can expect \n     help. This committee must act now to send this desperately \n     needed help.''\n       In remarks yesterday to the Federal Judges Association \n     meeting in Washington, Reno warned that ``the number (of \n     vacancies) is growing.''\n       ``As you are no doubt aware,'' Reno told the judges, ``the \n     level of contentiousness on the issue of filling judicial \n     vacancies has unfortunately increased in recent times.''\n\n[[Page S5304]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5302-5", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5302-S5304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CHIEF JUDGE KAZEN, U.S. DISTRICT COURT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, In the past few months my Democratic \ncolleagues have attempted to paint the picture of a national emergency \nregarding unfilled vacancies in the Federal courts. We hear talk of a \njudicial crisis, of justice suffering at the hands of overworked and \nover-burdened judges, and of the Senate Judiciary Committee creating \nthis situation out of political motivation. A recent example is an \narticle in the Washington Post which interviewed only one Texas \ndistrict judge who described how he was plowed under with work ever \nsince Congress decided to get tough on drug smuggling and illegal \nimmigration. And because his district has three open seats, he can't \nkeep up with the caseload. Unfortunately this one judge has been used \nin an attempt to reflect some kind of a national crisis. Maybe some \nclarifying remarks regarding the central issues of this article will \nshed some light on this matter.\n  As the chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative \nOversight and the Courts, I sent a comprehensive questionnaire to \narticle III judges last year. This extensive judicial survey addressed \nthe very concerns raised by the May 15 article in the Washington Post. \nThe judge in question was kind enough to respond to the questionnaire, \nas were most of his colleagues. As a matter of fact, 12 out of 17 \nactive judges over 70 percent of the southern district of Texas \nfurnished my subcommittee with detailed replies. Of those 12 judges, \nonly 2 other judges complained of an unmanageable caseload and of a \ngrowing backlog. That means that 9 out of 12 judges found their \ncaseloads to be manageable. As a matter of fact, one judge even stated \nthat: ``there is absolutely no backlog whatsoever.''\n  Of the three judges who did complain of not being able to keep up \nwith their workload, one had been on the bench less then 2 years, and \nthe other two were the only two judges in the southern district \ninvolved in extensive outside work activities beyond occasional\n\n[[Page S5303]]\n\nspeaking engagements. You would think that before judges complain about \nneeding more help, they would be devoting 100 percent of their working \ntime and energy to their caseloads. Unfortunately, it appears that is \nnot the case here.\n  One must also keep in mind the organizational set-up of the district \nin question. The southern district has the highest number of judges in \nall of Texas, one of the highest in the Nation for that matter. Right \nnow a total of over 30 active judges, senior judges, and magistrate \njudges are handling cases in that district. All but three of the active \njudges last year found their caseloads were manageable. Therefore, when \none throws statistics and numbers around, we must be careful how to \ninterpret those figures. For example, we must factor in the number of \ncases which are handled by staff attorneys. Prisoner petitions, for \nexample, are rarely handled by a judge, but are routinely included in \ncaseload statistics. As another Texas judge has told me, once prisoner \npetitions are factored out, the southern district's docket has actually \ndecreased, not increased over the last 10 years. In addition, numerous \njudges have contacted me and praised the Prisoner Litigation Reform Act \nas having had a substantial and dramatic impact on the number of \nprisoner filings and as having caused that number to decrease \nenormously. I have asked the judge in question for more information on \nthese issues.\n  We must also keep in mind that many senior judges are hearing cases. \nIn the southern district of Texas there are at least three senior \njudges. In order to be certified, a senior judge must carry, at a \nminimum, a 25 percent caseload. And many senior judges maintain a full \ncaseload. Yet, senior judges are not factored into the weighted \ncaseload statistics when ascertaining whether new judges are needed. In \nother words, senior judges are not even counted, even though they make \nconsiderable contributions. Again, beware of the numbers you read in \nthe paper.\n  As a matter of fact, nationally there are 48 seniors judges certified \nat 25 percent workload, with another 86 senior judges who are doing at \na minimum at 25 percent workload. In addition, there are 206 senior \njudges certified at a 50 percent or more workload. Now lets add up the \nnumbers: if you take 25 percent of the 48 senior judges, 25 percent of \nthe additional 85 senior judges, and 50 percent of the 206 senior \njudges, you would have 136 full time judges, which more than makes up \nfor the 100 or so vacancies nationwide. Now, while I would agree that \nthere may be pockets of districts around the country that need some \nhelp, the overwhelming majority of the judges in the district named by \nthe Washington Post, and across the Nation for that matter, are working \ndiligently to serve justice and are doing so with a manageable caseload \nand without a backlog.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the Washington Post \narticle printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 15, 1997]\n\n               Cases Pile Up As Judgeships Remain Vacant\n\n                         (By Sue Ann Pressley)\n\n       Laredo, Tex.--The drug and illegal immigrant cases keep \n     coming.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay my deepest respects \nto Father William Cunningham. Detroit lost one of its favorite sons on \nMonday, May 26, when Father Cunningham died following a 7-month battle \nwith liver cancer.\n  His passing, and the loss we now face, brings us great sorrow. True \nheroes, after all, are never easily replaced. However, it also provides \nus a moment's pause to reflect upon and celebrate the extraordinary \ndeeds of a man too humble to accept any congratulations while still in \nour midst.\n  Rarely do individuals, by the sheer force of the power of their \nvision, manage to alter the destiny of an entire city. Father \nCunningham, without question, was one of these individuals. His \ncommitment to Detroit, and to eradicating the problems that plagued it, \nwas unwavering. Where others decried the insurmountable obstacles, \nFather Cunningham optimistically advocated solutions.\n  William Thomas Cunningham grew up in Detroit's Boston-Edison \nneighborhood. He attended Sacred Heart and St. John's Provincial \nSeminaries and was ordained into the priesthood in 1955.\n  Father Cunningham was teaching English at Sacred Heart Seminary when \nwidespread rioting broke out in Detroit in the summer of 1967. Just a \nfew short blocks from his classroom Detroit was being torn apart, both \nliterally and figuratively.\n  In the aftermath of this deadly summer, Father Cunningham and Eleanor \nJosaitis, a Taylor, MI, housewife and mother, joined forces. Angered by \nwhat they felt was an inadequate response on the part of the religious, \nacademic, industrial, and government establishments, Cunningham and \nJosaitis formed a civil rights organization, Focus:HOPE, to work to \nensure the summer of 1968 was a peaceful one.\n  In an effort to promote racial harmony, Cunningham and Josaitis began \ngathering and distributing food and clothing to riot victims. In the \nprocess of doing so, Cunningham learned of Agriculture Department \nwarehouses stocked with food supplies. With the missionary's zeal and \npowers of persuasion that made him such an effective public servant, \nCunningham convinced the USDA to donate these large stockpiles for \nassistance to the inner city poor.\n  Today, Focus:HOPE feeds 51,000 people a month. However, Focus:HOPE \nhas evolved and grown into so much more than just an organization that \nfeeds the hungry.\n  Father Cunningham was driven by the belief that the only thing \nseparating the poor and unemployed in downtown Detroit from their \nbetter off counterparts in the surrounding suburbs was a lack of job \ntraining and education. So Focus:HOPE set out to make people more \nemployable.\n\n  Two decades later, on a forty acre industrial and educational complex \non Oakman Boulevard in Detroit, Focus:HOPE runs myriad highly \nsuccessful enterprises. The Center for Advanced Technologies trains 85 \npeople to graduate with bachelor's degrees accredited by Wayne State \nUniversity. The Machinist Training Institute offers year-round classes \nand boasts of a 100-percent graduation and placement rate. Yet another \nprogram is Fast-Track, a training course to teach prospective job \napplicants the necessary math and communications skills to be \ncompetitive. Focus:HOPE also runs two for-profit auto parts \nmanufacturing firms, High-Quality and Tec Express, not to mention a \nchild care center, a communications center and a food distribution \ncenter.\n  Consider the following statistics as a measure of the success of \nFather Cunningham's work. At the time of its conception in 1968, \nFocus:HOPE had a budget of about $12,000. In 1996, that budget had \ngrown to $76 million. Focus:HOPE currently employs over 800 people and \nhas 45,000 volunteers.\n  Last October, Father Cunningham was diagnosed with cancer. He \ncertainly wouldn't have been faulted had he chose to rest and enjoy his \nfinal days. Yet, as he had done his entire life, Father Cunningham \nchose to fight on. At the same time he battled his cancer, he continued \nto press forward with his latest project. In the days ahead, Focus:HOPE \nwill open Tech Villas, an apartment complex of over 100 units, will be \nconstructed within an empty former Michigan Yellow Pages building.\n  Father Cunningham was a man who had received the praise of \npresidents, heads of industry, and an entire city grateful for his \nvision. In the end, however, Father Cunningham still thought of himself \nas a simple parish priest, no more important than those he served.\n  It may be years before Detroit sees the likes of another leader as \ndynamic and committed as was Father Cunningham. No amount of tribute \ncan ever begin to sufficiently repay our debt to Father Cunningham and \nEleanor Josaitis, who will carry on their work.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of all my colleagues in the Senate and all \nthose who live in my State of Michigan, I bid a fond farewell to Father \nWilliam Cunningham. While he may no longer be with us, his legacy lives \non in the institution he built, in the city he helped save, and in the \ncountless lives he touched.

Then there are those few who are dynamic \nenough to make history.\n  This week we honor someone who has made more history than most--our \ndistinguished President pro tempore, Strom Thurmond.\n  Strom Thurmond was born during the Presidential term of Theodore \nRoosevelt--probably the only other person in the 20th century to have a \ncomparable energy level.\n  And in the same way TR launched America on the great adventure of the \n20th century, Strom Thurmond has been a real force in building up and \nguiding America during that century.\n  A few of our colleagues may have been friends with Jack Kennedy; but \nStrom Thurmond is the one who ran against Harry Truman--and came within \na hair of denying him the White House.\n  He is the only sitting Senator today who actually was on a general \nelection ballot as a Presidential candidate.\n  Strom Thurmond has always been a man of the people.\n  In 1954, when the 31-member committee that represented the political \nestablishment of South Carolina froze him out of a special election, \nStrom Thurmond did what no one before or since has done--ran and won as \na write-in candidate for the U.S. Senate.\n  Strom Thurmond has always been ahead of his time, with his finger on \nthe pulse of history.\n  In the middle of the Johnson landslide in 1964, he moved against the \ntide, from the Democrat to the Republican party.\n  With the next election, he became only the second elected Republican \nSenator from the deep South since Reconstruction.\n  By the time the next two sitting Senators changed party affiliation--\n30 years later--a majority of the Senators and Representatives from \nacross the Nation--and, for the first time since Reconstruction, a \nmajority from the South--were now in Strom Thurmond's adopted party.\n  In fact, he is the only Senator to have served as a Democrat in the \nmajority and the minority, and as Republican in the majority and the \nminority.\n  When we look at the New South today, we see the fruits of the \n``Thurmond Revolution,'' or the ``Thurmond Realignment.'' He showed the \nway.\n  The issue on which I've probably worked most closely with Strom has \nbeen the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  When you work with him closely on an issue like that, you see how, \nand why, his colleagues revere him.\n  I cosponsored the first balanced budget amendment that made it to the \nfloor of the U.S. House in 1982. I've been a part of writing every one \nsince.\n  But Strom cosponsored an earlier version in the 1950's. Once again, \nhe was ahead of his time.\n  When we finally pass that constitutional amendment, and permanently \nlock in that balanced budget we\n\n[[Page S5305]]\n\nachieve in 2002, it will be the ``Thurmond Amendment.''\n  When you ask Strom Thurmond what his secret is for stamina and \nenergy, he may say something about diet, working out, swimming, or \nloving the work he does for the people of his State.\n  But his secret is, he thinks young--always.\n  He probably still considers himself the junior Senator from South \nCarolina--every time he stands with constituents for a picture in front \nof the portrait of John C. Calhoun just outside this Chamber.\n  One year, his campaign camper was the ``Strom Trek.'' Another year it \nwas the ``Thurmon-ator.''\n  And he loves to talk with young people.\n  He always has time to talk to the pages and visit with our staffers, \ntreating them with respect and warmth, making them feel special.\n  He always remembers to ask about our families, and always imparts \nsome of that joy of life to those around him.\n  Strom Thurmond has a joy of life, a love of people, and a sense of \nduty that give him purpose and energy.\n  In a world that we fear is becoming too coarse, he is gracious--and \nreminds us of the way back to civility.\n  He is devoted to God and country.\n  He is our most senior Senator and the highest-ranking constitutional \nofficer of the Senate. Best of all for us, Strom Thurmond is our friend \nand teacher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5304-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending May 30, the United States imported 8,374,000 \nbarrels of oil each day, 327,000 barrels less than the 8,701,000 \nimported each day during the same week 1 year ago.\n  While this is one of the few weeks that Americans imported less oil \nthan the same period 1 year ago, Americans still relied on foreign oil \nfor 56.5 percent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that \nthe upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United \nStates obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign \ncountries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil \naccounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil? By \nU.S. producers using American workers?\n  Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in \nAmerica if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double \nthe already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United \nStates--now 8,374,000 barrels a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5305-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       JUNK GUN BAN IN CALIFORNIA\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to mark a historic day in the \nnationwide movement to get junk guns, or Saturday night specials, off \nour streets. The California State Assembly and the California Senate \npassed legislation to prohibit the manufacture and sale of junk guns in \nCalifornia. The bills require that all guns made or sold in California \nmeet the same quality and safety test currently required of imported \nfirearms.\n  I applaud and thank each and every member of the California \nLegislature who voted for the bill for their courage in supporting this \nimportant legislation. I especially wish to acknowledge Assemblyman \nLouis Caldera and Senator Richard Polanco, whose leadership and \ntenacity contributed immeasurably to the passage of this legislation.\n  The bills passed by the California Legislature are nearly identical \nto a bill I introduced in the Senate last spring, the American Handgun \nStandards Act, which I have reintroduced this year. For the largest \nState in the Union to pass this legislation is extraordinary.\n  I trust that this important victory is just what we need here in \nCongress to move forward with junk gun legislation on the Federal \nlevel. Each year, nearly 40,000 Americans die from gunshots and more \nthan 200,000 are injured. Gunshots are now the leading cause of death \namong children in California.\n  I have spoken on this floor many times before about the junk gun \ndouble standard that has flooded our streets with cheap, unsafe, easily \nconcealable handguns. In 1968, Congress required that all handguns \nimported to the United States meet a tough quality and safety test. \nThis import restriction virtually cut off the flow of foreign junk \nguns. However Congress failed to require domestically produced handguns \nto meet the same test. This double standard led to the creation of a \ndomestic junk gun industry that has flooded our streets with these \nunsafe, ultracheap handguns.\n  Study after study has shown that these junk guns are the criminal's \nweapon of choice.\n  California has taken the lead in a nationwide movement to get these \nguns off our streets. Thirty-two cities and counties have enacted local \nordinances banning junk gun sales within their jurisdictions. Now that \nthe California Legislature has taken this courageous step, I urge \nGovernor Wilson to sign this historic legislation.\n  Today, Californians who want an end to gun violence had a major \nvictory, and the U.S. Senate should take notice. I hope that soon we \nwill be able to pass the American Handgun Standards Act, which will \nmake our children, our families, and our communities safer.\n  There is no reason why American-made handguns should not have the \nsame quality and safety standards as imported handguns. This dichotomy \nis killing our people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5305-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5305-S5309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NATIONAL GUARD\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, over the last few days, I have been reading \nin newspapers and hearing on radio and television about the Quadrennial \nDefense Review [QDR] and the so called National Defense Panel [NDP]. \nThe QDR is supposed to be a comprehensive assessment of current \nmilitary strategy and force structure, as well as outlining a vision \nfor the future. However, experts have called this QDR ``A Cold War \nRelic'' and when it comes to the Army, I agree with them.\n  I truly believe the citizens of Kentucky and the American people \ndeserve the best national defense strategy the Nation can afford. Yet \nthe Active Army wants to cling to their 10 divisions, while \nsimultaneously calling for a new Base Closure Commission. This is \nespecially ironic when you consider that during the 1995 Base Closure \nCommission, the Active Duty Army leadership insisted the Army could not \nafford to close any more bases. This was just 2 years ago. The Base \nClosure Commission said not to have another Commission until the year \n2001.\n  Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to read page 3-2 of the \n1995 Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission's report to the \nPresident, which says `` * * * The Defense Department will be \nimplementing the closures and realignments of the 1995 and prior \nCommissions through the end of this decade. The requirement in the \nDefense Base Closure and Realignment Act that all Closures be completed \nwithin 6 years means that the closures\n\n[[Page S5306]]\n\nfrom the 1995 round will not be completed until 2001. For that reason, \nthe Commission recommends that the Congress authorize another Base \nClosure Commission for the year 2001 similar to the 1991, 1993, and \n1995 Commissions.'' I understand this is still the view of our former \ncolleague Alan J. Dixon, the Chairman of the 1995 Base Closure and \nRealignment Commission.\n  The Active Army argues that they are going to cut the Active Force by \n15,000 men and women. But my colleagues shouldn't be fooled. When you \nlook closely, you will see that the 15,000 troops the Army wants to cut \nare nothing more than ghosts. What you have are 15,000 positions in the \nActive Army that have been left empty the last few years.\n  So the question remains: where does the Army plan to put these ten \ndivisions--with no real reductions--if they close bases? How do they \nmeet their budget target, while simultaneously protecting their general \nofficer slots and keeping their 10 active divisions? Their answer? Cut \nthe Army National Guard by approximately 38,000 people. That is a 10 \npercent reduction of the entire Army National Guard Force Structure.\n  This is the very same Army National Guard, Mr. President, that \ncurrently provides more than 55 percent of the ground combat forces, 45 \npercent of the combat support forces and 25 percent of the Army's \ncombat support units, while only using 2 percent of the Department of \nDefense budget.\n\n  Why, my colleagues might ask, would the Active Duty Army leadership \ndo such a thing? Well lets look. First, the Army leadership argues that \nthe Guard divisions have no war fighting missions. This is true. But \nthe Guard divisions have no war fighting missions because the Active \nDuty Army leadership has failed to give them a war fighting mission. \nAnd the reason they don't give them a war fighting mission is because \nthen they would have to explain why they still wanted to keep 10 active \nduty divisions.\n  Also the Active Army does not consider members of the Army National \nGuard as soldiers. Instead they treat the men and women of the Army \nNational Guard with contempt. These Active Duty types seem to forget \nthat the men and women of the Army National Guard have undergone the \nsame training as the active duty forces. Fifty percent of the entire \nArmy National Guard are men and women coming off active duty with the \nArmy.\n  The generals in the Active Army should look at their own figures \nregarding retention of their active duty members. The annual attrition \nof the Active Army is 36 percent, the attrition in the Army Reserve is \n34 percent, while the attrition in the Army Guard is only 18 percent.\n  Perhaps what is most frustrating to me is the fact that the Active \nArmy refused to consult with the Army Guard during the QDR. When asked \nabout this oversight by the press, the Army spokesperson responded that \n``there is an Army Reserve colonel and a Guard colonel here in our \noffices. They get to weigh in on the issues.'' You don't need an \nextensive knowledge of military affairs to realize that a colonel \ndoesn't pull much weight against a group of active duty Army generals \nprotecting their turf.\n  Mr. President, there should be no reason for the poor working \nrelationship between the Active Army and the Army National Guard. I \nlook at the strong working relationship between the Active Air Force \nand Air National Guard and wonder why can't the Army have this kind of \nrelationship. I look at the great relationship the Active Duty Marine \nCorps has with its reserve units and wonder why not the Army and the \nGuard?\n  Mr. President, Company A, 4th Tank Battalion, 4th Marine Division \n[REIN] which was deployed to Saudi Arabia in December 1990 is stationed \nat Fort Knox. This company of outstanding reservists was selected to \nlead the attack by the 6th Marine Regiment into the battle for Kuwait. \nThis outstanding Marine Corps Reserve unit fought along side their \nactive duty comrades and did a great job.\n  They were able to work side by side with their active duty \ncounterparts because the Marine Corps Reserves play a vital role in the \nMarine Corps military strategy and because the Marine Corps integrates \nboth reserve training and education with their active counterparts.\n  There are a number of plans I have been told about which could save \nmore than $2.5 billion a year for the Army. They envision elimination \nof two Active Divisions. Two divisions could come out of Europe, and \nthe Army could fly brigades from the United States to Europe on a \nrotational basis to serve a 3-month tour. The Army could take the \nequipment from these divisions and modernize Guard Divisions and give \nthe Guard Divisions the war fighting missions of the two eliminated \nactive divisions.\n  Remember, Mr. President we have a Marine Corps that we can send \nanywhere in the world. We can do the same with the Army. Look at the \n101st, the 82d, the 10th Mountain, and the 3d Infantry Division. These \nare tough Active Duty Forces that the 15 enhanced National Guard \nBrigades and the 8 National Guard Divisions can support.\n  Given these tight fiscal times, I hope all my colleagues remember \nthat an Army Guardsman can be kept combat ready for an annual cost of \n$17,000, while an active duty soldier costs more than $80,000. The Army \nGuard, just like its Active Duty counterpart, is trained for combat.\n  Up to this point, I have tolerated the Active Army's all-too-obvious \nbias. Yet the QDR represents the final straw. Some of my colleagues \nwant to wait for the National Defense Panel to do their review and \nreport to Congress. I was a cosponsor of the amendment that called for \nthis panel. When Senator Bond and I agreed to cosponsor the amendment \ncreating the Defense Panel, we did so only after we had received \nassurances that someone with a Guard background would be on the panel.\n  Mr. President, the National Defense Panel has been turned into a \njoke. It is nothing more than a warmed-over version of the failed Roles \nand Mission Commission--a Commission that spent more money in 2 years \nthan the Base Closure Commissions spent in 5 years.\n  No one other than the outgoing Deputy Secretary of Defense has been \ninterested in anything the Roles and Mission Commission reported and it \nshould come as no surprise that this Commission also did not have a \nGuard representative. So what we have is a National Defense Panel \nappointed by the outgoing Deputy Secretary of Defense consisting of \nindividuals from our cold war days who have no background in working \nday-to-day with the National Guard.\n  Even my friend Senator McCain, an author of the amendment that \ncreated the National Defense Panel, expressed his disappointment with \nthe lack of imagination in appointing the members of this Panel.\n  I think it's high time we put a stop to this childish bickering \nbetween the Army and the National Guard. The Active Duty Army needs to \nget its act together and accept the National Guard as an equal partner \nso they all can be the best Army they can be.\n  Mr. President, I ask unamious consent that the following articles, \none from the National Guard magazine by Maj. Gen. Richard C. Alexander, \nbe printed in the Record following my remarks, also that two articles \nfrom the Armed Forces Journal, May 1997, issue by former Congressman \nG.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery and a second article by John G. Roos. I hope \nall my colleagues will read these articles.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Armed Forces Journal, May 1997]\n\n                     An Apples-to-Apples Comparison\n\n             (By MG Richard C. Alexander, President, NGAUS)\n\n       The Pentagon announced this month that a Virginia Army \n     National Guard rifle company has been notified to begin \n     training for possible deployment to Europe in support of \n     Operation Joint Guard, the Bosnia peacekeeping mission \n     formerly known as Joint Endeavor.\n       Thousands of Guard members have deployed for this mission \n     over the past several months, many of whom already have \n     returned to home station. So, you may ask, what's the big \n     deal? The big deal is that should the unit actually deploy, \n     Virginia's C Company, 3d Battalion, 116th Infantry, would be \n     the first National Guard infantry unit to be mobilized by the \n     Department of Defense since the Vietnam War. It's fitting \n     that this unit, which once fell under the command of Gen. \n     Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson, might break the ice. I'm proud \n     of C Company, just as I am of all our units.\n\n[[Page S5307]]\n\n       At the same time, this newsworthy event adds poignancy to \n     an ongoing debate about the Department of the Army's failure \n     to include its National Guard combat troops in national \n     military strategy. To this day, none of the Guard's eight \n     combat divisions is in the nation's warfighting plans. The \n     question is not only why it has taken so long for the Army to \n     call up a Guard infantry unit, but also why Guard divisions \n     are completely excluded from the war fight? Haven't our \n     combat troops undergone the same training as our active-duty \n     brethren? Isn't the Guard's training and readiness ultimately \n     the responsibility of the active Army?\n       In fact, under the provisions of Title 11, the Army \n     National Guard Combat Readiness Reform Act of 1992, the Army \n     is supposed to provide 5,000 active-component advisors whose \n     primary responsibility is to ensure National Guard and \n     Reserve training standards are achieved. To date, the Army \n     has not met this congressional mandate.\n       In this issue of National Guard Magazine, you will find \n     strong evidence, despite what some Army leaders say, that \n     Army Guard combat units can mobilize in time for war.\n       Let me point out a comparison that exposes the weakness in \n     the active Army's straw man concerning the ability of Guard \n     units to successfully mobilize for war. During the Gulf War \n     mobilization, the 4th Tank Battalion, a United States Marine \n     Corps Reserve unit in the 4th Marine Division, successfully \n     transitioned from the M-60 to the M1-A1 Main Battle Tank in \n     just 45 days. The battalion trained, shot and qualified, then \n     deployed to the Gulf where it fought alongside its active \n     Marine Corps counterparts. Indeed, one of its companies \n     knocked out 35 of 36 Iraqi tanks in less than five minutes. \n     This is just one example of the success the Marine Corps has \n     had with putting all its units into the fight--by doctrine \n     and by training.\n       The Army must be just as accountable for the relationship \n     it has with Army Guard combat units.\n       In our Gulf War experience, the Tennessee Army Guard's \n     212th Engineer Company was the first American unit into Iraq \n     after the ground war began, breaching the way for allied \n     tanks. The 20th Special Forces Group, composed of National \n     Guard units from Alabama, Florida, Maryland, Mississippi and \n     Kentucky, completed their 90-day certification program in \n     half the time. And, of course, our National Guard artillery \n     units are legendary for their performance in the Gulf War, \n     with such standouts as Oklahoma's 1st Battalion, 158th Field \n     Artillery, (Multiple Launch Rocket System), which fired \n     record numbers of missiles on target.\n       Those who pay close attention to national defense know the \n     Guard and Reserve units are dependent upon how they are \n     treated by their respective services. Army Guard members are \n     ready, willing and motivated to take on real-world missions, \n     if only given the chance. We've proven this in places like \n     the Sinai, and we're proving it countrywide everyday.\n       The active Army leadership needs to be held accountable for \n     the Army Guard's overall performance. The Army must foster a \n     better working relationship among all of its officers and \n     enlisted personnel, active, Guard and Reserve. Army leaders \n     should not only be squelching myths about the Guard's combat \n     units, but taking the lead in promoting our successes on and \n     off the battlefield.\n       My hat is off to the Marine Corps leadership for fully \n     integrating its reserve fighting units into its total combat \n     force. The Marine Corps reserve forces play a vital role in \n     the national military strategy. The Corps continues to \n     integrate both reserve component training and professional \n     military education with that of the active component.\n       Needless to say, news about the 4th Tank Battalion's feats \n     during the Gulf War sparked a healthy competition within the \n     Corps' ranks. Last October, five years after the war, the \n     best tank crews from four Marine tank battalions--two active \n     duty and two reserve--were pitted against each other in a \n     showdown at Fort Knox's ultra-modern Yano Tank Range. Not \n     surprisingly, the 4th Tank Battalion's crew came out on top.\n       To emphasize its policy of equal treatment between its \n     components, the Corps dropped the term ``reserve'' in \n     reference to its ``part-time'' soldiers. They train their \n     soldiers for combat, and they send their soldiers to combat. \n     They don't wallow in hypothetical arguments.\n       It's time the active Army leadership followed suit.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Ensuring the Strength of Our Future--The QDR and the Future of the \n                           Guard and Reserve\n\n                  (By Hon. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery)\n\n       Someone recently asked me, ``Who's going to look out for \n     the National Guard and Reserve now that you've retired from \n     Congress?'' I thought about the question, in light of the \n     soon-to-be-released Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and the \n     reality of today's changing defense environment, and the \n     answer was simple: The nation, led by my colleagues in \n     Congress, will safeguard the Guard and Reserve because the \n     Guard and Reserve so effectively help protect our nation.\n       A public treasure, the National Guard is actually older \n     than the United States, first convening in the 13 original \n     colonies. Now, more than 220 years later, its two-fold \n     mission remains the same: to protect the state and to be a \n     part of the federal militia. From thwarting drug smugglers on \n     our southern and western borders to fighting on the front \n     lines in the Gulf War, today's guardsmen and reservists play \n     a vital role in protecting America's interests and citizens.\n       A roadmap for the future of our defense requirements, the \n     QDR must assess threats to our nation and our military's \n     capability to meet them. This QDR intends to evaluate the \n     changing nature of conflict in the world today and whether it \n     is feasible for our services to fight and win two regional \n     Gulf War-sized conflicts nearly simultaneously.\n       My colleagues in Congress, however, will continue to base \n     decisions to allocate funds less on the threat of regional \n     conflicts and more on meeting anticipated global \n     contingencies around the world. A keen eye will also be kept \n     on such potential flash points as China, North Korea, Iran, \n     Iraq, and possibly even Russia.\n       I have heard some concerns voiced that QDR's bottom-up \n     review isn't appropriate given that many members of Congress \n     who will evaluate the report lack military backgrounds. In my \n     view, the process is still effective. Worldly in experience \n     and highly educated, men and women in Congress, regardless of \n     having served in wartime, possess the most important \n     quality--the power to listen--to the QDR commission, to \n     military experts, and most importantly, to the people they \n     serve--their constituents, the American people.\n       When I was elected to Congress in 1967, more than 50 \n     percent of the national budget went to the military. Now, \n     less than 20 percent of our nation's budget funds the \n     military. With the threat of further reductions of up to \n     40,000 active military personnel, the fate of our nation's \n     security--and of the Guard and Reserve--is in question.\n\n\n                            more cuts ahead\n\n       The Guard and Reserve have shared the pain of the overall \n     cutbacks, facing reductions in end strengths each year since \n     1980. With total active military personnel expected to shrink \n     by 21 percent from FY96 to FY98, selected Reserves are \n     expected to be reduced by 10 percent, and civilians (FTEs) \n     will shrink by 27 percent.\n       These numbers seem staggering; we simply cannot set in \n     motion the bleeding of the nation's National Guard and \n     Reserve's fighting strength.\n       A few things to consider: The Guard and Reserve are perhaps \n     one of the best values for the American taxpayer today. In \n     times of conflict, the Guard and Reserve participate equally \n     in the fighting force, side by side with their active-duty \n     counterparts. But personnel costs for Guard and Reserve are \n     only half as much as for the full-time military. And let's \n     remember that these citizen-soldiers are an important link \n     between the public and the professional military.\n       Some have questioned whether the Guard and Reserve, in \n     their present forms, are still pertinent in today's changing \n     environment. But their existence has become more appropriate \n     than ever before, given the expanded domestic role they \n     fulfill. For example, just in the past few years alone, the \n     Guard and Reserve have been called to perform a wide range of \n     missions here at home, from reacting to the Los Angeles \n     riots, to supporting community rebuilding efforts in the \n     current aftermath of the Midwest flooding, to protecting our \n     borders in the drug interdiction program. These domestic \n     activities should not, however, take the place of combat \n     missions and combat support.\n       The Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve, for \n     example, with the highest number of full-time technicians, \n     have done an excellent job of training and planning for \n     missions, sometimes a year or more in advance. While other \n     components have so far been prepared to move out despite \n     shorter planning cycles, they are moving to adopt the Air \n     Force's successful advance planning structure. Through proper \n     training, Guard and Reserve units are ready to deploy in a \n     reasonable time.\n       As with anything, the role of the Guard and Reserve is only \n     as good as we make it. In the last 15 years, I worked with my \n     colleagues in Congress toward the billion-dollar package of \n     add-ons to fortify the Guard and Reserve. But today my \n     colleagues in Congress must be more vigilant than ever before \n     in protecting this extremely valuable national resource.\n\n\n                           stem the drawdown\n\n       I urge Congress to restore defense budget spending levels \n     to maintain our strength and capability to fight any conflict \n     or mission we encounter. We must also stem the massive \n     drawdown in the Total Force. We've gone about as far as we \n     can or should go.\n       As a way of strengthening and preserving the Guard and \n     Reserve, I offer the following recommendations:\n       The Department of Defense and all service branches must \n     continue to accept the role of their National Guard and \n     Reserve counterparts as part of the Total Force. This \n     includes assigning them more combat and combat support \n     missions.\n       DoD must offer equitable benefits and enticements to gain \n     and retain the best men and women for our Guard and Reserve. \n     This includes expanding health care and dental benefits, \n     offering combat pay for overseas missions, and confirming \n     legislation to provide health care coverage for victims of \n     Gulf War Syndrome rather than waiting indefinitely for the \n     results of lengthy medical research.\n       The active force must continue to play an important role in \n     improving training for the Guard and Reserve.\n\n[[Page S5308]]\n\n       Just as for active personnel, we must continue to provide \n     the same state-of-the-art, properly maintained equipment and \n     tools, and the proper personnel to sustain them. Further, we \n     must make Operations and Maintenance funds readily available \n     to keep that equipment in top fighting shape.\n       Whatever the outcome of the QDR process, the Total Force--\n     Active, Guard, and Reserve--will continue to provide for the \n     defense of this great nation and for the freedom of our \n     people.\n                                  ____\n\n       Enter Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs \n     Deborah Lee. At her direction, early last year the Institute \n     for Defense Analyses (IDA) was told to conduct a \n     comprehensive inquiry to determine how long it would take to \n     get the most complex type of division in the National Guard \n     force structure ready to deploy for combat. The Texas \n     National Guard's 49th Armored Division was selected as the \n     test unit, and the actual readiness conditions prevailing in \n     the 49th were used in establishing the study's baseline.\n       Drawing on the expertise of officers from HQDA and the \n     Army's Training and Doctrine Command, Forces Command, and \n     other appropriate organizations, a seven-month study began \n     last July. Using relatively conservative planning assumptions \n     for such things as the availability of training areas and the \n     amount of training support that could be expected form \n     active-duty army elements, the IDA-led inquiry determined \n     that the 49th Division could achieve a validated readiness \n     status in 94 days and could get to either a port of \n     debarkation or an airhead in 132 days.\n       Not surprisingly, when these conclusions made their way to \n     the Army staff early this year, they created more than a bit \n     of heartburn. As things now stand, active-duty Army officials \n     believe that the study results are probably flawed because--\n     get this--the Active Army probably wouldn't be able to \n     deliver the types of training and other support that the \n     Active Army is supposed to provide to the National Guard \n     during the mobilization process. They're not sure though, \n     since there is no standard procedure for validating the \n     readiness status of a National Guard division; in fact, \n     there's no Army field manual that lays out the process by \n     which a division is supposed to mobilize and prepare for \n     deployment.\n       It's ironic that while most elements of America's military \n     force structure would like nothing better than to find a \n     place to hide during QDR deliberations, the Army National \n     Guard is crying out for attention. But some National Guard \n     officials clearly feel that years of benign neglect have put \n     their divisions in a perilous position for QDR-prompted cuts. \n     With the IDA-led study results in hand, these officials vow, \n     they aren't about to disappear quietly.\n\n   Unequal Partners--National Guard's Combat Divisions Remain Hidden \n                    Beneath Mantle of Benign Neglect\n\n                           (By John G. Roos)\n\n       Today's ``Total Army'' includes eight National Guard combat \n     divisions. This substantial slice of America's combat power \n     is in addition to the National Guard's 15 ``Enhanced \n     Readiness Brigades'' that presumably would be used to augment \n     active-duty forces in the event of an all-out national \n     emergency. But those eight divisions haven't attracted much \n     attention during the nearly completed Quadrennial Defense \n     Review (QDR), since they're not even included in America's \n     war plans.\n       Ever since the contentious issue of Georgia's 48th Infantry \n     (Mechanized) Brigade's purported inability to achieve ready-\n     for-deployment status during Desert Storm, Army planners have \n     shed away from relying on National Guard combat units to \n     augment active-duty Army forces during the early stages of a \n     conflict. In spite of the special attention the Army \n     continues to devote to its Enhanced Brigades in order to keep \n     them at relatively acceptable levels of combat readiness, \n     they still remain far from the tip of the spear in the \n     Service's deployment plans. But at least those Enhanced \n     Brigades do come into play at some point during Army \n     warfighting planning sessions. The same can't be said of the \n     eight National Guard divisions.\n       In the wake of the ``come-as-you-are'' planning assumptions \n     that flowed from the Bottom-Up Review's short-notice, two-MRC \n     strategy, those eight divisions were deemed so unlikely to be \n     ready to deploy in time to make a difference in the conflicts \n     the Army would most likely face that they were quietly \n     flushed from Army war plans. The plug was pulled more than \n     five years ago, when former Army Chief of Staff General \n     Gordon Sullivan told the House Armed Services Committee that \n     it would take 365 days to prepare a National Guard division \n     for deployment to a combat arena. After the howls of protests \n     from National Guard leaders subsided, the Army revised its \n     estimate downward to 270 days. But that three month chop by \n     the Army headquarters staff did little to assuage the Guard's \n     leadership: Even a nine-month mobilization, training, and \n     deployment cycle, they argued, was blatantly pessimistic and \n     would continue to exclude National Guard divisions from the \n     Army's warfighting planning process.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I join with my friend and cochair of the \nNational Guard Caucus when I call the attention of my colleagues to an \neditorial found in today's issue of the Washington Times by Mr. Philip \nGold, entitled ``The Army vs. The National Guard'' which I ask \nunanimous consent to be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BOND. This editorial outlines succinctly the issues facing the \nNational Guard in the debate surrounding its force structure and its \nvery future. I have said before and reiterate now in the strongest of \nterms, that rather than bill payer, the Guard's role should be vibrant, \nviable, and adequately funded by the Department of Defense.\n  National Guard units from every State are, today, involved in \noperations domestically in their State roles, and globally in their \nnational role. Recently, units from my home State have been involved in \nmissions in accordance with United States directives in Bosnia, \nHungary, the Persian Gulf, and continue to serve our interests there. \nUnits from States which have experienced natural disasters have \ntraditionally been the ``Cavalry to the rescue.'' Even the U.S. Air \nForce was a recipient of the National Guard's professional response \nwhen and A-10 aircraft which had crashed in a remote area was initially \ndiscovered by a National Guard Team involved in the search.\n  With the fiscal constraints being imposed on our military force while \nsimultaneously increasing their roles and missions, we need the Guard \nnow, more than ever. We need it to be trained, we need it to be well \nequipped, and we need it funded.\n  Mr. President I call upon all Senators to join with me and Senator \nFord along with the other members of the National Guard Caucus in a \npledge to insure the robust nature of the National Guard, a service \nfrom which we ask so much.\n\n\n                               exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 5, 1997]\n\n                    The Army vs. the National Guard\n\n                            (By Philip Gold)\n\n       The fracas was inevitable. Several weeks ago, the National \n     Guard's senior leadership concluded that they hadn't been \n     given a fair chance to make their case before the Quadrennial \n     Defense Review (QDR). They also concluded that the Army was \n     systematically lying to them about the extent of the Guard \n     reductions they wanted. So they requested a meeting with \n     Defense Secretary William Cohen and were told to ``go through \n     their chain of command.''\n       So they did . . . through their other chain of command. \n     They went to the governors, who started writing the \n     president, cc: the Pentagon. That got Mr. Cohen's attention \n     and Mr. Cohen's attention--to adapt a venerable adage--\n     started flowing downhill. As of this writing, the secretary \n     was ordered an Army/National Guard ``off-site'' at the \n     Pentagon (great place for an ``off-site'') to work it out the \n     first week in June. Also as of this writing, the Guard has \n     received seven contradictory letters from Mr. Cohen, army \n     secretary Togo West and senior army generals on structuring \n     the meeting. About the only thing that hasn't been suggested \n     is a United Nationals peacekeeping force in the room.\n       Maybe not such a bad idea, given the acrimony on both \n     sides.\n       Whatever the ``off-site'' producers, it won't last long. \n     The Army and the National Guard have been at it for \n     centuries. The Guard has survived through a combination of \n     domestic political savvy and foreign threats that seemed to \n     require a large reserve. But does this venerable (some would \n     say archaic) institution have any relevance to today's world \n     and tomorrow's missions?\n       The answer is that the Guard has a greater relevance today \n     than during the Cold War--exactly the kind of relevance the \n     Founding Fathers envisioned when they elected to place the \n     preponderance of the nation's military strength in the state \n     militias.\n       Three facts vindicate the Guard. First, the U.S. simply \n     cannot afford to maintain a large standing army. The force \n     that did Desert Storm is long-gone. Nor can the United States \n     afford to maintain large portions of the present force at \n     high readiness. Reserves are far cheaper, especially in a \n     world where mass armies are vanishing, and where those that \n     remain grow ever more obsolete and vulnerable to other forms \n     of American power.\n       Second, the Guard and service reserves provide a de facto \n     ``people's veto'' on major foreign involvements. If a \n     president lacks the popular support to mobilize, he lacks the \n     popular support to go to war--and has better not do it.\n       Third, the Guard is a classic ``dual use'' system, \n     available for foreign and domestic tasks. The Guard's \n     experience in domestic emergencies offers a capability of \n     major military significance. For example, the Guard, not the \n     standing Army, should be given the nuclear/biological/\n     chemical weapons disaster relief mission. The standing Army \n     doesn't need this capability in peacetime, so it should be in \n     the part time forces.\n\n[[Page S5309]]\n\n     Given the likelihood of future terrorist actions on American \n     soil, the Guard, with thousands of sites around the country \n     and local expertise, offers a far superior means of deploying \n     this capability for domestic emergencies.\n       Further--and this is not easy to say--the standing Army, is \n     an institution in profound disarray, trashed by scandal and, \n     in many ways, looking for work that will generate hard cash \n     and renewed respect. Almost inevitably, that points toward \n     more domestic missions, especially counter-terrorism in its \n     various aspects. One need not conjure up lurid thoughts of \n     military coups or images of an alienated, embittered officer \n     corps to understand that this is a bad idea. The less the \n     standing military is involved in domestic affairs, the \n     better. Not because they're evil people, but because their \n     professional methods and loyalties may do more harm than \n     good. The Founders knew it; the Army's domestic intelligence \n     activities during Vietnam proved it. To the extent that \n     military force may have to be used in this country in the \n     decades ahead, it ought to be the Guard, with its complex set \n     of responsibilities to and relationships with country, state, \n     and community.\n       But the political and cultural justifications for the Guard \n     don't address one practical question: Can they be ready to do \n     the job? Obviously, the answer depends on what the job is and \n     what you mean by ready. Still, one thing is clear. There is \n     no inherent reason the Guard cannot perform adequately across \n     the range of its missions. The Marine Corps and the Air Force \n     have demonstrated what can be accomplished when reserves are \n     treated as assets, not rivals. New tools and methods, from \n     tank and cockpit simulators to computerized command post \n     exercises, offer training possibilities unimaginable even 10 \n     years ago. High-priority units can be filled with people \n     willing to accept high levels of contractual obligation, \n     including extended active duty and early call-up. In short, \n     the Guard's proficiency is limited only by resources and \n     creativity--and by a standing Army that, for reasons of its \n     own, prefers not to acknowledge it.\n       Again, that standing Army isn't evil. It's simply fighting \n     for its institutional life and soul. The current off-site, \n     and the next one, and the one after that, will no doubt \n     reflect the desperation of the struggle. But the Army should \n     not be permitted to sacrifice the Guard to protect its own \n     turf bowls. The current military situation, and the wisdom of \n     centuries, should preclude it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5305-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO LORD MICHAEL JOPLING\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I come to the Senate floor today to tell the Senate that \na very special and dear friend to many of us who serve in the Senate, \nthe Right Honorable Michael Jopling, has now been honored in his \ncountry with a life peerage and will join the House of Lords.\n  Those of us who know Michael Jopling have known him as a Member of \nParliament who has served more than three decades in Britain as a \nMember of Parliament. He served as a Minister of Agricultural, \nFisheries, and Food in the British Government for two 4-year periods \nbetween 1979 and 1987. Those of us here in the Senate who know him, \nknow him because of his active participation in the North Atlantic \nAssembly sessions and particularly in the British-American \nInterparliamentary Conference meetings which many of us have \nparticipated in from time to time.\n  He continues to serve, Mr. President, as the Secretary for the \nInterparliamentary Exchange. Senator Byrd and I will lead a Senate \ndelegation in August to meet with our British counterparts, and for the \n10th year in a row it will be Lord Jopling, now, who will meet us. He \nbrings great energy and enthusiasm to the meetings we have held and, \nreally, his participation has been unparalleled.\n  As a matter of fact, I am sad to report to the Senate that with his \nyouthful exuberance he got the better of himself recently when he \nsuffered an accident in a Go-Kart race. He broke some ribs and had some \ndamage to his lungs, but he is on the mend now. I understand that he \nwill have full recovery.\n  I further bring greetings to the Senate from our friend Senator \nHeflin. Senator Heflin has written to me about his real joy to see our \nfriend, Michael Jopling, so honored. I am reminded of a speech that Sir \nWinston Churchill made in the House of Commons on August 20, 1940. He \nsaid:\n\n       The British Empire and the United States will have to be \n     somewhat mixed together in some of their affairs for mutual \n     and general advantage. For my own part, looking out upon the \n     future, I do not view the process with any misgivings.\n\n  It is, in fact, the British-American interparliamentary process that \nhas given great effect to those words, and Lord Jopling has been a \nleader of that effort. He has made a lasting contribution to the great \nrelationship between our two countries. He and his wife Gail have \nalways been gracious hosts, and they really are wonderful goodwill \nambassadors for Britain.\n  I come to offer my congratulations to Lord Jopling. I think others \nwho know him will want to congratulate him, also. We particularly thank \nhim for years of dedication to his country and to the cause of world \npeace and understanding. He is a great personal friend. I am delighted \nto see a friend honored.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. As they say in England, hear, hear. We are delighted to \nhear of the elevation of our friend Michael to Lord Jopling. It shows, \namongst other things in England, that you do not only have to be young, \nyou can be old and still succeed.\n  I wish him well, too, in his recovery, and I appreciate the Senator \nfrom Alaska pointing out this wonderful happening.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from South Carolina for those \nremarks, and I know I reflect the sentiments of my great friend Howell \nHeflin in reporting to the Senate this great news.\n  Mr. DODD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. I do not know Michael Jopling as well as our good friends \nfrom Alaska and South Carolina, but I have met him on numerous \noccasions, having attended a couple of the sessions of the North \nAtlantic Assembly with Judge Heflin, our former colleague.\n  I remember when I left the other body, Mr. President, and came to the \nU.S. Senate, our former colleague and delightful raconteur, Morris \nUdall, pulled me aside and said, ``I want you to know I do not approve \nof your moving to the U.S. Senate. All I can say is by this move you \nhave improved the intelligence of both bodies,'' and one might suggest \nI suppose here with our good friend Michael Jopling, being elevated to \nthe status of Lord, that he is certainly going to improve the \nintelligence of that body.\n  He is a wonderful person, a great individual, and I wish him well.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nhours of debate on the subject of the conference report on H.R. 1469.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use. I \nstate to the Senate that I don't intend to use the whole hour, unless \nit is necessary to respond to some comments that may come up. It is my \nhope that we can finish debate on this bill and then turn to the budget \nresolution.\n  The conference report on the defense and emergency disaster \nsupplemental bill will soon be before us. It is not before us yet. In \nthe interest of time, we hope that we can get this matter resolved so \nthat we may vote upon the bill as soon as it is received from the \nHouse.\n  Mr. President, the conferees completed their work yesterday afternoon \nand the conference report was filed in the House last night. The final \nbill keeps faith with the version that passed the Senate last month. It \nprovides needed relief for the victims of disasters in 35 States. The \nbill also provides $1.8 billion for military operations in Bosnia, \nSouthwest Asia, and foreign deployments. Those amounts replace funds \nalready spent by the administration. Without this funding for the \nDefense Department, we face a severe reduction in training, readiness,\n\n[[Page S5310]]\n\nand quality of life for our troops worldwide.\n  The bill continues to exceed the levels requested by the President \nfor the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], the community \ndevelopment block grants, economic development, agriculture, and for \nthe Corps of Engineers. I might say, however, Mr. President, while this \nbill involves increases of $8 billion, we have offset $8.4 billion. \nThere is no net increase in this bill. We actually have a $400 million \nnet reduction in spending for fiscal year 1997 as a result of this \nbill.\n  Each of our subcommittees have carefully reviewed the amounts \nproposed by these agencies, and working with the Members from the \nimpacted States, we have arrived at these funding levels. The new \nbudget authority is offset by corresponding rescissions, as I have \nindicated. Those exceed the total spending.\n  Again, let me say, all defense spending is offset by reductions \navailable to the Department of Defense in terms of prior \nappropriations. Again, consistent with the Senate version of the bill, \nadditional amounts are provided for needed highway programs. Mr. \nPresident, there was a request from the administration for some highway \nmoney. We added to that. We have reached a compromise now by virtue of \nthe work that was done by Senator Shelby and Senator Lautenberg. That \nresults in an increase for the so-called donor States, compared to the \nbill that passed the Senate. But I believe it keeps faith with the \ncommitment that we have made to provide more funding to the donee \nStates. We did not rewrite the highway formula. We reached an honest \ncompromise with the House, where the House is dominated primarily by \ndonor States and this Senate has more votes from the donee States. Now, \nthis is a legitimate compromise on the money without rewriting the \nhighway formula.\n  The conferees maintained the continuing resolution language; it is \nunchanged. It was the same version in both the House and Senate bills. \nIt was not before the conference, actually. The levels of the \ncontinuing resolution version provide 100 percent of the fiscal year \n1997 enacted rate of appropriations in the event a bill is not passed \nby the end of the fiscal year. This is more generous than most \ncontinuing resolutions that have been passed by the Congress in prior \nyears. Typically, past resolutions provided that the money to be \navailable during the period of a continuing resolution was the lower of \nthe two amounts provided by the House or the Senate. This is not that \ncase. This continuing resolution would be 100 percent of the amount \nthat has been available in 1997.\n  I might say to the Senate that, after considerable debate, the \nconferees modified the language on the 2000 census; that is, we \nmodified the provision adopted by the Senate. The conference agreement \nprohibits the use of sampling and mandates a full enumeration of \nAmericans for the apportionment of the House of Representatives. This \nis nothing more than maintaining current law, Mr. President, the \nconstitutional requirement for a real census. It does not permit a \npolitical polling type of census.\n  I think we should state to the Senate that the Appropriations \nCommittee in the House and the Senate each have recognized that this \ndecision will increase the cost of the census for the year 2000. We are \nprepared to fund that additional cost within the total available under \nthe bipartisan budget agreement, which we will vote on later today. I \nregret that no Member of the minority has chosen to sign the conference \nreport, but I do understand and respect Senator Byrd's decision. I knew \nof his objection from the very beginning to the continuing resolution \nprovision that is in the bill. But I want to assure Senators that, as \nfar as the appropriations aspects of this bill, it is not a partisan \nbill. The agreements reached on the appropriations for disaster relief \nand for the recovery from the disasters were adopted with complete \nconsultation with all Members of each body, regardless of party.\n\n  I hope the President will closely evaluate the total bill before he \nreaches the decision on a veto. We know that there is a threatened \nveto. We hope to work with the President to meet the needs of the \nvictims of these disasters and to maintain our national defense, which \nis our constitutional duty. Vetoing this bill will simply delay further \nthe aid and support that is needed by the citizens of more than 30 \nStates.\n  I do want to state, Mr. President, that this is the first bill that I \nhave been privileged to handle as chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. I offer my thanks to Chairman Bob Livingston for his \ncourtesy and cooperation in working with Members of the Senate on this \nbill. It is a very complex bill, Mr. President. At times, this was a \nvery contentious conference. But the House chairman, who was the \nchairman of the conference, presided over the conference with \nconsiderable grace, diligence, and good humor. I do believe that all \nMembers will agree that anyone who wanted to participate in the debate \nconcerning this conference was able to do so. I do urge the adoption of \nthe bill by the Senate today so the bill can reach the President as \nsoon as possible.\n  It will be a difficult vote, Mr. President, and I expect a very close \nvote on whether the bill goes to the President at all. Thank you.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing staff members of the Appropriations Committee and various \nsubcommittees be granted floor access during the consideration of the \nconference report on H.R. 1469:\n  Christine Ciccone, Becky Davies, Sid Ashworth, Alex Flint, Bruce \nEvans, Wally Burnett, Jon Kamarck, Jay Kimmitt, Michele Randolph, Jack \nConway, Jim Morhard, Mary Beth Nethercutt, Robin Cleveland, Craig \nHiggins, Pat Raymond, Dona Pate, Susan Hogan, and Kevin Johnson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield myself some of the time assigned \nto the minority side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, this bill is critically \nimportant because it responds to the disasters in many States. \nObviously, of greatest concern and interest to this Senator are the \ndisasters that have occurred in North Dakota. Perhaps I could give a \nbrief review for my colleagues and people who might be watching on the \nneed for this disaster legislation. Before I do that, I want to thank \nthose who helped write this legislation. I specifically want to thank \nthe chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens. I \nalso want to thank his staff because they listened to our plea for help \nand they responded. We deeply appreciate that. There were some heated \nmoments as we discussed this legislation, but much of what is here is \nvery good and critically important to our recovery.\n  As I say that, I must also register disappointment for the unrelated \nmatters that have been included in this legislation, which the \nPresident has indicated will compel him to veto the legislation. We \nasked for and pleaded for a clean disaster bill, one that did not \ncontain extraneous matters. But that did not happen.\n  Mr. President, I want to go now to a review of the disasters that \noccurred and led to the necessity for this kind of legislation. North \nDakota has been hit with the most extraordinary set of disasters in our \nState's history. First, we had, as this chart shows, ``Snow Foolin', \nFargo-Moorhead Sets Record.'' Mr. President, that is not an athletic \nrecord, it is a record for snowfall. At the time they wrote this \narticle, we had received almost 95 inches of snow. Before we were done, \nwe reached over 10 feet of snow that fell in North Dakota during the \nwinter season.\n  Next, we were faced with an extraordinary ice and blizzard storm, \nwhich was the most powerful winter storm in the last 50 years in North \nDakota. That occurred in the first week of April. This picture shows \ndowned power lines. It just snapped power lines all across the \nnortheastern part of the State, and 80,000 people were without power. \nMany were without power for over a week. Not only were power lines \naffected by this incredible storm, but, as this picture shows, we had \nthousands of cattle that were killed by this extraordinary blizzard. \nThis shows a mother who is\n\n[[Page S5311]]\n\nlicking one of her calves. This calf, by the way, did not survive. You \ncan see another dead animal, another dead cow. We lost over 150,000 \nhead in this incredible blizzard in early April.\n  This is a circumstance in which some cows froze to death and many \ndied by suffocation because in the blizzard the winds were so powerful \nthat it blew snow up into their nostrils, and it compacted. And then \nthe cows actually suffocated, an especially gruesome death for these \nanimals.\n  It didn't end there, unfortunately, because not only did we have \nrecord snowfall followed by the most powerful winter storm in 50 years \nbut then we had on top of it a 500-year flood; a flood that in Grand \nForks was 26 feet above flood stage. And the dikes could not hold. As \nthis headline says, ``Broken Dikes, Shattered Hopes,'' and a picture of \njust one part of Grand Forks.\n  Grand Forks is a city of 50,000 people. Ninety-five percent of the \npeople were evacuated. Eighty percent of the homes were badly damaged. \nTens of thousands of structures were just devastated. In fact, if you \ngo to Grand Forks now--this is 6 weeks after the flood devastation--on \nevery corner, on every boulevard are stacked the personal belongings \nand the personal effects of the people of the city of Grand Forks. It \nis like a giant junkyard because everything has been destroyed. This \nwater was contaminated. All of these things are ruined. The carpets, \nthe drapes, all of the furniture, all of their clothing and personal \neffects destroyed; all of it. It is amazing to go through town. You can \nsee what everybody's refrigerator looked like; everybody's washer and \ndryer--because they are out on the curb. They are out on the boulevard \nwaiting to be picked up because they are all destroyed. It is really an \nincredible experience.\n  This picture shows the extraordinary extent of the flooding that \noccurred once those dikes broke. I went on a helicopter and flew north \nof Grand Forks. This shows from horizon to horizon water. In fact, the \nwater was 40 miles wide. Remember. This river is normally 75 to 100 \nyards wide. But after the dikes burst, the water spread and was 40 \nmiles wide.\n  You will remember--I think the President has North Dakota roots--you \nmay recall, Mr. President, that we used to have a lake thousands of \nyears ago, Lake Agassiz, that covered much of eastern North Dakota. A \nlot of us said it looks like Lake Agassiz is reforming because to be up \nin a helicopter and as far as the eye can see was water; really a \nstunning sight.\n  The disaster didn't end there because in the middle of the 500 year \nflood we had an incredible fire break out. The headline in the paper \nwas, ``Red Overruns Heart of Forks.'' Of course, they are referring to \nGrand Forks. The picture shows amidst the flooded streets this fire \nthat broke out. This fire devastated much of three blocks of downtown \nGrand Forks. Many buildings were destroyed. This picture shows the \nheadline, which says it well, ``A City Scarred.''\n  This shows the National Guard with the firemen fighting that \nincredible inferno. I mean it was an inferno. This fire was so intense \nand so powerful that giant support beams for office buildings actually \nwent up and were forced by the convection, by the power of these air \ncurrents, they blew up into the air and went across the street to the \nnext block. That is how this fire spread, block to block, and destroyed \nmuch of three city blocks.\n  You can see. This is one of the major commercial buildings in the \ncity of Grand Forks. It looks like it went through the raids of \nDresden. It is just a shell. It was block after block that looked just \nlike this. Over 150 business structures were destroyed in the combined \nflood and fire; 156 business structures in Grand Forks alone, housing \nabout two businesses per structure on average. So about 300 businesses \nhad their property wiped out.\n  This headline came in the Grand Forks Herald, which says it all: \n``Come Hell and High Water''. It shows the little street sign with the \nwater right up to the top; 6 feet of water standing right in the middle \nof town. Here is again the burned-out shell of a three-block area where \nthe people have been absolutely devastated.\n  Mr. President, we have another headline that comes from the Grand \nForks Herald: ``4 Days Since Congress Let Us Down.''\n  This was after Congress failed to act after the Memorial Day recess, \nand they gave 11 reasons to pass the disaster bill now.\n  We have heard a lot of talk that, ``There is money in the pipeline. \nDon't worry about anything. Nothing is being held up because there is \nmoney in the pipeline.'' We just had the mayors of the affected \ncommunities in town yesterday. The business leaders of Grand Forks were \nhere. One of them said, ``You know. I hear all of this talk about money \nin the pipeline. All I can say is there must be cement in the pipeline \nbecause the money is not getting through.''\n  The fact is there is no money in the Housing Department's pipeline \nfor the buyout and relocation of the thousands of homes that have been \ndestroyed. There is no money in that pipeline. We met yesterday with \nSecretary Cuomo. We asked him. ``Do you have any money anywhere that \ncould be diverted to go to work immediately so these homes can be \nbought out and relocated so we can start to rebuild this community?''\n  His answer was, ``No, I don't.''\n  We met yesterday with Secretary Daley, the Secretary of Commerce. We \nasked him. ``Do you have EDA funds that are in the pipeline that could \nbe used to help rebuild the business community that has been \ndevastated?''\n  He said, ``No, I do not.''\n  There is no money in the pipeline to reimburse the school districts \nwho took the kids from the disaster areas. Those school districts \nstepped forward and said, ``Yes. We will take your children. We will \nput them in our schools. We will transport them. We will feed them. We \nwill give them books. We will provide teaching''--because the schools \nin Grand Forks are devastated.\n  There is no money in the pipeline to reimburse the school districts \nthat stepped forward. There is no money in the pipeline for the \nDepartment of Agriculture to help the ranchers who lost hundreds of \nthousands of heads of cattle in this remarkable winter that we have \njust been through.\n  So when people say there is money in the pipeline, that no project is \nbeing delayed, that is just not accurate. That is just not accurate. We \nhad the direct testimony of the mayors of the affected cities, of the \nbusiness leaders of these cities, and they are saying to us: ``We are \nstopped cold until and unless this disaster bill passes.''\n  So, Mr. President, I am here today with two messages. No. 1, a \nmessage of thanks to those who have supported a disaster package that \nis meaningful and critically important for recovery. But I am also here \ntoday to say that I am also disappointed that we don't have before us a \nclean disaster bill--one that does not have unrelated provisions so \nthat the President can sign this legislation and we can move forward \nwith the recovery and rebuilding. That is unfortunate, and one that I \nhope is not repeated any time in the future.\n  I have been in the U.S. Senate for 10 years. And when others had \ndisasters, we never offered amendments that were controversial, that \nwould hold up the legislation, or that would cause a Presidential veto. \nWe never did that. We never even thought of doing such a thing. I wish \nothers would have extended the same courtesy to us that we have \nextended to them.\n  Some said, ``Well, you offered amendments.'' Yes. That is true. I \nhave offered amendments to disaster legislation before--\nnoncontroversial amendments that were supported on both sides of the \naisle, that were supported by the administration, that didn't hold up \nanything. I certainly have done that. But I would never have even \nthought of offering an amendment that would compel a Presidential veto. \nI mean I really do not understand why that would be done.\n  I do not want to lose sight of the important provisions that are in \nthis legislation--provisions that will help rebuild the homes and \nbusinesses that have been destroyed; provisions that will help farmers \nand ranchers in many cases who have lost their foundation herds; \nprovisions that will help them recover; provisions that will allow the \nCorps of Engineers to rebuild and repair and reconstruct levies and \ndikes so that we don't go through this again next year.\n  Believe me. We are acutely aware that in North Dakota we could face \nanother disaster next year if we do not\n\n[[Page S5312]]\n\nact and act quickly. Again, remember, we have a very short construction \nseason. We need to go to work now to get these projects completed. The \nmoney that is here for the Federal Highway Administration to rebuild \nroads, highways and bridges--many of the bridges up and down the Red \nRiver have been destroyed by this series of disasters--the funds for \nthe school districts that have been impacted, and the funding for \nDevil's Lake because we have another disaster that is occurring in \nNorth Dakota: Devil's Lake. This lake is raising inexorably. It has \ntripled in volume and doubled in size in the last 3 years. It is like a \ncancer eating more and more of the countryside, eating up homes, eating \nbuildings, eating up roads and bridges. And we are grateful to the \ncommittee for having included $5 million for the work that needs to be \ndone this year on an outlet from that Devil's Lake; and, for the money \nto rebuild the rural sewer system; the money to provide floodplain \neasements for those whose land is flooded and who have now been denied \nany ability to earn an income necessary for their families.\n  Mr. President, I want to end on this note, as I started, by saying:\n  No. 1, we are deeply grateful for the response of so many in this \nChamber who came to help out.\n  The occupant of the Chair wrote me a very gracious note reminding me \nof his North Dakota roots and offering to help out with this disaster. \nWe appreciate that.\n  We appreciate again especially the assistance of the chairman of the \nSenate Appropriations Committee. We appreciate the help of his staff. \nWe appreciate the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee and \nhis staff for the great assistance they have provided in getting this \nlegislation in shape.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we also have a disappointment. The \ndisappointment is that we have these unrelated measures that are in \nthis legislation. Hopefully, this will all be resolved as quickly as \npossible so that the relief can start to flow to those communities that \nhave been so badly hurt.\n\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I shall be very brief. I had a chance \nto speak at some length about the need for disaster relief, and the \nneed for emergency assistance for Minnesotans and the Dakotas. I want \nin less than 3 minutes to just say two things on the floor today.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues. This started out in the hope \nthat eventually it will end up as a bipartisan effort, and a lot of \ncooperation to get help to people, our neighbors. This is help that \ndoesn't make everybody whole again, but at lease it gives people a \nchance to rebuild their lives. I hope that next week that is where this \nends up. It started out on a very positive note, and I hope it will end \nup there.\n  My second point is my colleague from North Dakota said he was \ndisappointed. I am actually outraged. I think it is transparent. I \nthink what is going on here is silly.\n  There are some extraneous amendments on what should be a straight \ndisaster relief bill--the way we collect census data; having to do with \na continuing resolution; having to do with a budget resolution; and, if \nthere is any kind of crisis a Government shutdown next fall; having to \ndo with parks; you name it. This shouldn't be on this bill.\n  I think what people know here--for some reason they think people in \nthe country don't know it--that it is going to go to the President, the \nPresident is going to veto it, and it is going to be sent back. If it \nis an effort to embarrass the President, what is accomplished? Because \nwhen it gets sent back here, it is my fervent hope--and I believe this \nwill happen--that these extraneous provisions will be taken off the \nbill. Then it will go back to the President, and then it will be \nsigned.\n  What has been accomplished? Is the point to embarrass the President? \nIs it just a game?\n  I think we are going to be faced next week with one of two scenarios: \nEither it goes to the President, the President vetoes it--and everybody \nhere knows it. But so do people back in our home States. They have \nintelligence. The President will veto it. Then it will come back here. \nAnd one of two things will happen: Either the bill will be stripped of \nthese provisions that have nothing to do with the compelling need to \nget help to people, in which case, great. Thank you. Fine. But what was \nthe point?\n  Or that will not happen. And if that does not happen, then I will use \nevery measure I know how to use as a Senator to stop this process here. \nI will do everything I can next week if we do not get a clean bill. \nEverything I can do to fight for the people in Minnesota I will do. So \nmy hope is that this ends up on the positive note that it started out \non because this is really not about a kind of strategy or tactics. It \nis just about getting help to people, and it is time. It is time to do \nthe right thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I believe the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia [Mrs. Boxer], has been waiting.\n  How much time does she wish?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes from the time under my \ncontrol to the distinguished Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his leadership on all of this, and the chairman of the committee. \nThis is his first time as chairman bringing a bill to the floor. I know \nthat both sides have worked very, very hard.\n  Mr. President, this is a good news-bad news day for the people in \nNorth Dakota and for the people in the 21 other States who are waiting \nto see this Congress finally pass an emergency bill and send it to the \nPresident. It is a good news day because the bill is before us.\n  As has been said many times, and I repeat it again, for both sides, \nfrom the chairman, Senator Stevens, to the ranking member, Senator \nByrd, to their staffs, to all of the members of the Appropriations \nCommittee, of which I am a new member, I cannot tell you how grateful \nwe from California are for the patience and understanding and the work \nthat went into this bill, for the things we have in this bill to help \nour people. We have had devastating floods, and we have many things to \ndo to pick up the pieces for the people who were hit hard, for the \npeople who have to replant orchards, for the people who depend on \nYosemite National Park and the tourism that it brings to give them \nlivelihood and sustenance.\n  Those funds are in this bill, and they do not come from FEMA, I say \nto my colleagues. And, as my friend, Senator Conrad from North Dakota, \nsaid, they are not in the pipeline. These funds must come through the \npipeline, and until this bill passes they will not be there because \nthey are from agriculture, they are from the highway fund, they are \nfrom the Army Corps of Engineers, and they are from housing.\n  So the funds that are in the pipeline--and I think it is important we \nall understand this--are the FEMA funds. By the way, if we have another \ntragedy in our country--we never know when disaster strikes--even that \ncould be jeopardized. I watched with horror the tornado that hit Texas, \nand I thought to myself here we are on a break and another natural \ndisaster hits. I hope FEMA does have the wherewithal to meet that \ndisaster.\n  So, my friends, we are playing with fire. We are playing with \nflooding. We are playing with earthquakes. We are playing with disaster \nhere. We need to be sure that the funds in this bill which have been \nput together in such a careful way get to the people who need them the \nmost.\n  I am glad my colleague from North Dakota showed the photographs again \nof the devastation because sometimes we have a short attention span and \nwe forget, but when we see those buildings as they looked when they \nwere in flames in the middle of a flood, it really did remind you of \nWorld War II pictures, of the worst kind of attack, and this was an \nattack from nature.\n  We need to do what we can to make these people whole, to work with \ntheir\n\n[[Page S5313]]\n\nprivate insurers, to work with communities, to work with local and \nState governments to do what we can do. It is a very basic question: \nWhat are we here for? Are we here to play political games? Are we here \nto win a political skirmish? Or are we here to help the people who so \nneed that help? I hope that, after we get through today, because \nclearly we have these riders attached to this bill that have nothing to \ndo whatsoever with the emergency, I hope when this bill comes back from \nthe President, who has been forthright about the fact he will veto a \nbill with these riders, we will strip these controversial riders from \nthe bill and move on.\n  Mr. President, my people in California are waiting. They do not \nunderstand it. I went home, and they said, ``Well, why, Senator, is \nthis all taking so long?'' I explained that there were three \ncontroversial riders placed on this bill that have nothing to do with \nthe emergency. And one of them, the most controversial, undermines the \nbudget agreement that we were all so proud to say we support. It is \nalmost as if the majority is protecting the Senate from the majority.\n  Why do I say that? Because there is no reason why we have to put this \nGovernment on automatic pilot. There is no reason why we cannot do our \nwork and pass our appropriations bills. We do not need an automatic \npilot budget process in place. If we had that in place, why do we need \nthe Senate? We would not need it; we would just put everything on \nautomatic pilot. The only people who can cause a shutdown are the \npeople right here in this Senate. If we agree we are never going to \nshut down the Government, let us agree to do our work and pass our \nbills and compromise and move forward.\n  I do not blame the President for being outraged on this. Here he \nholds a press conference; everyone is hugging everyone, Democrats and \nRepublicans; they passed the budget. Everyone gave a little and \neveryone got a little. Now we have this automatic CR placed on an \nemergency bill, which, if it passes, will totally undermine that \nagreement there. There are harsh cuts in education and the environment. \nThis does not belong on this bill.\n  Here is the point. These riders should stand on their own two feet. \nThey should come here as separate bills. We should debate them and vote \nthem out. They should not be attached to legislation to help people who \nhave been thrown off their feet by disasters. This is wrong. We do not \nhave to do this.\n\n  So, yes, it is a good news-bad news day for people in 22 States--good \nnews because we are moving the supplemental, bad news because it has \nthese extraneous matters attached that undermine the budget agreement \nand do other things and do not belong on this bill. The bill will be \nvetoed, and we will be back to square one. And people in the country \nwill scratch their heads and wonder what on Earth are we doing. That is \nnot a proud moment for this Senate.\n  Mr. President, on an unrelated matter, I want to mention that \nsomething historic happened in California yesterday that does deal with \nanother type of emergency, and that is the passage of junk gun laws.\n  Let me tell my colleagues what happened in California yesterday.\n  The California State Assembly and the California State Senate passed \nlegislation to prohibit the manufacture and sale of junk guns in \nCalifornia, Saturday night specials. Those guns that have not one \nquality of safety standard are now banned from manufacture in the State \nof California, assuming the Governor signs this bill.\n  Mr. President, we talk about emergencies; 40,000 people a year are \nkilled by gunshots in this great Nation, almost 300,000 a year are \nwounded, and the criminal gun of choice is the Saturday night special, \nthe junk gun, the only product in America today that has not one \nquality of safety standard. In 1968, those guns were outlawed from \nimportation after Robert Kennedy was assassinated. I have to say there \nwas a big loophole that allowed American companies to make these guns. \nI am proud that the State assembly and the senate passed this bill. It \nis modeled after my bill that I introduced last year and again this \nyear.\n  I hope that as we deal with emergencies and we look at the emergency \nof gun violence, we will recognize we have guns on the market today \nthat are banned from importation because they are so poorly made, and \nat the minimum people deserve to have safety standards and quality \nstandards on guns that they purchase.\n  So, Mr. President, it is a great day for Californians. Even with the \nworst, heaviest type of heavyhanded lobbying, these bills passed, and I \nam very excited about it. I hope that we will have the courage to do \nthe same in the Senate. I will give the Senate a chance to cast that \ncourageous vote.\n  I close, Mr. President, by again thanking my colleagues from Alaska \nand West Virginia for their assistance to the good people of California \nand the 21 other States, particularly the heart-rending photos we saw \ntoday that just reminded us of what happened in North Dakota. I thank \nthem for working in a bipartisan fashion to get a bill to us that is an \nexcellent bill, and I pray and I hope that we can get these extraneous \nriders stripped off of this bill so that the people in North Dakota and \nthe people in the 21 other States can say this Senate did something to \nreally help the people of America.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 28 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time did the Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], \nuse?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. She used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. All right. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will yield myself such time as I may consume from \nthe time under my control.\n  Mr. President, I regret that I am unable to support the conference \nagreement on the emergency disaster assistance appropriations bill, \nH.R. 1469, now before the Senate. I am unable to do so despite my total \nsupport for the more than $5 billion in disaster assistance payments \nwhich are included in this measure for the hundreds of thousands of \npeople across the country who are the victims of the many natural \ndisasters that have occurred in recent months.\n  I also support the nearly $2 billion contained in the measure for aid \nto our men and women in uniform around the world, particularly in \nBosnia, engaged in peacekeeping operations, as well as the nearly $1 \nbillion contained in the measure for payment of veterans' compensation \nand pensions.\n  These funds are all vitally needed for the purposes for which they \nare appropriated and should be made available at the earliest possible \ntime. Indeed, it is my view Congress should not have recessed for the \nrecent Memorial Day break without having enacted into law these funds \nthat are contained in this bill.\n  Unfortunately, as did the bill when reported out of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee and after Senate action, this conference \nagreement contains a number of controversial, extraneous legislative \nprovisions which have no business being included in an emergency \ndisaster assistance bill. The President has never wavered in his \nstatement that he will veto the measure despite the critical nature of \nfunding it contains for hundreds of thousands of people. He has urged \nCongress to remove the extraneous provisions and send him a clean \ndisaster assistance bill which he can sign. Regrettably, the leadership \nin Congress has chosen to use this bill as a vehicle for making \npolitical points on such things as keeping the Government operating on \nautomatic pilot for the entirety of fiscal year 1998 at 1997 levels \nregardless of merit and ignoring the fact that a number of activities \nthroughout the Federal Government should not continue and should be cut \nor eliminated altogether.\n  This so-called automatic CR and other extraneous provisions need not \nbe on this bill. They can be raised at any time and debated in their \nown right as freestanding measures. They can be raised by the \nleadership at any time. What other reason can there be then to insist \non including them in this disaster assistance measure than to make \npurely political points?\n  I am disturbed by this decision to proceed in this fashion. I note \nthat no Democratic Member of the conference on H.R. 1469, no Democratic \nMember signed the conference report. In not signing a conference \nreport, I find no\n\n[[Page S5314]]\n\nfault with and intend no disrespect toward the chairmen of the \nconference. I congratulate Chairman Livingston on conducting a very \nfair and evenhanded conference. I congratulate our own chairman of the \nconference, chairman of the Senate conferees, Senator Stevens, who \nalso, likewise, is very aware of and always considerate of the needs of \nthe constituencies of the Members of this body. I have always found \nhim, over the long years of friendship that I have enjoyed with him, to \nbe most considerate, charitable and fair. In the conduct of this \nconference, these two chairmen were courteous to all members and showed \ngreat patience and eminent skill in completing the conference as \nexpeditiously as possible. Unfortunately, they had no ability to remove \nthese controversial matters that have caused me to oppose the measure \nand have caused me not to sign the conference report, and I speak for \nothers on my side of the aisle who, likewise, did not sign this \nconference report. Only the leadership of the two Houses could have \naccomplished that result.\n\n  To those Senators who have chosen to delay the enactment of the \nmeasure in order to make political points which they hope to gain from \nforcing the President to veto it, I say consider this: Next time it may \nbe your State, it may be your people, it may be your constituents.\n  For the reasons I have stated, I will not vote for the adoption of \nthe conference report.\n  We must not continue to play cynical games with people who need help \nwhen a disaster has taken lives, taken homes, taken farms, taken \nlivestock, taken livelihoods. I hope that this will be the last time \nsuch tactics are employed on an emergency disaster bill.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. Does the Senator \nfrom North Dakota wish to have some time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to yield for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota, [Mr. Dorgan].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I spoke earlier today on the floor for \nabout 30 minutes on this subject. I shall not extend much beyond that. \nBut I did want to add my voice to the voice of Senator Byrd and \nexpress, as I indicated previously, two things. First, my gratitude for \nthe resources that are in this bill that would be available and helpful \nto the victims of the flood in my State; and, second and also \nimportant, my concern about the unnecessary delay.\n  I was looking for a copy of the conference report. It is not yet \navailable here in the Senate. The conference report is a conference \nreport to provide emergency appropriations. The emergency \nappropriations are necessary to respond to natural disasters. But, of \ncourse, there are issues in this conference report that determine that \nit will not become law. The conference report, if it were on my desk, I \nwould hold it up and say, ``This is not going to be law, and everyone \nin this Chamber knows it.''\n  It is part of the process that is so frustrating from time to time in \nthis Chamber. It is a process that goes on from time to time on a lot \nof legislation--and the Democrats do it, the Republicans do it: Put \nextraneous or unrelated amendments on a bill. That is not unusual. The \nrules of the Senate allow that. What is unusual is that a bill \nproviding for disaster relief to thousands and thousands of people is \nnow being used for that purpose. That's unusual. That's unprecedented. \nThat didn't happen previously. A disaster bill, generally speaking, was \na piece of legislation that most understood should not be used for the \ntraditional kinds of political games that are played here in the U.S. \nCongress. That is what is different this time.\n\n  This aid will come. The resources in this bill will be available. \nRecovery will take place, but after, now, 2 weeks' delay. Two weeks ago \ntoday, the Congress left for the Memorial Day recess without having \nenacted a conference report. Now, today, the conference report is \nbefore us and it will be undoubtedly approved. It will not be signed \ninto law, and everyone in this Chamber knows it.\n  Some say, and they make the case with great forcefulness, ``It \ndoesn't matter. Nothing that needs to be done is not now being done. \nThere is money in the pipeline.'' I have heard it a hundred times this \nweek from people who don't have the foggiest idea about what the facts \nare.\n  Will Rogers once said, ``It's not what he knows that bothers me so \nmuch, it's what he says he knows for sure that just ain't so.'' There \nis some money in the FEMA pipeline to deal with emergency immediate \nrelief--food today, housing tonight in a motel. But there is no money \nin the pipeline from HUD to rehabilitate the housing, to begin the \nconstruction that is necessary--in a State, by the way, that has a very \nshort construction season. Losing 3 weeks in North Dakota, in a \nconstruction season where we have to replace probably 1,000 to 1,500 \nhomes, is devastating. It is a delay that is devastating to the region.\n  That is the point that drives us and compels us to say, thanks for \nthis aid. It will get there. We appreciate very much the cooperation of \neveryone. But we remain enormously disturbed by the fact that this \nconference report is not going to be law and everybody in this Chamber \nknows it, and the result will be another week of delay. There will be 1 \nmore week with thousands of people who wake up in the morning not in \ntheir own beds, somewhere else--a shelter, a neighboring town, a hotel, \na home of a stranger who took them in. There are thousands of them, \nthousands of them today without a home, waiting for the fundamental \ndecisions that will be unlocked by this bill. And the strategy today, \nby some, is to include in this bill something that will certainly gain \na veto, because it has no relationship to this bill and the President \nhas said it is something he cannot support. The result will be 1 more \nweek, 7 more nights, 14 more nights, for people who don't have a home. \nThat's the dilemma.\n  Mr. President, I have consumed my time. I thank the Chair and the \nranking member of the committee. I hope, when all of this process is \ncomplete and the dust settles, that the quantity of resources involved \nin this bill finally, even if belatedly, will be there to provide some \nhope and help to those families who now feel hopeless and helpless. \nThere is help on the way.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes and 40 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nsenior Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Mr. President, I very much agree with the Senator from North Dakota, \nthe Senator from West Virginia, my colleague from California, and all \nwho have really very sincerely expressed their dismay on the way this \nbill has been handled. I would like to just take a few minutes and \nremind my colleagues that this started with a flood in California in \nJanuary, and it is now June. According to the California Office of \nEmergency Services, California sustained $1.8 billion in damages during \nlast winter's flooding. In California alone, 9 people died and 100,000 \npeople lost their homes. They were forced to flee from their homes. \nThis was the third 100-year flood in the last 10 years. It gives you \nthe idea of the impact on part of the State.\n  Mr. President, 48 out of 58 counties in California were declared \nFederal disaster areas. Damage to levees, to roads, and other \ninfrastructure was severe. There were over 60 levee breaks in the delta \narea of California. Many of those breaks have yet to be repaired. These \nlevees do two things. Because the land behind the levee is below sea \nlevel, the levees protect homes and agricultural land from the rivers. \nNow, when the levees break, the land behind the levee is peat, and the \npeat comes out into the water. That water is the drinking water for \ntwo-thirds of the people of the State; that is 20 million people. And \nwhen you treat the water for drinking and it has been infested by peat \nsoil, the chlorine throws off carcinogens. So the longer you leave \nthese levees unattended and the longer you have the intrusion of the \npeat-infested\n\n[[Page S5315]]\n\nwater into the drinking water, you increase problems in California.\n  So far, out of this more than $1.8 billion, California has only \nreceived $27 million for FEMA, for flood fighting, for debris removal, \nand for infrastructure repair. Fully repairing the damage to public \nfacilities will take months, if not years.\n  I spent 3 days in these areas. I have flown over most of the levee \nbreaks. I saw the extent of the damage. In places where I flew in a \nhelicopter, let's say maybe 300, 400 feet above the ground, you could \nnot see anything that was not flood-affected on either side. As far as \nyour vision could go, flat land, from 300 to 500 feet above the ground, \nit was all water. You only saw rooftops.\n  I talked with people who lost as many as 14,000 trees in their \norchard, who were wiped out of their dairy farms, wiped out of their \nhomes. I went into the homes of people who were not farmers. I saw \nwater halfway up the ceiling, everything ruined. Wiring, everything was \nruined in the house. If only everyone could see this, I don't think \nthey would want to play these games with this vital piece of \nlegislation.\n  Let me remind my colleagues of the emergency relief provision and \nexactly what is in the bill: $5.6 million, 22 States. According to OMB, \nthe bill allocates $3.3 billion out of new money and existing FEMA \nfunds for disaster aid to California. Additionally, the bill provides \nanother $780 million for disaster-related work in California. This is \n$200 million for Federal highway work, $176 million for repairs at \nYosemite, $300 million for the Army Corps of Engineers, and $47 million \nfor the Department of Agriculture.\n  I want, just for a moment, to try to debunk the implication that no \nfamily has been denied assistance due to delays in the bill. This might \nbe true for agencies like FEMA, which has the disaster trust fund to \ndraw from. But other Federal agencies responding to the disasters are \ndepending on this funding.\n  HUD currently has no CDBG funds to dedicate to disaster recovery \nefforts, and both the House and Senate bills contained a half a billion \ndollars for CDBG disaster recovery efforts. So without this bill, there \nis no money for these efforts.\n  Other Federal programs are also waiting for this funding: the \nDepartment of Agriculture's Emergency Conservation Program, which \nassists farmers in rehabilitating flooded farmland and clearing debris \nfrom the fields. Without this bill, farmers in the upper Midwest have \nto delay planting and will see their costs driven up.\n  The Watershed and Flood Prevention Program, the Tree Assistance \nProgram--now, this is important. I mentioned losing 14,000 trees. Crops \nthat are permanent, like vines and trees, are eligible for grants \nthrough the Tree Assistance Program for replanting. There are no moneys \nfor that without this bill. So it is necessary, if you are going to get \nthe tree in the ground, to get it done as fast as possible.\n  Let me talk about one of our Nation's jewels--Yosemite National Park. \nDelaying this bill closes off parts of this park for millions of \nvisitors, no question. The Park Service is proceeding with the most \npressing needs, but funds in this bill are now going to arrive too late \nto affect this summer. That means that contracts to begin the permanent \nroad widening and the permanent utility repairs need to be let as soon \nas possible to minimize the impact on the park. If it can't be done \nsoon, we are into winter again and then it is not going to be for \nanother year.\n  The President has made no secret about the fact that he will veto \nthis bill when it hits his desk. We all know the problems with the \nautomatic CR. I, for one, believe that this killer provision is really \nnot necessary. We have shown that when we want to work together in a \nbipartisan way and make the necessary compromises that we can do it. \nAll we have to do is pass appropriations bills on time. Two weeks ago \nwe voted for a balanced budget. I think it is somewhat disingenuous to \ninclude the automatic CR in this legislation.\n  Let me spend a few moments on another killer issue, because I have \nspoken to a few Members on the other side about it, and that is the \ncensus sampling. I had hoped the conferees would have been able to \naccept the Senate compromise. The conference report prohibits the use \nof statistical sampling. This impacts every high-growth State in the \nUnited States. I know there is politics in it, let's face it, because \nlower-income people, minorities, are the most affected if you don't \nsample. So, if you don't sample, you cut down your numbers in that \ncategory. That might be one thing in elections, but let me tell you it \nis also another thing in funding formula. So by not accepting the \nsampling, the high-growth States are essentially deprived of vital \nformula.\n  Without sampling, the 2,000 census undercount would reach more than \n18 million households, it would miss about 1 million people in \nCalifornia; it would miss 5 to 6 million in other States.\n  Let me give you one example. California's share of Federal vocational \nrehabilitation funds total about 8 to 9 percent of the Federal funds in \nthe program. These funds would be 11 percent going to California if \nbased on an accurate census. If we don't do the sampling, the cost to \nthe State is $70 to $100 million in just this one program alone. You \ncan multiply that all across the board in title I moneys for schools, \nfor poor children, and so every State that has a growth in these \nnumbers, if you don't use the sampling, for political reasons you are \nsacrificing formula dollars for your State. I might tell you, I find \nthat very hard to do.\n  I intend to vote for this bill because the bulk of this bill is money \nfor California. I recognize that the President will veto it. I will \nalso vote to sustain his veto when this comes back. I am hopeful that \nthe rumors I hear about the House are correct, that there will be \nanother bill and it will be a basic disaster relief emergency \nsupplemental so we can get on with other things.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the Senator from Arizona such time as he may \nrequire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank you, and I thank the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. As always, \nthey have done a very dedicated and very important job here.\n  As I always do on these bills, Mr. President, I am compelled to talk \nabout some of the parts of this bill which were added which I find very \nobjectionable and which I find unacceptable. I, again, lament that \nthese really nonessential and sometimes wasteful appropriations are \nadded to a bill that is labeled an ``emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill.''\n  Mr. President, in this bill, some that I have found--I am sure there \nare others--are that it makes an additional $35 million available for \nnew grants under the Commerce Department Advanced Technology Program. I \nam the chairman of the Commerce Committee. The Advanced Technology \nProgram falls under the responsibility of the Commerce Committee. We \nhave been investigating that program. We have had a lot of effort put \nin to making sure the best methods are used for selecting the \nrecipients of these grants. And now in an emergency bill, we see $35 \nmillion for new grants under the Advanced Technology Program.\n  It earmarks $5 million for the study of water allocation issues in \nAlabama, Florida and Georgia; $10 million for transportation planning \nand other purposes at Yosemite National Park; $15 million for research \non environmental factors affecting breast cancer; $650,000 for the \nNational Commission on the Cost of Higher Education. Someone has to \nhelp me out here. Where is the emergency? Where is the emergency that \nrequires $650,000 for the National Commission on the Cost of Higher \nEducation?\n  It earmarks $5 million for the development of a legislative \ninformation system in the Office of the Secretary of the Senate;\n  And $16 million to continue development of an automated targeting \nsystem for the Customs Service; a set-aside, Mr. President--a set-\naside--of $12.3 million for discretionary authority to construct a \nparking garage at a VA medical center in Cleveland, OH. Do you want me \nto tell you that again? Mr. President, $12.3 million for the \nconstruction of a parking garage at a VA\n\n[[Page S5316]]\n\nmedical center in Cleveland, OH. I know this bill covers a lot of \ndisaster areas. I don't believe Cleveland, OH, was an area that was \nafflicted, and certainly I do not suspect that a garage for a VA \nmedical center would be an emergency.\n  There is an earmark of $500,000 from previously appropriated funds \nfor a parking garage--another parking garage--in Ashland, KY, to \ninstead restore the Paramount Theater in that city; authorization to \nmake grants under the Center for Ecology Research and Training for Bay \nCity, MI.\n  There are others, Mr. President. This is really not fair to the \nAmerican people, it is not fair to the taxpayers, and I wish we would \nstop these things. I, frankly, grow weary.\n  I want to talk about an important part of this bill, and that is the \nprovision which has been put in the bill which prevents the President \nfrom shutting down the Government. That is what it is all about. It \nprevents the President from shutting down the Government.\n  As we know, in the last 2 years, one time he shut down the Government \nand another time the Congress was forced to add some $8 to $9 billion \nin additional spending which they otherwise wouldn't because of a \nthreat to shut down the Government. Why would I care and why should we \ncare, when we are talking about disasters, about the shutdown of the \nGovernment? Because the shutdown of the Government was a manmade \ndisaster, Mr. President.\n  The shutdown of Government was a manmade disaster that afflicted the \nlives of millions of Americans and if it happens again because of our \nfailure to do our work, we will, again, inflict pain and punishment on \nthe American people.\n\n  I was interested in and I appreciate the comments just made by the \nSenator from California about Yosemite National Park. There is a report \non the ``Economic Importance of National Parks: The Effects of the \n1995-96 Government Shutdown on Selected Park-Dependent Businesses and \nCommunities.'' This is a report of the National Parks and Conservation \nAssociations.\n  On page 8 it says:\n\n       Impacts were substantial in and around California's \n     national parks, in spite of the fact that they were not in \n     their peak seasons when the shutdowns occurred.\n\n  The report goes on to say:\n\n       At Yosemite National Park, an off season hardly exists. \n     Impacts in and around the park, which normally receives more \n     than 120,000 visitors in December, were the worst encountered \n     in our investigation.\n\n  And then it goes on to quote Gilbert Ghyselinck, owner of Yosemite \nGateway Inn, estimated loss, $45,000; Jim Houtz, owner of the Cedar \nLodge Inn and Parkline Restaurants in El Portal, CA, south of Yosemite, \nestimated loss, $40,000 to $50,000. ``We put about 50 people on \nunemployment. It was pretty rough. The part that hurt us the worst was \nputting those people on unemployment when they were trying to put away \nfor the winter.''\n  Mr. President, I want to point out they were not Federal workers. \nThey were people who were never repaid, never repaid for our shutdown \nof the Government.\n  A gentleman in Oakhurst, CA:\n\n       That Christmas and New Year's shutdown was the toughest on \n     us. We're close to full that time of year--90 percent \n     occupancy. I think we barely made 50 percent. It was only 10 \n     days, but it was the 10 days you want. It's also had some \n     lingering effect.\n\n  Cheryl Tyler, of Oasis of Eden Inn, Yucca Valley, CA, estimated loss, \n$30,000. Cheryl Tyler said:\n\n       It really killed us. They were canceling as fast they could \n     get on the phone. People booked for 5 days. They stayed one \n     night and left. We lost half our business.\n\n  It goes on and on. Mr. President, this is what happens when you shut \ndown the Government. I am totally and completely in sympathy with my \ncolleagues who are seeking disaster relief. We, on this side of the \naisle, are also seeking disaster relief. We are seeking relief from a \ndisaster to ensure that it will never happen again.\n  I would like to quote from a study that was made by the Congressional \nResearch Service, a CRS report for Congress entitled ``Shutdown of the \nFederal Government: Effects on the Federal Workforce,'' James McGrath, \nanalyst, National Government Division, updated June 17, 1996, conducted \nby the Congressional Research Service. Let me just tell you some things \nthey talk about.\n  Examples of Federal services adversely affected by the shutdowns \ninclude those related to health, welfare, law enforcement, public \nsafety, financial services, parks, museums, monuments, visas, \npassports, services to American Indians and services to veterans, among \nmany others as listed below.\n  Health: New patients not accepted into clinical research. Toxic waste \ncleanup at 609 sites stopped; 2,400 Superfund workers sent home.\n  Welfare: 10,000 new Medicare applications, 212,000 Social Security \ncard requests, 360,000 individual office visits, 13 million recipients \nof aid to families with dependent children, 273,000 foster care \nchildren, over 100,000 children receiving adoption assistance services, \nand over 100,000 Head Start children experienced delays.\n  There were 10,000 home purchase loans and refinancing applications \ntotaling 800 million dollars worth of mortgage loans for moderate- and \nlow-income working families nationwide that were delayed.\n  Law enforcement and public safety: Well, there is one good piece of \nnews here, Mr. President, the suspension of investigative activities by \nthe IRS. So I guess something good comes out of every disaster. But on \na far more serious note, the Department of Justice suspended work on \nmore than 3,500 bankruptcy cases. Delinquent child support cases were \nsuspended, the deadbeat dads program. Closure of 368 National Park \nService sites. Loss of 7 million visitors. Grand Canyon National Park, \nclosed for the first time in its 76-year history.\n  Local communities near national parks lost an estimated $14.2 million \nper day in tourism revenues. I point out, again, Mr. President, the \npeople who lost those tourism revenues never got them back. It was not \nlike the Federal workers, where they were repaid when we started the \nGovernment up again.\n\n  Closure of national museums and monuments--the loss of some 2 million \nvisitors; 20,000 to 30,000 applications by foreigners for visas to come \nto this country went unprocessed each day; 200,000 U.S. applications \nfor passports went unprocessed; U.S. tourist industries and airlines \nsustained millions of dollars in losses because of visa and passport \ncurtailment.\n  The American Indians. I will quote Deborah Maddox, the acting deputy \ncommissioner for the Bureau of Indian Affairs:\n\n       We are getting close to an emergency situation. This week, \n     we would be generating our general assistance payments for \n     53,000 individuals and families. These grants are for very \n     basic needs and are for people who are not eligible for other \n     services.\n\n  Mr. President, American veterans sustained a major curtailment in \nservices as a result of the Federal shutdown, ranging from health and \nwelfare to finance and travel. They include cancellation of vocational \nrehabilitation appointments; nonprocessing of payments for \ncompensation, pension and education claims; delayed payments of GI bill \neducation checks and insurance death claims; and canceled counseling \nservices to avoid foreclosures. It goes on and on.\n  Mr. President, what we did when we shut down the Government was \nunconscionable and unacceptable, and it cannot be repeated. And for the \nlife of me--for the life of me--I do not understand why. There is some \nconnection being made between the extension of emergency disaster \nrelief services and this provision in the bill. The only reason, Mr. \nPresident, there is a distinction being made is the President of the \nUnited States does not want to have to sign the bill with this in it \nbecause the President of the United States does not want to see \nlegislation which would prevent his ability to shut down the \nGovernment.\n  Mr. President, in the Washington Post not long ago, a few days ago, \nthere was a letter from Mr. Albert R. Wynn, who is a U.S. \nRepresentative to Congress representing a district in the State of \nMaryland, very close to here in the District of Columbia, it is a \nletter to the editor of the Washington Post.\n\n       While I recognize that The Post considers itself a national \n     newspaper, as a U.S. Representative from the Washington \n     region, I find portions of The Post's May 15 editorial\n\n[[Page S5317]]\n\n     ``Fooling Around in the House'' very troubling.\n       I cosponsored the bipartisan ``Government Shutdown \n     Prevention Amendment'' to the ``Disaster Recovery Act of \n     1997.'' The amendment guarantees that the federal government \n     will remain open and functioning at current funding levels if \n     Congress and the administration cannot agree on the details \n     of the Federal budget. Basically, this amendment provides a \n     safety net for federal employees and the American taxpaying \n     public, which expects its government to provide uninterrupted \n     service. Given the devastating psychological and economic \n     effect the last government shutdown had on our region, I am \n     concerned that The Post considers such an amendment ``fooling \n     around.''\n       The Post's assertion that this amendment ``would change the \n     balance of power between the elected branches'' and that \n     ``the effect would be to lock in place a new norm in which an \n     agency's appropriations would be frozen from year to year \n     unless Congress acted to raise--or lower--it'' is just plain \n     wrong. The amendment clearly sunsets in 1998, and thus would \n     affect only the appropriations bills now under consideration \n     . . .\n       Let me remind The Post of the effects of the last \n     shoutdown: The cost to the federal government was $1.5 \n     billion; 170,000 veterans did not receive December 1995 \n     Montgomery GI Bill education benefits on time; more than \n     200,000 passport applications were not processed; pay for \n     more than 750,000 federal employees was delayed; 7 million \n     national parks visits were prevented; 2 million visits to \n     historic museums were prevented; 5,200 small businesses did \n     not receive guaranteed financing; 1,036 contract bid \n     opportunities were lost for small businesses, and 30,000 FHA \n     single-family home loans could not be insured.\n       For those who apparently think the Republicans are so \n     humbled that they wouldn't shut the government down again, I \n     would remind them that we never thought the government would \n     shut down during the Christmas season 1995.\n       Thus, in the final analysis, I do not believe federal \n     employees or taxpaying citizens think keeping the government \n     open with a continuing resolution is ``Fooling Around in the \n     House.''\n\n  Mr. President, I cannot say it any better. We have an obligation to \nprovide for the needs of those who have suffered natural disasters. \nThere is no one who sponsors this amendment who disagrees with that. \nAnd we want that money there as quickly as possible.\n  But I would allege, Mr. President, that when we ignore the \npossibility and fail to address the looming possibility of a manmade \ndisaster which would be caused by the shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment, again, Mr. President, I cannot quite comprehend why we \nwould not understand that we also have that obligation as well.\n  So I hope the President of the United States will change his mind. \nThe Senator from Alaska, the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, has said, and I have said, we would be \nwilling to negotiate the details of this amendment. We would be more \nthan happy to talk about satisfying some concerns as long as we \npreserve the basic principle of keeping the Government open.\n  So, Mr. President, I believe we are going to pass this bill. I \nbelieve it is going to the President with it included in the bill. And \nI hope that the President of the United States will sign the bill, and \nthen we would prevent again the disasters that we inflicted upon the \nAmerican people during Christmas of 1995, for which not only did the \nAmerican people suffer, but I have to tell you, in all candor, the \nreputation of the legislative branch of Government and the entire \nFederal Government, the governing body, suffered as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I reluctantly rise to oppose the \nsupplemental appropriations bill currently before us.\n  But first, let me once gain take this opportunity to extend my \ndeepest sympathies to those communities and families in the Upper \nMidwest who have had to deal with the loss and anguish caused by the \nterrible flooding several weeks ago.\n  I know all Marylanders join me in extending our thoughts and prayers \nto everyone in the Midwest.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I had hoped for a quick and speedy \npassage of this critically needed assistance to the disaster victims. I \nknow they are counting on us to help them get back on their feet--to \nhelp them rebuild their homes and businesses.\n  I am therefore deeply troubled by the fact that what should have been \na speedy, nonpartisan targeted relief bill has instead turned into yet \nanother nasty partisan battle that is designed to divide us and provoke \na veto from the President.\n  I have several major concerns with the supplemental, the first of \nwhich is the census sampling amendment that prohibits the Census Bureau \nfrom using funds to conduct statistical sampling in the year 2000 \ncensus. While to many this is a dry, academic topic, it impacts all \nAmericans on a daily basis.\n  In addition to being the manner for determining representation in the \nCongress, the census has become the basis for which billions of dollars \nin Federal assistance are allocated. Programs such a low-energy \nassistance, community block development grants, and other vital \nprograms to Maryland for transportation, housing, and education all \nrely on accurate census data.\n  This amendment does not follow the congressionally sought \nrecommendation of this Nation's top statistical experts who advise \nusing statistical sampling to get accurate data. Instead this provision \nwould result in an undercount of many of the Nation's citizens. \nEspecially hard hit would be those in rural areas and the inner city \npoor. That's wrong.\n  There is no reason to play games with the census, particularly when \nso many people's lives are at stake. Everybody counts in America, and \neverybody should be counted.\n  Mr. President, I am also very concerned by the continued inclusion in \nthis disaster relief package of what has artfully been called the \nShutdown Prevention Act.\n  Nobody knows the pain of a Government shutdown better than me and the \nMarylanders I represent. When the last shutdown occurred, numerous \npeople from across my State felt the shock and dislocation of those \nevents.\n  When I visited the Government agencies that had to remain open, I saw \nthe frustration on the faces of the workers and the financial hardship \nit caused for all Federal employees.\n  Let there be no mistake, I do not want another shutdown and will do \neverything I can to prevent it. But this bill is not the answer.\n  Instead, this bill which provides for a permanent continuing \nresolution, is nothing more than a partisan exercise designed to \nhamstring Congress from exercising its constitutional role in the \nlegislative process.\n  If we fail to enact our appropriations bills on time, the continuing \nresolution contained in this bill simply prevents Congress from \nincreasing spending on such crucial items as cancer research, crime \nfighting, and education. It also hampers Congress in cutting \nunnecessary spending and eliminating waste.\n  Lastly, I am disappointed by the method we have chosen to pay for \nthis bill. By taking over $3 billion in unobligated funds from HUD's \nsection 8 public housing program to pay for FEMA's disaster relief \nfund, we are simply robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  We cannot keep on raiding this program to pay for disaster funding. \nWe must find a new way to pay for emergency supplemental appropriations \nbills because these disasters are not going to end.\n  We could be facing even more expensive disasters in the near future. \nAre we going to continually rob one or two agencies to pay for these \nbills?\n  I believe we need a new system or a new arrangement to deal with \nthese types of disasters--a new system that is off-budget.\n  Mr. President, because of the census sampling amendment, the \ncontinuing resolution, and the way in which we have chosen to pay for \nthe bill, I am forced to oppose this bill.\n  It is my sincere hope that in the future we can avoid these partisan \nfights over disaster relief bills and find a more equitable way to pay \nfor them.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wanted to take a minute to express my \ndeep satisfaction with the results produced by the conference on the \nemergency supplemental bill. The negotiations were complicated by how \nmany issues were in play, but the chairman did a masterful job at \nmethodically and successfully working through each and every item. \nChairman Stevens' patience and perseverance are why we are here today.\n  I want to take note of two sections of particular importance to me. \nFirst, the transportation chapter includes language which is essential \nto Kentucky. This legislation provides for a long overdue funding \ncorrection in Federal-aid highway funding. As a result of an\n\n[[Page S5318]]\n\naccounting error, Kentucky's highway funding in 1996 resulted in a loss \nof Federal funds. This bill will provide Kentucky with $29.8 million to \ncorrect this funding shortfall. I am pleased to report that this level \nexceeds the $12.6 million requested by the Governor to complete the \nWilliam H. Natcher Bridge. I know the people of Daviess County and \nwestern Kentucky look to the completion of this bridge.\n  Second the foreign operations chapter in the House bill included \nlanguage giving the President permission to waive earmarks for Ukraine \nwhich the Senate had included in last year's bill. This waiver \nauthority was being offered in response to a deteriorating situation \ninvolving corruption and a slow down on crucial economic reforms. \nCongressman Callahan and I have very different views on the need for \nearmarks, but we share a concern about the trends in Ukraine. We were \nable to craft a compromise which made clear we are not content with the \npace or scope of reform by allowing the President to waive any earmark \nas it affects aid to the Government of Ukraine. The compromise exempted \nimportant projects such as nuclear safety and all activities carried \nout by the private sector and nongovernment organizations. Most \nimportantly, we did not permit any reduction in the overall level of \nthe aid we provided--the $225 million stands intact. Should the \nadministration choose to withhold or suspend funds for the government, \nthey must reallocate the funds to other programs within Ukraine.\n  We have sent a clear and focused message to the government that \nreforms are essential if businesses are going to have the confidence to \ninvest. But, we have narrowly crafted that message so that we do not \ndamage our bilateral relationship or the support we provide to \norganizations committed to advancing both Ukrainian and American \ninterests. Both Congressman Callahan and I will review the progress \nmade on this important issue when we take up the fiscal year 1998 bills \nin the coming weeks. I want to congratulate him on concentrating our \nattention on Ukraine's problem and working so effectively with me and \nmy Senate colleagues to produce a compromise which we all hope will \ngenerate real results.\n\n\n    direct operating loan funds for low-income and minority farmers\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I want to mention another group of Americans \nwho are suffering as Members of Congress continue to hold up the \ndisaster relief supplemental appropriations bill and prevent us from \npassing a funding measure that the President can sign. That struggling \ngroup is our Nation's low-income farmers.\n  Back in April of this year, a group of farmers came to my office and \ndescribed to me a crisis as real as the floods faced by Americans in \nthe Upper Midwest. It is planting season and many States, including \nVirginia, have exhausted their total allocation of direct operating \nloans. Direct operating loans are the funds made available by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to cover the costs of planting and repaid \nwhen crops are harvested. Without operating funds, the livelihoods of \nmany farmers, mostly on small farms, are threatened.\n  The Operating Loan Program is especially important for minority \nfarmers, many of whom have suffered from the well-documented \ndiscrimination within the Department of Agriculture. Discrimination has \ncaused or contributed to the financial ruin of minority farmers \nnationwide and has resulted in bankruptcies and impoverished \nretirements. But as the number of black farmers in the United States \nhas dwindled at three times the rate of other farmers nationwide--\nnearly to the point of extinction--a few farmers have managed to \nsurvive and keep their struggling farms afloat. USDA acknowledges that \n``having direct operating loan funds is critical for low-income \nminority farmers in their effort to become self-sustaining, successful, \ncontributing members of rural communities.''\n  After speaking with Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman and with the \nassistance of Senators Cochran, Bumpers, Stevens and Byrd, we were able \nto include an appropriation in the supplemental to provide $100 million \nin direct operating loan funds to those low-income farmers who cannot \nobtain credit elsewhere. I believe these funds are as critical to \nserving the needs of small and limited-resource farmers as implementing \nthe recommendations outlined in the Civil Rights Action Team report to \nremedy many of the long-standing problems plaguing the Department and \neradicating, once and for all, the discrimination that has plagued the \nDepartment for decades.\n  Unfortunately for Virginia and the other Southern States, it is now \nJune, and we have reached the tail end of the planting season. As we \nwaste time disputing controversial provisions attached to a disaster \nrelief funding bill, we've denied farmers access to loan assistance and \nprevented the farmers who have survived decades of discrimination the \nmoney needed to get their crops in the ground and to keep their farms \nafloat.\n  Mr. President, I find this situation frustrating, but my frustration \nmust pale in comparison to the low-income and minority farmers who have \nstruggled and, thus far, have managed to survive this manmade disaster. \nAgain I want to thank my colleagues who are interested in helping our \nNation's farmers and helped add my language to the supplemental. But, I \nask my colleagues who are keeping this desperately needed money out of \nthe field and out of the hands of our Nation's farmers to stop playing \npolitics and let us pass a bill that the President is willing to sign.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me say, as I did when this legislation \noriginally came before the Senate a month ago, that I fully support the \ndisaster relief that is being provided here. My heart goes not to the \nfamilies that have lost their homes, their businesses, and their \nschools in the recent floods and snows. We have all seen the \ndevastation on the evening news, in the newspapers. It is tragic, and \nwe owe it to the people in the Midwest and elsewhere to put the full \nresources of the Federal Government behind the relief effort to help \nthem get on their feet as soon as possible and restore some sense of \nnormality to their lives.\n  Mr. President, the relief in this bill is urgently needed. So are the \nprovisions that would prevent another shutdown of the Federal \nGovernment this fall. It seems to me that we are taking the very \nresponsible step of acting now to prevent another shutdown of the \nGovernment--something President Clinton says he, too, wants to prevent. \nYet the President is threatening to veto the disaster relief, of all \nthings, on account of the antishutdown provisions.\n  Why would a President who says he opposes Government shutdowns \nthreaten to veto a bill that would prevent Government shutdowns?\n  I will tell you why. Recognizing how anxious Members of Congress were \nabout being perceived as responsible for another Government shutdown \nlast fall--recognizing that Congress would do just about anything to \navoid another shutdown--the President was able to demand and win an \nadditional $6.5 billion for his favorite programs. Majorities in the \nHouse and Senate went along. I did not. The threat of a shutdown proved \nto be a valuable part of the President's arsenal then, and it will be \nagain unless we put a mechanism in place to keep the Government open \nwhile we continue to negotiate acceptable spending levels.\n  There are other good things in this bill as well, including \nprovisions to extend the expiration date of the San Carlos Apache Tribe \nWater Rights Settlement Act of 1992, and to ratify the agreement \nbetween the tribe, Phelps Dodge Corp., and the Secretary of the \nInterior for long-term water use.\n  Yet, Mr. President, I find myself in the position of having to vote \nagainst this bill for the very same reason I did when it first came \nbefore this body last month: it is yet another in a long line of \nspending bills that merely add to the deficit. It is business as usual, \nand it comes at a time when we supposedly have reached agreement on a \nplan to eliminate deficits by the year 2002.\n  It would be one thing if there were no other way to get aid to the \nflood victims except to borrow. But it is quite another thing when we \nignore other options in order to keep spending on other programs.\n  The Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, offered an amendment that \nwould have reduced spending across the board by a grand total of 1.9 \npercent. One point nine percent. That is less than 2 cents on the \ndollar in other programs to pay for this disaster relief\n\n[[Page S5319]]\n\nand other spending. That is all it would have taken, yet there were \nonly 38 of us in the Senate who voted for that amendment.\n  Later today, we will be asked to vote on the so-called balanced \nbudget agreement that our leadership struck with the White House. The \nink on the budget agreement is not even dry. Yet the supplemental \nappropriations bill we are about to vote on would add $6.6 billion to \nthe deficit over the next few years. It busts the budget agreement \nbefore the final vote is even taken.\n\n  What does that say about the budget agreement, which does not even \nbegin to reduce the deficit until the year 2001? Consider the deficits \nthat are projected under that plan. The deficit this year is expected \nto total $67 billion. We are trying to get to a zero deficit--to \nbalance--by the year 2002. But under the budget agreement, the deficit \ngoes up, not down. It climbs 34 percent--to $90 billion next year--and \nthen remains in that range for 2 more years. Only in the final 2 years \nof the 5-year plan--in 2001 and 2002--would the deficit drop \ndramatically.\n  If anyone thinks that we are really going to be able to eliminate a \n$90 billion deficit in those final 2 years--when we cannot even find a \nway to pay for less than $7 billion in disaster relief in the bill \nbefore us today--they are mistaken.\n  Mr. President, we all know that disasters can and will occur on a \nregular basis. Unfortunately, they will happen--floods, hurricanes, \nearthquakes, and the like. We know it, and we should plan for it.\n  The Appropriations Committee acknowledged in its own report that the \nnumber of major disaster declarations in the 1992-1996 period has \nincreased 54 percent. In other words, we had ample warning that \nsomething would occur somewhere.\n  Had we prepared for the need for disaster assistance last fall, \ninstead of using every extra dollar to meet President Clinton's demands \nfor new spending, we would already have been able to respond to the \nemergency in the Midwest and elsewhere around the country. But by \nignoring the potential for disasters last fall, we merely paved the way \nfor adding to the deficit now when the need for relief takes precedence \nover budget concerns.\n  Mr. President, this bill is more expensive than when it left the \nSenate a month ago. It is still not paid for. It busts the budget \nagreement that we will vote on this evening. We can and we must do \nbetter.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I want to voice my very strong objections \nto the 2000 census language in this bill. It bans the use of sampling--\nand any other statistical technique--to count the American population \nfor purposes of apportionment. It's unfair--it will cost the American \ntax payers about a billion dollars--it's political--it just doesn't \nmake sense.\n  Let's talk about fairness. Without sampling, the Census bureau tells \nus that the 2000 census may be about as accurate as the 1990 census. \nThat's the best case scenario. But in 1990, the census missed 10 \nmillion people. It counted 6 million people twice. And it counted \nanother 10 or 20 million people in the wrong place--maybe even in the \nwrong congressional district. Is that our idea of fairness? Is that our \nidea of ``one man, one vote?''\n  And many of the people undercounted in the last census are poor. Many \nof them belong to ethnic and racial minorities. We excluded some of \nAmerica's most vulnerable people from the democratic process. Is that \nour idea of fairness? Of course not. But that's the kind of census we \nwill have if this language passes into law.\n  Let's talk about cost. The Census Bureau tells us that a non-sampling \ncensus could cost almost a billion dollars more than a non-sampling \ncensus. Much of that additional cost will go toward various efforts \nthat the Bureau knows will have only marginal pay-off. But if the \nBureau can't sample, it will have to make every effort--even marginally \neffective efforts--to count people the traditional way. Without \nsampling, we're talking about a higher cost census to deliver a less \naccurate population count. Is that a responsible use of tax payer \ndollars? Does that make sense at the precise moment in time when both \nCongress and the American people are committed to the painful process \nof balancing the budget?\n  And let's talk about common sense. Statistical sampling is a \nrigorous, reliable, scientific tool. You can't find a statistician who \ndisagrees with that. That view is supported by GAO, the Commerce \ninspector general, the National Academy of Sciences, and a host of \nprofessional organizations.\n  The Bureau has been using statistical sampling in the decennial \ncensus for decades. The census long form--which goes to only one in six \nhouseholds--is a perfect example of a kind of sampling that is widely \naccepted. Virtually every arm of Government--Federal, State, and \nlocal--uses long-form data for enforcement of laws like the Voting \nRights Act and for tailoring programs to the cultural diversity of our \npopulation. And we are not plagued with law suits challenging the \nreliability of this data because it is based on sampling.\n  Ironically, the language in this bill would allow continued use of \nsampling for the long-form. In fact, it allows sampling for every \npurpose except that most important one--counting the American people \nfor purposes of apportionment. On the one hand, it acknowledges that \nsampling is valid and valuable--a scientific tool. But on the other \nhand, it denies us the use of that tool just where it would be most \nvaluable. That makes no sense at all.\n  Finally, despite what I read in the newspapers, I have seen no data \nwhatsoever validating the apparent political assumption that an \naccurate census means fewer House seats for Republicans. It is true--as \nI have already stated--that many of the undercounted people are poor or \nmembers of minority groups. But other groups are undercounted, too. We \nundercount people in rural areas--that's a third of the 1990 \nundercount--and many of those areas are Republican strongholds. We \nundercount people who are renters rather than homeowners, and \nstatisticians tell us that disadvantages the Sun Belt States--where \nRepublicans are also strong. Just last week the 2000 Census Advisory \nCommittee discussed the politics of the undercount. That committee \nconsists of census and population experts representing the statistical \ncommunity, every level of Government, and every large minority group. \nThe committee was unable to determine who would be the political \nwinners and losers in an accurate census.\n  This isn't about Democrats versus Republicans. We undercount people \nof every race, gender, age, State, and political persuasion. The real \nwinners and losers in the sampling debate are the American people. Our \nsystem of Government guarantees equal representation for all \nAmericans--regardless of race, ethnicity or economic circumstances--\nwhether they live in the country or the city--whether they own their \nhomes or rent them. That should be our goal--our only goal--in planning \nthe 2000 census.\n  In my home State of Ohio, we had a slight overcount in 1990. But I \ndon't fear the political consequences of an accurate census. My \ncommitment is to the fundamental principles of America's system of \nGovernment. And I'm confident that the citizens of Ohio feel the same \nway. Give us a fair, accurate census, and let the political chips fall \nwhere they may.\n  I know full well that the Census Bureau's plan to use sampling is \nhighly controversial. I have some reservations about it myself. Some \npeople say that sampling doesn't meet the constitutional requirement \nfor an ``actual enumeration.'' Some say that sampling is inherently \nsubjective because it is based on statistical assumptions. These are \nquestions that must be resolved.\n  On the constitutional issue, however, the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee recently heard testimony from a panel of attorneys who are \nnot friends of sampling. The panel included Wisconsin's Attorney \nGeneral James Doyle. He led the charge against sampling in 1990 because \nstatistical adjustment of that census would have given California an \nadditional House seat at Wisconsin's expense. We also heard from Stuart \nGerson, the Assistant Attorney General who advised the Bush \nadministration not to adjust the 1990 census. Both testified that the \nconstitutional requirement for an ``actual enumeration'' doesn't \nrequire a headcount. What it requires--what the Framers intended--is \nthe most accurate census possible. That's what we should be aiming for. \nAnd those who tell us that\n\n[[Page S5320]]\n\nsampling is inherently unconstitutional are trying to scare us into a \ncensus process that doesn't meet the Framers' goal.\n  What's critical right now is for census to continue its planning \nprocess--continue to appear before congressional committees--as it is \ndoing before the Governmental Affairs Committee--and continue to \nexplain its plans. Most importantly, the Bureau must test the proposed \ncensus plan in the 1998 dress rehearsal. Only after this process is \ncomplete will we know whether sampling will yield a better census--a \ncensus that includes every American. The census language in this bill \nwould make that impossible.\n  My heart goes out to all the Americans who are counting on us for the \ndisaster relief this bill will provide. I want to give them that \nrelief. It is extremely regrettable that in our legislative process \nthis has also become a bill that jeopardizes the most fundamental \nprinciple of our Democratic society--every American's right to equal \nrepresentation. If the census language in this bill passes Congress \ntoday, it will add to the other reasons that may persuade the President \nto veto the bill--and send it right back to us. Then perhaps we can get \non with the job of providing relief to the thousands of people who are \ncounting on us, and let the Census Bureau get on with planning the best \ndecennial census in American history.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I reluctantly rise to oppose this \nconference report. Regrettably, the majority has decided to play \npolitics with the lives of disaster victims. This is a tragedy.\n  Mr. President, I don't have a particular dog in this fight. My State \nhas been fortunate to be free of disasters recently. But it pains me to \nlook at television footage of homeless people in the Dakotas and \nMinnesota and know that they are not getting all needed assistance \nbecause of two unrelated political riders to this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I oppose this conference report because it includes \nthe so-called automatic CR. I want to be clear with my colleagues--this \nprovision violates the bipartisan budget agreement. Let me repeat this, \nthe automatic CR violates the bipartisan budget agreement.\n  It violates the budget agreement for two reasons:\n  First, it would lower the total amount of discretionary spending \navailable for fiscal year 1998. The budget agreement calls for $527 \nbillion in discretionary spending for fiscal year 1998, which is a $17 \nbillion increase over last year's level. If the automatic CR is \nenacted, the majority could refuse to pass the 13 appropriations bills \nand they would succeed in a $17 billion cut in discretionary spending. \nThis would violate one of the basic Democratic accomplishments in the \nbudget agreement.\n  Second, the automatic CR would make deep cuts in programs that are \nprotected in the bipartisan budget agreement. The bipartisan \nnegotiators agreed to provide large increases in 13 major discretionary \nprograms.\n  Examples of these programs include: Elementary and secondary \neducation improvement, Pell grants, child literacy, Head Start, \nnational parks, job training, the Clean Water Act, Superfund, and the \nCOPS Program.\n  Mr. President, the automatic CR would freeze these programs at last \nyear's levels. Therefore, these programs would not get the increases \npromised in the bipartisan budget agreement if Congress did not pass \ncertain appropriations bills.\n\n  Mr. President, as ranking member of the Budget Committee, I am \nconcerned that the majority is violating the bipartisan budget \nagreement before the ink is dry.\n  First, they include this automatic CR that cuts overall discretionary \nspending and specific programs that were protected by the bipartisan \nbudget agreement. Second, a House Ways and Means Subcommittee has \napproved welfare provisions that are in direct violation of the terms \nof the bipartisan budget agreement.\n  This is a disturbing trend. If we are to maintain bipartisan \ncooperation in the coming weeks, the majority will need to drop their \nefforts to move legislation that directly violates the bipartisan \nbudget agreement, like the automatic CR.\n  Mr. President, I also oppose the census provision in the supplemental \nbill. This is not a provision based upon statistical science, it is a \nprovision based upon politics. It is the latest attempt by the \nRepublican National Committee to try to increase its political fortunes \nin the next century.\n  My Republican colleagues, at the request of the RNC, have proposed to \nthrow hundreds of millions more at the 2000 census. This additional \nmoney, we have been told by the National Academy of Sciences, will not \nmake the census any more accurate, just more expensive. The Census \nBureau estimates that spending up to $800 million more than planned \nwould reduce the undercount only marginally.\n  This provision does not belong in a disaster relief bill and it \nshould be stripped out and sent back to the Government Affairs \nCommittee for further consideration.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the President will immediately veto this \nbill and that the majority will then pass a clean disaster relief bill \nso that people suffering all over this country will be able to begin \nthe process of rebuilding their lives and communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I sincerely regret that the bill before us \ntoday is not the one which will get relief to the flood victims of the \nUpper Midwest. Why, because it is laden with extraneous, highly \npolitical provisions which the President has told us for months that he \ncould not and would not sign.\n  What are those provisions? The first is an automatic continuing \nresolution which, if enacted, would put the Government on automatic \npilot if Congress is unable to complete its work on appropriations \nbills by the end of the fiscal year. While that may sound like a good \nidea, it is not. It would serve as a disincentive for Congress to \ncomplete their work in a timely fashion, and it would remove any \nleverage the President would have on appropriations bills not enacted \nby the end of the fiscal year.\n  The second extraneous provision prohibits the Bureau of the Census \nfrom using statistical sampling in preparing the 2000 census. Never \nmind that statistical sampling was proposed by the National Academy of \nSciences after a lengthy study as the best way to ensure an accurate \ncount. There is no question that this attempt to prohibit such sampling \nis politically motivated. While I oppose both provisions on their \nmerits, neither, in any case, belongs on an emergency disaster \nappropriations bill.\n  The sole purpose of the bill before us today is to try to embarrass \nthe President, not to help disaster victims. This is a sad day in the \nannals of congressional history. It is political one-upmanship at its \nworst. It is not about helping the people we were elected to serve. It \nis not about helping thousands of people in Grand Forks who are trying \nto rebuild their homes and their lives. It is about raw politics, pure \nand simple. Never, to my knowledge, has a disaster bill been held up \nfor purely political, partisan advantage. That is what we are doing \ntoday, and that is just plain wrong.\n  A group of business and political leaders from Grand Forks were in \nWashington yesterday, including Mayor Pat Owens. They were here to meet \nwith officials of the various agencies that will receive emergency \nfunds in this bill. Our officials were discussing how the money \ncontained in this measure could help their devastated community. A \ncouple of them sat in on the appropriations conference. They were \nappalled at what they saw and heard. They heard about the census, the \nUkraine, Uruguay, a continuing resolution, but they heard almost \nnothing about disaster funds. The people of Grand Forks are in dire \nstraights. Their needs are urgent. Their lives are on hold, yet their \nproblems were barely discussed in the conference.\n  We North Dakotans are a strong, proud, and resolute people. We will \nface the challenges ahead with courage and commitment. But with damages \nexpected to be in the billions, we can not fully recover without the \nFederal help provided in this bill. As I stated earlier today, I am \nenormously grateful for all the resources provided in this bill to help \nour disaster stricken region. I am particularly grateful to Senators \nStevens and Byrd who were extremely helpful and supportive throughout\n\n[[Page S5321]]\n\nevery step of the process. Without their personal intervention and \ncontinuous support, many items and millions of dollars would not be in \nthe bill we have before us today.\n  I want to thank their staffs as well--Steve Cortese and Jim English--\nwho gave me wise advice and counsel on my maiden voyage as a member of \nthe Committee on Appropriations. On behalf of all the people of North \nDakota, I want to thank them as well as all the members of the \ncommittee for their understanding and their generous assistance. I hope \nthat by next week, we will be able to deliver the resources promised in \nthis bill.\n  Let me just list a few of the items in the bill that will have a \ndirect bearing on our ability to recover, and for which there is \ncurrently no money available in the pipeline:\n  $500 million in community development block grants. This is the most \nflexible funding and the most crucial component to allow for buyouts. \nWhile all disaster States are eligible for this assistance, we \nanticipate that the majority will go to the Dakotas and Minnesota;\n  $50 million for a new Livestock Indemnity Program which will help \nNorth Dakota farmers and ranchers who have lost close to 125,000 head \nof livestock;\n  $15 million in Department of Agriculture funds to purchase floodplain \neasements to reduce hazards to life and property due to the floods;\n  $5 million for the Interest Assistance Program to provide additional \nfunding for guaranteed, low-interest loans to farmers;\n  $20 million to reimburse school districts who have had to educate \nadditional children who were dislocated by the floods;\n  $5 million for all preconstruction and design work for an outlet from \nDevils Lake to the Sheyenne River;\n  $27.9 million in Corps of Engineers funding for North Dakota from the \nFlood Control and Coastal Emergencies Program;\n  $600,000 for Ramsey County to mitigate damages to the sewer system \nfrom flooding, if necessary;\n  Up to $20 million for the Corps of Engineers to raise the levees at \nDevils Lake;\n  $210,000 for North Dakota's National Parks;\n  $3.9 million for the BIA in North Dakota;\n  $265,000 for the Indian Health Service in North Dakota;\n  $6.1 million for North Dakota to repair damaged freight rail lines;\n  $9.3 million to the Fish and Wildlife Service in North Dakota;\n  $840,000 for the U.S. Geological Survey in North Dakota;\n  Department of Education waiver authority language which will permit \nthe Department to help students having difficulty meeting application \nand other statutory deadlines regarding Federal education funds; and\n  Language that allows disaster States greater flexibility in using \nchild care and development block grant funds to help families in \nnonemployment-related activities relating to the cleanup and recovery.\n  My purpose in providing this list is to illustrate the urgent need to \npass a bill the President can sign. Those who argue that there is \nplenty of money in the pipeline to respond to our needs are just plain \nwrong, as the list above so aptly demonstrates. None of funds listed \nabove will be available until the President signs a disaster bill.\n  There are many people beyond the Congress to thank for their support \nin the wake of a series of historic and devastating disasters in North \nDakota. Above all, I want to thank the people of North Dakota who, \ndespite their losses, have refused to be overcome. They have displayed \na remarkable sense of courage, caring, and conviction throughout the \nordeal. Never have I been more proud to represent the State of North \nDakota than I am now. They are wonderful people. They know the meaning \nof neighbor. Whenever and wherever they were able, they extended a hand \nto those less fortunate.\n  The great spirit of our people is embodied in the mayor of Grand \nForks, Pat Owens. While small in stature, she has the heart of a giant. \nShe gave us the courage not to lose courage. Her indomitable spirit \nheld the citizens of Grand Forks together during the worst days of the \ntragedy, and now is guiding us patiently and compassionately through \nthe recovery.\n  Finally, I want to thank all the Federal agencies for their long \nhours and hard work in bringing emergency assistance to relieve the \nimmediate suffering of our citizens. They have done a magnificent job \nunder extremely trying circumstances, and we are grateful for their \nsuperhuman efforts. James Lee Witt, the Director of FEMA, has been the \nguiding light in this endeavor. He came to North Dakota and personally \nwitnessed the devastation, and then rushed personnel and resources into \nthe State to assess damages and provide emergency assistance. He has \nalso coordinated the activities of other Federal agencies in trying to \nget assistance to those in need as quickly as possible. That process is \nongoing, and James Lee remains the stalwart in that endeavor. We thank \nhim for all he has done and continues to do.\n  I intend to support this bill even though I know it is headed for a \nveto because of the extraneous provisions contained in it. I am voting \nfor it to keep faith with my constituents, and to give them hope that a \nvery similar bill, absent the political riders, will be passed next \nweek. That bill will provide us with the helping hand we need to \nrebuild our communities, reunite our families and restore our economic \nbase. We will face the challenge ahead with courage and commitment. \nWith our prairie faith to guide us, we will rebuild, we will recover, \nand we will be a stronger community.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 36 minutes, and \nthe Senator from West Virginia has 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. FORD. And it be charged to the majority.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We will take it off our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to add my comments to those \nalready expressed about how important it is that this legislation be \npassed, that it be acted upon rapidly, that people understand the \nextraordinary emergency that we are experiencing, that money is not \nadequately found in the pipeline today to meet all of the contingencies \nthat are currently affecting communities all through the Midwest.\n  A delay by any other means will send exactly the wrong message to so \nmany people who are waiting for us to act. We know that the legislation \nin its current form will be vetoed. It is a very dark day in the \nSenate, and, in my view, it is an extraordinarily unfortunate set of \ncircumstances that today when we have an opportunity to send the right \nmessage to all the people who have contacted us, when we have an \nopportunity to say we do understand, we find many of our colleagues \npushing a political agenda that has nothing to do with this legislation \nat all.\n  Mr. President, I would hope that the Senate would not adjourn until \nwe find a bill signed by the President. I would hope that once this \nbill is vetoed, we will move a clean bill immediately, send it back to \nthe President immediately, that we will not allow that veto to be any \ncause for delay in responding as comprehensively as we know how to \nrespond to the needs we find across this country.\n  The balanced budget agreement we all voted on just 2 weeks ago makes \na continuing resolution virtually unnecessary. We do not need to have a \ncontinuing resolution given the fact that we are working now in good \nfaith on both sides of the aisle to resolve what remaining problems \nthere may be with regard to budgetary policy. And I have every \nexpectation we will be able to pass these appropriations bills and we \nwill pass the reconciliation bill along the lines of the agreement that \nwe have just voted on.\n  We know that there are contentious issues that have to be addressed \noutside the budget itself. The census sampling question is one that \nunderstandably is controversial. But I must say,\n\n[[Page S5322]]\n\nthe National Academy of Sciences was charged with the responsibility of \ncoming up with a way with which to improve upon the accuracy of the \ncensus.\n  We know that, because of methods used in 1990 by the Bureau of the \nCensus, we were not even as accurate in 1990 as we were in 1980. And as \nwe examine all the other possibilities for attaining a greater degree \nof accuracy, the one that is universally accepted is the one subscribed \nto and incorporated in the policy that is the subject of this \ncontroversy right now.\n  This is not something dreamed up by a Democratic or a Republican \nadministration. This is something calculated to be the most accurate \nresponse by the National Academy of Sciences. But regardless of how one \nmay view that particular issue, it ought not be in a bill to address \nthe disasters that we face across this country.\n  There are many, many needs that are unmet. We received letters from \ncommunities across South Dakota, across North Dakota. Every one of them \nhas made it very clear that the immediate passage of this supplemental \nis crucial to their economic viability. No contracts can be awarded to \nrepair the sewer system in Watertown, SD, until this bill is passed.\n  I have a letter from the mayor of Watertown, who has asserted once \nmore the extraordinary difficulties that she, as mayor, is facing. I \nwill just read a couple of passages.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            City of Watertown,\n\n                                      Watertown, SD, June 3, 1997.\n     Senator Tom Daschle,\n     Hart Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I appreciate the opportunity to \n     provide information which underscores the need for the \n     immediate passage of the Supplemental Disaster Relief \n     Appropriation bill.\n       On April 4th, the City of Watertown, a City of \n     approximately 20,000 residents suffered a 500 year flood \n     event which was fought by City, County and State resources in \n     the midst of a 60 mph blizzard in subfreezing temperatures. \n     Flood waters froze and remained for 4-5 weeks. Over 4,000 \n     residents were evacuated during the flood and storm. \n     Approximately seven hundred and fifty homes were left without \n     sewer and water for over four weeks. The sanitary and storm \n     sewer systems were inundated and our wastewater treatment \n     facility which was designed to treat 3.5 million gallons of \n     sewage per day was flooded by over 18 million gallons per \n     day.\n       Substantial damage was done to the sewer and infrastructure \n     system. Many homes were severely damaged by water and ice. A \n     substantial number of residents remain displaced today.\n       Both FEMA and SBA, along with Red Cross and the Salvation \n     Army were enormously helpful in meeting the emergency needs \n     of the affected residents and continue to assist to this day; \n     however, without the Supplemental Appropriations bill, it is \n     impossible to begin to fully recover.\n       As a City, it now becomes our responsibility to prioritize \n     needs, both short term and long term. As we proceed to do so, \n     it is incredibly difficult to make firm plans without the \n     commitment of Federal emergency dollars. Certain emergency \n     projects, which have not been budgeted, must now be done to \n     protect the community from experiencing further damage: the \n     capping of storm sewer pipes from the river to prevent the \n     reflooding of an entire quadrant of the City; significant \n     sections of sewer must be repaired to prevent the system from \n     being flooded by extremely high groundwater levels, streets \n     must be patched or repaired due to extensive water damage and \n     shorelines along the lake area must be reinforced to stop the \n     ongoing damage due to high water and wave action. No \n     contracts can be awarded without confirmed sources of revenue \n     for projects which the City cannot accommodate due to lack of \n     dollars. In addition, South Dakota construction seasons are \n     very short. Without immediate passage of the Supplemental \n     bill, Watertown will be unable to make many necessary \n     repairs during the current construction season.\n       Mitigation issues, both short term and long term are \n     dependent on immediate Federal assistance: flood control \n     projects cannot be accurately assessed without the \n     consideration of the buy-out program which serves to relocate \n     businesses and residences out of the flood plain. The degree \n     to which buy-outs or flood prevention structures are \n     necessary cannot be determined without the knowledge of \n     available assistance levels. Residents whose homes would be \n     excellent candidates for buy-outs are in limbo, unable to \n     make decisions about reconstruction or completing the \n     recovery process because the City is unable to negotiate \n     unless firm funding commitments have been made. And, in fact, \n     the result of delayed passage of the Supplemental bill may be \n     that the City is forced to eventually pay more for homes \n     which were repaired in the meantime.\n       CDBG funds are incredibly important to the States and \n     Cities because they are flexible funds, allowing dollars to \n     be delivered to priority projects in a timely manner. \n     Leveraged with local and EDA funds, communities can get the \n     most for the dollars being spent. No community or State is \n     prepared for the immediate incredible costs of additional \n     staffing needs, mitigation planning and project costs \n     resulting from such devastating, unexpected occurrences. \n     Immediate dollars for planning and technical assistance are \n     critical to our recovery.\n       In the case of northeast South Dakota, communities such as \n     Watertown continue to be threatened by record high water \n     tables, aquifers and saturated watersheds which bleed into \n     one another increasing the likelihood that flooding will \n     continue to be a problem. Unless necessary measures can be \n     undertaken to reduce our exposure to future floods now, \n     future costs will continue to mount . . . Immediate and \n     future mitigation needs require dollars for both local and \n     State governments working as partners to solve problems as \n     quickly as possible.\n       Watertown's economy will be enormously impacted by the \n     devastating floods of 1997. Our very livelihood centers \n     around the agricultural community for 100 miles in all \n     directions. With many of the roads under water, travel to \n     patronize our businesses is severely impacted. Without \n     immediate assistance for animals killed during the disastrous \n     winter and historic floods, herds will not be revitalized, \n     profits will plunge and dollars for commerce will be few. \n     Fields unable to be planted will equate into diminished \n     dollars long term for businesses on main street. The very \n     economy of Watertown and many affected rural towns like it, \n     are dependent upon the immediate response of Congress. We are \n     so grateful for the generosity and assistance provided to us \n     from throughout the United States. We are now in need of \n     dollars to rebuild for the future. The very well-being and \n     livelihood of thousands of affected disaster victims in the \n     upper midwest cries out for assistance in picking up the \n     pieces of their lives and rebuilding the affected areas of \n     their communities.\n       In closing, Senator Daschle, I would remind members of \n     Congress that the bottom line in all of this is people. As I \n     have stated before, Watertown is determined to recover and \n     become stronger than ever. The incredible community spirit I \n     have witnessed throughout these very difficult days has been \n     nothing short of inspiring. We simply ask that the \n     Supplemental Appropriations bill be passed as soon as \n     possible to enable our community and others to recover and to \n     heal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Brenda S. Barger,\n                                                            Mayor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is addressed to me. It says:\n\n       [I want to underscore] . . . the need for the immediate \n     passage of the Supplemental Disaster Relief Appropriations \n     Bill . . .\n       As a city, it now becomes our responsibility to prioritize \n     needs, both short term and long term. As we proceed to do so, \n     it is incredibly difficult to make firm plans without the \n     commitment of Federal emergency dollars. No contracts can be \n     awarded without confirmed sources of revenue for projects \n     which the City cannot accommodate due to lack of dollars. \n     . . .\n       Watertown's economy will be enormously impacted by the \n     devastating floods of 1997. Our very livelihood centers \n     around the agricultural community for 100 miles in all \n     directions. . . . Without immediate assistance for animals \n     killed during the disastrous winter and historic floods, \n     herds will not be revitalized, profits will plunge and \n     dollars for commerce will be few. Fields unable to be planted \n     will equate into diminished dollars long term for businesses \n     on main street. The very economy of Watertown and many \n     affected rural towns like it, are dependent upon the \n     immediate response of Congress.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not think you can say it any clearer than that. \nThese people need help. They need it now. They do not understand all \nthese complicated, misguided and extraordinarily problematic extraneous \nmatters added to this legislation at the worst possible time. It is not \njust mayors, it is not just the people living in most of our \ncommunities in eastern South Dakota, North Dakota and Minnesota that \nare struggling. Farmers and ranchers have also expressed themselves in \na myriad of ways.\n  Mr. President, 350,000 livestock in South Dakota alone were lost in \nthe storms and flood--350,000. We have never had an experience of that \nmagnitude in my lifetime. We have $145 million in livestock losses \nalone. Not one dime has been provided or can be provided to indemnify \nproducers for livestock losses until this bill passes. There is no \npossibility of providing any meaningful relief to livestock producers \nanywhere in the country until this legislation passes.\n  Mr. President, I have received so many remarkable letters from people \nall over South Dakota. I want to read\n\n[[Page S5323]]\n\nexcerpts of one, and I ask unanimous consent the entire letter be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   April 14, 1997.\n     Senator Tom Daschle,\n     Hart Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       To Whom It May Concern: We live in the far North West \n     corner of South Dakota. We have had a devastating winter to \n     say the least. This last storm just added a finishing flair \n     to the proverbial cake. When the winds finally died, we went \n     to check our cattle. We had bedded heavily and created the \n     best protection we could for them.\n       We found a horrifying sight; the cows looked as if they \n     were walking snowballs. They had suffocated from ice covering \n     their nostrils. As we went along we found dead calves \n     scattered and tromped into the earth. Some stood like statues \n     froze over with snow, blinded by the same. Our hearts ached, \n     we spent the day dragging in cold calves that were trying \n     their best to hold onto life. We saved what we could, others \n     just gave up hope, as are we\n       Our daughter who is eighteen, had never seen such a heinous \n     sight. It is seven days past since the storm. We are still \n     losing calves from the effects. Our greatest fear is not only \n     financially, but that our daughter is tremendously stressed, \n     as well as we. There is no greater pain than watching a child \n     agonize.\n       As we heard of losses through the community our hearts were \n     further pained. All have lost livestock, all are in pain. \n     Some losses have been such as extreme ones we wonder how any \n     human can live through it. Some are not or have chosen not \n     to.\n       We implore you to please send some relief our way. A 70/30 \n     deal is to no benefit if you can't afford the 70. We have \n     lost 12 cows and approximately 30 calves. We know people that \n     have lost 100 head to 150 head so we feel fortunate.\n       Ironically this loss could financially devastate us, so far \n     this winter has costed us $82,000 more than usual. Yet we \n     feel fortunate it isn't more. We also feel fortunate to still \n     have each other and God to hold us up.\n       PLEASE.......................................S.O.S.!!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Nolan L. Seim,\n                                                    Shadehill, SD.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The letter is from Nolan Seim:\n\n       To whom it may concern,\n       We live in the far North West corner of South Dakota. We \n     have had a devastating winter to say the least. This last \n     storm just adding a finishing flair to the proverbial cake. \n     When the winds finally died, we went to check our cattle. . . \n     .\n       We found a horrifying sight; the cows looked as if they \n     were walking snowballs. They had suffocated from ice covering \n     their nostrils. As we went along we found dead calves \n     scattered and tromped into the earth. Some stood like \n     statutes froze over with snow, blinded by the same. Our \n     hearts ached, we spent the day dragging in cold calves that \n     were trying their best to hold on to life. We saved what we \n     could, others just gave up hope, as are we. . . .\n       We implore you to please send some relief our way.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My question to the leader is I hope he realizes this is \nnew law. Never before in the history of the United States have we \nassisted people who lost cattle during a disaster. So we are making new \nlaw. It is not just an appropriation. It is an authorization bill, too.\n  I accept what the Senator says. It would be nice to get the bill \npassed, but I want the Senate to know that we took it upon ourselves to \nnot only appropriate money but to change the law so that disaster aid \nwould be available to people who lost cattle. I understand this is a \nbad disaster, but there have been many disasters where people have lost \ncattle before and they received no aid.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I could respond to the distinguished chairman. He has \ndone an outstanding job, and I appreciate his responsiveness to this \nparticular need. We have had other disasters where cattle were \ndetrimentally affected, and ranchers have been compensated for \nlivestock, but they have never been compensated, as he has indicated, \nfor losses as a result of floods or winter snowstorms.\n  But we have clearly set precedent with regard to the reimbursement of \nranchers, and, in fact, that happened in 1992. This legislation is \nmodeled after that particular legislation, and I appreciate greatly his \nsupport and the effort he has made to respond to this circumstance as \nCongress has responded to situations in the past involving livestock.\n  Mr. President, it is not just livestock producers, it is not just \ncommunities. People in South Dakota and across the Midwest have been \nhit across the board in a number of different ways. It has been the \ncoldest winter on record, we have had the most severe blizzards in our \nhistory, a 500-year flood, and there were only 2 days in 1997 when a \nPresidential disaster was not in effect for South Dakota. The winter \nstorms produced winds chills of 90-degrees-below-zero and 70-mile-an-\nhour winds, 13,000 miles of road were impassable, and lives and \nlivelihoods were threatened in ways we have never seen before.\n  My point in reminding all of my colleagues about this loss, Mr. \nPresident, is simply this: There is no patience left out there. They \nhave endured the winter. They have endured the floods. They have \nendured this long, deliberative process about how we respond in the \nmost effective way to all the problems we have across the country in \nemergencies and disasters where declarations have been made, but they \ndo not understand this. They do not understand how anyone can take a \nbill this important and use it for vehicles that have nothing to do \nwith the disaster, nothing to do with an emergency, nothing to do with \nresponding as effectively as we possibly can, given the circumstances \nthat they have had.\n  I do not understand it either, Mr. President, and I just hope that we \ncan collectively respond as soon as the veto is made in a way that will \ngive them more hope and less frustration, more belief in what we as \nRepublicans and Democrats can do to respond more effectively than we \nare this afternoon. We have to get rid of the extraordinary cynicism \nthat comes so often when people in the country affected by these \ncircumstances watch what we do. We cannot effectively deal with that \ncynicism so long as cynical uses are made of legislation this \nimportant.\n  So, again, let me thank the chairman for his best effort in trying to \nresolve any of these difficulties. Let me thank the ranking member. \nSenator Byrd has been extremely responsive and cooperative in all ways, \nas he is in so many instances. I thank the Members for their efforts.\n  I must say, this is a disaster in and of itself. For us not to be \nable to respond, for us not to resolve these matters, for us to know \nthat this bill will be vetoed, and do it anyway, is inexcusable and \ninexplicable. I just hope we can find a way to resolve these matters \nthis week and decide in a mutual fashion that we will get a new bill \nthat will be signed by the President in the shortest possible time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind words that the \nDemocratic leader has made here on the floor. My response to him would \nbe that no President in the history of the United States has closed \ndown the Government like President Clinton did. There are hundreds of \nthousands of people who were put in a position of being told to stay \nhome, they could not go to work. When they did not go to work, \nfacilities all over this country were closed. People were told they \ncould not get their veterans checks, they could not get any assistance \nfrom the Social Security Administration. They were totally closed down.\n  Now, to use the first vehicle available to us in the appropriations \nprocess to try to prevent that, I do not think is a cynical act. I am \nsorry that he used that word with regard to this provision. It is a \nlegitimate difference of opinion with the administration and with the \nminority, but I do not believe we are being cynical in trying to \nprotect the people of the United States from another shutdown, which I \nforesee is going to happen unless we find some way to come to an \nagreement with this President about the misuse of the Presidential \npower to shut down the Government when we were not out of money, by the \nway. We were not out of money. There were funds that could have been \nused to keep the office open.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me respond very briefly, and I know \nthere are Senators who are seeking recognition. We will differ as to \nwho it was that shut the Government down. I think many of those in the \nRepublican leadership have already admitted themselves that they hold \nthe larger share of the responsibility.\n  The question is, do we need this vehicle, this bill, as the only \nmeans by\n\n[[Page S5324]]\n\nwhich we can resolve that problem in the future? That, in my view, is \nthe cynical part of this. We know we can resolve it. We know we can \nfind a way with which to deal with shutdowns in Government. We know \nthat we can find other ways to resolve our differences. But to use this \nmust-pass piece of legislation to do it, in my view, is wrong. A lot of \nour colleagues know it is wrong, and I just hope we can put those \nissues aside and deal with them at another time and get this \nlegislation passed the way it should be passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the remaining time to the Senators from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Hutchison.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. What is the remaining time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes, twenty-one seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I will speak for 5 minutes, and then I will yield the \nfloor to my colleague from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak on two issues that were brought \nup by the Senator, the distinguished minority leader, and also others \non the floor, and that is, we keep hearing, ``Send the President a bill \nhe can sign.'' Mr. President, we are sending the President a bill that \nhe can sign.\n  It is like we have a responsibility in Congress just to please the \nPresident. Mr. President, I think this is a two-way street. \nPennsylvania Avenue runs two ways.\n  It is well settled in American law that there is a Congress that \npasses laws and a President who signs or vetoes those laws. So it is \nnot, ``Send the President a bill he can sign.'' We are sending the \nPresident a bill he can sign. We are sending the President a bill that \nhe has asked for, to replenish the FEMA funding. The people of North \nDakota and South Dakota and Minnesota are getting the help they need--\nand they should, and we want them to--and we are going to replenish \nthose funds.\n  In addition, we are providing the notice and the process to not only \nthe people who work for Government, the people who depend on it, about \nwhat is going to happen, what process are we going to use for \nappropriations bills so they can plan, so they will know that the \nveterans checks will be there, so they will know, if they plan their \nfamily vacation on October 2, that they will be able to get into the \nGrand Canyon, so that if they have a problem with a passport, they will \nknow that there is not an artificial disruption of Government on \nOctober 1 because the President and Congress have not agreed. What \nbetter time to provide that process than right now in the first \nappropriations bill of this year?\n  Mr. President, we are sending the President of the United States a \nbill that he can sign to replenish the FEMA funding, and we are acting \nin a most responsible way so that the veterans of this country will \nnever again have to worry if their check is going to be there on time, \nso that the very disaster victims that we are trying to assure have \ncoverage will never have to worry that the check is going to get there \non time because they will never have to worry that Government might \nshut down if Congress and the President have not agreed to one or two \nappropriations bills by the September 30 deadline. We want Congress and \nthe President to have a level playing field, to negotiate in good \nfaith, as Congresses and Presidents have done for years in this \ncountry.\n\n  The second issue I want to talk about is why we have to do these \nthings in this bill, why we can't do it in a separate bill, as the \ndistinguished minority leader has asked that we do? It is because there \nis urgency. There is urgency in determining how we are going to do the \nprocesses of Government, whether it is census, whether it is just the \nfunctions of Government. There is an urgency that we set that process \nright now. So, Mr. President, when we hear all of the talk about \nsending the President a clean bill, we are sending the President a \nclean bill. We are sending the President a bill that provides for the \nfunding for our armed services, to replenish their accounts; we are \nsending the President the replenishing of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Account; we are providing for the people who are in need as \nwe speak, and we are making sure that there is not a disruption today, \nnor on October 1 or 2 of this year, because we are providing for the \norderly transition of Government from fiscal year to fiscal year.\n  Mr. President, when you hear all of the horror stories about this \nbill not being clean, having political overtones, we need to set the \nrecord straight. The President can sign the bill that we are sending \nhim, or he can tell us what he doesn't like about it and negotiate in \ngood faith. But to tell the American people that any victim of a \ndisaster is not getting funding, especially when he has not even made a \ndecision yet to declare the victims of a tornado in Texas last week a \ndisaster so that they will know the funding is coming, I think is a \nspecious argument.\n  I ask the President and the minority leader to cease and desist from \ntelling the American people something that is not true, and that is \nthat we are not providing for the disaster victims and the armed \nservices of our country. We are doing it, and we are providing \nresponsible Government for the people who depend on Government checks, \nwhether it is the worker or a citizen of our country, so they will be \nable to plan on October 1 of this year that there will not be a \ndisruption for any reason in the normal processes of Government.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me make a very brief comment on this \nissue that the minority leader has raised. Then I want to turn to the \nreal purpose that I have come to the floor to speak on today.\n  What we have done in this bill, recognizing what happened last year \nwhen the Government shut down, is simply say to the President that if \nwe have an impasse in deciding on how much money we are going to spend \nin any given area, while we are working out those differences, the \nGovernment, in that area, will have the same level of funding that it \nhad this year, and so the Government will not be shut down and services \nwon't be disrupted.\n  There is only one reason the President would refuse to go along with \nthis imminently reasonable proposal, and that reason is that the \nPresident believes that by having the leverage of shutting down the \nGovernment, he can extract additional spending from the Congress. That \nis what happened in the last week of the session last year. We \nincreased spending by about $7 billion in that year, and about $20 \nbillion over the next 4 years, basically because of the power of the \nPresident to intimidate a Congress that was frightened because the \nGovernment might shutdown.\n  So I hope nobody is confused. This issue is about spending money. The \nPresident wants to spend more of it. We would like to begin by saying \nthat while we negotiate on that subject, we will not shut the \nGovernment down; we fund it at the existing year's level.\n  I am sorry to have to come over to be, apparently, the last speaker \nof the day on a bill that everybody will rejoice in and pound on their \nchest and say, ``Look what we have done for our fellow citizens who had \nthe misfortune of having terrible floods.'' We have all seen the \npictures, and those of us who represent States that weren't flooded \nhave all been thankful that it didn't happen to us. Our hearts have \ngone out to those who have been victims.\n\n  I want to end this debate today by pointing out why this bill \nrepresents a failure. It represents a failure for the Congress and the \nAmerican people, not because we are helping people who suffered from a \ndisaster, but because we are not paying for it. We want to get all this \ncredit for being compassionate. We want to fulfill the obligation that \nthe Government has taken on itself to help people who suffer from \nnatural disasters. But when it comes right down to it, we don't want to \ndo what families have to do in America, or what businesses have to do \nwhen they undertake similar activities--that is, we don't want to spend \nless money on other things. In fact, when we considered this disaster \nfunding bill on the floor of the Senate, I offered an amendment to \nreduce spending across the board in other areas by .7 percent--hardly \nmassive cuts--so that we could help those who suffered from natural \ndisasters, but do it in such a way as to pay for it. I am sorry to say \nthat my\n\n[[Page S5325]]\n\namendment got only 38 votes. I personally believe that if the American \npeople had the right to vote on paying for the disaster assistance by \ncutting other programs, they would have voted for that amendment and it \nwould have passed. So I somewhat feel here in the Senate as if my views \non this subject are kind of hopelessly out of fashion. But I do believe \nthat when families sit around kitchen tables every night and write \ntheir budgets and make tough decisions when they have emergencies, they \nhave to take money away from things they want to do, and I believe they \nwould have been on the side that I took on this issue.\n  This bill, as now written, with all the good things it will do, will \nraise the deficit this year by $760 million. It will raise the deficit, \nover the next 5 years, by $6.6 billion. We are going to adopt a budget \nresolution. We have already adopted it in both Houses of Congress--we \nare going to work out the differences and adopt it shortly--that is \ngoing to set out the claim of balancing the budget. I am not going to \ndrag that dead cat back across the table by pointing out again in great \ndetail that 97 cents out of every dollar of deficit reduction in that \nbudget is simply assumed. It doesn't represent any policy change. But I \nhave to lament, in passing, that before that budget is adopted, we are \nalready busting that budget by $6.6 billion. The deficit spending in \nthe Senate and the deficit spending in Washington never comes to an \nend.\n  I wish we were having a different battle today rather than fighting \nover continually funding the Government--which I think we should--\ninstead of allowing it to be shut down. But I wish we were having a \nfight about the fact that this bill doubles the level of funding that \nwas originally requested. I wish we were having a battle about the fact \nthat this bill spends $8.6 billion --twice as much as originally \nrequested--for flood damage and for replenishment of money for Bosnia. \nI wish there were greater concerns about the fact that this bill will \nraise the deficit by $6.6 billion. But that concern today, while it \nexists in the Senate, is certainly a minority view. I think it is \nimportant on these occasions to simply point out that we have done the \nright thing in helping our fellow Americans who have had terrible \nthings happen to them that were beyond their control. But we have done \nthe wrong thing by not paying for it, because in helping people that \nhave suffered from a natural disaster, we are contributing once again \nto not only a man-made, but a Government-made disaster called the \ndeficit. I simply want to predict that this problem is not going to go \naway and that we are going to be back here some day worrying about the \ndeficit again, and that we might wish that we had not raised it by $6.6 \nbillion today.\n  I thank our distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor giving me this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I just wanted to share a few thoughts with \nyou on something that came up this last week.\n  I was quite distressed when I heard that the President of the United \nStates--the administration--suggesting that maybe our troops in Bosnia \nare going to be there for a longer period of time than the deadline \nhaving been established of June 30, 1998. This bothers me a great deal, \nfor one reason in particular, and that is, I am chairman of the \nReadiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Back \nwhen the decision was made in 1995 to send troops to Bosnia, many of us \nfelt this was not a good idea--not that we are not compassionate, but \nthat we were using our very rare, precious resources, after this \nadministration has decimated virtually our defense budget to send \ntroops over to areas and endanger their lives where we have no national \nsecurity interest at stake.\n  This is something that bothers quite a few of us. So we introduced \nback in November 1995 a resolution of disapproval to stop the President \nfrom sending troops over to Bosnia. This only lost by four votes, or we \ncould have perhaps kept our troops from being sent over to Bosnia.\n  I was concerned about this because I went to Bosnia to see what our \ninterests might be over there. When I went up to the northeast sector, \nthe northeastern part of Bosnia, where it would be under the \njurisdiction of the support of the United States for our station troops \nto be stationed, I got up there, and when I told the people up there \nthat it was going to be 12 months, as the President promised, that our \ntroops would be over there--this is November 1995, keep in mind--\nGeneral Hoagland, in charge of the northeast\n\n[[Page S5326]]\n\nsector for the United Nations, made this statement. He started \nlaughing. He said, ``You mean 12 years, don't you?'' I said, ``No, 12 \nmonths. The President has promised that this is a 12-month operation, \nthat if we deploy the troops to Bosnia, they would be back in 12 \nmonths.''\n\n  So nobody really believed rationally that would happen. However, \nbecause of the President's promise that the troops would be back in 12 \nmonths, they were able to get enough votes to defeat our resolution of \ndisapproval. And they sent the troops over to Bosnia.\n  Now we are in a position where we will do everything in our power to \nsupport the troops over in Bosnia. But at the time when he said they \nwould all be back by December 1996, all of a sudden, as soon as the \nelection was over, we find that the troops are going to be extended \nover there another 18 months, or until June 30 of 1998.\n  This is kind of a creeping thing that we go through, such as we \nexperienced many years ago with our Marines in Guatemala. We have many \nother examples where we have gone in for a limited period of time. I \ncan remember when we sent troops over to Somalia and they were going to \nbe over there for a short period of time. And they stayed. It wasn't \nuntil 19 of our Rangers were murdered and their bodies dragged through \nthe streets of Mogadishu that finally there was enough pressure to \nbring our troops back home.\n  I am very concerned now because, as I suspected would be the case, \nthe President, who, again, has promised the second time that all the \ntroops would be back home now by June 30, 1998, has started to renege \non that. We can't let this happen.\n  The cost they talked about for the Bosnian operation initially was $2 \nbillion. It has now turned out to be closer to $8 billion, as I \npredicted over 18 months ago it would be, and we are at least creeping \nup to $6.5 billion.\n  Where does that money come from? We are going to be asked to vote for \nan emergency supplemental. That is to pay for the additional cost over \nthere, along with other problems, other flood problems and emergencies \nthat existed, and a few cats and dogs thrown into the bill. However, in \nthis case, we have to spend the money.\n  Where does it come out of? It comes out of our defense budget, which \nis already strained to the point where we can't carry out the minimum \nexpectations of the American people, and that is to defend America on \ntwo regional fronts.\n  So we have a second reason. Not only are we endangering the lives of \nour troops over there, but we are also spending money that should be \ngoing into building and rebuilding our Nation's defense system.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to get on record, as I did in Brussels when \nI gave the speech to NATO, that I would do everything, with every fiber \nin my being, to make sure that the troops come back.\n  I would suggest this, however. I think the President is in the bully \npulpit on this. I think he keeps continuing to want to leave them over \nthere knowing full well that once the troops leave, it will go back to \njust like it was before. The Croats, Muslims, the Serbs, the \nMujaheddin, the Arkan Tigers, the Black Swans--all of the other rogue \nforces--will be over there fighting as they were before. And then he \ncan say, well, if we had left them their longer, that would not have \nhappened. Recognizing that is going to happen regardless, I still say, \nMr. President, we should all resolve to ourselves that our troops \nshould come on the second deadline that we have standing. That is June \n30, 1998.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee on \nconference on the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 84), establishing \nthe congressional budget for the U.S. Government for fiscal year 1998 \nand setting forth appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 1999, \n2000, 2001, and 2002, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the concurrent \n     resolution (H. Con. Res. 84) having met, after full and free \n     conference, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to \n     their respective Houses this report, signed by all of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of June 4, 1997.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention \nof the Senate a typographical error contained in the statement of \nmanagers to accompany the conference report on the fiscal year 1998 \nbudget resolution. During the course of the conference some language \nwas worked out to include in the statement of managers with respect to \nthe section 8 housing allowance--which is set out in section 203 of the \nconference report. This language was mistakenly included in the \ndescription of section 203 of the Senate amendment rather than in the \ndescription of section 203 of the conference agreement. The language at \nissue reads as follows:\n\n       The agreement creates an allowance of $9.2 billion in \n     budget authority with an associated, but unspecified, amount \n     of outlays to be released by the Budget committees when the \n     Appropriations committees report bills that provide for \n     renewal of Section 8 housing assistance contracts that expire \n     in 1998. The conference agreement assumes that the amount of \n     the allowance to be released (estimated to be $3.436 billion \n     for outlays) will not be reduced to the extent that the \n     appropriations and authorizing committees produce Section 8 \n     savings that were proposed in the President's 1998 budget.\n\n  Mr. President, the conference report on the concurrent budget \nresolution of the budget for fiscal year 1998 now before the Senate, \nrepresents the first major legislative step--in what will be a number \nof steps--to implement the bipartisan budget agreement announced by \nPresident Clinton and the bipartisan congressional leadership almost \nexactly 1 month ago today.\n  As those in this Chamber will understand, but maybe not as obvious to \nthose watching this debate, this conference agreement is the blueprint \nthat will guide the building and enforce the adjustments to legislation \nthroughout the summer. When the legislation is finished following this \nblueprint, and when it is sent to the President and signed, we will \nhave built a house that is fiscally strong for the future.\n  So today's vote on this conference agreement should be identical to \nthe 78 to 22 vote taken in this Chamber just before the Memorial Day \nrecess. And that is as it should be, because the conference agreement \nis based on the Senate-passed budget resolution and the House-passed \nbudget resolution which both followed the agreed on budget levels of \nthe announced bipartisan budget agreement. In other words the aggregate \nnumbers in the two Chambers' resolutions were almost identical, \nresulting in hardly any need for a conference.\n\n  In fact, it wad initially felt that since both resolutions followed \nthe agreement, there was not even a need or a conference. It was held \nby our joint leadership that merging the two resolutions--because of \nthe normal differences in House and Senate committees of jurisdiction \nunder the reconciliation instructions--that this could have been done \nby simply adopting a House amendment to the Senate amendment, a \nprocedure clearly authorized under the Budget Act. However, this \nprocedure would have put us in the posture of possibly having \namendments to that House amendment, the leadership concluded we should \nexpedite the process by simply having a conference meeting and avoiding \npossible amendments.\n  So on Tuesday afternoon when the House returned from the Memorial Day\n\n[[Page S5327]]\n\nrecess, they appointed conferees and Tuesday evening the conference \nmet. As I indicated, since the two resolutions were almost identical in \nthe numbers, the only issues to conference were related to some \nprocedural reserve fund mechanisms, and nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate, \nsense-of-the-House, and sense of-the-Congress resolutions.\n  Yesterday these minor issue were resolved and last evening the \nconference agreement and accompanying statement of managers was filed. \nThe House of Representatives just acted on the budget resolution \nconference agreement by a vote of 327 to 97, almost identical to the \nvote when it first passed the House on May 20. The House-passed budget \nresolution passed on a vote of 333 to 99. Today, nearly 90 percent of \nthe House Republicans voted for his conference agreement, and almost \ntwo thirds of the House Democrats voted for it. Clearly this is a \nbipartisan budget agreement as reaffirmed in this vote today in the \nHouse.\n  And now the Senate is about to follow suit. If you voted for the \nSenate-passed budget resolution on May 23, then you have no reason not \nto vote for this conference agreement on June 5.\n  For the record, through it is probably unnecessary, I might remind \nthe Senators and those watching what this blueprint for a balanced \nbudget means. It means that when our fiscal house is finished following \nthis blueprint, the Federal deficit, which would have topped $150 \nbillion in 2002 if nothing was done, will be balanced. And if the \npolicies that get us to balance in 2002 are continued unchanged beyond \n2002, we will reduce spending over the next 10 years almost $1.1 \ntrillion.\n  The blueprint for the balanced budget agreement before us this \nafternoon means that spending which would have grown at 4.4 percent \nannually over the next 5 years will now grow at slightly over 3 \npercent, about the rate of growth in the overall economy.\n  The blueprint for the balanced budget agreement means that the size \nof the Federal Government will decline. Federal spending which today \nrepresents 20.8 percent of the economy today, will decline to 18.9 \npercent in 2002.\n  The blueprint for the balanced budget agreement means that the \nMedicare part A program will remain solvent for nearly a decade and \nthat the spending on all of Medicare that is now projected to grow at \nnearly 9 percent annually over the next five years, will be reduced to \na more manageable growth rate of about 7.5 percent annually.\n  The blueprint for the balanced budget agreement means that Federal \ntaxes will be reduced on hard working American families with children \nand on small business and farms. Taxes will be reduced by $85 billion \nover the next 5 years, and if these tax cuts are extended over a 10-\nyear period, total tax reductions not exceeding $250 billion will be \ngiven to the American public.\n  We are going to let them keep their money. It is their money.\n  Finally, the blueprint does assume that some additional resources are \nneeded for high priority Federal programs in education, environment, \njustice, transportation, children's health, work welfare reform, and \nsome safety net programs. But I would remind the blueprint critics that \nthe some $33.6 billion in additional resources spent on these priority \nprograms represent less than 0.37 percent of the total $9.0 trillion in \ntotal Federal spending we expect over the next 5 years.\n  This is a good blueprint. Like all blueprints, as the building \nactually begins in the committees of jurisdiction these next few weeks, \nit will require some adjustments in the actual building phase and from \ntime to time, as has already begun, there will be disputes as to how to \nread the blueprint. In those cases, I am long with my ranking member \nand the bipartisan leadership will work with the committee chairman to \ninsure that we are making a good faith effort to stick to the \nagreement. But today the design is clear and the builders can go to \nwork.\n  In closing let me say that the passions of the Federal budget debate \nlie at the very essence of our free, democratic governmental system. \nThe questions of the role of the Federal Government, how much of our \nnational wealth should be spent on the public good and who should pay \nfor it, are questions that date back to the beginning of this great \nrepublic.\n  In recent years, however, the obstacles to the Federal budget have \nbeen primarily a question of finding a working consensus between the \nexecutive and the Congress. Today we have a consensus on this issue. Of \ncourse, each of us alone might have designed the plan differently, but \nthen we might not have had a consensus. Yes, I personally think we \nshould have done more in entitlement spending programs that still \nthreaten the foundation of this house we build today, but for today we \nmust do what we can. And I ask you to vote as you did on May 23 and \nadopt this conference agreement. Then we will be one step further on \nthe road to the future of restoring the American dream for the young \npeople of our country.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join the manager of the Budget \nCommittee in supporting the conference report on the budget resolution. \nPerhaps it is unnecessary to recall what constitutes this agreement, a \nconsensus agreement. Consensus is a fairly simple word with very \ndramatic meaning. It is the majority view--not the unanimous view but \nthe majority view--of the participants in an agreement in a debate.\n  And I want to just take a moment to remind everybody about the fact \nthat this is a consensus agreement. Those who are looking for total \nvictory are not going to find it here and those who are looking for \ntotal defeat are not going to find it here. A consensus view, the \nmajority view is what we strove for. I am unhappy with some things, and \nI am sure my colleague on the other side of the aisle is also unhappy \nwith some of these things. But we struck an agreement in good faith. We \nworked very hard. We worked hard to get it through the conference and \nwe thought that we had a continuation of the understanding that was \narrived at when we shook hands a few weeks ago and presented the Senate \nside of the budget understanding, the budget resolution.\n  As I said in my first remarks, I fully support this agreement. That \ndoesn't mean I support it enthusiastically, but it means that it has my \ncommitment because we worked so hard and we got so many good things in \nthis budget resolution. What I am concerned about--if there seems to be \nevident a note of reluctance or wariness in my comments, it is true. It \nis true because what I have heard already, and I have read in the \npapers, as it is said, is that there are those who want to reinterpret \nwhat it is that we agreed upon when we concluded this Senate budget \nresolution, what we agreed upon when we had the conference concluded; \nthose who are saying, well, not this many immigrants are going to be \ntaken care of; or not this proposal on containing the tax cut, $250 \nbillion over the 10-year period; or not making certain that the \ninvestments in the principal passenger railroad in this country are \ngoing to be made, as it was understood by me and others sitting there.\n  So I want to throw out that word of caution. This is, as I think \neveryone knows, nonamendable. It is a budget conference report. There \nis no room for amendment. There is no opportunity for amendment. The \nconference report before us is very similar to the budget resolution \nthat the Senate approved on May 23, by a vote of 78 to 22. It provides \na framework to get our fiscal house in order while protecting critical \nnational priorities. Last fall, the American people spoke at polling \nbooths. They elected a Democratic President and a majority of the \nRepublicans in both Houses. Yet, despite this divided Government, they \nhave been clear about what they want. They want the gridlock to end. \nThey want the bickering to end. They want us to get to work. They want \nus to do the best we possibly can to get this house in fiscal order and \nget on with the business of our country.\n  At the same time, Americans asked that Washington focus on the issues \nthat matter most to us: Education, Medicare, children's health, \nenvironment, fighting crime, and other Government responsibilities that \nmake a difference in the way people live. I believe the conference \nreport before us keeps our trust with the people. It is not, as I \nearlier said, a perfect agreement. It is not exactly as I would have \nwritten it. But I consider it an enormous step forward. It will, as we \nsee it now, relieve future generations of having to continue to pay for \nborrowing that we have done or that we are doing now. But it is going \nto stop in 2002--that's my belief and that's the belief of those who \nnegotiated in good faith to get this agreement done. It calls for the \nlargest investment in education and training since the Johnson \nadministration. It is phenomenal. It says we are going to put money \ninto our children. We are going to prepare for the future. We are \nagreed on that. And with that, it combines tough fiscal discipline with \na strong commitment to Medicare, environment, transportation, and other \nnational priorities.\n  Throughout this process, President Clinton has insisted and I have \nagreed that an agreement that imposes real\n\n\n[[Page S5328]]\n\nfiscal discipline, that builds on President Clinton's tremendous \nsuccesses in reducing the deficit, and balances the budget in a real, \ncredible way, is the way we have to go. The President has insisted and \nI have insisted that we make education the priority that it is.\n  I strongly supported some amendments that were dropped in the process \nof discussion, like the Dodd amendment. I commend the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut for his leadership. His was the amendment that \nsaid that we would not go beyond $250 billion worth of tax cuts over \nthe 10 years. A point of order could have been raised against any of \nthe tax cuts in the bill and that point of order could have been waived \nonly with the votes of 60 Senators. But it was dropped in the \nconference.\n  Instead, there is a commitment that says that $250 billion over the \nnext 10 years, $85 billion in the first 5 years and $165 billion in the \nsecond 5, is the most that can be had by way of tax cuts. There are \nletters supporting it. There are letters from the chairman of the Ways \nand Means Committee in the House, there is a letter from the chairman \nof the Finance Committee in the Senate, there are letters from the \nSpeaker of the House, and there is a letter from the distinguished \nmajority leader here, that confirms the position that we took. So, \nwhile there is some disappointment that the language that we originally \nanticipated would be in there is not part of the record, but it is \nindirectly recognized. It is there.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of letters from the Speaker and \nSenate majority leader and the letter from Senator Roth and Congressman \nArcher be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 1997.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We would like to take this opportunity \n     to confirm important aspects of the Balanced Budget \n     Agreement. It was agreed that the net tax cut shall be $85 \n     billion through 2002 and not more than $250 billion through \n     2007. We believe these levels provide enough room for \n     important reforms, including broad-based permanent capital \n     gains tax reductions, significant death tax relief, $500 per \n     child tax credit, and expansion of IRAs.\n       In the course of drafting the legislation to implement the \n     balanced budget plan, there are some additional areas that we \n     want to be sure the committees of jurisdiction consider. \n     Specifically, it was agreed that the package must include tax \n     relief of roughly $35 billion over five years for post-\n     secondary education, including a deduction and a tax credit. \n     We believe this package should be consistent with the \n     objectives put forward in the HOPE scholarship and tuition \n     tax proposals contained in the Administration's FY 1998 \n     budget to assist middle-class parents.\n       Additionally, the House and Senate Leadership will seek to \n     include various proposals in the Administration's FY 1998 \n     budget (e.g., the welfare-to-work tax credit, capital gains \n     tax relief for home sales, the Administration's EZ/EC \n     proposals, brownfields legislation, FSC software, and tax \n     incentives designed to spur economic growth in the District \n     of Columbia), as well as various pending congressional tax \n     proposals.\n       In this context, it should be noted that the tax-writing \n     committees will be required to balance the interests and \n     desires of many parties in crafting tax legislation within \n     the context of the net tax reduction goals which have been \n     adopted, while at the same time protecting the interests of \n     taxpayers generally.\n       We stand to work with you toward these ends. Thank you very \n     much for your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Newt Gingrich,\n       Speaker.\n     Trent Lott,\n       Senate Majority Leader.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 1997.\n     Mr. Erskine Bowles,\n     Chief of Staff to the President,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Bowles: We are writing to express our desire for \n     continued cooperation between Congressional staff and the \n     staff of the various Administration agencies during the \n     development of the current budget agreement.\n       Much of the most difficult work in connection with the \n     budget agreement will involve the development of the revenue \n     provisions that will satisfy the parameters of the agreement. \n     Historically, the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation \n     has provided technical legal and quantitative support to the \n     House and Senate. The Budget Act requires the use of Joint \n     Committee on Taxation revenue estimates. Ken Kies and his \n     staff are committed to facilitating our work on the tax \n     provisions of this budget agreement. You can be assured that \n     they will cooperate with Administration counterparts in \n     receiving Administration input as they carry out their \n     statutory responsibilities.\n       The revenue estimating staffs of the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation and the Office of Tax Analysis at Treasury have a \n     long history of cooperation and communication among analysts. \n     It is our understanding that steps have already been taken to \n     insure that the cooperative efforts of these two staffs will \n     be intensified during the current budget process. It is also \n     our understanding that the professional staffs at the Office \n     of Tax Analysis at Treasury and the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation will consult and share information necessary to \n     understand fully the basis of their revenue estimates and to \n     minimize revenue estimating differences. The proposal shall \n     not cause costs to explode in the outyears.\n       Now that we have agreed upon the overall parameters of this \n     significant agreement, an inordinate number of details \n     concerning specific provisions must be drafted and analyzed \n     by the JCT and the committee of jurisdiction. We look forward \n     to working with the Administration.\n           Sincerely,\n     Newt Gingrich,\n       Speaker.\n     Trent Lott,\n       Senate Majority Leader.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Senate Budget Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. John R. Kasich,\n     Chairman, House Budget Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pete and John: Our Committee will soon begin marking \n     up tax legislation to meet the reconciliation directives of \n     the 1998 Budget Resolution. We will meet the Resolution's \n     instructions of reducing revenues by $85 billion over the \n     five year period 1998-2002 and by no more than $20.5 billion \n     in 2002.\n       Furthermore, we can assure you that, consistent with the \n     May 15, 1997 letter from the Speaker of the House and the \n     Majority Leader of the Senate to the President which stated, \n     ``It was agreed that the net tax cut shall be $85 billion \n     through 2002 and not more than $250 billion through 2007,'' \n     the ten year net revenue loss in the tax reconciliation bill \n     will not exceed $250 billion.\n           Sincerely,\n     William V. Roth,\n       Chairman, Finance Committee.\n     Bill Archer,\n       Chairman, Ways and Means Committee.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I note also that this resolution does include the \nsense of the Congress resolution that again reaffirms that $250 billion \n10-year tax limit on tax cuts is clarified, in a way. I just want to \nremind everybody what it says here:\n\n       The 10-year cost of the tax reconciliation bill resulting \n     from this resolution shall not exceed $250 billion and any \n     revenue loss shall be certified by the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation in consultation and cooperation with the Office of \n     the Tax Analysis of the Department of the Treasury.\n\n  To make the point by continuing to emphasize it, I don't think anyone \nshould have any doubts that the tax cuts in the reconciliation will be \nlimited. We are not going to suffer a repeat of exploding deficits that \nflowed from the disastrous policies of the Reagan era. We will not go \ndown that road again.\n  So as we wrap up our work on this budget resolution, I congratulate \nthe President for his leadership in this effort. We are here today on a \nbipartisan basis, only because the President decided to lead the effort \nto make it happen. He deserves enormous credit for it. When we look \nback at the results of the legislation that the President wanted to put \nforward some years ago, in 1993, and we see the incredible results, we \nsee reports by a publication like Fortune magazine saying this is one \nof the greatest economies that this country has ever had, you can sense \nthe strength of the economy, you can sense the confidence that the \npeople have in their ability to take care of their families and to \nprovide, hopefully, with the programs that we are outlining here today, \neducation for their children in the future, security for the aged, to \nmake sure that these investments will produce job opportunities and a \nbetter quality of life for all our people. That is what we want to see.\n\n[[Page S5329]]\n\n  So, I yield the floor and I say to my colleagues, even if there is \nsome disagreement, even if there is some question, I hope we will get \nthe fullest support that we can obtain for this agreement. It does, \nonce again, put the fiscal house in order. It maintains the important \npriorities that we all, I think it is fair to say, would like to see.\n  I am sure if I talk to my colleague to my right here, if we talk \nabout education for our children, he will say we want to invest in \neducation for our children.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We want to have Medicare more secure. Our approaches \nmight be slightly different, but the fact is we want the same \nobjective.\n  So, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I would like to have my fellow manager \nenter into a unanimous-consent agreement, if we could, so every Member \ncan plan on when we would be able to speak; that we would do what we \ntraditionally do, to have one Republican and one Democrat, then back to \nthe Republican, back to the Democrat, to yield for speeches in that \nway?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question? In the \nunanimous-consent agreement, which I think makes all the sense in the \nworld, will the Senator be kind enough in the rotation, since we have \nSenator Faircloth here and Senator Hollings, and I am pleased to follow \nSenator Hollings, could we be listed in order right now, since we are \nhere?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. And then, beyond that, it will be one Republican and \none Democrat--I would agree to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. OK. I think it was understood we would yield now to \nSenator Faircloth. I yield to Senator Faircloth such time as he might \nuse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, I take the floor to rise to discuss a \nserious issue, and my concern is this. The ink isn't even dry on this \nbudget agreement and I have heard nothing, yesterday and today, but \nrumors that there are plans to change radically and have a major tax \nincrease put into this agreement. Specifically, there is much talk, and \nit is far beyond rumor, of increasing the tobacco tax from 21 cents to \n50 cents per pack, which would raise $15 to $30 billion a year.\n  The problem is, of course, the tax cut in the budget plan is too \nsmall. But that is not news to anybody; it was always too small. The \nRepublicans wanted to cut taxes by $188 billion. We now have a net tax \ncut of $50 billion, and that is to cover several initiatives such as \ncapital gains, estate tax, and child credit. As I view choices, we \nshould live by the budget agreement we passed in the Senate, and the \none we want to pass. Now, if we can't do that, if there is some reason \nwe cannot do that--and we want to cut taxes further, which I agree to--\nthen there is a simple choice that it would be a wonderful thing if \nthis body could learn--to cut spending, to spend less money. That is a \nwonderful alternative that we need to know about. Not every time we are \nshort of money, raise taxes.\n  If there is intent on the part of some of those who are having this \ndiscussion to change the budget agreement, I wonder why we are even \nhaving a budget resolution. What else are we going to change? Are we \ngoing to expand the deficit? Are we going to expand spending? \nApparently we are. Is a deal not a deal? We either agree not to raise \ntaxes any farther or we do not agree, and it looks like we do not \nagree. But I think it is an outrage that it is even under consideration \nat this point in the negotiations.\n  When I came to the Senate I said I would never vote for a tax \nincrease. I never have and I never will. We have plenty of money. We \nare spending it in too many places.\n  We do not need a tax increase. Taxes are already too high. The \naverage American works until mid-May to pay his or her taxes now. One-\nthird of the money the average citizen earns goes to pay taxes. A tax \nincrease of any kind is the last thing the working men and women of \nthis country need now. What they truly need is a tax cut.\n  But we say we are going after the tobacco industry, which really \ndoesn't count, but when we drive the tobacco industry into bankruptcy, \nwhat product do we want to attack next? To each Senator, what product \nfrom your State will we decide to drive into bankruptcy? This is a \nGovernment that has an insatiable appetite for tax money--money of any \nkind, borrowed, taxes, there is never enough.\n  The net tax cut in the budget resolution is only 1 percent of \nrevenues over the next 5 years, a pretty minuscule amount. It is hardly \na windfall. Yet, here we are before we even get the resolution passed \nand we are considering raising taxes.\n  Again, I have to ask, what is the budget agreement for? Why do we \neven call it an agreement, if we fully intend to come back and rewrite \nit in the Finance Committee? Why debate it and argue over it on this \nfloor when the real decision is going to be made in the Finance \nCommittee? It is a waste of our time.\n  The agreement is not worth the paper it is written on if we are going \nto haul it over into the Finance Committee and they are going to make \nthe decision.\n  Madam President, I can give every assurance that if the Finance \nCommittee intends to raise taxes beyond what is called for in the \nbudget resolution, passing this bill is going to be extremely \ndifficult. I will say now, we are heading into dangerous territory in \nraising taxes. There is not support for it, even if it is on tobacco. \nThis isn't a case of reading anybody's lips. We don't have to read \nlips. We can read the budget resolution. We don't need new taxes. I \nwill forcefully oppose any kind of effort to increase them. Frankly, \ngiven that this is going on and has been for 2 days, I think the Senate \nis wasting its time on a budget resolution that will be rendered \nmeaningless within a week.\n  I thank you, Madam President, and I yield back any time I might have \nremaining.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, let me talk to a very, very important \npoint other than taxes and the increase thereof.\n  What we have is the jargon of ``I'm against taxes, I'm against taxes, \nI'm against taxes,'' but now we have reached the point where we are \nincreasing spending, because we are not paying our bills. We are \nincreasing spending by $1 billion a day. That is the interest cost on \nthe national debt.\n  When Reaganomics commenced in 1981, the interest costs on the \nnational debt were $74.8 billion. We had less than $1 trillion debt, \nand the interest cost was only $74.8 billion. So looking at it in a \nhistorical sense, for 200 years of our history, with the cost of all \nthe wars, we had never reached a $1 trillion debt. We had paid for the \nRevolution, right on up through World War I, World War II, Korea, \nVietnam, and yet, in the last 16 years, without the cost of a war, we \nhave jumped to a $5.4 trillion debt. And it is all because you wouldn't \npay the bill. You were against taxes, and you were against paying the \nbill. It is wonderful to go home with that singsong and continue.\n  I have a chart right here to show exactly what I am talking about. \nThere is the $74.8 billion in interest costs at the time of President \nReagan. This has all the Presidents since Truman, the actual deficits, \nthe actual debt and thereby the forced interest costs, which I call \ninterest taxes. You know, they say death and taxes can't be avoided; \nneither can interest costs on the national debt. So beware of the \ncolleague who comes and says, ``I am against taxes, and I'm never going \nto vote for taxes,'' like this is a luxury we all can afford. I would \nlove that. I can just come here and join in the spending. We would \nnever have any taxes and we would all get reelected, but the country \nwould go broke because you have to pay, as this debt goes through the \nceiling, the interest cost.\n\n  It is now, as shown here by the CBO figures, at 359 billion, and this \nchart is somewhat outdated by several weeks. Its actually higher now. \nStill, there is no question it is $1 billion a day we are spending for \nnothing. I know my distinguished colleague from North Carolina is \ninterested in highways. So is the\n\n[[Page S5330]]\n\nSenator from South Carolina. This $1 billion doesn't pay for a single \nroad or a single bridge. It doesn't engage us in any research. It helps \nus not with health research at the National Institutes of Health. It \ndoesn't pay for defense. It doesn't give foreign aid. It doesn't do \nanything but represent waste, and we are determined to continue this \nwaste.\n  Let me get right to the point about this particular budget resolution \nbecause, Madam President, I say advisedly, if there ever was a fraud, \nthis particular budget resolution is a fraud. I say that advisedly to \nmy colleagues in the Senate. The distinguished Senator from Iowa gets \nup and says, ``This is bipartisan, this is bipartisan, and it just \npassed the House with 350 votes.'' Then our distinguished ranking \nmember on this side of the aisle on the Budget Committee said, ``This \nis consensus, we had to get together, we got a consensus,'' and thereby \nis the sizzle that is supposed to sell this steak when the truth of the \nmatter is it is one piece of meat that is an outrageous fraud.\n  Let's go to the partisan resolution that we passed in 1993. If you \nwant to see frauds, it is when they get together. When they don't get \ntogether, you are getting nearer the truth in budgeting. Back in 1993, \nMadam President, we cut some 250,000 Federal employees off the payroll. \nWe came in and we created savings, spending cuts of $500 billion, and, \nyes, we increased taxes. We taxed beer, we taxed gasoline and, yes, we \ntaxed Social Security.\n  I can see my colleague on the other side of the aisle talking about \nthat Social Security tax increase that the Senator from South Carolina \nvoted for and, pointing over to this side, the distinguished Senator \nsaid, ``Ah, they will be hunting you down like dogs in the street and \nshooting you.'' The chairman of the Finance Committee was willing to \nbet everything on it. He said he would bet his home and everything \nelse. Of course, the poor gentleman is not here anymore, but he was \ngoing to bet it all.\n  Another distinguished Senator said, ``Wait a minute, these tax \nincreases, they'll take the money and spend it, it won't be allocated \nto the deficit.'' And they went down the list deriding, if you please, \nthe partisan budget of 1993, that budget plan.\n  What has it given us, without a single Republican vote? The partisan \nbudget is what I want to talk about. This morning, I was listening to \nearly morning TV. I turned on CNN at 6 o'clock, a little before 6, and \nthey had the chief economist for Bear Stearns, and he said this economy \nis the strongest that he had ever experienced in 24 years. We have the \nlowest unemployment in those 24 years. We've got inflation down to its \nlowest point in 35 years. We have created 12.1 million jobs. Business \ninvestment is up to the highest point since World War II. The stock \nmarket has doubled and, ah, deficits, Madam President, deficits, the \ndeficits for the first time are really starting to increase. I was with \nPresident Johnson here in the Senate when we balanced the budget back \nin 1968 and 1969. Since that time, deficits have been going up, up, and \naway; the national debt is up, up, up, and away; interest cost spending \nfor nothing is up, up, up and away. But, Madam President, under \nPresident Clinton's plan of 1993, deficits have been declining each \nyear, every year, for 5 years.\n  Heavens above, what does this instrument do? I hold in my hand the \nconference report. On page 4, I looked for the word balance. Instead, \nyou see the word deficit. If you want to know what the actual deficit \nis, all you need do is go to the public debt. For fiscal year 2001, it \nis $6,307,300,000,000. For fiscal year 2002, instead of balance, it \ngoes up to $6,481,200,000,000. So the actual deficit is \n$173,900,000,000. Here is the figure, here is the document, here is the \ntruth. And while the Senator from South Carolina cries fraud, we have \nthis so-called bipartisan consensus, where we say ``I'll take your tax \ncuts if you take my spending increases and we'll all run around on the \nfloor of the Congress hollering balance, balance, balance.'' Everywhere \nman cries balance, but as for me, give me balance or give me staying \nthe course. I wanted staying the course, but here is what they did \ninstead.\n\n  I hope they get ashes in their mouths, that media crowd, when they \nsay ``balance,'' ``the balanced budget plan,'' ``the balanced budget \nresolution that passed,'' ``the balanced budget.'' It is time we stop \nlying to the American people and tell the truth and show the page. I \ndare them to refute it. I have the document right here right now.\n  So what has happened? Instead of staying the course, Madam President, \nwe have gone off the wagon.\n  President Clinton put us on the wagon. We stopped drinking that old \ndeficit whiskey, but now we are taking the bottle back up and we are \ngoing to start drinking again. And we are going to get drunk on the \nwonderful balance--balance, 200-proof--excuse me, $173,900,000,000-\nproof. That is what we have to drink here this afternoon.\n  And how do they do it? It is similar to another time, back in 1990, \nwhen I was on the Budget Committee trying to hold the line on Gramm-\nRudman-Hollings, with the automatic spending triggers across the board. \nThey abolished them at 1:45 a.m., October 21, early in the morning. And \nI raised a point of order. They voted me down. That is when I asked for \na divorce from Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. It was supposed to be a solid \nboost toward fiscal responsibility, not a shield they started hiding \nbehind.\n  But, again, what they do is take unrealistic savings or spending \ncuts. We have it over in the Commerce Committee. I talked to the \ndistinguished chairman this morning. You are not going to find $26 \nbillion in spectrum auctions.\n  What we did back in 1990 was to revise the economics. We did the same \nthing again this year. What we did here is, we found $225 billion the \nday before they made the agreement. That was convenient, wasn't it? \nThey found $225 billion.\n  And they came again with backloading, just as they did in 1990. I \nlooked at this particular instrument here, the 1997 conference report, \nand saw that 72 percent of the spending cuts occur in the last 2 years. \nThey backload it. Unrealistic--not going to happen.\n  But worst of all, they go again and start looting the trust funds of \nAmerica--looting the trust funds, the pension funds, to the extent \nwhere we now owe, in 1997, $1.484 trillion. Under this particular \nresolution, by the year 2002, we will owe just under $2 trillion--\n$1.992 trillion.\n  Now, here is how they do it. They use Social Security moneys. They \nuse the military retirees' money, civilian retirees' pension funds, the \nunemployment compensation moneys, the highway trust funds--and we are \nnot building highways--and the airport moneys. That is scandalous.\n  Right to the point, Madam President, they are going to continue the \ntax increases that the Senator from North Carolina talks about. They \nwill continue the airport and airways tax on passenger taxes that we \npay as airline travelers. But that is not going to airlines. That is \ngoing to give you an inheritance tax cut or capital gains tax cut. That \nis outrageous, scandalous. That is a breach of trust.\n  If you want to talk about a breach of trust, I was reading Bob \nReich's book. Former Secretary of Labor, Secretary Reich, said, ``I'm \nproud of two things: One, during my 4-year tenure I got a minimum wage; \nand the second thing, I passed the Pension Reform Act of 1994.''\n  And what did that provide? All of us in the Congress said, \n``Corporate America, you have got to fully fund your pensions so the \nemployees can count on it. You can't use it, you can't raid those trust \nfunds, those pension funds.''\n  Madam President, guess what? Just 3 weeks ago, Denny McLain, the all-\nstar championship pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, was sentenced to 8 \nyears in prison because, as head of a corporation, he used the pension \nfunds to pay a corporate debt.\n  Here we are using trust funds to pay the Government debt. In private, \noutside-the-beltway America, you get a prison sentence for this. Here \nin the wonderful Congress, heavens above, you get the ``Good Government \nAward,'' you get consensus, you get bipartisanship, you get one grand \nfraud. It is time we stopped lying to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized under the previous agreement.\n\n[[Page S5331]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Alaska. I say, \nI will try to stay under 10 so he will have time to speak. We had an \nagreement, those of us here earlier, if that would be OK. I will try to \nbe quite brief, because we have been through a tremendous amount of \nthis debate.\n  Mr. President, first of all, let me just say that I appreciate the \nwork of my colleagues. I know that my friend from New Jersey is \ncommitted to many of the same issues that I am. Whatever he does, he \ndoes in good faith. I think this budget agreement is a profound \nmistake. I have said I think it is a budget without a soul. I believe \nthat very honestly and truthfully.\n  I worry about so much of these cuts in capital gains and estate taxes \ngoing to the very top of the population, those that really do not need \nany assistance. Mr. President, really, I hate the tradeoff. I think it \nis a budget without a soul. And I think it is a profound mistake as a \nblueprint for our country for the following reasons.\n\n  First, let me just start with the justice, just by raising the \nquestion of simple justice. In the last Congress, all in the name of \ndeficit reduction, in the welfare bill we made huge cuts. Almost all of \nthe cuts we made were targeted to low-income people. We made cuts \ntotalling about $26 billion in food nutrition programs, food stamp \nprograms. We do not restore any of that by way of a blueprint in this \nbudget agreement. Then we made cuts in benefits for legal immigrants.\n  Now, my colleague from New Jersey expressed some of his dismay about \nwhat is going on in the House side, in the House Ways and Means \nCommittee. And I am quite in agreement with him. But I also just want \nto say I guess it is how you look at what is progress.\n  The fact we restored some benefits for legal immigrants who are \nelderly and disabled, that is a good thing. And the fact that we \nrestored some benefits for children, that is a good thing. But the fact \nof the matter is, if you are elderly, if you are 80 years old and you \nare not disabled, you are just old and poor, you are elderly and poor, \nyour benefits were not restored in the budget agreement. I do not think \nthat is enough.\n  The fact of the matter is, for children who need food nutrition help \nor for elderly people, there was no restoration of funding for food \nnutrition programs. I do not think that is enough. Just as a matter of \nelementary fairness, we should have done much better.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues have talked about our priorities. I \nguess I will be honest. I really understand that everybody votes in \ngood conscience--and I know this budget agreement is going to get a \ngood vote--but to have tax cuts, and I think my colleague from South \nCarolina is on the mark, to backload it, and with enormous revenue \nloss, the vast majority of the benefits going to those people who least \nneed it, and what is the tradeoff? The tradeoff is what is \nunacceptable. This is a budget without a soul.\n  Mr. President, we had an amendment that would have at least restored \nthe $5 billion in investment in dilapidated school infrastructure. It \nwas voted down. Why are we doing tax cuts for wealthy people and we are \nunwilling to invest in rebuilding our schools?\n  Mr. President, I had an opportunity to go to Delta, MS. I visited a \nschool. There is going to be some renovation now, but the ceiling was \njust practically caving in. The toilets were so decrepit, no child \nshould ever have to go into a bathroom like this. You could not wash \nyour hands after going to the bathroom because there was no running \nwater in the sink.\n  Now, that is not just in the South. These schools exist in the North \nand the Midwest and the West. These are the schools that too many of \nour children go to every day. And we did not invest one penny in \nrebuilding these schools for America's children, for some of the \npoorest children in America. I just think that this is unacceptable. \nAnd I think that this budget is a budget without a soul.\n  Mr. President, we have talked so much about early childhood \ndevelopment, and we have been reading all these reports, all the \nneuroscience evidence. It is so compelling. The evidence is irreducible \nand irrefutable that if we do not invest in the nutrition--and I could \ntalk about each one of these areas at great length--if we do not invest \nin the health care, if we do not invest in really good child care, \nreally good child care, if we do not get it right for these children, \nthat by age 3 they are not going to be ready for school and they will \nnever be ready for life.\n  Mr. President, with all due respect, what are we doing with cuts in \ncapital gains and estate taxes, disproportionately going to the very \ntop of the population, not even targeting that, and at the same time we \nmake a pittance--I am sorry--a pittance of investment when it comes to \nthe most critical years that affect whether children are going to do \nwell in education, and those are in the very early years?\n  We have White House conferences that talk about the development of \nthe brain. We have speeches that are given. And yet, when it comes to \nwhere the rubber meets the road, when it comes to what are our \npriorities, we have a budget agreement here that does not make the \ninvestment in these children, does not make the investment in early \nchildhood development, barely scratches the surface. It is not even a \nbaby step.\n  How much longer are these children going to have to wait? Everybody \nkeeps talking about how we have to balance the budget for the sake of \nour children, our children's future. How about these children right \nnow? And let us go ahead and balance the budget. But, first of all, why \ndo we have these tax cuts that go to some of our wealthiest citizens? \nWhy are we backloading it? Why are we eroding our revenue base? Why are \nwe building here a straitjacket which will prevent us from making any \nof these investments in rebuilding rotting schools, in health and \nnutrition and child care for children at a very early age?\n  This is a budget without a soul. I think this budget as a blueprint \nfor our country is a profound mistake. It is a profound mistake for \nAmerica.\n\n  Mr. President, one final point because I promised to be brief. I \ncould go on and on, but I have spoken on these issues before.\n  There was a cut in this budget--and really, it was not very well \npublicized--in veterans health care, $2.3 or $2.7 billion. I just want \nto make it very clear to my colleagues that when we got briefings from \nthe White House--and everywhere else nobody talked about this. We had a \nflat-line budget we were worried about, but $2.3 or $2.7 billion--a \ncouple different figures are out there--over the next 5 years in \nveterans health care.\n  Dr. Ken Kizer, who runs those health care programs, was out in \nMinnesota. He did not know about it. I do not think Secretary Jesse \nBrown knows about it. And I will tell you something, the veterans \norganizations, all of the organizations I know that I have had the \nhonor of working with, are really indignant about this. They are angry \nnot only about the substance of it, but also the manner in which it was \ndone. So I will have an amendment and I certainly hope my colleagues \nwill join me to restore that funding for veterans health care. I think \nit is critically important.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude. I do not understand why we have \naccepted this tradeoff of tax cuts disproportionately benefiting the \npeople on the top, not even targeting them to middle income or small \nbusinesses, and at the same time not investing in rebuilding our \nschools, not investing in early childhood development, not investing in \nmaking sure that every child has a head start, not investing adequately \nin veterans health care.\n  I just think that this tradeoff is unacceptable. Yes, let us have an \nagreement. But what is the price? The price of this agreement is that \nwe have, as a Senate, I think--I know some colleagues disagree with me, \nI know many do, I know most do--I think we have abandoned a principle \nthat has been so important to our country. I think it has been a \nprinciple which, in many ways, has led to our resilience as a nation.\n  It is a principle that has to do with the very meaning of our Nation, \nit is the principle of justice, it is the principle of expanding \nopportunities for our citizens, and it is that American dream that \nevery child--no matter color of skin, no matter income, no matter boy \nor girl, no matter urban or rural, --that every child will have the \nsame chance to reach his or her full potential. We have not met that \nstandard in\n\n[[Page S5332]]\n\nthis budget agreement. We are nowhere near that standard. That is why, \nagain, I will vote no.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I want to begin by commending our colleagues from New \nMexico and from New Jersey, Senator Domenici and Senator Lautenberg, \nfor their herculean efforts on this budget process. This is a very \ndifficult task.\n  I had--I say guardedly--the privilege of serving on the Budget \nCommittee for a number of years, and it is more of a sentence than a \nduty in many ways, considering the laborious task day in and day out of \ngoing through the number-crunching process. I feel a special sense of \nappreciation for the work of those who serve on the committee, and for \nthose who lead the committee in the case of the chairman and the \nranking Democratic member.\n  I would like to take a few moments if I could to discuss just one \naspect of this budget resolution, one that has already been addressed \nby Senator Lautenberg, the ranking Democratic member of the committee. \nIt is a provision that started out as a rather innocuous suggestion \nthat was adopted unanimously by this body as part of the budget \nresolution and then became the source, Mr. President, of some \ncontroversy over the last several days. But the issue has been \nresolved, due to the efforts of Senator Lautenberg, Senator Domenici \nand others, to the satisfaction of everyone, including the author of \nthe original provision, and that is myself.\n  The budget agreement, as we all know, was reached by the President \nand the Congress and includes a number of provisions designed to \nprotect the priorities that Americans care about while ensuring that \nthe budget would reach balance in the year 2002 and thereafter.\n  One of the stipulations of the budget agreement specified that the \ncost of the tax cuts would be a net $85 billion over 5 years and a net \n$250 billion, one-quarter of a trillion dollars, over 10 years. There \nwas a letter, in fact, signed by the majority leader of the Senate, Mr. \nLott, and the Speaker of the House, Speaker Gingrich, and sent to the \nPresident. I quote it here: ``It was agreed that the net tax cut shall \nbe $85 billion through the year 2002 and not more than $250 billion \nthrough the year 2007.''\n  As I say, this letter was signed by both leaders. I was surprised, \nhowever, Mr. President, when the budget resolution came to the floor \nmore than 2 weeks ago with no mention whatever of the cost of the tax \ncuts over 10 years. The resolution fulfilled the first part of the \nagreement by instructing the tax-writing committees to craft \nlegislation that would cost no more than $85 billion over the first \nfive years. But when it came to the understanding on the $250 billion, \nthat had been left out of the resolution, entirely. That is a large \namount indeed, a quarter of a trillion dollars.\n  Mr. President, in my view, again, I think this budget resolution is a \ngood resolution. I offered amendments to shift some of the priorities \nhere. I lost in that effort. I wish we had done more in the area of \nearly childhood development, Healthy Start, Head Start, child care. I \nwill still make those arguments from time to time. But there are \nimprovements clearly in many important areas of this budget.\n  Even though I disagreed in part with it, I think it is a good \nresolution. But the provisions on tax cuts left me with a great deal of \nconcern because you could write the tax cut part of this budget \nresolution, much of which I agree with, in such a way that for the \nfirst 5 years the revenue losses would be limited to $85 billion. But \nwe all know how to write these in such a way that the second 5 years \nthey could blow totally out of proportion and we end up where we were \nin the mid-1980s, again looking at a huge deficit. I might add that \neven with my language, there is no guarantee that that will not happen \nafter 10 years. But at least over the first 10 years with the agreement \nwe have reached here, we are left with an assurance that that is not \ngoing to happen in the short term, and future Congresses will have an \nopportunity to examine how these tax cuts are working.\n  So this new language that will be included in the agreement, I think, \nwill be a major step forward.\n  I should tell my colleagues what happened procedurally. My amendment \nto put in place a cap of $250 billion over 10 years was accepted on a \nvoice vote. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico and my colleague \nfrom New Jersey agreed with the amendment. It was adopted. In fact, \nSenator Lautenberg enthusiastically supported the amendment. It ended \nup in conference, but there was no similar language in the House \nversion. But then John Spratt, the distinguished Congressman from South \nCarolina, went to the floor on the House side and instructed the House \nconferees that my amendment should be adopted. To the credit of many of \nthe Republican Members of the House, as well as Democrats, they agreed \nwith John Spratt. So he carried overwhelmingly in a House vote to \naccept my amendment.\n  So we were left with a situation where the House instructed conferees \nto take the amendment that had been accepted on a voice vote here, but \nfor reasons that I will allow them to explain, the majority decided on \nour side that they could not continue to hold this amendment. Instead, \nthey offered a compromise. That was a sense-of-the-Congress resolution \nthat would limit the tax cut to $250 billion over 10 years, and require \nthat the Joint Tax Committee and others would certify that we had not \nbroken that ceiling of $250 billion over 10 years. In addition, a \nletter has been signed by our colleagues Senator Roth, the chair of the \nFinance Committee, and Congressman Archer, chairman of the Ways and \nMeans committee. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Roth \nand Archer letter be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Senate Budget Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John R. Kasich,\n     Chairman, House Budget Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pete and John: Our Committees will soon begin marking \n     up tax legislation to meet the reconciliation directives of \n     the 1998 Budget Resolution. We will meet the Resolution's \n     instructions of reducing revenues by $85 billion over the \n     five year period 1998-2002 and by no more than $20.5 billion \n     in 2002.\n       Furthermore, we can assure you that, consistent with the \n     May 15, 1997 letter from the Speaker of the House and the \n     Majority Leader of the Senate to the President which stated, \n     ``It was agreed that the net tax cut shall be $85 billion \n     through 2002 and not more than $250 billion through 2007,'' \n     the ten year net revenue loss in the tax reconciliation bill \n     will not exceed $250 billion.\n           Sincerely,\n     William V. Roth,\n       Chairman, Finance Committee.\n     Bill Archer,\n       Chairman, Ways and Means Committee.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Let me read from that letter:\n\n       Furthermore, we can assure you that, consistent with the \n     May 15, 1997 letter from the Speaker of the House and the \n     Majority Leader of the Senate to the President which stated, \n     ``It was agreed that the net tax cut shall be $85 billion \n     through 2002 and not more than $250 billion through 2007,'' \n     the 10-year net revenue loss will not exceed $250 billion.\n\n  This language confirms the agreement made by the President, the \nSenate, and the Congress, as well as the sense-of-the-Congress \nresolution and the certification.\n  Some may argue you have given up, it is not exactly law. I do not see \nit that way. I am satisfied people have made their commitments, and \nthose commitments have been confirmed. This letter has been signed by \nthe two chairs of the committee, and that ought to be satisfactory \nenough for people that we mean what we say in these resolutions. What \ngood is it going to be to have a budget in balance by the year 2002 \nthat goes immediately out of balance in 2003 because we did not keep an \neye on the tax expenditure side of this equation?\n  So, with this new language that Senator Lautenberg and Senator \nDomenici worked on here, I am very satisfied this is a good resolution. \nI believe that those of us who have been concerned that this \nresolution, while balanced in the initial stages, could end up out of \nbalance very quickly, have seen our concerns eased by this progress.\n  So I want to thank once again the leadership of Senator Lautenberg,\n\n[[Page S5333]]\n\nSenator Domenici, Senator Roth and Congressman Archer, as well as \nCongressman Spratt, for their work in this regard, and lastly just \npoint out, Mr. President, I know that there are legitimate issues that \nhave been raised by those who say, ``Well, what happens in the second \n10 years? You can craft the tax expenditure provisions so they could \nend up pushing us out of balance in the second 10 years.'' I cannot \nargue with that. That could happen. We will have to look at it very \nclosely. Obviously, the economy could change dramatically in 10 years. \nWe may have to come back and revisit parts of this.\n  So there are no reassurances for the second 10 and there are those \nwho will lay out for you scenarios that show there is significant \nballooning, if you will, of those tax cuts in the second 10 years. We \nmay have to come back and revisit that. But by putting in the net cap \nof $250 billion over the next 10 years, I think we have done a great \ndeal to avoid the kind of problem that occurred in the early 1980's \nwhen no such caps were put in place and we saw as a result of the 1981 \ntax program a major deficit created in this country.\n  I voted against that 16 years ago. I am glad I did. I think I was \nproven correct by what happened. I think we have avoided any likelihood \nof that occurring, certainly in the short run, here, and we will have \nplenty of opportunities in the Congress to respond if for whatever \nreason that begins to happen later on.\n  I thank the leadership and my colleague from New Mexico and the \nSenator from New Jersey for this agreement and look forward to \nsupporting the resolution.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Budget Resolution assumes reductions \nin spending of $290 billion over the next 5 years. To accomplish this \ngoal we, of course, must adopt changes in federal programs.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee has received reconciliation \ninstructions requiring $4.8 billion in savings over a 5-year period be \nobtained from programs under our committee's jurisdiction. Most of this \ncommittee's programs involve Federal employees and retirees.\n  In March, the President sent his budget proposal to Congress in which \nhe recommended $6.5 billion in savings from Federal employee and \nretiree benefit programs. Included in the President's proposal was $1.7 \nbillion to be saved by delaying annual cost-of-living adjustments for \nFederal retirees. As chairman of the Subcommittee with jurisdiction \nover this subject I opposed that proposal, and so did the chairman of \nthe full Committee, Senator Fred Thompson.\n  The President's Federal employee-related proposal had four basic \ncomponents:\n  First, the President proposed delaying the receipt of civilian \nFederal retiree cost-of-living adjustments from January until April \nthrough the year 2002, which would have cost the typical Federal \nretiree $726 over the next 5 years.\n  I thought the proposal was unfair since it singled out Federal \ncivilian retirees for this change. No other group of retirees was \ntreated this way.\n  Most Federal retirees are not wealthy people. Most are like other \nAmericans who have retired from private sector jobs and are just barely \nmaking ends meet. The average yearly income for a Federal retiree--\nafter taxes and out-of-pocket costs of health care and life insurance \npremiums--is $14,864. This hardly allows for a comfortable lifestyle, \nconsidering the average Federal retiree faces annual living costs of \n$22,098.\n  Our subcommittee opposed the singling out of Federal civilian \nretirees for a COLA delay, and this position was adopted by \nGovernmental Affairs Committee Chairman Thompson in his Annual Views \nand Estimates report submitted to the Senate Budget Committee. I was \nvery pleased that Budget Chairman Domenici agreed with us and not the \nPresident.\n  Second, the President's budget also assumed a savings starting in \nJanuary 1999 be achieved by requiring employees to pay a greater share \nof their health care premiums.\n  Under current law, the Government pays, on average, 71 percent of the \npremiums of the health insurance plans in which Federal employees and \nretirees enroll. That calculation is based on 60 percent of the average \npremium of the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program's Big Six health \ninsurance plans.\n  In 1990, Aetna--one of the Big Six high-option plans--dropped out of \nthe Federal Employee Health Benefit Program. In order to prevent \nenrollees' share of the premium from rising, Congress enacted \nlegislation establishing a proxy plan. The President's budget proposal \nallowed for the expiration of the proxy plan, thereby shifting \napproximately $4 billion of health care premium costs from the \nGovernment to the employee over 5 years.\n  The Federal Employee Health Benefit Program, unlike Medicare, is not \nfacing a fiscal crisis. In fact, it works so well, I believe we should \nuse it as a model for future health care reform. However, I do not \nthink the President's willingness to simply accept conversion to a Big \nFive-based formula by default, thereby lowering the government's share \nof the premium to about 67 percent, is equitable. Doing so would not \nonly shift substantial costs to enrollees but it would allow for the \ncontinued use of an outdated formula. As subcommittee chairman, I \nintend to propose a new formula-- possibly based on a weighted average \nof all plans--which will maintain the current rate of contributions to \nthe FEHB plans by the government and its employees.\n\n  Regardless of any change in the FEHBP formula, it is possible health \ninsurance premiums will increase over the next year due to medical \ninflation and federally mandated increases in basic coverage. Congress \nshould not aggravate the situation by shifting an additional $4 billion \nin costs onto enrollees.\n  Third, the President's budget plan also increased Federal agency \ncontributions to the retirement fund for civil service retirement \nsystem employees by 1.51 percent beginning October 1, 1997 and ending \nSeptember 30, 2002. Currently, agencies match employee contributions of \napproximately 7 percent.\n  Fourth, the President recommended an increase in Federal employee \nretirement contributions--0.25 percent of base pay in 1999, another \n0.15 percent in 2000, and a final 0.10 percent in 2001--adding up to a \ntotal of 0.50 percent increase. The higher contribution rate would \nexpire on December 31, 2002.\n  I believe the President's proposed Federal employee budget package \ngoes far beyond fairness. President Clinton has advocated a \ndisproportionate contribution by those who have been asked to give \nagain and again over the past several years. Federal employees and \nretirees across the country know there is no justification for the \nPresident's proposed package of changes--and it does not serve the \ninterest of fairness to the Federal workforce.\n  The Federal Government may be the largest employer in the Nation, but \nit is far from being a model employer. You might ask, what is the \nFederal Government offering its workforce in order to attract and \nretain qualified personnel who can respond to the challenges of \nproviding efficient, effective service to the American people? Federal \nemployees have witnessed the slow erosion of their pay and benefit \npackage over the last several years.\n  Because of the requirements of the budget resolution some changes \nmust be adopted. As we work toward the goal of achieving the $4.8 \nbillion in savings required of our committee, Federal employees will \nhave to share the burden of deficit reduction, but they will not be \nsingled out to accept burdens not imposed upon other Americans.\n  Without question, public employees play an important role in our \nsociety. The hope is that by offering a balanced and fair compensation \npackage, we can continue to attract and retain a talented and skilled \nworkforce to deliver federal services. The reconciliation package which \nI will work to develop will have that as a goal as well as deficit \nreduction.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the conference report on \nthe budget resolution and to say that I am pleased that this year is \nshaping up to be a historic year in the fight to balance the budget. \nDemocrats and Republicans have worked together to fashion a bipartisan \nagreement that is projected to balance the unified budget in 5 years, \nin the year 2002.\n  I will support this budget plan because it will help maintain the \nsuperb\n\n[[Page S5334]]\n\neconomy we are now enjoying. The budget plan will build on the 1993 \ndeficit reduction bill, which has cut the unified budget deficit by 77 \npercent. The budget plan also makes room for priorities that are \nimportant to the American people, such as middle-class tax relief, \ngreater funding for education, more attention to our environment, and \nhealth care for the young and the elderly.\n  We have been able to agree on a balanced, commonsense package--one \nthat avoids extreme cuts to programs that Americans depend on and \nincludes some tax cuts. This agreement is balanced because it builds on \nthe economic gains that America has made since 1992.\n\n\n                      the best economy in 30 years\n\n  We need to remember how far we have come since 1992, when this \ncountry was in the depths of a recession. In the past 5 years, we have \nhad so much economic growth and so little inflation that the experts \nare describing today's economy as the best in 30 years. Let me briefly \ndescribe some of these gains--gains that have made a budget agreement \npossible today.\n  Unemployment has fallen from 7.5 percent in 1992 to an annual rate of \n4.9 percent. The last time unemployment was at 4.9 percent or less, it \nwas 1973.\n  For the first 3 months of this year, inflation ran at an annual rate \nof 1.8 percent. The last time inflation was this low, it was 1965.\n  The economy has created 12.5 million jobs since President Clinton was \nfirst inaugurated.\n  There were nearly 1.5 million housing starts in 1996, the most since \n1988.\n  The economy grew at an annualized rate of 5.6 percent in the first \nquarter of this year. This is truly a stunning rate of growth at this \npoint in our economic recovery.\n  The economy has responded beautifully to the economic plan that \nSenate Democrats passed in 1993--without one Republican vote. The \nmeasure of our achievement is that today's economy is the best economy \nAmerica has had in 30 years.\n\n\n                building on democratic deficit reduction\n\n  However, the 1993 bill didn't just spark our economy into recovery. \nIt also cut the unified deficit by 77 percent.\n  Let's recall when the real heavy lifting occurred with respect to \ndeficit reduction. It was only Democrats who voted for President \nClinton's deficit reduction bill in 1993. And what has that bill done \nto the deficit since? The unified deficit has fallen dramatically, from \n$290 billion in 1992, to $255 billion in 1993, to $203 billion in 1994, \nto $164 billion in 1995, and $107 billion last year.\n  Most importantly, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the \ndeficit for 1997 will be only $67 billion.\n  That's a cut of 77 percent in the unified deficit. Under President \nClinton, for the first time since the Civil War, we will slash the \ndeficit 5 years in a row.\n  Let's put it another way. The budget plan we are voting on today will \nprovide $204 billion in deficit reduction over the next 5 fiscal years. \nIn contrast, the 1993 bill provided 5 times that amount of deficit \nreduction. If you compare the actual deficits for fiscal years 1994 to \n1998 to what CBO in 1993 expected those deficits to be, you realize \nthat the 1993 bill achieved $922 billion in deficit reduction for the \nyears 1994 to 1998.\n\n  Let's put it yet another way. If you calculate the improvements in \nthe deficit from 1994 through 2002, you realize that the 1993 bill cut \nfuture deficits by $2.4 trillion. Again, if we do get to a balanced \nbudget in 2002, Democrats will have done the heavy lifting.\n  So there's some justice, Mr. President, in the fact that this \nbalanced budget deal contains Democratic priorities and protects \nDemocratic programs that Americans depend on. We today are standing on \nthe shoulders of the Democratic Members of Congress who voted to cut \nthe deficit in 1993.\n\n\n               budget plan protects America's priorities\n\n  Besides the economic record of the past 5 years and the dramatic \ndeficit reduction that Democrats have achieved, the third thing that \nmakes this agreement possible is that it allocates resources to the \npriorities that the American people care about: education, the \nenvironment, health care, and middle-class tax relief.\n  On education, this budget plan includes the President's budget \nproposal for Head Start, which puts us on the road to enrolling 1 \nmillion children in Head Start in 2002. Only 714,000 kids were enrolled \nin 1993. In addition, the budget would fund a child literacy \ninitiative. The more we learn about education and child development, \nthe more we realize that early intervention is vital to enabling a \nchild to gain the skills and knowledge that are vital in today's \neconomy. That's why Head Start and the literacy initiative are so \nimportant to our Nation's future.\n  At the higher education end, this budget would fund the largest Pell \nGrant increase in two decades. Four million students could receive \ngrants of $3,000 a year, which is $300 higher than the current annual \ngrant. The plan also includes $35 billion worth of higher education tax \ncuts, including a credit and a deduction. In total, this will be the \nlargest increase in higher education funding since the G.I. Bill in \n1945. These resources are sorely needed today. As every American knows, \ncollege costs have been spiraling upwards, putting college out of reach \nfor too many families. I am pleased that this budget plan will address \nthis issue.\n  The budget plan will also devote resources to preserving our \nenvironment. This agreement would provide $3.4 billion in 1998 for the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, which is a 9 percent increase over \nlast year's level, for its research and enforcement work to protect the \npublic from environmental threats. The agreement would enable the \nexpansion of the Brownfields Redevelopment Initiative to help \ncommunities clean up and redevelop contaminated areas. And it could \ndouble the pace of Superfund cleanups, leading to 500 additional sites \nbeing cleaned up by the year 2000.\n  With respect to health care, this budget plan is a marked departure \nfrom the extreme budget plans we saw here in the Senate back in 1995. \nIn 1995 the majority tried to slash $270 billion from Medicare in order \nto provide $240 billion in tax cuts for the rich. Fortunately that plan \nnever became law. This bipartisan agreement would cut projected \nMedicare spending by $100 billion over the next 5 years, but those cuts \nwill largely come from health care providers. And these savings will \nextend the life of the Medicare trust fund for at least a decade. The \nagreement would also provide 4 major new preventive Medicare benefits: \nmammography, colorectal screening, diabetes self-management and \nvaccinations. What a far cry this plan is from the plan 2 years ago.\n  I would also like to mention that the budget plan contains a major \nnew initiative to provide health care for kids. It would provide $16 \nbillion over the next 5 years to cover 5 million children. This \ncoverage will take the form of either improvements to Medicaid or a new \nmandatory grant program to the States in order to supplement their \nefforts to cover uninsured children in working families.\n  Lastly, I remain hopeful that this budget agreement will cut taxes \nfor America's hard-working families. We do not know the details of the \nproposed tax legislation yet, but the Republican leadership has assured \nus that the tax bill will include a $500-per-child tax credit to make \nit easier for families to raise their kids. It will contain $35 billion \nin higher education tax credits to make college more affordable. It \nwill expand the tax advantages of individual retirement accounts.\n  I have some concerns about the eventual shape of the tax bill, but \nthis budget plan does not specify the distribution of the tax cuts. It \ndoes not specify the details of the estate tax or capital gains tax \ncuts. Those details may well be controversial. But I will wait to see \nthe tax bill before I make that judgment.\n\n\n                    further deficit reduction needed\n\n  Besides the eventual shape of the tax cuts, I want to raise one other \nconcern about this budget plan. Many of my colleagues are describing \nthis budget as a balanced-budget agreement, and indeed it does balance \nthe unified budget, as I have said. However, as I made clear during the \ndebate on the balanced budget amendment, I do not think the unified \nbudget accurately portrays our fiscal situation. This budget plan is \nprojected to balance the unified budget, but the unified budget counts \nthe Social Security surplus, which is estimated to be $104 billion in \n2002, in order to reduce the deficit.\n\n[[Page S5335]]\n\n  Congress has recognized that it is not appropriate for us to count \nthe Social Security surplus in this way. And we have said so in the \nlaw. Section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 forbids us \nfrom doing it. So if you look at the text of this conference report, \nwhich is about the only place where we actually observe section 13301, \nyou will find a revealing statistic. The conference report lists the \nprojected budget deficits in each fiscal year. And guess what? In 2002, \nif you take out the Social Security trust fund surplus, we will have a \ndeficit of $108 billion.\n  So, Mr. President, in my view the Congress still has some deficit \nreduction left to do if we are to truly balance the budget. And I am \npleased that the final version of the budget plan contains my \namendment, which the Senate approved when I offered it here 2 weeks \nago. My amendment simply says that we should continue to work to reduce \nthe true deficit, so that we can balance the budget without relying on \nthe Social Security trust fund.\n\n\n                          a balanced agreement\n\n  However, Mr. President, I do not intend to make the perfect enemy of \nthe good in our budgeting. In general, I believe this budget agreement \nmeets America's expectations and addresses America's priorities. That \nis why I will vote for it, and why I will work to see the budget deal \nimplemented this summer in a way that carries out the bipartisan \nagreement that we have achieved this spring.\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as we are now within 1,000 days \nof the new millennium, we need to begin to think about what our Nation \nshould look like in the next 1,000 years. For in the last 1,000 years \nwe have discovered new continents and new planets, we have conquered \ndeadly diseases and created new technology. As we stand at the \nthreshold of the next century we need to take the steps to prepare the \nFederal Government and all Americans for the path that lies ahead.\n  This budget resolution is based on principles which are reasonable, \ncredible, solution-oriented, and are based on common sense. It is \nbecause of those principles, Mr. President, that I rise today to \nsupport this bipartisan balanced budget resolution. For today we begin \nthe process to bring fiscal security and greater economic opportunity \nto our children.\n  For over 25 years, the Federal Government has been unable to balance \nthe budget. We now owe more than $5.3 trillion. Therefore, we spend \nover $900 million on interest every day. We send more to our \nbondholders in 3 days than we do to every man, woman, and child in \nVermont over the course of an entire year.\n  The interest payment on our national debt is five and half times more \nthan we spend on all education, job training, and employment programs \ncombined. If one was to ask the question what should be the Federal \npriorities of this Nation? Should we spend more money on education for \nthe future of this Nation, or more money on interest? Well, it is clear \nwhat our choice would be--education. Yet, we have precisely reversed \nour priorities because we have been imprudent with our fiscal policy.\n  Balancing the budget is what we need to do to ensure a brighter \nfuture for America. Lower interest rates will allow American families \nto purchase their first home, send a child to college, and buy a new \nautomobile. The real benefits of a balanced budget will be realized in \nthe increased standard of living for each American family.\n  Mr. President I would now like to take a moment to speak about some \nof the provisions in this agreement.\n  Medicare serves a 37.5 million elderly and disabled individuals in \nthis country. For several years the trustees of the Medicare program \nhave continued to send notice to Capitol Hill that steps needed to be \ntaken or this program will go bankrupt. This budget resolution keeps \nthis program solvent for the next 10 years. We now can take the steps \nto make fundamental changes to preserve and strengthen Medicare for the \ncurrent recipients and future generations.\n  Through the effort of several of my colleagues, children's health was \nput in the forefront during these first few months of the 105th \nCongress. Senators came up with different proposals due to one \nfundamental thing--the need to provide health insurance to the \nestimated 10 million low income children. I commend both the \nadministration and the leadership for realizing the importance of this \nissue and to providing the needed resources for these children.\n  In many families today, both parents need to work in order to get by. \nThey work in order to give their children a chance at a better future. \nDinner tables in the past were filled with lively conversation. \nConversation centering on discussions of values and goals and the other \nimportant issues which bring a family together. These tables are now \nsilent. Empty tables due to the fact parents come home from work just \ntoo tired.\n  It is time for we in Congress to take some steps to provide relief \nfor the American family. The tax reduction package is not going to \nsolve all the problems that each family faces in this country. But what \nit will do is leave some additional dollars in the pockets of our hard-\nworking Americans in order for them to spend those funds on their \nfamily needs. As a member of the Finance Committee, I look forward to \nworking with Chairman Roth on the specific provisions dealing with tax \nrelief.\n  One of the reasons I first got involved in public service was to make \na difference in the educational system of our Nation. As chairman of \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee I feel that it is important \nthat we continue to improve our school system. We have all read stories \nabout children who go to class but just don't learn. Each day is a lost \nopportunity to shape and prepare these children for the future. A \ngeneration is leaving high school unable to meet the challenges that \nlay ahead.\n  When a high school graduate is unable to read, what we find is that \nwe sent an individual into the world who will live a life of missed \nopportunities. Every year America becomes a more technological country. \nDistances which used to be measured in the time it took for a plane \ntravel across this country are now measured in the time it takes for a \nsignal to be bounced off a satellite. Children need to graduate from \nhigh school not just able to read but to understand the changing nature \nof the workplace.\n  Over my many years in Congress, I have championed educational \nopportunities for our children. This budget provides additional funding \nfor programs that will help students throughout this Nation prepare for \nthe future. Even though, for every dollar of increased spending for \ncertain specific programs, this budget has made a $15 reduction in \nspending. Today we begin to prepare our students with greater \neducational opportunities and our Federal Government will lower deficit \nspending, both which will help meet the demands of a global economy.\n  Mr. President, in closing, the American people in 1996 sent a message \nto our Nation's Capital. They wanted an administration and Congress of \ndifferent political parties to work together to solve common problems. \nThough this agreement is not perfect, and there are some in this \nChamber that feel that we have gone too far and some who feel we have \nnot gone far enough, it is an important step forward. This is not a \nbudget based on party, or one that was written exclusively in the Halls \nof Congress or in the Oval Office, this is a budget of compromise. This \nis a first step toward a new millennium. A time where America is going \nto need the ability to meet the challenges that lie ahead.\n  I want to commend Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici and \nMajority Leader Lott for their determination, their hard work, and \ntheir vision in putting together this historic budget resolution. This \nis the first step to ensure a brighter tomorrow for our nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport on the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution, which puts us on a \npath to a balanced budget by the year 2002. As a member of the Budget \nCommittee, I am proud to have been a part of the process that created \nthis agreement. While I recognize that it is not perfect and that the \nreal work is still ahead of us, I still believe that it represents a \nlegitimate and fair plan to ensure that we achieve a balanced budget.\n  This agreement builds on the historic and successful deficit \nreduction package enacted in 1993, which resulted in a\n\n[[Page S5336]]\n\nreal reduction in the Federal deficit. This 1993 package not only \nbrought the deficit down from a high of $290 billion in 1992 to an \nestimated $70 billion for 1997, but it has achieved real economic \ngrowth and expansion.\n  The agreement before us today is another step in making sure that our \nfiscal house is in order. Developing this agreement was not an easy \ntask, and required some tough choices, but the bipartisan approach \nsucceeded.\n  Throughout the process, significant improvements were made to the \noriginal agreement. I believe that some of these improvements are \nessential to protecting the integrity of the agreement. I am pleased \nthat most of these improvements remained in agreement throughout the \nconference process.\n  One of these improvements is an amendment that I offered to ensure \nthat in meeting the deficit reduction target for Medicaid, the \nauthorizing committees will not look to a per-capita cap as a mechanism \nfor savings or for controlling future spending. I believe that this was \nan important message to send; a per-capita cap is not an acceptable \nmechanism for controlling Medicaid costs and could seriously jeopardize \nthe quality of care for millions of children, senior citizens, and the \ndisabled.\n  Along these same lines, I was pleased to join with my colleague from \nMissouri, Senator Bond, in support of an amendment that expresses the \nsense of the Senate, that any changes in the Medicaid disproportionate \nshare hospital payments not jeopardize the ability of hospitals, \nespecially children's hospitals to serve the most neediest and the most \nvulnerable. We have to be absolutely sure that the numbers do not drive \nthe policy. If savings can be achieved through reforming DSH without \njeopardizing access to quality health care for the most needy than \nthese policy changes should be considered. But, if the motive is simply \na number and develop the policy around the cut, than this is \nunacceptable.\n\n  Working with my good friend from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, we \nwere successful in including the family violence option amendment to \nthe Senate resolution. This amendment simply recognizes the need to \nproperly clarify the ability of the States to include a family violence \noption as part of their welfare reform plans without facing any \npenalty. During Senate debate on welfare reform in the 104th Congress, \nSenator Wellstone and I included this option as guidance to the States. \nUnfortunately, there is now some dispute as to congressional intent. \nThe family violence option amendment that Mr. Wellstone and I offered \nto the budget resolution is intended to address this confusion. The \namendment is simple: It allows the States to waive work or training \nrequirements for victims of domestic violence and abuse without being \nforced to count these individuals as part of the 20 percent hardship \nexemption. Proper implementation of a family violence option guarantees \nthat women who have been victims of domestic violence or abuse do not \nbecome victims of welfare reform. Placing barriers to welfare simply \nmeans that these women and their children are trapped in a violent and \nin some cases, life threatening environment. For many, welfare is the \nonly way to escape the violence.\n  While I believe that this agreement is a major step forward, I am \ndeeply concerned that efforts already underway would ignore the \nagreement. In developing the reconciliation bills, we must adhere to \nthe goals and principles of this agreement. I am hopeful that there \nwill be no effort to ignore the policy assumptions in this agreement. \nWe must also be absolutely sure that any tax cut proposal is fiscally \nsound and does not explode the deficit. Not only would this be \nunethical, but it would be economically foolish.\n  I want to thank both Chairman Domenici and Senator Lautenberg for \ntheir efforts in bringing this conference report together and for \nworking with me to improve the final agreement.\n\n\n                      children's health initiative\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to clarify for the \nrecord, a procedural point in the budget resolution. The budget \nresolution conference report currently before the Senate includes \nlanguage which would permit the chairman of the Budget Committee, with \nthe concurrence of the ranking member, to revise the reconciliation \ninstructions to the Finance Committee and to adjust other budget \nresolution levels in amounts which are intended to reflect the \nchildren's health initiative. In this regard, I would direct the \nattention of our colleagues to the children's health section of the \nbipartisan budget agreement, which provides that the $16 billion in \nfunding ``could be used for one or both of Medicaid (provisions) * * * \nand a program of capped mandatory grants to States.'' The agreement \nfurther provides that other possibilities for implementation of the \nchild health initiative may be considered if mutually agreeable. Would \nthe chairman of the committee agree that the budget agreement therefore \nrequires the concurrence of all parties to the agreement--the majority \nand minority in Congress and the President--before other policy options \nmay be considered?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, I concur with the Senator from New Jersey that \nagreement of the President and the majority and minority leadership in \nCongress are necessary to consider children's health options beyond the \nspecified Medicaid and capped mandatory alternatives.\n\n\n                          highway reserve fund\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with \nthe distinguished Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee regarding the \nhighway reserve fund in the conference agreement on H. Con. Res. 84.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I strongly support increased \nFederal infrastructure spending. This budget resolution, while \nproviding for increased transportation spending, does not provide as \nmuch infrastructure spending as I would have liked. During floor \nconsideration of this budget resolution, I offered an amendment to \nprovide for a reserve fund for highways that would allow for increased \nspending on highways above the amounts called for in the budget \nresolution so long as appropriate offsets are found. I believe that, \nonce the Senate begins debate on the reauthorization of the Intermodal \nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act or ISTEA, there will be strong \ninterest on the part of many Members on both sides of the aisle to find \nadditional resources to produce a highway bill that is balanced and \nmeets the transportation needs of all regions of the country. As such, \nI am very pleased that the conference agreement on this budget \nresolution includes a highway reserve fund that is effectively \nidentical to the one provided for in my amendment.\n  I wish to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Budget Committee \nfor his cooperation on this matter and ask if I am correct that the \nmain purpose of this reserve fund is to accommodate higher contract \nauthority and outlays for highway programs if this additional spending \nis offset by direct spending reductions or revenue increases?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, the Senator is correct. We have provided $8.5 \nbillion in outlays above the President's budget request for \ntransportation. Even more critical, the bipartisan budget agreement and \nthis budget resolution has as one of its primary discretionary \nassumptions that Congress will spend all of the highway trust fund \nreceipts over the next 5 years. This will allow for increased highway \nobligations by the Appropriations Committee of $9.3 billion over the \nPresident's budget request for highways between 1998 and 2002.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Chairman also take a moment to describe how the \nreserve fund would be used to create this additional deficit-neutral \nspending for highways?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nfor raising this issue and would be happy to explain the operation of \nthe reserve fund. As the Senator knows, the authority to fund highway \nprograms is split between the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nwhich provides budget authority through contract authority, and the \nAppropriations Committee, which controls outlays of the highway program \nthrough annual obligation limitations.\n  The bifurcated funding nature of these programs made it difficult to \ndesign a reserve fund to allow for additional funding. I appreciate the \nSenator from West Virginia's assistance in crafting the highway reserve \nfund.\n  The highway reserve fund in this resolution has separate components \nto allocate funding from additional savings to the Environment and \nPublic Works\n\n[[Page S5337]]\n\nCommittee for additional contract authority and to the Appropriations \nCommittee for additional outlays for highway programs.\n  The first provides a mechanism to increase budget authority levels in \nthe budget resolution to accommodate additional highway contract \nauthority. If legislation is reported to the Senate, or an amendment is \noffered on the Senate floor, that reduces nonhighway direct spending or \nincreases revenues above the levels contained in the budget resolution, \nthese savings will be made available for highway spending.\n  The savings would be captured by adjusting the budget resolution's \nlevels to ensure these savings are not spent for other programs. Next, \nthe budget authority levels in the resolution would be adjusted upwards \nto accommodate higher contract authority for highways. In order for the \nBudget Committee to determine how to adjust budget authority levels, \nthe provision of the bill or the amendment must either provide the \ncontract authority for highway programs or dedicate the savings in some \nfashion for highway programs.\n  These savings must be either direct spending savings--a reduction in \nmandatory spending--or an increase in revenues. Other changes, such as \na reduction in an authorization of appropriations or the diversion of \nrevenues from the general fund to the highway trust fund, will not \nqualify. In addition, the savings will qualify only if the committee of \njurisdiction from which the savings are found is already within its \nsection 602 ceiling. Savings cannot be used for additional highway \nspending if the Senate committee of jurisdiction has already used such \nsavings to meet its reconciliation targets.\n  The second component of this reserve fund allows for these savings, \nonce they have been enacted, to be reserved for future appropriations \nbills to accommodate additional outlays that would result from an \nincrease in the obligational ceilings for highway programs.\n  When the legislation that generates the direct spending savings or \nrevenue increases is enacted, I, as Budget Committee chairman, will \nsubmit to the Senate a document that will reflect the revisions to the \nbudget resolution levels to ensure these savings are not spent on other \nprograms. This document also would provide the amount on a year-by-year \nbasis of the outlay adjustment that could be made to the discretionary \ncaps for additional highway spending.\n  As with the adjustment for budget authority I have just discussed, \nthese additional savings must be in addition to the budget resolution \nsavings. It is my belief this reserve fund will allow for a deficit-\nneutral way of providing additional infrastructure resources.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chairman. Am I correct then, that an amendment \non the ISTEA reauthorization bill or other legislation that makes the \nnecessary savings and provides additional funding for highways in the \nmanner you have described will not be subject to a Budget Act point of \norder in the Senate?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. The reserve fund ensures that budget \nlevels are adjusted to accommodate such legislation and avoid Budget \nAct points of order for exceeding committee allocations or budget \naggregates.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Chairman for taking the time to \nclarify this very important issue and I look forward to working closely \nwith him to provide additional highway resources for our Nation during \nthe reauthorization of the ISTEA or other legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would inquire of the Senator from New Jersey and the \nranking Democratic Senator for the Budget Committee, as he knows, on a \nvote of 51-49, the Senate passed the Coverdell amendment to the budget \nresolution, increasing aggregate budget authority in the year 2000 by \n$2.539 billion and function 500 budget authority in the year 2000 by \nthe same amount. The stated purpose of the amendment was to permit \nStates and local education agencies to create voucher programs that \nwould take Federal dollars away from public schools and divert those \nFederal dollars to support private schools and religious schools. It is \nmy understanding that the entire Coverdell amendment has now been \ndropped. Is that correct?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is there anything in the budget agreement or this budget \nresolution or the report, that reflects any language similar to the \npurpose of the Coverdell amendment?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No, there is not.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Does the final budget resolution include any of the \nnumbers that were included in the Coverdell amendment?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No, it does not.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for his response. Obviously, any \nsuch voucher program would be highly objectionable because of its \nserious harmful effects on the Nation's public schools. It's the wrong \neducation priority, and I hope it will continue to be rejected by \nCongress and the President.\n\n\n                           Food Stamp Program\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before we pass the final version of the \nbudget resolution, on behalf of myself and the ranking member, Senator \nLautenberg, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee.\n  Mr. President, the final budget resolution contains an unusual \nreconciliation instruction to the Agriculture Committee. Unlike the \nother committee reconciliation instructions, it calls for an increase \nin direct spending of $1.5 billion over 5 years. This instruction is \ndesigned to fulfill the bipartisan budget agreement between the \nPresident, the Speaker of the House, the Senate majority leader and the \nSenate minority leader. These parties agreed to add $1.5 billion in new \nspending for the Food Stamp Program for increased work slots and \nexpanded waiver authority in the jurisdiction of the Agriculture \nCommittee. The specific details of the bipartisan budget agreement can \nbe found on page 89 of the committee print that accompanies Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 27.\n  Mr. President, I would therefore ask the chairman and ranking member \nof the Agriculture Committee about their intentions regarding the \nbipartisan budget agreement's provisions of $1.5 billion in new food \nstamp spending consistent with the details that can be found on page 89 \nof the committee print that accompanies Senate Concurrent Resolution \n27?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would respond to the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee by saying that I intend to work with \nthe ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, to \ncraft a bill that will comply with the bipartisan budget agreement's \nfood stamp provisions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of the \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chairman and ranking member for these \nresponses.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am very pleased to hear the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Agriculture Committee \ncommit to fulfill the bipartisan agreement's food stamp provision.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, section 6005 of the conference agreement \non H.R. 1469 contains a substitute for the original Senate prohibition \non the expenditure of funds to advocate certain policies with respect \nto the recognition, validity, or management of rights of way \nestablished pursuant to section 2477 of the Revised Statutes (43 U.S.C. \n932), more commonly referred to as R.S. 2477.\n  Section 6005 establishes a commission to recommend a long-term \nsolution to the administration and Congress. The commission is \nbipartisan--6 Republicans and 6 Democrats--plus a retired Federal judge \nselected by the other 12 to chair the commission. The commission has \nrepresentatives from the administration, Congress, and the States.\n  The commission is cost effective--the only new cost is the salary of \nthe retired judge. All other members are Federal, State, or \ncongressional employees who would serve on the commission within the \nscope of their existing duties. The Secretary of the Interior is \nresponsible for payment of the chairman's salary and expenses, and for \nproviding, and paying for any necessary staff, office space, and \nexpenses out of existing funds provided for the Department of the \nInterior.\n  Based on concerns raised by the administration, the provision waives \nthe\n\n[[Page S5338]]\n\nFederal Advisory Committee Act to avoid lengthy procedural delays. \nHowever the commission's hearings are open to the public, and a public \nrecord is required to be kept of those hearings. In addition, the \ncommission must keep a record of its deliberations.\n  The commission is tasked with recommending changes in law to \nexpeditiously resolve outstanding right of way claims under R.S. 2477. \nThose recommendations are to be made in consultation with the governors \nof affected States. It is my hope that working together this commission \ncan reach consensus on this difficult issue.\n  This commission must make its recommendations by March 1, 1998, and \nmust include with their submission any comments they receive from \ngovernors. The Secretary of the Interior must approve or disapprove the \nrecommendations in their entirety by March 31, 1998. If the Secretary \napproves the commission's recommendations, then a fast track procedure \nis provided in Congress to ensure those recommendations are considered. \nIf the Secretary does not approve the commission's recommendations, \nthen the fast track procedure is not available. Under the fast track \nprocedure only relevant amendments are allowed in the Senate during \nfloor consideration of the bill, and any message from the House on such \na bill.\n  The conference agreement leaves intact the permanent prohibition on \nthe issuance of final rules or regulations on R.S. 2477 without express \nauthorization of such rules or regulations by a subsequent act of \nCongress, and specifically states in section 6005(b)(5)(A) that this \nprovision does not constitute such express authorization. Section 6005 \ndoes not repeal or modify any existing law, and takes no position \nregarding the legitimacy of the R.S. 2477 policy announced by the \nSecretary of the Interior on January 22, 1997.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, as we finish our work on the \nconference report. I want to express my appreciation to Jodi Grant, who \nhas provided invaluable assistance to me and my staff. Jodi served as \ncounsel to the Democratic staff before leaving us recently to work on \nthe leadership staff of the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kerry. However, she has taken time from her busy schedule to \ngive us the benefit of her special expertise on budget matters. I very \nmuch appreciate her assistance, and thank her for her willingness to \nhelp.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5326-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 1997--\n                           CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are going to vote on the budget \nresolution in just a moment.\n  I want to announce that the House passed the Senate budget resolution \n333 to 99. We passed it 78 to 22.\n  I believe the reason we have not gotten a balanced budget in the past \nis we have not had a President and a Congress in accord. And I think we \nare going to get a balanced budget.\n  In recent years, however, the obstacles to the Federal budget have \nbeen primarily a question of finding a working consensus between the \nExecutive and the Congress. Today we have a consensus on this issue. Of \ncourse, each of us along might have designed the plan differently, but \nthen we might have had a consensus. Yes I personally think we should \nhave done more in entitlement spending programs that still threaten the \nfoundation of this house we build today, but for today we must do what \nwe can to. And I ask you to vote as you did on May 23 and adopt this \nconference agreement.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We yield all the time we had.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the conference \nreport.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nSenate will shortly adjourn over until Monday at noon, 12 o'clock. I \nannounce to all Senators that no votes will occur on Monday prior to \nthe hour of 5 p.m. I expect a lengthy period of morning business on \nMonday to accommodate a number of requests, and I will update the \nDemocratic leader at a later time with respect to potential legislation \nthe Senate may consider on Monday. We have already had one conversation \nabout that, and we will have some more here in a few minutes.\n  Before I consider two housekeeping items, I would like to thank all \nSenators for their cooperation this week. The Senate has now passed a \nbudget resolution outlining a long overdue balanced budget for our \nNation, and I congratulate all those Senators who have participated in \nthe negotiations. Again, I thank Senator Domenici, the chairman of \nBudget Committee, and Senator Lautenberg, who also has worked with us \ngetting through some problems we ran into. They both did an excellent \njob. The Senate also adopted the supplemental appropriations conference \nreport. Consequently, I think this has been a good week, and I hope we \ncan continue that next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5338-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5339-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5339]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT CONCERNING THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY TO THE THREAT POSED BY WEAPONS \n         OF MASS DESTRUCTION--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 45\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 204 of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)) and section 401(c) of the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)), I transmit herewith a 6-month \nreport on the national emergency declared by Executive Order 12938 of \nNovember 14, 1994, in response to the threat posed by the proliferation \nof nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (``weapons of mass \ndestruction'') and of the means of delivering such weapons.\n                                                  William J.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 25\n\n       Whereas, Since its establishment following World War II, \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has played a key role \n     in helping to bring stability to the world. In addition to \n     its strategic significance, NATO has fostered economic and \n     social benefits through increased communications and various \n     programs. This success is built on the commitment of its \n     member nations to ideals of democracy and opposition to \n     oppression; and\n       Whereas, The role that NATO plays in encouraging peace and \n     progress is especially apparent to the Baltic nations of \n     Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The Baltic states, through \n     their individual histories, especially their common \n     experiences in this century, are well aware of the need for \n     unity among people devoted to self-determination. The \n     irreversible commitment to democracy in Estonia, Latvia, and \n     Lithuania is among the many conditions that are the \n     foundation of NATO; and\n       Whereas, While much has changed in Europe over the past \n     decade, there remain many reminders of threats to security in \n     the region. Situations in several areas illustrate the role \n     for NATO and the need for it to include the nations of the \n     Baltic states; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we memorialize the President and the \n     Congress of the United States to work for the admission of \n     Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania into the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-130. A resolution adopted by the House of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky; to the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations.\n\n                            House Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the noble people of Ethiopia have developed and \n     nourished a proud and distinguished culture that has endured \n     for three millennia; and\n       Whereas, Ethiopia has had a long and productive friendship \n     with the United States of America; and\n       Whereas, the people of the United States have responded \n     generously and magnificently to the plight of Ethiopian \n     famine victims through the provision of humanitarian aid; and\n       Whereas, the winds of democratic change have blown \n     dramatically and ferociously across the former Soviet Union, \n     Eastern Europe, Latin America, many parts of Africa, and now \n     to Ethiopia; and\n       Whereas, Ethiopia is poised at a crucial juncture in its \n     history because it is making a regression toward non-\n     democratic one-party rule of Ethiopian People's Revolutionary \n     Democratic Front (EPRDF); and\n       Whereas, the ascendance of the Ethiopian People's \n     Revolutionary Democratic Front and its policy of promoting \n     ethnic federalism have engendered animosity among \n     nationalities of Ethiopia; and\n       Whereas, such governmental policies and practices have \n     contributed to the severity of strained relations in Ethiopia \n     by misdirected bureaucratic cleansing, arbitrary arrest, and \n     detention of the prominent physician professor Asrat Woldeyes \n     and many other prisoners of conscience, recognized as such by \n     Amnesty International and the indigenous Ethiopian Human \n     Rights Council (EHRC); and\n       Whereas, the people of Ethiopia are aspiring to resolve \n     their complicated problems through the formation and \n     utilization of democratic institutions and maximum citizen \n     input; and\n       Whereas, the basic underpinning of democratic institutions \n     in the new Ethiopia should be the supremacy of the will of \n     the people and the guarantee of the rule of the people; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Ethiopian government should adhere to the \n     United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which \n     encourages freedom of speech, assembly, religion, and press, \n     guarantees all basic rights, and discourages ethnocentric \n     politics and ethnic reservations; and\n       Whereas, it is crucial that the diverse voices, opinions, \n     and philosophies of the people be expressed in promoting \n     political, economic, and social progress and justices in \n     Ethiopia; and\n       Whereas,, a multiparty government may be the most \n     egalitarian, feasible, and productive political arrangement \n     in providing suffrage and in overcoming monumental obstacles; \n     and\n       Whereas, the President Bill Clinton and the Congress of the \n     United States will play a crucial role in promoting the \n     peaceful resolution of the immense problems of war ravaged \n     Ethiopia; and\n\n[[Page S5341]]\n\n       Whereas, the implementation of a democratic, multiparty \n     government in Ethiopia should be a long-range foreign policy \n     goal of the United States Government;\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the General \n     Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky:\n       Section 1. That the Honorable House of Representatives \n     continue to encourage the formation of democratic \n     institutions, multiparty participation, progressive social \n     change, and respect for fundamental human rights in Ethiopia, \n     including freedom of association and expression.\n       Section 2. The President and the Congress of the United \n     States should be encouraged to use every possible means at \n     their command to examine the policy, that recognizes and \n     evaluates the political conditions that exist in Ethiopia \n     with a view to ensure the prevention of the shocking \n     brutality of ethnic warfare elsewhere in Africa from \n     spreading to Ethiopia.\n       Section 3.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and \nthe Public Health Service Act to improve the regulation of food, drugs, \ndevices, and biological products, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n the food and drug administration modernization and accountability act \n                                of 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nmodernize the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] and reauthorize the \nPrescription Drug User Fee Act for 5 years. This legislation comes as \nresult of over 3 years of consideration by the Congress on steps that \ncould be taken by the agency that would contribute to its mandate to \nprotect the American public while ensuring that life-saving products \ncould be made more readily available.\n  FDA acknowledges that its mandate also requires it to regulate over \none-third of our Nation's products. Within its purview the FDA \nregulates virtually all of the food and all of the cosmetics, medical \ndevices, and drugs made available to our citizens. I believe, and \nseveral members of the Labor Committee share my belief, that in an \norganization the size of FDA there is always room for improvement and \nmodernization. Our objective, which this legislation achieves, was \nidentify areas where improvements could be made that will strengthen \nthe agency's ability to approve safe and effective products more \nexpeditiously.\n  Last year, both the House and the Senate held numerous and extensive \nhearings on countless proposals for modernizing and reforming the FDA. \nThe Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee successfully reported a \nbipartisan bill that sought to accomplish many of those reforms. But \nlast year, acrimonious issues remained, time ran out and the bill did \nnot receive floor consideration. This year I have resolved to move \nforward. I have been committed to addressing last year's most \ncontroversial issues. I believe that the legislation I am introducing \ntoday addresses virtually all of objections raised last year both in \nprocess and in content. This is a better bill and I believe that upon \nexamination, my colleagues will agree that it accomplishes its goal.\n  I want to comment a moment on the open, consensus-building process we \nfollowed in developing this legislation. The Labor Committee held two \nhearings. During the first the committee received testimony from the \nprincipal FDA Deputy Commissioner, Dr. Michael Friedman, and all of the \nFDA Center Directors. The second hearing included representatives from \npatient and consumer coalitions and from the food, drug, and medical \ndevice sectors regulated by the FDA. Committee members learned from the \nagency of the administrative reforms and the progress it has already \nundertaken, areas that remain a challenge, and those areas that require \nlegislative authority to change. The committee listened to consumers' \nconcerns with provisions that were considered last year that they felt \nwould weaken the FDA's ability to protect the public health. Finally, \nthe committee learned of the ongoing and needless delays and \nfrustrations facing health care and consumer product sectors of our \neconomy in working with the FDA. The committee learned of the \nfrustrated attempts to work through the bureaucratic labyrinth of \nneedless regulatory delays. Delays that prohibited people from getting \naccess to vitally needed, life saving medical treatments, drugs, and \ndevices.\n  Since the finish of the committee's hearings we have engaged in an \nopen, collaborative process that has given voice to each party wishing \nto be heard. For many of these meetings it is worth noting that the \nagency was a full, cooperating participant and we would not have been \nable to make the progress made without FDA's collaboration. Several \nmeetings, essentially roundtable discussions, have occurred with \nbipartisan committee staff, the FDA, and each of the several sectors \nregulated by the agency. These meetings have given all the participants \nan opportunity to discuss problems and potential solutions and have \nbeen the basis for the consensus bill I am introducing today. Finally, \ncommittee staff have had numerous meetings to discuss key provisions in \nthe bill with a wide range of consumer groups including, among others, \nthe Patient Coalition, Public Citizen, the Centers for Science in the \nPublic Interest, the Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and the National \nOrganization for Rare Diseases. It should be clear that no person or \ngroup was excluded from this deliberative process.\n  Let me turn to the content of this measure and the steps we have \ntaken to respond to the controversies raised last year. Five key \nobjections were raised against the FDA reform bill that had been \nreported on a strong bipartisan vote from the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee during the last Congress. In that vein, we have sought to and \nhave accomplished addressing each of the substantive concerns raised by \nthe minority.\n  Last year's measure was criticized by some for the number of \nmandatory, but shortened, product review time frames that critics said \nwould overburden the FDA and for the hammers that would have required \nFDA to contract out some product reviews or to give priority to \nproducts approved abroad. Today's legislation eliminates most of the \nmandatory time frames and retains only those necessary to ensure \ncollaborative, more efficient reviews or to facilitate quick reviews of \nlow risk products. The contracting out and European review hammers that \nwould have forced FDA actions have been eliminated.\n  Last year's provision allowing for third party, outside expert review \nwere criticized for turning central regulatory authority decisions over \nto private industry, creating conflicts of interest, and depriving FDA \nof resources and expertise. Today's legislation adopts FDA's current \nsystem for accrediting and selecting third-party review organizations. \nThe bill expands FDA's current pilot third-party review program beyond \njust the lowest risk devices and FDA retains final approval for all \ndevices. Devices that are life-\n\n[[Page S5343]]\n\nsupporting, life-sustaining, or implantable are excluded from third-\nparty review. FDA may allow third-party review for higher risk devices \nat its sole discretion. This approval will allow FDA to retain, \naugment, and focus its expertise, at its discretion, on critical areas \nof its expanding workload.\n  Last year's bill would have required FDA to contract out review of \nfood additive petitions, medical devices, and drugs. Critics argued \nthese changes would weaken consumer protections. We have modified these \nprovisions to give FDA express authority to contract out when deemed by \nFDA to be more efficient or to add needed expertise.\n  Thsi year the collaborative effort has continued. During our meetings \nFDA identified a number of enforcement powers that the agency believes \nwill enhance its ability to protect the public health. We have included \na number of FDA's specific requests. Many patient and consumer groups \nraised concerns about insufficient safeguards related to the fast-track \ndrug approval process and the provision improving accelerated access to \ninvestigational products and we have adopted several of their key \nconcerns.\n  I would close by saying that this measure embodies a reasonable, \nmoderate approach to balancing the agency's mandate to regulate over \none-third of our Nation's economy and provide for the public health and \nsafety with the compelling need to provide new, improved, safe, and \neffective products to the American public. It is a good bill and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to improve it even further.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Hutchinson, \n        and Mr. Coverdell):\n  S. 831. A bill to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to \nprovide for congressional review of any rule promulgated by the \nInternal Revenue Service that increases Federal revenue, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                     the stealth tax prevention act\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Stealth Tax \nPrevention Act. Perhaps the most important power given to the Congress \nin the Constitution of the United States is bestowed in article I, \nsection 8--the power to tax. This authority is vested in Congress \nbecause, as elected representatives, Congress remains accountable to \nthe public when they lay and collect taxes.\n  Last year, Mr. President, Congress passed the Congressional Review \nAct of 1996, which provides that when a major agency rule takes effect, \nCongress has 60 days to review it. During this time period, Congress \nhas the option to pass a disapproval resolution. If no such resolution \nis passed, the rule then goes into effect.\n  The Internal Revenue Service, as the President here knows, has \nenormous power to affect the lives and the livelihoods of American \ntaxpayers through their authority to interpret the Tax Code. The \nStealth Tax Prevention Act that I am introducing today, along with \nSenator Bond and Senator Hagel, will expand the definition of a major \nrule to include, Mr. President, any IRS regulation which increases \nFederal revenue. Why? Because we desperately need this today.\n  For example, if the Office of Management and Budget finds that the \nimplementation and enforcement of a rule has resulted in an increase of \nFederal revenues over current practices or revenues anticipated from \nthe rule on the date of the enactment of the statute under which the \nrule is promulgated. Therefore, the Stealth Tax Prevention Act will \nallow Congress to review the regulation and take appropriate measures \nto avoid raising taxes on hard-working Americans, in most cases, small \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. President, the Founding Fathers' intent, as you know, was to put \nthe power to lay and collect taxes in the hands of elected Members of \nCongress, not in the hands of bureaucrats who are shielded from public \naccountability. It is appropriate, I believe, that the IRS's breach of \nauthority is addressed, in light of the fact that we are celebrating \nthis week Small Business Week.\n  The discretionary authority of the Internal Revenue Service exposes \nsmall businesses, farmers, and others to the arbitrary whims of \nbureaucrats, thus creating an uncertain and, under certain cases, \nhostile environment in which to conduct day-to-day activities. Most of \nthese people do not have lobbyists that work for them, other than their \nelected Representatives, the way it should be. The Stealth Tax \nPrevention Act will be particularly helpful in lowering the tax burden \non small business which suffers disproportionately, Mr. President, from \nIRS regulations. This burden discourages the startup of new firms and \nultimately the creation of new jobs in the economy, which has really \nmade America great today.\n  Americans pay Federal income taxes. They, Mr. President, as you well \nknow, pay State income taxes. They pay property taxes. On the way to \nwork in the morning they pay a gasoline tax when they fill up their \ncar, and a sales tax when they buy a cup of coffee.\n  Mr. President, average Americans in small businesses are saddled with \nthe highest tax burden in our country's history.\n  Allowing bureaucrats to increase taxes even further, at their own \ndiscretion through interpretation of the Tax Code is intolerable. The \nStealth Tax Prevention Act will leave tax policy where it belongs, to \nelected Members of the Congress, not unelected and unaccountable IRS \nbureaucrats.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 831\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW OF INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE \n                   RULES THAT INCREASE REVENUE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Stealth \n     Tax Prevention Act''.\n       (b) In General.--Section 804(2) of title 5, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(2) The term `major rule'--\n       ``(A) means any rule that--\n       ``(i) the Administrator of the Office of Information and \n     Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget \n     finds has resulted in or is likely to result in--\n       ``(I) an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000 or \n     more;\n       ``(II) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, \n     individual industries, Federal, State, or local government \n     agencies, or geographic regions; or\n       ``(III) significant adverse effects on competition, \n     employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the \n     ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with \n     foreign-based enterprises in domestic and export markets; or\n       ``(ii)(I) is promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service; \n     and\n       ``(II) the Administrator of the Office of Information and \n     Regulatory Affairs of the Office of Management and Budget \n     finds that the implementation and enforcement of the rule has \n     resulted in or is likely to result in any net increase in \n     Federal revenues over current practices in tax collection or \n     revenues anticipated from the rule on the date of the \n     enactment of the statute under which the rule is promulgated; \n     and\n       ``(B) does not include any rule promulgated under the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996 and the amendments made by \n     that Act.''.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished \ncolleague from Alabama, Senator Shelby, in introducing legislation to \nensure that the Treasury Department's Internal Revenue Service does not \nusurp the power to tax--a power solely vested in Congress by the U.S. \nConstitution. The Stealth Tax Prevention Act will ensure that the duly \nelected representatives of the people, who are accountable to the \nelectorate for our actions, will have discretion to exercise the power \nto tax. This legislation is intended to curb the ability of the \nTreasury Department to bypass Congress by proposing a tax increase \nwithout the authorization or consent of Congress.\n  The Stealth Tax Prevention Act builds on legislation passed \nunanimously by the Senate just over 1 year ago. As chairman of the \nCommittee on Small Business, I authored the Small Business Regulatory \nEnforcement Fairness Act--better known as the Red Tape Reduction Act--\nto ensure that small businesses are treated fairly in agency rulemaking \nand enforcement activities. Subtitle E of the Red Tape Reduction Act \nprovides that a final rule issued by a Federal agency and deemed a \nmajor rule by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of the \nOffice of Management and Budget\n\n[[Page S5344]]\n\ncannot go into effect for at least 60 days. This delay is to provide \nCongress with a window during which it can review the rule and its \nimpact, allowing time for Congress to consider whether a resolution of \ndisapproval should be enacted to strike down the regulation. To become \neffective, the resolution must pass both the House and Senate and be \nsigned into law by the President or enacted as the result of a veto \noverride.\n  The bill Senator Shelby and I introduce today amends this law to \nprovide that any rule issued by the Treasury Department's Internal \nRevenue Service that will result in a tax increase--any increase--will \nbe deemed a major rule by OIRA and, consequently, not go into effect \nfor at least 60 days. This procedural safeguard will ensure that the \nDepartment of the Treasury and its Internal Revenue Service cannot make \nan end-run around Congress, as it is currently attempting with the \nstealth tax it proposed on January 13.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the IRS has issued a proposal that is \ntantamount to a tax increase on businesses structured as limited \nliability companies. The IRS proposal disqualifies a taxpayer from \nbeing considered as a limited partner if he or she ``participates in \nthe partnership's trade or business for more than 500 hours during a \ntaxable year'' or is involved in a ``service'' partnership, such as \nlawyers, accountants, engineers, architects, and health-care providers.\n  The IRS alleges that its proposal merely interprets section \n1402(a)(13) of the Tax Code, providing clarification, when in actuality \nit is a tax increase by regulatory fiat. Under the IRS proposal, \ndisqualification as a limited partner will result in a tax increase on \nincome from both capital investments as well as earnings of the \npartnership. The effect will be to add the self-employment tax--12.4 \npercent for social security and 2.9 percent for Medicare--to income \nfrom investments as well as earnings for limited partners that under \ncurrent rules can exclude such income from the self-employment tax.\n\n  Under the bill introduced today, the tax increase proposed by the \nInternal Revenue Service of the Treasury Department, if later issued as \na final rule, could not go into effect for at least 60 days following \nits publication in the Federal Register. This window, which coincides \nwith issuance of a report by the Comptroller General, would allow \nCongress the opportunity to review the rule and vote on a resolution to \ndisapprove the tax increase before it is applied to a single taxpayer.\n  The Stealth Tax Prevention Act strengthens the Red Tape Reduction Act \nand the vital procedural safeguards it provides to ensure that small \nbusinesses are not burdened unnecessarily by new Federal regulations. \nCongress enacted the 1966 provisions to strengthen the effectiveness of \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act, a law which had been ignored too often \nby Government agencies, especially the Internal Revenue Service. Three \nof the top recommendations of the 1995 White House Conference on Small \nBusiness sought reforms to the way Government regulations are developed \nand enforced, and the Red Tape Reduction Act passed the Senate without \na single dissenting vote on its way to being signed into law last year. \nDespite the inclusion of language in the 1996 amendments that expressly \naddresses coverage of IRS interpretative rules, we find ourselves faced \nagain with an IRS proposal that was not issued in compliance with the \nRegulatory Flexibility Act.\n  As 18 of my Senate colleagues and I advised Secretary Rubin in an \nApril letter, the proposed IRS regulation on limited partner taxation \nis precisely the type of rule for which a regulatory flexibility \nanalysis should be done. Although, on its face, the rulemaking seeks \nmerely to define a limited partner or to eliminate uncertainty in \ndetermining net earnings from self-employment, the real effect of the \nrule would be to raise taxes by executive fiat and expand substantially \nthe spirit and letter of the underlying statute. The rule also seeks to \nimpose on small businesses a burdensome new recordkeeping and \ncollection of information requirement that would affect millions of \nlimited partners and members of limited liability companies. The \nTreasury's IRS proposes this stealth tax increase with the knowledge \nthat Congress declined to adopt a similar tax increase in the Health \nSecurity Act proposed in 1994--a provision that the Congressional Joint \nCommittee on Taxation estimated in 1994 would have resulted in a tax \nincrease of approximately $500 million per year.\n  The Stealth Tax Prevention Act would remove any incentive for the \nTreasury Department to underestimate the cost imposed by an IRS \nproposed or final rule in an effort to skirt the administration's \nregulatory review process or its obligations under the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act. By amending the definition of major rule under the \nCongressional Review Act, which is subtitle E of the Red Tape Reduction \nAct, we ensure that an IRS rule that imposes a tax increase will be a \nmajor rule, whether or not it has an estimated annual effect on the \neconomy of $100,000,000. Our amendment does not change the trigger for \na regulatory flexibility analysis, which still will be required if a \nproposed rule would have a significant economic impact on a substantial \nnumber of small entities. We believe the heightened scrutiny of IRS \nregulations called for by this legislation will provide an additional \nincentive for the Treasury Department's Internal Revenue Service to \nmeet all of its procedural obligations under the Regulatory Flexibility \nAct and the Red Tape Reduction Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Shelby and me in supporting this \nimportant legislation to ensure that the IRS not usurp the proper role \nof Congress--nor skirt its obligations to identify the impact of its \nproposed and final rules. Rules such as that currently proposed by the \nIRS should be carefully scrutinized by Congress. When the Department of \nthe Treasury issues a final IRS rule that increases taxes, Congress \nshould have the ability to exercise its discretion to enact a \nresolution of disapproval before the rule is applicable to a single \ntaxpayer. The Stealth Tax Prevention Act Senator Shelby and I introduce \ntoday provides that opportunity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n        Hagel, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 832. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe deductibility of business meal expenses for individuals who are \nsubject to Federal limitations on hours of service; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n            The Business Meal Deduction Fairness Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, I am one of this \nbody's strongest advocates for deficit reduction. I attribute much of \nmy deep commitment to this goal to my days in business. As a \nbusinessman, I learned that you must balance your books and live within \nyour means. I also learned that you must treat people fairly and admit \nwhen you have made a mistake. I have come to the floor to acknowledge \nthat a mistake has been made, and must be corrected.\n  In August 1993 we passed the omnibus budget reconciliation bill. I am \nproud to say that this legislation has helped to produce falling \ndeficits and sustained economic growth. However, in our efforts to get \nour fiscal house in order we unfairly penalized a group of hard \nworking, middle-class Americans: transportation workers. It is for this \nreason that I rise today, to reintroduce the business meal deduction \nfairness bill. This measure would increase the deductibility of \nbusiness meals, from 50 to 80 percent, for individuals who are required \nto eat away from home due to the nature of their work.\n  In the 1993 reconciliation bill was a provision which lowered the \ndeductible portion of business meals and entertainment expenses from 80 \nto 50 percent. The change was aimed at the so-called three martini \nlunches and extravagant entertainment expenses of Wall Street \nfinanciers and Hollywood movie moguls. Unfortunately, the change also \nhit the average truck driver who eats chicken fried steak, hot roast \nbeef sandwiches, and meatloaf in truck stops. And while those who \nentertain for business purposes can change their practices based on the \ntax law change, long-haul transportation workers often have no choice \nbut to eat on the road.\n  For these workers, the 1993 decrease in the meal deduction has \ntranslated into an undeserved decrease in take home pay. For example, \nwhen the allowable deduction was dropped in 1993,\n\n[[Page S5345]]\n\nit increased taxes on an average truck driver $700 to $2,000 per year. \nThis is a huge increase for a truck driver who normally earns $27,000 \nto $35,000 per year.\n  Our legislation would increase the take-home pay of hard working, \nmiddle-class Americans who were inadvertently hurt by changes in the \ntax law in 1993. Workers who, due to regulations limiting travel hours, \nmust eat out. They have no control over the length of their trips, the \namount of time they must rest during a delivery, or, in many cases, the \nplaces they can stop and eat. This legislation is straight forward. It \nwould simply restore the business meal expense deduction to 80 per cent \nfor individuals subject to the Department of Transportation's hours-of-\nservice limitations.\n  I will be the first to admit that the budget deficit is the No. 1 \neconomic problem facing this country. Since being elected to the \nSenate, I have fought to eliminate this destructive drain on our \nability to grow and compete in the world economy, but I have fought to \ndo so in a fair manner. The 1993 reconciliation bill closed a loophole \nand unintentionally trapped some very hard working Americans. We need \nto acknowledge that a mistake was made and take the opportunity of a \ntax bill moving this year to fix that mistake. Therefore my colleagues, \nSenators Kerrey, Harkin, Hatch, Hagel, Grassley and I are requesting \nthe support and assistance of this entire body to ensure that the \nbusiness meal deduction fairness bill becomes law. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of my legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 832\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the Federal building courthouse at Public \nSquare and Superior Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio, as the ``Howard M. \nMetzenbaum United States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\n the howard m. metzenbaum united states courthouse designation act of \n                                  1997\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my dear \nfriend and former colleague, Howard Metzenbaum, on the occasion of his \n80th birthday. In his honor, I am introducing a bill that would \ndesignate the Federal Building Courthouse in Cleveland, OH, as the \n``Howard M. Metzenbaum United States Courthouse.'' I am joined by \nOhio's two Senators, Senator Glenn and Senator DeWine.\n  Mr. President, I propose naming a courthouse after Howard because a \ncourthouse is a symbol of justice where all people can come and be \ntreated equally under the law. Howard Metzenbaum deserves this honor \nbecause he was a dedicated public servant, who served his home State of \nOhio for 18 years in the U.S. Senate. Howard's sense of fairness and \nequality for all Americans led one of his former colleagues to suggest \nthat Howard would have made an exceptional U.S. Supreme Court Justice \nwhen he retired from the Senate in 1994.\n  Mr. President, naming a courthouse after Howard is only a small \ngesture in attempting to remember a man so committed to justice and \nfairness. Howard's contributions to the Senate are extraordinary, so we \nshould commemorate his unique contribution by celebrating his 80th \nyear, his 18 years in the United States Senate, and also the special \ncharacter he brought to our body.\n  I pay tribute today to a man who always stood up for what he believed \nwas right, fighting hard to preserve opportunity for those yet to come. \nAs a Senator, Howard had a broad range of interests and he pursued them \nwith dogged perseverance, sincerity, and clarity.\n  Howard and I worked on many issues together during our time in the \nSenate. Individual rights and environmental preservation were major \nconcerns. He poured his energy into clean air protection, nuclear \nregulation, cleaning up superfund sites, and recycling. Howard provided \nstrong leadership on antitrust issues as Chairman of the Subcommittee \non Antitrust, Monopolies and Business Rights on the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  He was a persistent gun control advocate, taking the lead on many \nantigun initiatives in the Senate. He was one of the lead sponsors of \nthe Brady bill handgun purchase waiting period, as well as the bans on \nassault weapons and plastic explosives.\n  But Howard's true passions lay with America's underprivileged and \nneedy communities, which never had a bolder champion. His work on \nbehalf of the poor, the disabled, and the elderly reflect his \nremarkable compassion for those members of society who face challenges \nthat many of us cannot fully appreciate. He tirelessly defended their \ninterests and fought for their protection. He was dedicated to \neradicating discrimination, ensuring adequate health care to those in \nneed, and boosting public education. It has been said many times, but \nfor good reason, that Howard brought not only his conscience to the \nSenate, but also the courage to act on his convictions.\n  Howard remains a good friend to me, but he was also a mentor and a \nteacher during his years in the Senate. He gave me good advice and \nplenty of it. And, I might add, he continues to do so today, which I \nwelcome. But more than that, his dedication to the office of United \nStates Senator is an example by which to live. He stood tall for the \nlittle people.\n  Some will affectionately remember Howard as determined, \nargumentative, and even ``irascible.'' I cannot deny that those words \ncome to my mind every now and then, when describing Howard. He was \nalways at his best then, and for good reason. I heard it said by one \nSenator, and not a good friend: ``If there wasn't a Metzenbaum here, \nwe'd have to invent one to keep us alert.''\n  I have missed working with Howard Metzenbaum in this great \ninstitution, a place that has been truly enhanced by his presence. I \nsalute him on celebrating his 80th year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 833\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF HOWARD M. METZENBAUM UNITED STATES \n                   COURTHOUSE.\n\n       The Federal building courthouse at Public Square and \n     Superior Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``Howard M. Metzenbaum United States \n     Courthouse''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the Federal building \n     courthouse referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a \n     reference to the ``Howard M. Metzenbaum United States \n     Courthouse''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 834. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure \nadequate research and education regarding the drug DES; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           the DES Research and Education Amendments of 1997\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by my \ndistinguished colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, in introducing \nan important women's health initiative. The DES Research and Education \nAmendments of 1997 would extend and expand our effort to assist the \nover 5 million Americans who have been exposed to\n\n[[Page S5346]]\n\nthe drug, DES. Representative Louise Slaughter, a long-time leader on \nthis issue, is introducing companion legislation today in the other \nbody.\n  Between 1938 and 1971, some 5 million American women were given the \nsynthetic drug, diethylstilbestrol, commonly known as DES. Women were \ngiven the drug during pregnancy in the mistaken belief it would help \nprevent miscarriage. The drug was pulled from the market based on \nstudies that found that it was ineffective and might result in damage \nto children born to the women who had been given it.\n  Since the 1970's, studies have shown that DES does damage the \nreproductive systems of those exposed in utero and increases these \nindividuals' risk for cancer, infertility, and a wide range of other \nserious reproductive tract disorders. The women exposed in utero to DES \nare five times more likely to have an ectopic pregnancy and three times \nmore likely to miscarry when they in turn try to have children. Studies \nalso show that one of every thousand women exposed to DES in utero will \ndevelop clear cell cancer. Women who took DES have also been found to \nface a higher risk for breast cancer.\n  In 1992, while there had been a number of research studies on DES \nexposure and its effects, much more research was necessary. That year, \nPresident Bush signed legislation introduced by myself and \nRepresentative Slaughter, that mandated a significant increase in DES \nresearch supported by the National Institutes of Health [NIH]. Our \nlegislation also required NIH to support long-term studies of Americans \nimpacted by this drug. Those studies are now underway and must be \ncontinued. The legislation we are introducing today will ensure that \nthis critical medical research continues. In addition, there is now \npreliminary evidence that the grandkids of women who took DES may also \nbe at higher risk for certain health problems, and this legislation \nwould help ensure that further research into this is supported.\n  Another major problem in this area is that millions of Americans \ndon't know the risks they face because of their exposure to DES. Many \nhealth professionals who see these people also lack sufficient \ninformation about DES exposure and the appropriate steps that should be \ntaken to identify and assist their patients. As a result, many people \ndo not seek or get the appropriate preventive care or take appropriate \npreventive measures to reduce their risks of adverse affects. For \nexample, women exposed to DES in utero and therefore at higher risk of \nmiscarriage may be able to reduce their risks with appropriate \nprecautionary steps.\n  In an initial attempt to address this need for better information, \nour 1992 legislation required NIH to test ways to educate the public \nand health professionals about how to deal with DES exposure. The \nlegislation we are introducing today would give people across the \nNation access to the information developed through these pilot programs \nby requiring a national consumer and health professional education \neffort.\n  Mr. President, we took a very important step in 1992 to begin to \naddress the significant problem presented by DES exposure. And we did \nit with strong bipartisan cooperation between a Democratic Congress and \na Republican President. That legislation expires this year. We need to \nmake sure that the progress we've made is continued. The 5 million \nAmericans whose health is at risk are depending on us to work together \nto make sure that happens. I urge my colleagues to join me in support \nof that effort. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 834\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``DES Research and Education \n     Amendments of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       With respect to diethylstilbestrol (a drug commonly known \n     as DES), the Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) DES was widely prescribed to American women from 1938 \n     to 1971 in the mistaken belief it would prevent miscarriage. \n     Approximately 5,000,000 pregnant women took the drug, \n     resulting in DES exposure for approximately 5,000,000 \n     daughters and sons.\n       (2) Studies conducted since the 1970s have shown that DES \n     damages the reproductive systems of those exposed in utero \n     and increases the risk for cancer, infertility, and a wide \n     range of other serious reproductive tract disorders. These \n     disorders include a five-fold increased risk for ectopic \n     pregnancy for DES daughters and a three-fold increase in risk \n     for miscarriage and preterm labor. Studies have indicated \n     that exposure to DES may increase the risk for autoimmune \n     disorders and diseases.\n       (3) An estimated 1 in 1,000 women exposed to DES in utero \n     will develop clear cell cancer of the vagina or cervix. While \n     survival rates for clear cell cancer are over 80 percent when \n     it is detected early, there is still no effective treatment \n     for recurrences of this cancer.\n       (4) Studies also indicate a higher incidence of breast \n     cancer among mothers who took DES during pregnancy.\n       (5) While research on DES and its effects has produced \n     important advances to date, much more remains to be learned.\n       (6) Preliminary research results indicate that DES exposure \n     may have a genetic impact on the third generation--the \n     children of parents exposed to DES in utero--and that \n     estrogen replacement therapy may not be advisable for DES-\n     exposed women.\n       (7) All DES-exposed individuals have special screening and \n     health care needs, especially during gynecological exams and \n     pregnancy for DES daughters, who should receive high risk \n     care.\n       (8) Many Americans remain unaware of their DES exposure or \n     ignorant about proper health care and screening. There \n     remains a great need for a national education effort to \n     inform both the public and health care providers about the \n     health effects and proper health care practices for DES-\n     exposed individuals.\n\n     SEC. 3. REVISION AND EXTENSION OF PROGRAM FOR RESEARCH AND \n                   AUTHORIZATION OF NEW NATIONAL PROGRAM OF \n                   EDUCATION REGARDING DRUG DES.\n\n       (a) Permanent Extension of General Program.--Section \n     403A(e) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 283a(e)) \n     is amended by striking ``for each of the fiscal years 1993 \n     through 1996'' and inserting ``for fiscal year 1997 and each \n     subsequent fiscal year''.\n       (b) National Program for Education of Health Professionals \n     and Public.--From amounts appropriated for carrying out \n     section 403A of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     283a), the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting \n     through the heads of the appropriate agencies of the Public \n     Health Service, shall carry out a national program for the \n     education of health professionals and the public with respect \n     to the drug diethylstilbestrol (commonly known as DES). To \n     the extent appropriate, such national program shall use \n     methodologies developed through the education demonstration \n     program carried out under such section 403A. In developing \n     and carrying out the national program, the Secretary shall \n     consult closely with representatives of nonprofit private \n     entities that represent individuals who have been exposed to \n     DES and that have expertise in community-based information \n     campaigns for the public and for health care providers. The \n     implementation of the national program shall begin during \n     fiscal year 1998.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. \n        Santorum, Mr. McCain and Mr. Ashcroft):\n  S. 836. A bill to offer small businesses certain protections from \nlitigation excesses; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n        The Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small \nBusiness Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act of 1997. This bill will provide \ntargeted relief from litigation excesses to small businesses.\n  Small businesses in Michigan and across the Nation have faced \nincreasingly burdensome litigation and desperately need relief from \nunwarranted and costly lawsuits. While other sectors of our society and \nour economy also need relief from litigation excesses, small businesses \nby their very nature are particularly vulnerable to lawsuit abuses and \nespecially unable to bear the high costs of unjustified and unfair \nlitigation against them.\n  As this week is Small Business Week, it provides a fine opportunity \nfor us to focus on relieving the burdens faced by small businesses. \nSmall businesses represent the engine of our growing economy and \nprovide countless benefits to communities across America. The Research \nInstitute for Small and Emerging Business, for example, has estimated \nthat there are over 20 million small businesses in America and that \nsmall businesses generate 50 percent of the country's private sector \noutput.\n  When I was in Michigan last week over the Memorial Day recess, I \nheard story after story from small businesses about the constraints, \nlimitations, and\n\n[[Page S5347]]\n\nfear imposed on them by the threat of abusive and unwarranted \nlitigation. I also heard about the high costs that they must pay for \nliability insurance. Those represent costs that could be going to \nexpand small businesses, to provide more jobs, or to offer more \nbenefits. According to a recent Gallup survey, one out of every five \nsmall businesses decides not to hire more employees, expand its \nbusiness, introduce a new product, or improve an existing one out of \nfear of lawsuits.\n  Before the Memorial Day recess, Congress passed the Volunteer \nProtection Act, which--if signed by the President--will provide \nspecific protections from abusive litigation to volunteers. The Senate \npassed that legislation by an overwhelming margin of 99 to 1. That \nlegislation provides a model for further targeted reforms for sectors \nthat are particularly hard hit and in need of immediate relief.\n  Small businesses have carried an often unbearable load from \nunwarranted and unjustified lawsuits. Data from San Diego's superior \ncourt published by the Washington Legal Foundation revealed that \npunitive damages were requested in 41 percent of suits against small \nbusinesses. It is unfathomable that such a large proportion of our \nsmall businesses are engaging in the sort of egregious misconduct that \nwould warrant a claim of punitive damages. Unfortunately, those sort of \nfindings are not unusual. The National Federation of Independent \nBusiness has reported that 34 percent of Texas small business owners \nhave been sued or threatened with court action seeking punitive \ndamages. Those figures are outrageously high and simply cannot have \nanything to do with actual wrongdoing.\n  We know of far too many examples of expensive and ridiculous legal \nthreats faced by our small businesses that they must defend every day. \nIn a case reported by the American Consulting Engineers Council, a \ndrunk driver had an accident after speeding and bypassing detour signs. \nEight hours after the crash, the driver had a blood alcohol level of \n0.09. The driver sued the engineering firm that designed the road, the \ncontractor, the subcontractor, and the State highway department. Five \nyears later, and after expending exorbitant amounts on legal fees, the \ndefendants settled the case for $35,000. The engineering firm--a small \n15 person firm--was swamped with over $200,000 in legal costs. That \nrepresents an intolerable amount for a small business to have to pay in \ndefending a questionable and unwarranted lawsuit.\n  There are more examples. In an Ann Landers column from October 1995, \na case was reported that involved a minister and his wife who sued a \nguide dog school for $160,000 after a blind man who was learning to use \na seeing-eye dog stepped on the woman's toes in a shopping mall. The \nguide dog school, Southeastern Guide Dogs, Inc., which provided the \ninstructor supervising the man, was the only school of its kind in the \nSoutheast. It trains seeing-eye dogs at no cost to the visually \nimpaired. The couple filed their lawsuit 13 months after the so-called \naccident, in which witnesses reported that the woman did not move out \nof the blind man's way because she wanted to see if the dog would walk \naround her.\n  The experiences of a small business in Michigan, the Michigan Furnace \nCo., is likewise alarming. The plawsuit in the history of her company \nhas been a nuisance lawsuit. She indicates that if the money the \ncompany spends on liability insurance and legal fees was distributed \namong the employees, it would amount to a $10,000 annual raise per \nemployee.\n  These costs are stifling our small businesses and the people who work \nthere. The straightforward provisions of the Small Business Lawsuit \nAbuse Protection Act will provide small businesses with relief by \ndiscouraging abusive litigation. The bill contains essentially two \nprincipal reforms.\n  First, the bill limits punitive damages that may be awarded against a \nsmall business. In most civil lawsuits against small businesses, \npunitive damages would be available against the small business only if \nthe claimant proves by clear and convincing evidence that the harm was \ncaused by the small business through at least a conscious, flagrant \nindifference to the rights and safety of the claimant. Punitive damages \nwould also be limited in amount. Punitive damages would be limited to \nthe lesser of $250,000 or two times the compensatory damages awarded \nfor the harm. That formulation is exactly the same formulation that \nappears in the small business protection provision that was included in \nthe product liability conference report that passed in the 104th \nCongress.\n  Second, joint and several liability reforms for small businesses are \nincluded under the exact same formulation that was used both in the \nVolunteer Protection Act passed this Congress and in the product \nliability conference report passed last Congress. Joint and several \nliability would be limited so that a small business would be liable for \nnoneconomic damages only in proportion to the small business's \nresponsibility for causing the harm. If a small business is responsible \nfor 100% of an accident, then it will be liable for 100% of noneconomic \ndamages. But if it is only 70%, 25%, 10%, or any other amount \nresponsible, then the small business will be liable only for that same \npercent of noneconomic damages.\n\n  Of course, small businesses would still be jointly and severally \nliable for economic damages, and any other defendants in the action \nthat were not small businesses could be held jointly and severally \nliable for all damages. This should provide some protection to small \nbusinesses so that they will not be sought out as ``deep pocket'' \ndefendants by trial lawyers who would otherwise try to get them on the \nhook for harms that they have not caused. The fact is that many small \nbusinesses simply do not have deep pockets, and they frequently need \nall of their resources just to stay in business, take care of their \nemployees, and make ends meet.\n  The other provisions in the bill specify the situations in which \nthose reforms apply. The bill defines small business as any business \nhaving fewer than 25 employees. That is the same definition of small \nbusiness that was included in the Product Liability Conference Report. \nLike the Volunteer Protection Act, this bill covers all civil lawsuits \nwith the exception of suits involving certain types of egregious \nconduct. The limitations on liability included in the bill would not \napply to any misconduct that constitutes a crime of violence, act of \ninternational terrorism, hate crime, sexual offense, or civil rights \nlaw violation, or which occurred while the defendant was under the \ninfluence of intoxicating alcohol or any drug.\n  Also like the Volunteer Protection Act, the bill includes a State \nopt-out. A State would be able to opt out of the provisions of the bill \nprovided the State enacts a law indicating its election to do so and \ncontaining no other provisions. I do not expect that any State will \nopt-out of these provisions, but I feel it is important to include one \nout of respect for principles of federalism.\n  I am pleased to have Senators McConnell, Coverdell, Santorum and \nMcCain as original cosponsors of the legislation and very much \nappreciate their support for our small businesses and for meaningful \nlitigation reforms. The bill is also supported by the National \nFederation of Independent Business and by the National Restaurant \nAssociation. I ask unanimous consent that letters from those two \norganizations be inserted in the Record.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section analysis \nof the bill be printed in the Record, as well as the full text of the \nbill, and I encourage my colleagues to support this simple and much-\nneeded legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 836\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Lawsuit Abuse \n     Protection Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States civil justice system is inefficient, \n     unpredictable, unfair, costly, and impedes competitiveness in \n     the marketplace for goods, services, business, and employees;\n       (2) the defects in the civil justice system have a direct \n     and undesirable effect on interstate commerce by decreasing \n     the availability of goods and services in commerce;\n       (3) there is a need to restore rationality, certainty, and \n     fairness to the legal system;\n       (4) the spiralling costs of litigation and the magnitude \n     and unpredictability of punitive\n\n[[Page S5348]]\n\n     damage awards and noneconomic damage awards have continued \n     unabated for at least the past 30 years;\n       (5) the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized \n     that a punitive damage award can be unconstitutional if the \n     award is grossly excessive in relation to the legitimate \n     interest of the government in the punishment and deterrence \n     of unlawful conduct;\n       (6) just as punitive damage awards can be grossly \n     excessive, so can it be grossly excessive in some \n     circumstances for a party to be held responsible under the \n     doctrine of joint and several liability for damages that \n     party did not cause;\n       (7) as a result of joint and several liability, entities \n     including small businesses are often brought into litigation \n     despite the fact that their conduct may have little or \n     nothing to do with the accident or transaction giving rise to \n     the lawsuit, and may therefore face increased and unjust \n     costs due to the possibility or result of unfair and \n     disproportionate damage awards;\n       (8) the costs imposed by the civil justice system on small \n     businesses are particularly acute, since small businesses \n     often lack the resources to bear those costs and to challenge \n     unwarranted lawsuits;\n       (9) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation \n     costs, small businesses face higher costs in purchasing \n     insurance through interstate insurance markets to cover their \n     activities;\n       (10) liability reform for small businesses will promote the \n     free flow of goods and services, lessen burdens on interstate \n     commerce, and decrease litigiousness; and\n       (11) legislation to address these concerns is an \n     appropriate exercise of Congress powers under Article I, \n     section 8, clauses 3, 9, and 18 of the Constitution, and the \n     fourteenth amendment to the Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 3.

In any civil action \n     against a small business, punitive damages may not exceed the \n     lesser of two times the amount awarded to the claimant for \n     economic and noneconomic losses, or $250,000.\n\n\n  section 5. limitation on several liability for noneconomic loss for \n                            small businesses\n\n       This section provides that, in any civil action against a \n     small business, for each defendant that is a small business, \n     the liability of that defendant for noneconomic loss will be \n     in proportion to that defendant's responsibility for causing \n     the harm. Those defendants would continue, however, to be \n     held\n\n[[Page S5349]]\n\n     jointly and severally liable for economic loss. In addition, \n     any other defendants in the action that are not small \n     businesses would continue to be held jointly and severally \n     liable for both economic and noneconomic loss.\n\n\n      section 6. preemption and election of state nonapplicability\n\n       The bill preempts State laws to the extent that any such \n     laws are inconsistent with it, but it does not preempt any \n     State law that provides additional protections from liability \n     to small businesses. The bill also includes an opt-out \n     provision for the States. A State may opt out of the \n     provisions of the bill for any action in State court against \n     a small business in which all parties are citizens of the \n     State. In order to opt out, the State would have to enact a \n     statute citing the authority in this section, declaring the \n     election of the State to opt out, and containing no other \n     provisions.\n\n\n           section 7. exceptions to limitations on liability\n\n       The limitations on liability included in the bill would not \n     apply to any misconduct that constitutes a crime of violence, \n     act of international terrorism, hate crime, sexual offense, \n     or civil rights law violation, or which occurred while the \n     defendant was under the influence of intoxicating alcohol or \n     any drug.\n\n\n                       section 8. effective date\n\n       The bill would take effect 90 days after the date of \n     enactment, and would apply to claims filed on or after the \n     effective date.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Abraham: On behalf of the 600,000 small \n     business owners of the National Federation of Independent \n     Business (NFIB), I am writing to commend you for your efforts \n     to put an end to abusive litigation and restore common sense \n     to our civil justice system.\n       Legal reform is a small business issue and was listed as to \n     top priority at the 1995 White House Conference on Small \n     Business. The frequency and cost of litigation have been \n     exploding at an alarming rate. Our civil justice system is \n     becoming increasingly inaccessible, unaffordable and \n     intimidating, not to mention unfair. It is now so strained \n     that it threatens not only the fair judicial process but also \n     has become a huge disincentive to business start-ups. The \n     cost and availability of liability insurance was listed as a \n     top concern to small business owners in a survey conducted \n     recently by the NFIB Education Foundation.\n       Small business owners now see the legal system as a ``no \n     win'' situation. If sued--even if completely innocent--it \n     means either a costly, protracted trial or being forced into \n     an expensive settlement to avoid a trial. Thousands of small \n     business owners across the country are having their business, \n     their employees, and their future put at risk by a legal \n     system that is out of control.\n       Small business owners support any measures that inject more \n     fairness into our civil justice system and allow for the \n     affordable pursuit--or defense--of legitimate cases. Your \n     legislation, the Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act \n     of 1997, is an important vehicle for those goals. With our \n     courts facing an extraordinary backlog with delays up to \n     several years in some jurisdictions, your bill will \n     discourage frivolous or malicious cases, and help streamline \n     and balance the system.\n       Thank you for your continued support of small business.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                           Vice President, Federal\n     Governmental Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              National Restaurant Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Spence Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: The National Restaurant Association--\n     the leading representative for the nation's restaurant \n     industry which employs more than nine million Americans--\n     strongly applauds your effort to protect small businesses \n     from Litigation excesses.\n       Many small businesses, particularly restaurants, have \n     become vulnerable to excessive litigation in recent years. \n     Indeed, our members are all too familiar with the rising \n     costs of liability insurance and with the reality that a \n     single frivolous lawsuit can be enough to drive a restaurant \n     out of business. We strongly support the Small Business \n     Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act of 1997 and believe it will go a \n     long way toward curbing lawsuit abuse.\n       Because of the fear of unlimited punitive damages when \n     faced with a claim, many small business owners settle out of \n     court for significant award amounts, even if the plaintiff's \n     claim is frivolous and unwarranted. Plaintiffs' attorneys \n     take advantage of a small business owner's fear, pursuing \n     claims against businesses that they know will have \n     ``settlement value.'' The Small Business Lawsuit Abuse \n     Protection Act limits the amount of punitive damages that may \n     be awarded against a small business. In any civil action \n     against a small business, punitive damages may not exceed the \n     lesser of two times the amount awarded to the claimant for \n     economic and noneconomic losses, or $250,000. Putting a cap \n     on the amount of punitive damages would help to reduce \n     frivolous suits and would enable businesses to obtain more \n     equitable settlements and avoid costly and unnecessary legal \n     fees.\n       In addition to limiting punitive damages, we are pleased \n     that your legislation includes a provision to limit several \n     liability for noneconomic damages. Under joint and several \n     liability, small business owners are often dragged into \n     lawsuits with which they had little, or nothing, to do. The \n     Abraham Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act takes an \n     important first step by limiting the liability for \n     noneconomic loss to the proportion of the small business' \n     responsibility. The limitation on several liability would \n     apply in any civil action against a small business.\n       Senator Abraham, we appreciate your continued commitment to \n     small business and to legal reform. We look forward to \n     working with you to pass the Small Business Lawsuit Abuse \n     Protection Act.\n       Sincerely,\n     Elaine Z. Graham,\n       Senior Vice President, Government Relations and Membership.\n     Christina M. Howard,\n       Senior Legislative Representative.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my esteemed \ncolleague from Michigan in the introduction of the Small Business \nLawsuit Abuse Protection Act of 1997.\n  Over the past 30 years, the American civil justice system has become \ninefficient, unpredictable, and costly. Consequently, I have spent a \ngreat deal of my time in the U.S. Senate working to reform the legal \nsystem. I was particularly pleased to help lead in the efforts to pass \nthe Volunteer Protection Act, which offers much-needed litigation \nprotection for our country's battalion of volunteers. America's \nlitigation crisis, however, goes well beyond our volunteers.\n  Lawsuits and the mere threat of lawsuits impede our country's \ninvention, innovation, and the competitive position our Nation has \nenjoyed in the world marketplace. The litigation craze has several \nperverse effects. For example, it discourages the production of more \nand better products, while encouraging the production of more and more \nattorneys. In the 1950's, there was one lawyer for every 695 Americans. \nToday, in contrast, there is one lawyer for every 290 people. In fact, \nwe have more lawyers per capita than any other western democracy.\n  Mr. President, don't get me wrong--there is nothing inherently wrong \nwith being a lawyer. I am proud to be a graduate of the University of \nKentucky College of Law. My point, however, is simple: government and \nsociety should promote a world where it is more desirable to create \ngoods and services than it is to create lawsuits.\n  The chilling effects of our country's litigation epidemic are felt \nthroughout our national economy--especially by our small businesses. We \nmust act to remove the litigation harness from the backs of our small \nbusinesses.\n  The Small Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act is a narrowly crafted \nbill which seeks to restore some rationality, certainty, and civility \nto the legal system. Specifically, this bill would offer limited relief \nto businesses or organizations that have fewer than 25 full-time \nemployees.\n  First, the bill seeks to provide some reasonable limits on punitive \ndamages, which typically serve as a windfall to plaintiffs. The bill \nprovides that punitive damages may be awarded against a small business \nonly if the claimant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that \nthe business engaged in wanton or willful conduct. The bill would also \nlimit the amount of punitive damages that may be awarded against a \nsmall business to, the lesser of: First, $250,000, or second, two times \nthe amount awarded to the claimant for economic and noneconomic losses. \nThird, the bill provides that a business' responsibility for \nnoneconomic losses would be in proportion to the business' \nresponsibility for causing the harm. Any other defendants in the action \nwho are not small businesses would continue to be held jointly and \nseverally liable.\n  Now, let me explain what this bill does not do. It does not close the \ncourthouse door to plaintiffs who sue small businesses. For example, \nthis bill does not limit a plaintiff's ability to sue a small business \nfor an act of negligence, or any other act, for that matter. The\n\n[[Page S5350]]\n\nbill also does not abolish joint and several liability for economic \nlosses.\n  Mr. President, this is a sensible, narrowly tailored piece of \nlegislation that is greatly needed to free up the enterprising spirit \nof our small businesses. I look forward to Senate's consideration of \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to join my good friend, \nSenator Abraham, in introducing the Small Business Lawsuit Abuse \nProtection Act. As a member of the Senate's Small Business Committee, I \nhave focused on helping small businesses succeed in an increasingly \ncompetitive environment.\n  Small businesses are vulnerable to abusive lawsuits. Take for example \nthe case of Dixie Flag Manufacturing, a small business in Texas that \nmanufactures American flags. The company was named in an injury lawsuit \nclaiming it manufactured an unreasonably dangerous product--a flag--\nthat failed to carry proper instructions or warning labels. Ironically, \nDixie Flag Manufacturing did not even make the flag involved in the \ninjury prompting the lawsuit. In fact, its only connection to the \nincident was that it happened to be in the business of manufacturing \nAmerican flags. Nevertheless, this mall family-owned business was \nforced to settle out of court in order to avoid large legal fees.\n  The cost of obtaining product liability insurance has skyrocketed \nover the last 20 years, and small businesses have been \ndisproportionately affected. A recent Gallup survey found that the fear \nof lawsuits drove 20 percent of small businesses not to hire more \nemployees, expand the business, introduce a new product, or improve an \nexisting one.\n  I recently authored the Volunteer Protection Act to shield volunteers \nfrom unreasonable and costly lawsuits, and it received overwhelming \nsupport in Congress because it takes real action to promote \nvoluntarism. Frivolous and absurd lawsuits are having a chilling effect \non the volunteer community. Consequently, the Volunteer Protection Act \ndeserves the President's unqualified support.\n  The Gallup study demonstrates that the threat of frivolous lawsuits \nis having a similar chilling effect on small business. Simply put, the \nSmall Business Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act, which has been modeled \nafter the Volunteer Protection Act, would provide needed protections \nfor small businesses from abusive and frivolous lawsuits.\n  Let me take this opportunity to briefly describe how the Small \nBusiness Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act would protect small businesses, \nspecifically those with fewer than 25 full-time employees.\n  First, it would require that clear and convincing evidence of gross \nnegligence must be present before punitive damages could be awarded \nagainst a small business. Second, it would place sensible limits on \npunitive damages, which could potentially bankrupt a small business. \nThird, it would provide for proportionate liability for small business.\n  It is important to note that this legislation would give States the \nflexibility to impose conditions and to make exceptions to the granting \nof liability protection. In addition, it would allow States to opt for \ncases where all parties are citizens of that State.\n  Finally, it is important to note that the bill clearly states which \nactions would not entitle a small business to protection. Any \nmisconduct constituting a crime of violence, an act of international \nterrorism, a hate crime, a sexual offense, or a civil rights violation \nor misconduct occurring while under the influence of alcohol or drugs \nwould not be covered.\n  Mr. President, this is Small Business Week. Accordingly, all citizens \nshould take a moment during this year's Small Business Week to \nrecognize our economy's dependence on small business and realize the \nimportance of nurturing their development. For Georgia, as is the case \nfor the whole Nation, small businesses are the jobs provider and the \nbackbone of our economy. The Small Business Administration reports that \nnearly 98 percent of the firms in Georgia that provide employment are \nsmall businesses. Moreover, it is estimated there are an additional \n213,000 self-employed entrepreneurs in my State.\n  What better time to highlight the importance of providing small \nbusiness much-needed relief from abusive lawsuits than during Small \nBusiness Week? I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting the Small \nBusinesses Lawsuit Abuse Protection Act and in protecting small \nbusinesses from abusive litigation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 837. A bill to exempt qualified current and former law enforcement \nofficers from State laws prohibiting the carrying of concealed firearms \nand to allow States to enter into compacts to recognize other States' \nconcealed weapons permits; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 concealed weapons permits legislation\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch and Senator Craig as \noriginal cosponsors of this legislation.\n\n  This bill would both authorize States to recognize each other's \nconcealed weapons laws and would exempt qualified current and former \nlaw enforcement officers from State laws prohibiting the carrying of \nconcealed firearms. This legislation is designed to support the rights \nof States and to facilitate the right of law-abiding citizens as well \nas law enforcement officers to protect themselves, their families, and \ntheir property.\n  The language of this bill is similar to a provision in S. 3, the \nOmnibus Crime Control Act of 1997, introduced earlier this year by the \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch. In light of \nthe importance of this provision to law-abiding gunowners and law \nenforcement officers, I am introducing this freestanding bill today for \nthe Senate's consideration and prompt action.\n  This bill allows States to enter into agreements known as compacts to \nrecognize the concealed weapons laws of those States included in the \ncompacts. This is not a Federal mandate; it is strictly voluntary for \nthose States interested in this approach. States would also be allowed \nto include provisions which best meet their needs, such as special \nprovisions for law enforcement personnel.\n  This legislation would allow anyone possessing a valid permit to \ncarry a concealed firearm in their respective State to also carry one \nin another State, provided that the States have entered into a compact \nagreement which recognizes the host State's right-to-carry laws. This \nis needed if you want to protect the security individuals enjoy in \ntheir own State when they travel or simply cross State lines to avoid a \ncrazy quilt of differing laws.\n  I use my own experience in Colorado as a former deputy sheriff and as \na person who just lives 9 miles from the New Mexico border and within \nan hour's drive of both Arizona and Utah as a person who is caught in \nthis kind of crazy quilt. I have always been a law-abiding citizen. I \nhave a permit to carry a gun in Colorado, but if I go south just 5 \nminutes into New Mexico, I have to comply with a different standard, \nand this bill would correct this different standard.\n  Currently, a Federal standard governs the conduct of nonresidents in \nthose States that do not have a right-to-carry statute. Many of us in \nthis body have always strived to protect the interests of States and \ncommunities by allowing them to make important decisions on how their \naffairs should be conducted. We are taking to the floor almost every \nday to talk about mandating certain things to the States. This bill \nwould allow States to decide for themselves.\n  Specifically, it allows that the law of each State govern conduct \nwithin that State where the State has a right-to-carry statute, and \nStates determine through a compact agreement which out-of-State right-\nto-carry statute will be recognized.\n  To date, 31 States have passed legislation making it legal to carry \nconcealed weapons. These State laws enable citizens of those States to \nexercise their right to protect themselves, their families, and their \nproperty.\n  Applicants, of course, must be law-abiding citizens and pass their \nState's firearm training requirements. In my State of Colorado, the \nState legislature has passed a bill which puts into place statewide \nuniform standards for concealed weapons permits.\n  The second major provision of this bill would allow qualified current \nand\n\n[[Page S5351]]\n\nformer law enforcement officers who are carrying appropriate written \nidentification of that status to be exempt from State laws that \nprohibit the carrying of concealed weapons. This provision sets forth a \nchecklist of stringent criteria that law enforcement officers must meet \nin order to qualify for this exemption status. Exempting qualified \ncurrent and former law enforcement officers from State laws prohibiting \nthe carrying of concealed weapons, I believe, would add additional \nforces to our law enforcement community in our unwavering fight against \ncrime.\n  I share the view of the Judiciary Committee chairman, Senator Hatch, \nas reflected in his legislation, that the need to establish greater \nnational uniformity concerning the entitlement of active and retired \nlaw enforcement officers to carry weapons across State lines is \nparamount. That is why I have included this provision in this bill. To \nour friends who do not believe in the right to bear arms, I recommend \nreading this morning's Washington Post. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 5, 1997]\n\n            Seven Slain in District in 36 Hours of Violence\n\n                (By Brian Mooar and Avis Thomas-Lester)\n\n       Two men were fatally shot yesterday in separate incidents \n     in Southeast Washington in a deadly 36-hour period in which \n     seven people were killed in the city, police said.\n       At least four other people were wounded by gunfire.\n       the unusual flurry of violence stretched the resources of \n     the D.C. police homicide branch, sending investigators from \n     one end of Washington to the other as reports came in about \n     shootings.\n       ``Everybody has their hands full, running here and running \n     there,'' Sgt. Marvin Lyons, a homicide squad supervisor, said \n     last night.\n       ``My detectives have been working around the clock and on \n     the multitude of different cases, and then this latest group \n     of homicides happens,'' said Capt. Alan Dreher, head of the \n     homicide unit for the last two years. ``I don't know if it's \n     a record, but it is certainly the highest number of homicides \n     I've seen in a 24- or 36-hour period since I've been \n     commander of homicide.''\n       The latest shooting occurred about 11 p.m. in the \n     Washington Highlands neighborhood in far Southeast \n     Washington. Police said that a woman and two men were shot \n     and wounded by gunfire in the 4200 block of Sixth Street SE.\n       That scene was not far from a shooting about eight hours \n     earlier that left one man dead near Sixth and Chesapeake \n     Streets SE.\n       Another man was killed about 1:30 p.m. yesterday near the \n     Kentucky Courts apartment complex in the 200 block of \n     Kentucky Avenue SE.\n       The names of those shot, including a man wounded on 50th \n     Street NE about 9 p.m., had not been released last night.\n       While keeping up with the two fatal shootings yesterday, \n     homicide detectives were investigating Tuesday's fatal \n     shootings of three young men in Northeast Washington and the \n     discovery of two bodies in Northwest.\n       Officers on patrol in the 5800 block of Blaine Street NE \n     about 4 p.m. Tuesday saw what appeared to be two men sitting \n     in a car in an alley. But when the officers checked on them, \n     officials said, they discovered that both men had been shot \n     several times.\n       They were identified as Norman Isaac, 18, of the 100 block \n     of 59th Street NE, and William Alonzo Powell III, 23, of the \n     100 block of 58th Place NE, police said.\n       Later Tuesday, Bernard Campbell Allen, 17, was shot \n     multiple times about 11 p.m. at 16th and E streets NE. Allen, \n     of the 9300 block of Edmonston Road in Greenbelt, was taken \n     to D.C. General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead a few \n     hours later, police said.\n       About 9 a.m. Tuesday, police found the body of an \n     unidentified woman who had been stabbed to death and left in \n     an alley in Columbia Heights. Later in the day, the body of \n     an unidentified man was found in the trunk of a car in the \n     1400 block of Chapin Street NW.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. This appeared this morning, and is a story about seven \npeople slain in violence in the last 36 hours in Washington, DC, four \nor more wounded in just that same 36-hour period. And I would point out \nthat this is a city that has the tightest gun control laws in the \nNation, so tight in fact that not a Senator or Congressman, not a \nSupreme Court Justice, for that matter, can carry a concealed weapon. \nIt seems like only the bad guys can carry them in this town.\n  I do ask unanimous consent that Senator Hatch be added as an original \ncosponsor to this bill and it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 837\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to \neliminate legal impediments to quotation in decimals for securities \ntransactions in order to protect investors and to promote efficiency, \ncompetition, and capital formation; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n               the common cents stock pricing act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, today Senator Bond, Senator Moseley-Braun, \nand I are introducing legislation to require stocks to be traded in a \nmuch more consumer-friendly fashion with the added benefit of saving \ninvestors billions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, I send that legislation to the desk for its \nintroduction.\n  Let me just say parenthetically this is not the first time that I \nhave had the privilege of working with the senior Senator from Missouri \non legislation that affects vital consumer interests. He and I had the \nopportunity to work over several previous Congresses and secured in the \nlast Congress significant changes to Federal law that protect consumers \nin terms of correcting information on their consumer histories, the \nlargest single complaint before the Federal Trade Commission, and \nthrough his leadership and support and sustained efforts we were able \nto accomplish that. So I look forward to working with him on the piece \nof legislation that we introduce today, with the only caveat that I \nhope my distinguished colleague and I might be more helpful in getting \nthis passed in a sooner period of time than we did on our previous \nenterprise which took three successive Congresses to work through.\n  This legislation would bring to an end an antiquated pricing system \ncurrently used by Wall Street to buy and sell stocks that dates back to \ncolonial times when the New York Stock Exchange was founded in the 18th \ncentury and the dollar was denominated in pieces of eight. While every \nother pricing system in our country has moved to dollars and cents, \nWall Street continues to use this outdated eighths pricing system.\n  As one article pointed out, and I quote, ``Imagine going to the \ngrocery store and seeing bacon selling for $3\\3/8\\ and chicken potpies \nfor $1\\5/8\\.'' Mr. President, not only has every other pricing system \nin America moved to dollars and cents, but all other major stock \nexchanges in the world--all--have abandoned the antiquated eighths \nsystem and now trade in decimals.\n  The bill that we are introducing today is a companion piece of \nlegislation to H.R. 1053 sponsored in the House of Representatives by \nCongressmen Oxley, Markey and Bliley. This legislation would direct the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission to, within 1 year after the \nenactment of the legislation, adopt a rule to transition the stock and \noption markets away from their current trading practice in eighths to \ntrading in dollars and cents.\n  Currently, the New York Stock Exchange has a rule which mandates a \nminimum quote of an eighth for a share of stock trading in excess of \n$1. This rule is sanctioned by the Securities and Exchange Commission. \nOtherwise, it would be a blatant example of price-fixing. This \nlegislation would require the SEC to revise this sanction to better \nrepresent the interests of consumers and investors throughout the \ncountry.\n  I must say, Mr. President, I have been encouraged by recent newspaper \nreports which suggest that the New York Stock Exchange plans to move to \none-sixteenth of a dollar and in 2 years to switch to decimals. If \nthose reports are in fact confirmed--and I am informed that there is a \nmeeting today in which formal action will be taken to that effect--then \nthe members of the New York Stock Exchange are to be commended for \nmoving in the right direction. I would note, however, that there are \nother stock exchanges in the United States which have not yet indicated \nthat is their course of action, and so this legislation will be \nnecessary to ensure that all take that step.\n  There are currently 60 million Americans who participate directly in \nthe stock markets who would benefit from change. Large pension funds \nand small investors alike would benefit. According to SEC Commissioner \nSteven Wallman, investors would end up saving between $5 billion to $10 \nbillion each year if stocks were traded in increments of dollars and \ncents rather than in the current practice of trading in eighths. It is \nnot uncommon for a 500-million share day to occur on a given day, so a \nsmall change in the spread would mean enormous savings for investors.\n  Many of us are reluctant to have Government intervene in the \nmarketplace. Private sector determinations ought to be the rule, not \nthe exception, here in America. In point of fact, we do not have a free \nmarket at work here. In fact, we have a classic example of price \ncollusion. Wall Street dictates that this antiquated system be used and \nthat all dealers must adhere to it. In essence, we are not interfering \nwith the free market system; we are stepping in to help the stock \nmarket act more like a free market.\n  We are not trying to dictate the spreads that could be charged in the \nbuying and selling of stocks or the profits that Wall Street can make. \nIn my judgment, that would be appropriate. If this legislation is \nenacted, however, stocks would be traded in dollars and cents and then \nthe free market can more accurately determine what the prices and \nspreads should be. This is the essence of a free market. This is the \nessence of free enterprise. It seems appropriate as we move into the \n21st century. It is time the United States joined the rest of the world \nin using a more rational, understandable system of stock transactions.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Bryan in \nintroducing the Common Cents Stock Pricing Act of 1997. I thank Senator \nBryan for his leadership in this measure. As he indicated in his \ncomments, we worked together through three sessions of Congress to pass \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act. Numerous members of staff came and went \nwhile we were trying to get this commonsense consumer measure passed, \nand I only hope, as he indicated, that we will not have a similar 6-\nyear battle on this one, because I think the bill is very simple, very \nstraightforward, and reflects common sense. It calls for the markets to \nget on in the business of trading in plain numbers, dollars and cents, \ninstead of fractions.\n  The Common Cents Stock Pricing Act will make stock prices easier to \nunderstand for the average small investor. It will also force stock \ndealers to compete in pennies, which should result in lower transaction \ncosts and investor savings.\n  Our Nation's stock markets use pricing methodologies which date back \nto the 18th century, when colonies used Spanish dollars as their \ncurrency. Traders would chisel these ancient coins into ``pieces of \neight'' or ``bits'' and use them to purchase commodities. When \norganized stock trading began in New York in 1792, stock prices were \nquoted in bits, or eighths.\n  Mr. President, 200 years later, the time has come to move beyond this \npricing system. We don't use Spanish coins today, we don't use bits, \nand we don't need confusing price systems.\n  The pricing system based on ancient coins is not only out of date, \nbut it is difficult for the average investor to understand. At least \none newspaper has recognized this fact. The San Francisco Chronical \nrecently began printing its tables in dollars and cents, instead of \nfractions. Others, including the Boston Globe and USA Today have called \non the stock exchanges to move to a penny pricing system.\n  Small investors also stand to benefit financially from the move to \npricing by the penny rather than by the bit. SEC Commissioner Steve \nWallman estimates investors lose a minimum of $1.5 billion a year under \nthe current system. Other experts put the figure in the $4 to $9 \nbillion range.\n  Let me just explain why small investors lose in the current \nenvironment. Stock exchange rules effectively limit the minimum spread \nbetween a stock's buy-and-sell price to one-eighth of a dollar, or 12.5 \ncents. This means that floor traders earn at least 12.5 cents from \ninvestors on every trade. Large investor institutions can get better \ndeals on their trades by negotiating prices on block trades, but the \naverage small investor has to pay the full fare.\n  Penny stock pricing is also in step with the rest of the world. The \nU.S. is\n\n[[Page S5353]]\n\nthe only major market that trades in eighths; every other country uses \ndecimal pricing. If we are going to maintain our role as the dominant \nplayer in world markets, the U.S. must keep pace and move to a system \nof decimal pricing.\n  The bill we are introducing today is straightforward. It simply calls \non the Securities and Exchange Commission to promulgate a rule, within \n1 year after the enactment date of the legislation, to transition the \nstock and option markets away from fractionalized trading, bits \ntrading, into dollars and cents pricing.\n  I think the bill is an appropriate way for the Government to regulate \nfinancial markets. The Common Cents Stock Pricing Act does not \nmicromanage the markets by dictating what the spread will be. The \ncompetition and the markets will determine the spread. The \nimplementation of the SEC will allow competitive forces to decide what \nthe spread will be.\n  Let me close by saying I also noted the New York Stock Exchange \nannouncement has been made that it will begin trading in sixteenths and \neventually in decimals. I commend Senator Bryan and the sponsors of the \ncompanion House legislation, because their bill was cited as one of the \nreasons that the New York Stock Exchange was moving forward. I plan to \nreview the language to ensure that their efforts clearly commit them to \nmove to decimals, and that other exchanges will move to decimals. We \nneed to do so in a reasonable timeframe and not wait until the \nforecasted computer crisis of the year 2000, when all of the computers \ngo back to 1900.\n  Big investors get good deals every day in negotiating stock trade \nprices. I think it is time for the average investor to get a good deal \ntoo. I encourage my colleagues to join me in making sure average \ninvestors are treated equitably. I thank my colleague from Nevada for \nhis work on this issue, and I encourage and invite other Members of the \nSenate to join us in supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 839. A bill to improve teacher mastery and use of educational \ntechnology; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                    the technology for teachers act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today, with the support of \nSenator Murray from the State of Washington, to introduce legislation \nthat will increase the effectiveness of our efforts to improve \neducation in the country. I send to the desk the legislation and ask \nthat it be referred to the appropriate committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the bill is entitled the Technology for \nTeachers Act. Its purpose is to increase the ability of millions of new \nand current teachers to use technology in the classroom.\n  Every school day in my home State of New Mexico and across the \ncountry, computers are being purchased, are being unpacked and are \nbeing delivered to classrooms in the hope that the teachers there will \ndo wonderful things with those computers to assist the educational \nprocess. Sometimes that happens, but most of the time, the computer \nthat is delivered and unpacked is just one more challenge to that \nteacher, one more demand on that teacher's time and one more drain on \nthe energy of that teacher, because no one has given the teacher the \ntraining necessary to be able to do wonderful things with the computer.\n  Most of the teachers in our public schools today started teaching \nbefore the era of personal computers really began and was established.\n  The problem begins with low standards for the preparation of teachers \nto use this new technology and for the licensing of new teachers. This \nis reflected in a chart I have, Mr. President, that I would like to \ncall attention to. This chart demonstrates the following. On the left-\nhand side, we have the States that now require one course in education \ntechnology. You can see that the red area indicates that 32 States now \nrequire a course in education technology. Eighteen of our States \nrequire no instruction in education technology today.\n  But the more problematic part of this chart is the right-hand side, \nwhere we try to depict the new teachers who feel prepared to use \ntechnology in the classroom.\n  You can see that the green area indicates that 90 percent of our new \nteachers do not feel prepared to use technology in the classroom. That \nmeans 90 percent have not had adequate training, including the 90 \npercent who have had that one course that is required in those 32 \nStates. So there is a serious problem.\n  We also have a disturbing imbalance between the high investment we \nare making in equipment on the one hand and our inadequate investment \nin teachers on the other. Let me show a couple of other charts to make \nthat point.\n  This chart tries to make the distinction between the high \navailability of computers in our schools versus the low amount of \nteacher training to use them. Ninety-eight percent of our schools today \nare equipped with some computers. So, clearly, that is a major step \nforward from where we were, for example, 5 or 10 years ago. But if you \nlook at the teachers who took more than 1 day of training in a single \nschool year on how to use those computers, it is 15 percent of our \nteachers. Clearly, that imbalance exists.\n  We are investing in the hardware; we are not investing in training \nthe teachers to use that hardware effectively.\n  Let me show one other chart to make the same point. This is \nconnections to the Internet. This shows a 1997 estimate of the percent \nof schools that are connected to the Internet. About 65 percent of our \nschools have at least some connection to the Internet. When you look, \nthough, down at the classroom level, you see that only 14 percent of \nour classrooms actually have a connection to the Internet.\n  Only 13 percent of schools require some kind of advanced training for \nteachers so that they would know how to take advantage of that hookup \nto the Internet. And teachers who are actually using the Internet to \nhelp with their instruction is only 20 percent. So, again, we have a \nmajor imbalance between the investment in the equipment on the one \nhand, and the inadequate investment in training our teachers on the \nother. The experts say that 30 percent of the total investment we make \nin education technology should be used to train teachers, but right now \nwe spend only 9 percent on teacher training. In my own State of New \nMexico, only 4 percent of the $33 million spent on education technology \ngoes for training teachers. That's less than half the national average \nand less than one seventh what we should be spending on teacher \ntraining.\n\n  I am not saying that the Federal Government has not invested in \nteacher training as a part of school reform. There is a lot of money \nwhich is available for this, but also for a great many other needs. \nClearly, this chart shows that. When we talk about general reform of \neducation, there are four large programs that the Federal Government \nhas. Of course, Title I is by far the largest, Title VI, Goals 2000, \nthe Eisenhower Professional Development Program--all of those programs \nhave funds that arguably can be used for training of teachers in this \nrespect but, in fact, there are other great demands on those funds.\n  When you look at technology for education, we now have the Technology \nLiteracy Program that is funded at $257 million. The request from the \nPresident and the agreement in this year's Budget Resolution is to \nsubstantially increase that in the coming years. But when you look at \ntechnology training for teachers, there is absolutely nothing planned \nfor that or required to be spent on that. This legislation tries to \ncorrect that deficiency.\n  There are no Federal programs today devoted exclusively to technology \ntraining for teachers--either technology training for new teachers that \nare being trained, or technology training for current teachers in the \nwork force.\n  Let me briefly describe what our bill would do, Mr. President. This \nbill has two parts. One would improve the technology training that 2 \nmillion new teachers will get while they are in college during the next \ndecade to try to ensure that as they begin their teaching careers, they \nhave had this instruction.\n  The other part involves the technology training that millions of our\n\n[[Page S5354]]\n\ncurrent teachers will need throughout their teaching careers.\n  For both parts, our legislation provides that the Department of \nEducation would make competitive grants to the States, to the States' \ndepartments of education that are responsible for the licensing of \nteachers and for maintaining high teaching standards. Those States' \ndepartments would then set up competitive grant programs, one to go to \ncolleges of education for innovative programs to train new teachers to \nuse technology; the other set of grants would go to local school \ndistricts for innovative professional development of current teachers.\n  The bill would require that the States' departments of education, the \ncolleges of education, the local school districts, and the education \ntechnology private sector all work together to create these innovative \nteacher training programs. This bill would be a major step forward in \nproviding the necessary training to our teachers so that they can \nbenefit from new technologies and integrate those new technologies into \ntheir instruction.\n  There are some very good examples, happening in a few places, of what \nshould be happening all over the country. For example, the University \nof Missouri has a program that issues a laptop computer to incoming \nfreshmen in their College of Education. It has built telecommunications \nlinks to K-through-12 schools throughout the State of Missouri.\n  This bill would also support some innovative programs similar to the \nprogram we have in New Mexico called the Regional Education Technology \nAssistance Program; it trains five teachers from each of the school \ndistricts in my State. In fact, we have only reached out now and gotten \nthe involvement of 52 of our 89 school districts. But the idea here is \nto get a cadre of teachers who are comfortable with the use of \ntechnology who can then work in their school district to train other \nteachers so that they, too, can be comfortable with the use of that \ntechnology and not have the technology just be a frill which is put \nover in the corner of their classroom for people to use when they don't \nhave other more important activities to pursue.\n  Mr. President, I think this legislation is particularly important \nbecause it tries to deal with the very real resource constraints that \nsome of our school districts face. In my home State, we have a school \ndistrict in Cuba, NM, where they have had to give up their music \ninstruction, they have had to give up their home economics program, in \norder to acquire technology to try to enrich their curriculum. This \nwould provide some additional sources of funds for them so that they \ncould get that technology, they could get the training for the use of \nthat technology. That is the great need that we have at this particular \ntime.\n  I hope very much that we can get a hearing on this bill this summer, \nmove ahead with it, and enact this legislation before the conclusion of \nthis session of the Congress. I think this is a step forward.\n  We have seen significant progress over the last few years in Federal \nsupport for technology and the use of technology in education. The one \ngreat deficiency today is that we do not put enough into training \nteachers so that that technology can be used effectively. This \nlegislation will help to correct that problem.\n  I thank Senator Murray for cosponsoring the legislation. I hope other \ncolleagues will do so as well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM:\n  S. 840. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan exemption from tax gain on sale of a principal residence; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n           the principal residence tax exclusion act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I introduce the Principal Residence \nTax Exclusion Act of 1997. Earlier this year, Representatives Rob \nPortman and Ben Cardin introduced similar legislation, styled H.R. \n1391, in the House of Representatives. In addition, both President \nClinton and former Senator Dole have expressed strong support for a \ncapital gains exclusion for our Nation's homeowners.\n  This is a proposal that enjoys widespread bipartisan support. Now is \nthe time to make good on our promises to help our Nation's families.\n  As everyone knows, moving is a stressful and complicated process. \nBesides worrying about whether to take advantage of a job opportunity \nin another State or to move closer to family members or to accept some \nother reason for relocation, such as a change of residence at \nretirement, people should not have added to all of those complex \ndecisions the worry about paying taxes on the sale of their permanent \nresidence.\n  This act will get the tax code out of the family's decisionmaking \nprocess. It will allow the family to make decisions based on the \nfamily's specific circumstances, not based on constraints imposed by \nthe tax law.\n  What is the current law? Under the current law, capital gains from \nthe sale of principal residences are subject to taxation. However, two \nprovisions exclude many homeowners from the effect of that taxation.\n  First, under the so-called rollover provision, taxpayers can roll \nover gains from the sale of a principal residence into a new residence \nand defer any capital gains tax under certain conditions. One of those \nis that the purchase price of the new residence must exceed the \nadjusted sales price of the previous principal residence. The new \nresidence must be purchased within 2 years of the date of sale of the \nfirst home.\n  There is a second provision which results in many homeowners not \npaying a capital gains tax on a principal residence. And that is the \nage 55 exclusion, a taxpayer is eligible for a one-time permanent \nexclusion of up to $125,000 on any accumulated gain from the sale of \ntheir principal residence. In addition to meeting the age 55 \nrequirement to qualify for this exclusion, the taxpayer must have owned \nthe residence and used it as their principal residence for at least 3 \nyears during the 5 years prior to the sale.\n  A taxpayer is eligible for the exclusion only if neither the taxpayer \nnor the taxpayer's spouse has previously benefited from this exclusion. \nConsequently, Mr. President, to avoid the tax, most people wait until \nthey are eligible for the one-time exclusion or they make what may be \nuneconomic decisions regarding the sale of their home.\n  Mr. President, this is not right. People should be able to move when \nthey want to, not when the tax code makes it financially possible. They \nshould be able to buy a smaller home, if that is what they desire, \nwithout having to pay a tax on the difference between their profit on \nthe sale of the first home and the price of the new home.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue of removing governmental intrusion \nfrom family matters. This is an issue of allowing Americans to be free \nfrom unnecessarily burdensome requirements. This is an issue of \npermitting people to make decisions that will ultimately have a \npositive impact on the American economy.\n  The Principal Residence Tax Exclusion Act would go a long way toward \nresolving each of these issues. I hope that my colleagues will join me \nin supporting this proposal.\n  Under this act, the Principal Residence Tax Exclusion Act, taxpayers \nof any age--I underscore ``any age''--could exclude the gain on the \nsale of a principal residence of up to $500,000 for a married couple \nfiling a joint return, and up to $250,000 for a single taxpayer.\n  To be eligible, the taxpayer must have owned and used the home as the \nprincipal residence for at least 2 of the last 5 years prior to the \nsale. The exclusion will generally be available once every 2 years.\n  This legislation would have a far-reaching impact on the families of \nour Nation. Under the current law, approximately 150,000 families \nannually have taxable gain on the sale of their homes. This number \nwould be even higher. However, concern about the tax causes most people \nto wait until they are eligible for the one-time exclusion or to buy \nincreasingly more expensive homes over time regardless of whether such \npurchases are economically wise or otherwise meet the family's needs.\n  Under the new proposal, the Department of the Treasury estimates that \nonly about 10,000 transactions annually would be subject to taxation. \nSo nearly all families would be relieved of the burdensome \nrecordkeeping requirements and constraints on decisionmaking which are \npart of the current law.\n\n[[Page S5355]]\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to bring to your attention one such \nfamily, a family who I believe represents the concerns of many American \nfamilies. Rudy and Lynn Saumell of Valrico, FL, retired and moved to \nFlorida several years ago after working for a combined total of 60 \nyears in the Connecticut school system. Lynn taught remedial math in \nthe elementary school for 25 years. Rudy taught for 15 years before \nserving as an assistant principal for 20 more years. The Saumells lived \nin their Connecticut home with their two daughters for 23 years. When \nthe Saumells retired 5 years ago, their girls had long since left home; \nthe family's needs had changed.\n  Lynn and Rudy decided to move to Florida to be near some of their \nrelatives and to enjoy the warm climate and a hospitable neighborhood. \nThey no longer needed such a large home. They were moving to a lower \ncost area. But the Saumells were concerned about being taxed on the \nsale of their Connecticut home. So, upon their accountant's advice, \nthey bought a more expensive home than they needed and used both the \none-time exclusion and the rollover provision to avoid paying tax on \ntheir previous residence's sale.\n  In order to qualify under current law, the Saumells had to keep \nextensive records of all of the improvements they made to their \nprevious residence. For over two decades, they complied with the law to \nthe best of their abilities despite the difficulties they encountered \nin doing so.\n  I commend the Saumells for their diligence. I agree with them that \nthese requirements seem unnecessarily burdensome and nearly impossible \nto fulfill without error, omission, or honest misunderstanding.\n  The act I propose would eliminate the need to keep these detailed \nrecords for 99 percent-plus of all Americans. After spending 5 years in \ntheir new home, the Saumells still want to move to a smaller home in a \nretirement community. They are paying more than they would like in \nproperty taxes. Their heat, water, and electric bills would be greatly \nreduced. Instead, Rudy and Lynn would rather spend the money they have \nsaved for traveling and helping their daughters buy homes for their new \nfamilies. Lynn and Rudy do not need such a big home for just the two of \nthem.\n  But the Saumells are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Under the \ncurrent law, if they keep their house they will not be able to spend \ntheir savings as they would like. But if they sell their home and buy a \nless expensive one, they cannot use the over-55 exemption again since \nit is only available once in a lifetime and the rollover provision \nwould not apply since they are not moving to a more expensive home.\n  Thus their savings would be eaten up by a large capital gains tax, \ndefeating the purpose of selling their current residence. So they are \nlocked in the dilemma: Do we stay in a home that is larger than we \nneed, more expensive than we can afford, or do we sell the home and \nsuffer a substantial capital gains tax?\n  Mr. President, why should the Saumells have to base their housing \ndecisions on the Tax Code rather than their family requirements? Why \nshould they be prevented from spending their savings on what they deem \nto be important?\n  Like many Americans who are affected by the capital gains tax on home \nsales, Rudy and Lynn have spent their entire lives working and saving \nfor their retirement and to assist their daughters in starting their \nnew families' lives. It is unfair to deny them the freedom to spend \nthese savings as they wish. So I offer this legislation to allow the \nSaumells and all of our Nation's families more freedom in their \ndecisionmaking, to be able to decide where to live based on their \nfamilies' circumstances, not on the Tax Code.\n  Rudy now volunteers with a local television station to help people \nrecover money that has been wrongfully withheld from them. Isn't it \ntime that we remove the Tax Code restraints on Rudy and help him get \nback the free use of his own money?\n  Mr. President, we have the means, the opportunity, and the support to \nhelp our Nation's families in a very significant way. Passing this \nlegislation is more than providing relief to our Nation's homeowners. \nIt is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the ERC, \nthe Employee Relocation Council, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           The Employee Relocation\n\n\n                                                      Council,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: The Employee Relocation Council \n     (``ERC'') strongly supports your efforts to introduce \n     legislation that would provide a $500,000 exclusion of gain \n     on the sale of a principal residence and we urge that this \n     proposal be included as part of the tax package to be \n     assembled by Congress in the coming weeks. Reducing the tax \n     cost of relocations and improving the economics of home \n     purchase decisions would be beneficial not only to individual \n     taxpayers, but to companies and the economy as well.\n       Currently, taxpayers can rollover gains from their \n     principal residence into a new residence and defer any \n     capital gains tax to the extent that the purchase price is \n     equal to or greater than the adjusted sales price of the old \n     residence. Additionally, a one time $125,000 exclusion \n     ($62,500 for separated individuals) is provided at age 55. \n     These tax rules are extremely complex; encourage relocating \n     employees to purchase increasingly expensive homes regardless \n     of their economic situation and can prevent companies from \n     relocating those employees because of increased relocation \n     costs (attached is an analysis of the benefits to employers \n     and employees that would result from enactment of this \n     proposal).\n       ERC is an association whose members are concerned with \n     employee transfers, the sale and purchase of real estate \n     related to the movement of household goods and other aspects \n     of relocation. ERC's members include some sixty percent (60%) \n     of Fortune 1000 corporations as well as real estate brokers, \n     appraisers, van lines, relocation management companies and \n     other industry professionals. ERC supports initiatives that \n     case the constraints and reduce the costs of moving employees \n     and that allow companies and individuals to relocate based on \n     sound economic decisions. ERC believes that one of the keys \n     to success in today's international marketplace is workforce \n     mobility, which enhances the ability of companies to compete \n     internationally and is reflected in improved national \n     productivity and efficiency. The complexity and costs imposed \n     by the current tax rules act as a detriment and forces \n     employers and employees to make decisions based on tax law \n     and not economic soundness. Accordingly, ERC endorses your \n     efforts to enact legislation that would provide for a \n     $500,000 exclusion of gain on the sale of a principal \n     residence.\n           Sincerely,\n     H. Cris Collie,\n       Executive Vice President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 841. A bill to authorize construction of the Fort Peck Reservation \nRural Water System in the State of Montana, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        The Fort Peck Reservation Rural Water System Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, today I introduce a bill that will ensure \nthe Assiniboine and Sioux people of the Fort Peck Reservation in \nMontana a safe and reliable water supply system. The Fort Peck \nReservation is located in northeastern Montana. It is one of the \nlargest reservations in the United States, and has a population of more \nthan 10,000. The Fort Peck Reservation faces problems similar to all \nreservations in the country, that of remote rural areas. This \nreservation also suffers from a very high unemployment rate, 75 \npercent. Added to all this, the populations on the reservation suffer \nfrom high incidents of heart disease, high blood pressure, and \ndiabetes. A safe and reliable source of water is needed to both improve \nthe health status of the residents and to encourage economic \ndevelopment and thereby self-sufficiency for this area.\n  This legislation would authorize a reservation-wide municipal, rural, \nand industrial water system for the Fort Peck Reservation. It would \nprovide a much needed boost to the future of the region and for \neconomic development, and ultimately economic self-sufficiency for the \nentire area. My bill has the support of the residents of the \nreservation and the endorsement of the tribal council of the \nAssiniboine and Sioux Tribes.\n  The residents of the Fort Peck Reservation are now plagued with major \ndrinking water problems. In one of the communities, the sulfate levels \nin the water are four times the standard for safe drinking water. In \nfour of the communities the iron levels are five times\n\n[[Page S5356]]\n\nthe standard. Sadly, some families were forced to abandon their homes \nas a result of substandard water quality. Basically, the present water \nsupply system is inadequate and unreliable to supply a safe water \nsupply to those people that live on the reservation.\n  Several of the local water systems have had occurrences of biological \ncontamination in recent years. As a result, the Indian Health Service \nhas been forced to issue several health alerts for drinking water. In \nmany cases, residents of reservation communities are forced to purchase \nbottled water. Not a big deal to those who can afford it, but difficult \nto a population that has the unemployment rate found on the \nReservation. All this, despite the fact that within spitting distance \nis one of the largest man-made reservoirs in the United States, built \non the Missouri River.\n  Agriculture continues to maintain the No. 1 position in terms of \neconomic impact in Montana. In a rural area like the Fort Peck \nReservation agriculture plays the key role in the economy, more so than \nin many areas of the State. The water system authorized by the \nlegislation will not only provide a good source of drinking water, but \nalso a water supply necessary to protect and preserve the livestock \noperations on the reservation. A major constraint on the growth of the \nlivestock industry around Fort Peck has been the lack of an \nadequate watering site for cattle. This water supply system would \nprovide the necessary water taps to fill watering tanks for livestock, \nwhich in normal times would boost the local economy of the region and \nthe State. An additional benefit of this system would be more effective \nuse of water for both water and soil conservation and rangeland \nmanagement.\n\n  The future water needs of the reservation are expanding. Data shows \nthat the reservation population is growing, as many tribal members are \nreturning to the reservation. It is clear that the people that live on \nthe reservation, both tribal and nontribal members, are in desperate \nneed of a safe and reliable source of drinking water.\n  The solutions to this need for an adequate and safe water supply is a \nreservation wide water pipeline that will deliver a safe and reliable \nsource of water to the residents. In addition this water project will \nbe constructed in size to allow communities off the reservation the \nfuture ability to tap into the system. A similar system for water \ndistribution is currently in use on a reservation in South Dakota.\n  The surrounding communities have also agreed with the importance of \nthis system. Last year when I introduced this bill, there were no \nadditional communities signed on to the system. Today, the surrounding \ncommunities have signed on and look at this system as a means of \nsupplying clean, safe drinking water to their residents.\n  The people of the Fort Peck Reservation, and the State of Montana are \nonly asking for one basic life necessity. Good, clean, safe drinking \nwater. This is something that the more developed regions of the Nation \ntake for granted, but in rural America we still seek to develop.\n  I realize the importance of getting this bill introduced and placed \nbefore the proper committee. This action will allow us to move forward \nand provide a basic necessity to the people of this region in Montana. \nGood, clean, safe drinking water.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Burns today \nin introducing legislation that authorizes the construction of a \nmunicipal, rural, and industrial water system for the Assiniboine and \nSioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation.\n  The reservation has long been plagued by major drinking water \nproblems including both inadequate supplies and unacceptable water \nquality. Ground water, the primary source of drinking water for many \nreservation residents, often exceeds the standards for total dissolved \nsolids, iron, sulfates, nitrates, and in some cases for selenium, \nmanganese and fluorine.\n  Bacterial contamination of domestic water supplies has also been a \nrecurring problem. On several occasions the Indian Health Service and \nTribal Health Office have had to issue public health alerts regarding \ndrinking water. In short, the very health of residents of the Fort Peck \nReservation depends on construction of this pipeline.\n  A safe and adequate supply of water is a necessity if the Fort Peck \nNation is to realize its dream of economic development and full \nemployment. The reservation economy is based on ranching and farming \nbut expansion of agricultural operations is severely limited by the \nlack of adequate stockwater supplies. Additionally more effective \ndistribution of water would result in more effective soil conservation \nand improvement of the native rangeland.\n  The Bureau of Reclamation has determined that a regional MR water \nsupply system using water from the Missouri River is a feasible \nalternative for addressing the serious water problems facing Fort Peck. \nThis legislation will make that alternative a reality for the people of \nthe Fort Peck Reservation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting authorization of this \ncritical project.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Craig, and Mr. \n        Hutchinson):\n  S. 842. A bill to provide for the immediate application of certain \norders relating to the amendment, modification, suspension, or \nrevocation of certificates under chapter 447 of title 49, United States \nCode; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                revocation of certifications legislation\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been working with representatives \nof the aviation industry on legislation that will address a problem \nwith the Federal Aviation Administration. Let me, first of all, say \nthat back in real life I have been a professional pilot for some 40 \nyears. I am a little bothered, too, at some of the things taking place \nin the aviation industry. I have seen great injustice done many, many \ntimes, having to do with the emergency revocation powers of the FAA. In \na revocation action, brought on an emergency basis, the certificate \nholder loses use of his certificate immediately, without an \nintermediary review by an impartial third party. The result is that the \ncertificate holder is grounded and, in most cases, is out of work until \nthe issue is adjudicated. I believe the FAA unfairly uses this \nnecessary power to prematurely revoke certificates when the \ncircumstances do not support such drastic action. A more reasonable \napproach, Mr. President, when safety is not an issue, would be to \nadjudicate the revocation on a nonemergency basis, allowing the \ncertificate holder to continue use of his certificate.\n  Please don't misunderstand me. In no way do I want to suggest that \nthe FAA should not have emergency revocation powers. I believe it is \ncritical to safety that the FAA can ground unsafe airmen and other \ncertificate holders. However, I also believe that the FAA must be \njudicious in its use of this extraordinary power. A review of recent \nemergency cases clearly demonstrates a pattern by which the FAA uses \ntheir emergency powers as standard procedure rather than an \nextraordinary measure.\n  Perhaps the most visible case is that of Bob Hoover, who happens to \nprobably be the best pilot in America today. He is up in age. I have \nwatched him and have been in a plane with him. He can set a glass of \nwater on the panel of an airplane and do a barrel roll without spilling \nany of the water. He is highly regarded as an aerobatic pilot. In 1992, \nhis medical certificate was revoked based on alleged questions \nregarding his cognitive abilities. After getting a clean bill of health \nfrom four separate sets of doctors--just one of the many tests cost Bob \n$1,700--and over the continuing objections of the Federal air surgeon, \nwho never even examined Bob Hoover personally, his medical certificate \nwas reinstated only after then-Administrator David Henson intervened. \nAnd I want to take this opportunity to tell David Henson what a great \njob he did for aviation, and for one person.\n  Unfortunately, Bob Hoover is not out of the woods yet.\n  His current medical certificate expires on September 30, 1997. Unlike \nmost airmen who can renew their medical certificate with a routine \napplication and exam, Bob has to furnish the FAA with a report of a \nneurological evaluation every 12 months.\n  It is a very expensive and unnecessary process.\n\n[[Page S5357]]\n\n  Mr. President, Bob Hoover's experience is just one of many. In a way, \nhis wasn't as bad, because some of them do this--like professional \nairline pilots--for a living.\n  I have several other examples of pilots who have had their licenses \nrevoked on an emergency basis. Pilots such as Ted Stewart who has been \nan American Airlines pilot for more than 12 years and is presently a \nBoeing 767 captain. Until January 1995, Mr. Stewart had no complaints \nregistered against him or his flying. In January 1995 the FAA suspended \nMr. Stewart's examining authority as part of a larger FAA effort to \nrespond to a problem of falsified ratings. The full NTSB board \nexonerated Mr. Stewart in July 1995. In June 1996, he received a second \nrevocation. One of the charges in this second revocation involved \nfalsification of records for a flight instructor certificate with \nmultiengined rating and his air transport pilot [ATP] certificate \ndating back to 1979.\n  Like most, I have questioned how an alleged 17\\1/2\\-year-old \nviolation could constitute an emergency; especially, since he has not \nbeen cited for any cause in the intervening years. Nonetheless, the FAA \nvigorously pursued this action. On August 30, 1996, the NTSB issued its \ndecision in this second revocation and found for Mr. Stewart. A couple \nof comments in the Stewart decision bear closer examination. First, the \nboard notes that:\n\n       The administrator's loss in the earlier case appears to \n     have prompted further investigation of respondent . . .\n\n  I find this rather troubling that an impartial third party appears to \nbe suggesting that the FAA has a vendetta against Ted Stewart. This is \nfurther emphasized with a footnote in which the Board notes:\n\n       [We,] of course, [are] not authorized to review the \n     Administrator's exercise of his power to take emergency \n     certificate action . . . We are constrained to register in \n     this matter, however, our opinion that where, as here, no \n     legitimate reason is cited or appears for not consolidating \n     all alleged violations into one proceeding, subjecting an \n     airman in the space of a year to two emergency revocations, \n     and thus to the financial and other burdens associated with \n     an additional 60-day grounding without prior notice and \n     hearing, constitutes an abusive and unprincipled discharge of \n     an extraordinary power.\n\n  Joining with me today is John Breaux of Louisiana. John has a \nconstituent, Frank Anders who has taken the lead gathering other \nexamples of FAA abuses with regard to their emergency revocation \nauthority. One in particular is Raymond A. Williamson who was a pilot \nfor Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Like Ted Stewart, he was accused of being \npart of a ring of pilots who falsified type records for vintage \naircraft.\n  As in all of the cases received by my office, Mr. Williamson biggest \nconcern is that the FAA investigation and subsequent revocation came \nout of the blue. In November 1994, he was notified by his employer--\nCoca-Cola--that FAA inspectors had accused him of giving illegal check \nrides in company owned aircraft. He was fired. In June 1995, he \nreceived an emergency order of revocation. In over 30 years as an \nactive pilot, he had never had an accident, incident, or violation. Nor \nhad he ever been counseled by the FAA for any action or irregularities \nas a pilot, flight instructor or FAA designated pilot examiner.\n  In May 1996, FAA proposed to return all his certificates and ratings, \nexcept his flight instructor certificate. As in the Ted Stewart case, \nit would appear that FAA found no real reason pursue an emergency \nrevocation.\n  Mr. President, I obviously cannot read the collective minds of the \nNTSB board, but I believe a reasonable person would conclude that in \nthe Ted Stewart case the Board, believes as I do, that there is an \nabuse of emergency revocation powers by the FAA.\n  This is borne out further by the fact that since 1989, emergency \ncases as a total of all enforcement actions heard by the NTSB has more \nthan doubled. In 1989 the NTSB heard 1,107 enforcement cases. Of those, \n66 were emergency revocation cases or 5.96 percent. In 1995, the NTSB \nheard 509 total enforcement cases, of those 160 were emergency \nrevocation cases or 31.43 percent. I believe it is clear that the FAA \nhas begun to use an exceptional power as a standard practice.\n  In response, I and Senators Craig, Hutchinson, and Breaux are \nintroducing legislation that would establish a procedure by which the \nFAA must show just cause for bringing an emergency revocation action \nagainst a certificate holder. Many within the aviation community have \nreferred to this needed legislation as the Hoover bill.\n  Not surprisingly, Mr. President, the FAA opposes this language. They \nalso opposed changes to the civil penalties program where they served \nas the judge, jury, and executioner in civil penalty actions against \nairmen. Fortunately, we were able to change that so that airmen can now \nappeal a civil penalty case to the NTSB. This has worked very well \nbecause the NTSB has a clear understanding of the issues.\n\n  Our proposal allows an airman within 48 hours of receiving an \nemergency revocation order to request a hearing before the NTSB on the \nemergency nature of the revocation. NTSB then has 48 hours to hear the \narguments. Within 5 days of the initial request, NTSB must decide if a \ntrue emergency exists. During this time, the emergency revocation \nremains in effect.\n  That means that the pilot does not have his certificate and cannot \nfly an airplane. In many cases, this is a means of a living. But that \nis for 7 days.\n  In other words, the certificate holder loses use of his certificate \nfor a maximum of 7 days. However, should the NTSB decide an emergency \ndoes not exist, then the certificate would be returned and the \ncertificate holder could continue to use it while the FAA pursued their \nrevocation case against him in an expedited appeal process as provided \nfor by the bill. If the NTSB decides that an emergency does exist, then \nthe emergency revocation remains in effect and the certificate holder \ncannot use his certificate while the case is adjudicated.\n  This bill is supported by: the Air Line Pilots Association, \nInternational; the Air Transport Association; the Allied Pilots \nAssociation, Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association; the Experimental \nAircraft Association; National Air Carrier Association; National Air \nTransportation Association; National Business Aircraft Association; the \nNTSB Bar Association; and the Regional Airline Association.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated March 11, \n1997, to me from the above mentioned organizations be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 11, 1997.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: The undersigned associations and \n     organizations endorse and support your proposed legislation, \n     the FAA Emergency Revocation Act of 1997, to reform the \n     Federal Aviation Administration enforcement process in an \n     important respect.\n       It has become apparent to us in recent years that the FAA \n     has significantly increased its use of its emergency \n     authority to immediately suspend or revoke airmen, air \n     carrier, and air agency certificates, thereby avoiding the \n     automatic stay of such action provided by law pending appeal \n     to the National Transportation Safety Board. This legislation \n     will accord due process to certificate holders by providing a \n     more adequate forum for promptly adjudicating the \n     appropriateness of the FAA's use of this authority. The \n     forum, the same one which will adjudicate the merits of the \n     FAA action, will also adjudicate, on a more timely basis, \n     whether aviation safety requires the immediate effectiveness \n     of a certificate action. The effect will be that in an \n     appropriate case, a certificate holder will be able to \n     exercise the privileges of its certificate while an FAA \n     certificate action is on appeal, all without compromise of \n     aviation safety.\n       We thank you for introducing this legislation, and we look \n     forward to working with you toward its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n         Air Line Pilots Association, International; Allied Pilots \n           Association; Experimental Aircraft Association; \n           National Air Transportation Association; NTSB Bar \n           Association; Air Transport Association; AOPA \n           Legislative Action; National Air Carrier Association; \n           National Business Aircraft Association; Regional \n           Airline Association.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, in closing, this bill will provide due \nprocess to certificate holders where now none exists, without \ncompromising aviation safety. This is a reasonable and prudent response \nto an increasing problem for certificate holders. I hope our colleagues \nwill support our efforts in this regard.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Mack):\n\n[[Page S5358]]\n\n  S. 843. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to simplify \ncertain rules relating to the taxation of United States business \noperating abroad, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n     INTERNATIONAL TAX SIMPLIFICATION FOR AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS \n                              LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would \nprovide much-needed tax relief for American-owned companies that are \nattempting to compete in the world marketplace. I am joined by Senator \nBaucus in introducing the International Tax Simplification for American \nCompetitiveness Act.\n  Mr. President, our country's economy has entered into an environment \nlike no other in our history. The success of the American economy is \nbecoming more and more intertwined with the success of our businesses \nin the global marketplace. As the economic boundaries from country to \ncountry merge closer together, and competition begins to arise from \npreviously lesser-developed nations, it is imperative that American \nowned businesses be able to compete from the most advantageous position \npossible.\n  There are already barriers the U.S. economy must overcome to remain \ncompetitive that Congress cannot hurdle by itself. I know that we have \ninternational trade negotiators working hard to eliminate those \nobstacles, such as barriers to foreign markets, but we can do more than \njust open barriers. We can reform our Tax Code in such a way that would \nensure continued success by American-owned companies in today's highly \ncompetitive international market. There is no need to further impede \nthe economy by saddling it with an outdated and extremely complex Tax \nCode.\n  If we pass on this opportunity, Mr. President, we run the risk of \njeopardizing the international competitiveness of the U.S. economy, as \nAmerican companies are lured to other countries with simple, more \nfavorable tax treatment.\n  The business world is changing at a more rapid pace than any other \ntime in history. Tax laws, unfortunately, have failed to keep pace with \nthe rapid changes in the world economy. The last time the international \nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code were substantially debated and \nrevised was in 1986. Since that time, existing economies have changed, \nand new economies have been created, all while our tax policy regarding \nthis changing market has remained the same. And in several cases, our \nforeign competitors operate under simpler, fairer, and more logical tax \nregimes. The continued use of a confusing, archaic tax code results in \na mismatch with commercial reality and creates a structural bias \nagainst the international activities of U.S. companies. We cannot, and \nshould not, continue to impede the progress of our economy.\n  Mr. President, the bill that I am introducing today seeks to simplify \nand correct various areas in the Internal Revenue Code that are \nunnecessarily restraining American businesses competing in today's \nglobal market. Some of these provisions are similar to those contained \nin the President's recently released simplification package. Some \nchanges come in areas that are in dire need of repair, and others are \nchanges that take into consideration international business operations \nthat exist today, but were either nonexistent, or limited to domestic \nsoil in 1986, when the tax reform laws were put into place.\n  An important correction to current rules relates to Foreign Sales \nCorporation [FSC] treatment for software. When the current FSC rules \nwere implemented 11 years ago, the level of software exports was \nnowhere near the level it is today. Because the Tax Code was not \nmodified with the evolution of the high-technology business world, \nAmerican software exports are currently discriminated against. This \nproposal would clarify that computer software qualifies as export \nproperty eligible for FSC benefits. These benefits are currently \navailable for films, records, and tapes, but not software.\n  The United States is currently the global leader in software \nproduction and development and employs nearly 400,000 people in high-\npaying software development and servicing jobs. The industry has \nexperienced a great deal of growth in the past decade, primarily due to \nincreased exports. If the FSC benefits to software continue to be \ndenied, we are creating another obstacle to the competitiveness of \nAmerican manufactured software, ultimately harming the U.S. economy, \nand putting American jobs at risk.\n  Another important change included in the bill would repeal the 10/50 \ntax credit rules. Currently, the code requires U.S. companies to \ncalculate separate foreign tax credit limitations for each of its \nforeign joint venture businesses in which the U.S. owner owns at least \n10 percent but no more than 50 percent. In addition to creating \nadministrative headaches for American owned companies that may have \nhundreds of such foreign joint venture operations, these rules impede \nthe ability of U.S. companies to compete in foreign markets.\n  It is necessary for businesses in the United States to operate in \njoint ventures worldwide, particularly in emerging, previously closed \nmarkets such as the former Soviet Union and the People's Republic of \nChina. Many times, the joint ventures are needed to assist the United \nStates investor to overcome significant local country and political \nobstacles involved with taking a controlling interest in foreign \ncompanies. This applies particularly to regulated businesses, such as \ntelecommunications companies. While this type of joint venture is \nnecessary for companies to enter and compete in foreign markets, the \ncurrent tax law in our country discourages such operations.\n  The bill would permit U.S. owners to compute foreign tax credits with \nrespect to dividends from such entities based on the underlying \ncharacter of the income of these entities, or the so-called look-\nthrough treatment, provided that the necessary information is \navailable. Moreover, the bill includes a provision that would eliminate \nthe overlap in the rules between passive foreign investment companies \n[PFIC] and controlled foreign companies [CFC]. PFIC rules were never \nintended to apply to CFC's. In the Tax Act of 1993, changes were made \nthat created unnecessary duplication in PFIC and CFC rules. Currently, \nthere are several CFC's that are caught under both sets of rules. This \nproposal would eliminate these duplications. If a PFIC is also a CFC, \nthe proposal generally would treat the foreign corporation as a non-\nPFIC with respect to certain 10-percent U.S. shareholders of the CFC.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues take a close look at this \nbill. This is not partisan legislation. It is an attempt to give fair \ntax treatment to American companies who operate abroad, and that, I \nthink, is an objective we all support. The bill is truly a technical \ncorrection and simplification, designed to correct the inequities in \nour Tax Code, and to help place U.S. companies on a level playing field \nwith their competitors in the foreign market. If we do not step up and \nmake these corrections, American companies will lose ground to their \nforeign counterparts, eventually losing their power to operate \nsuccessfully at home and harm our Nation's economic potential. American \nworkers are the most creative, competitive, and hard-working in the \nworld. It is our duty, Mr. President, to release them from any \nunnecessary constraints at home. Their hard work and perseverance will \nenable us to maintain and strengthen our lead in the global \nmarketplace, resulting in more quality, high-paying jobs on American \nsoil, and an even stronger national economy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section summary be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nThe International Tax Simplification for American Competitiveness Act--\n                         Summary of Provisions\n\n\n       title i--treatment of passive foreign investment companies\n\n       Section 101. PFIC/CFC overlap: The overlap between the PFIC \n     and CFC rules would be eliminated. In the case of a PFIC that \n     is also a CFC, the proposal generally would treat the foreign \n     corporation as a non-PFIC with respect to certain 10-percent \n     U.S. shareholders of the CFC. The change generally would be \n     effective for taxable years of U.S. persons beginning after \n     December 31, 1997, and to taxable years of foreign \n     corporations ending with or within such taxable years of U.S. \n     persons, subject to certain holding period requirements.\n       Section 102. PFIC mark-to-market election: A shareholder of \n     a PFIC would be allowed to make a mark-to-market election for \n     PFIC\n\n[[Page S5359]]\n\n     stock that is regularly traded on a qualifying national \n     securities exchange or is otherwise treated as marketable. A \n     similar election generally would be available for regulated \n     investment companies. The provision would be effective for \n     taxable years of U.S. persons beginning after December 31, \n     1997, and to taxable years of foreign corporations ending \n     with or within such taxable years of U.S. persons.\n       Section 103. Clarification of passive income definition: \n     The definition of passive income would be amended for \n     purposes of PFIC provisions by clarifying that the exceptions \n     from the definition of foreign personal holding company \n     income under section 954(c)(3) (regarding certain income \n     received from related persons) do not apply in determining \n     passive income for purposes of the PFIC definition. The \n     change would be effective for taxable years of U.S. persons \n     beginning after December 31, 1997, and to taxable years of \n     foreign corporations ending with or within such taxable years \n     of U.S. persons.\n       Section 104. Effective date of new PFIC provisions: The \n     changes made by the new PFIC provisions (sections 101-103, \n     above) would apply to taxable years of U.S. persons beginning \n     after December 31, 1997, and to taxable yeas of foreign \n     corporations ending with or within such taxable years of U.S. \n     persons.\n\n\n         title ii--treatment of controlled foreign corporations\n\n       Section 201. Extension of divided treatment to dispositions \n     of lower-tier CFCs: Section 1248 dividend treatment would be \n     extended to the sale of a CFC by a CFC where such dividend \n     treatment is provided under current law upon the sale of a \n     CFC by a U.S. shareholder. In addition, a provision added to \n     section 904(d)(2)(E) by the 1988 Act (TAMRA) would be \n     repealed. That provision requires the recipient of a CFC \n     distribution to have been a U.S. shareholder in the CFC \n     when the related earnings were generated to avoid \n     subjecting the distributions to the separate foreign tax \n     credit basket applicable to section 902 corporations. The \n     changes would be effective for gains recognized on \n     transactions or distributions occurring after the date of \n     enactment.\n       Section 202. Miscellaneous modifications to subpart F: The \n     following changes would be made to subpart F:\n       Subpart F inclusions in year of acquisition: The subpart F \n     inclusions of an acquirer of CFC stock would be reduced in \n     the year of acquisition by a portion of the dividend deemed \n     recognized by the transferor under section 1248. The \n     provision would apply to dispositions after the date of \n     enactment.\n       Adjustments to basis of stock: The income inclusion to a \n     U.S. shareholder resulting from an upper-tier CFC's sale of \n     stock in a lower-tier CFC that earns subpart F income would \n     be adjusted, under regulations, to account for previous \n     inclusions by adjusting the basis of the stock. The provision \n     would apply for purposes of determining inclusions for \n     taxable years of U.S. shareholders beginning after December \n     31, 1997.\n       Certain distributions of previously taxed income: The IRS \n     would be authorized to issue regulations to prevent multiple \n     inclusions in income or to provide appropriate basis \n     adjustments in the case of cross-chain section 304 dividends \n     out of the earnings of CFCs that were previously included in \n     the income of a U.S. shareholder under subpart F, or in other \n     circumstances in which there would otherwise be a multiple \n     inclusion or a failure to adjust basis. The provision would \n     be effective on the date of enactment.\n       U.S. income earned by a CFC: A treaty exemption or \n     reduction of the branch profits tax that would be imposed \n     under section 884 with respect to a CFC would not affect the \n     general statutory exemption from subpart F income that is \n     granted for U.S. source effectively connected income. The \n     provision would apply to taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 1986.\n       Section 203. Indirect foreign tax credit allowed for lower \n     tiers: The availability of indirect foreign tax credits would \n     be extended to certain taxes paid or accrued by certain \n     fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-tier foreign corporations. The \n     provision generally would be effective for taxes of a CFC \n     with respect to its taxable years beginning after December \n     31, 1997.\n       Section 204. Exemption for active financing income: Income \n     earned in the active conduct of a banking, financing, or \n     similar business by a CFC would not be treated as foreign \n     personal holding company income if (1) a significant \n     portion of the CFC's income for that business is derived \n     from transactions with unrelated customers in the \n     jurisdiction in which the CFC is organized and the CFC is \n     predominantly engaged in the active conduct of such \n     business, or (2) the CFC's income is derived in the active \n     conduct of a securities or banking business within the \n     meaning of the PFIC rules. In addition, the bill would \n     exclude from subpart F income a qualifying insurance CFC's \n     income from the investment of its assets, subject to \n     certain limitations. The provision would apply to taxable \n     years of foreign corporations beginning after December 31, \n     1997, and to taxable years of U.S. shareholders with or \n     within which such taxable years of foreign corporations \n     end.\n       Section 205. Provide look-through treatment for 10/50 \n     companies: Current law requires U.S. companies operating \n     joint ventures in foreign countries to calculate separate \n     foreign tax credit basket limitations for income earned from \n     each joint venture in which the U.S. owner owns at least 10 \n     percent but no more than 50 percent. The proposal would \n     permit U.S. owners to compute foreign tax credits with \n     respect to dividends from such entities based on the \n     underlying character of the income of these entities (i.e., \n     ``look-through'' treatment), provided that the necessary \n     information is available. Dividends from entities for which \n     the necessary information is unavailable would be aggregated \n     in a single foreign tax credit basket. The provision would \n     apply to dividends paid out of earnings and profits \n     accumulated during taxable years of foreign corporations \n     beginning after December 31, 1997.\n       Section 206. Study of treating European Union as a single \n     country: The Treasury Department would be directed to conduct \n     a study on the feasibility of treating all members of the \n     European Union as a single country for purposes of applying \n     the same country exceptions under subpart F. This study would \n     include consideration of methods of ensuring that taxpayers \n     are subject to a substantial effective rate of foreign tax if \n     such treatment is adopted. A report would be required within \n     six months.\n       Section 207. Expand subpart F de minimis rule: The subpart \n     F de minimis rule under current law excludes all gross income \n     from foreign base company income or insurance income if the \n     sum of the gross foreign base company income and the gross \n     insurance income of the CFC for the taxable year is less than \n     the lesser of five percent of gross income or $1 million. The \n     proposal would expand this rule to the lesser of 10 percent \n     of gross income or $2 million. The provision would apply to \n     taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997.\n       Section 208. Use U.S. GAAP for determining subpart F \n     earnings and profits: Taxpayers would be allowed to use U.S. \n     generally accepted accounting principles to determine subpart \n     F earnings and profits. The provision would apply to \n     distributions during, and the determination of the inclusion \n     under section 951 with respect to, taxable years of foreign \n     corporations beginning after December 31, 1997.\n       Section 209. Clarify treatment of pipeline transportation \n     income: The proposal would exclude income from the pipeline \n     transportation of oil or gas within a foreign country from \n     the statutory definition of ``foreign base company oil \n     related income.'' The provision would apply to taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 1997.\n       Section 210. Expand deduction for dividends from foreign \n     corporations with U.S. income: Under the proposal, the \n     constructive ownership rules of section 318 would apply in \n     determining whether the 80-percent ownership threshold of \n     section 245(a)(5) is satisfied, and the term ``dividend'' \n     would include subpart F inclusions. The provision would apply \n     to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997.\n\n\n                      title iii--other provisions\n\n       Section 301. Translation, redetermination of foreign taxes: \n     Current law requires U.S. taxpayers making foreign tax \n     payments to translate each payment made during the year into \n     U.S. dollars at the exchange rate on the day of payment. The \n     proposal would simplify this rule by generally permitting \n     accrual-basis taxpayers to translate foreign taxes at the \n     average exchange rate for the taxable year to which such \n     taxes relate. In addition, it generally would provide for any \n     subsequent adjustments to or refunds of accrued foreign taxes \n     to be taken into account for the taxable year to which they \n     relate. The provision would apply to taxes paid or accrued in \n     taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997, and to taxes \n     that relate to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1997.\n       Section 302. Election to use simplified foreign tax credit \n     calculation under AMT: Taxpayers would be permitted to elect \n     (with certain limitations) to use, as their alternative \n     minimum tax (AMT) foreign tax credit limitation fraction, the \n     ratio of foreign source regular taxable income to entire AMT \n     income. This would eliminate the need to calculate a separate \n     AMT foreign tax credit limitation. The election would apply \n     to all subsequent taxable years and could be revoked only \n     with IRS consent. The provision would apply to taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 1997.\n       Section 303. Outbound transfers: The excise tax under \n     section 1491 on certain outbound transfers would be repealed \n     and, in its place, full recognition of gain would be required \n     on a covered transfer of property by a U.S. person to a \n     foreign corporation, foreign partnership, or foreign estate \n     or trust. The provision would apply to transfers after \n     December 31, 1997.\n       Section 304. Inbound transfers: Regulatory authority \n     generally would be provided to require income recognition, to \n     the extent necessary to prevent U.S. federal income \n     tax avoidance, in the case of certain otherwise tax-free \n     corporate organizations, reorganizations, and liquidations \n     in which the status of a foreign corporation as a \n     corporation is a condition for nonrecognition by a party \n     to the transaction. The provision would apply to transfers \n     after December 31, 1997.\n       Section 305. Increase in reporting threshold: The ownership \n     threshold triggering the requirement to file information \n     returns regarding the organization or reorganization of \n     foreign corporations and the acquisition of their stock would \n     be increased from 5 percent to 10 percent, effective January \n     1, 1998.\n       Section 306. Exempt foreign corporations from uniform \n     capitalization rules: Under the proposal, the uniform \n     capitalization rules would apply to foreign taxpayers only \n     for the purposes of subpart F or the taxation of income \n     effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or \n     business. The provision would\n\n[[Page S5360]]\n\n     apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1996. \n     Section 481 would not apply to any change in a method of \n     accounting by reason of the provision.\n       Section 307. Extend FTC carryforward: The proposal would \n     extend the carryforward period for excess foreign income \n     taxes and extraction taxes form five years to 10 years. The \n     provision would apply to excess foreign taxes for taxable \n     years beginning after December 31, 1997.\n       Section 308. Domestic loss recapture: The proposal would \n     make symmetrical the overall foreign loss provisions by \n     recharacterizing overall domestic losses recaptured in \n     subsequent years as foreign source income. The provision \n     would apply to losses for taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 1997.\n       Section 309. FSC rules for computer software and military \n     property: The proposal would clarify that computer software, \n     whether or not patented, qualifies as export property \n     eligible for FSC benefits. The provision would apply to \n     sales, exchanges, or other dispositions after the date of \n     enactment. Also, the proposal would remove the 50-percent \n     limitation on foreign trading gross receipts attributable to \n     military property. This amendment would apply to taxable \n     years beginning after December 31, 1997.\n       Section 310. Special rules for financial services income: \n     The foreign tax credit limitation provisions generally would \n     be amended to exclude from high withholding tax interest any \n     interest on a security held by a dealer in connection with \n     its activities as such. The foreign tax credit limitation for \n     financial services income would be amended to include the \n     entire gross income of any person for which financial \n     services income exceeds 80 percent of gross income. In \n     addition,the section 904(g) source rules for U.S.-owned \n     foreign property would be amended to exclude income derived \n     by a securities dealer on securities. The proposals generally \n     would apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1997. In the case of deemed paid credits, the proposal would \n     apply to taxable years of foreign corporations beginning \n     after December 31, 1997 and to taxable years of U.S. \n     shareholders in such corporations with or within which \n     such taxable years of foreign corporations end.\n       Section 311. Exclusion of certain dealers' assets from \n     section 956 definition of U.S. property: The provision would \n     exclude from the definition of ``United States property'' \n     under section 956 certain assets acquired by a dealer in \n     securities or commodities in the ordinary course of its trade \n     or business. Excluded assets would include certain assets \n     posted as collateral or margin, certain obligations of U.S. \n     persons acquired in connection with a sale and repurchase \n     agreement, and certain securities acquired and held by a CFC \n     primarily for sale to customers. The provision would be \n     effective for taxable years of foreign corporations beginning \n     after December 31, 1997, and to taxable years of U.S. \n     shareholders with or within which such taxable years of \n     foreign corporations end.\n       Section 312. Foreign investment in mutual funds: The \n     proposal generally would exempt from U.S. taxation certain \n     dividends received by nonresident aliens or foreign \n     corporations from regulated investment companies (RICs) to \n     the extent the dividends are attributable to interest or \n     short-term capital gains. Also, for U.S. estate tax purposes, \n     the proposal would treat stock in certain RICs as property \n     without the United States. Finally, the proposal would expand \n     the special rules for REITs under section 897(h) to cover \n     domestically controlled RICs as well. The first provision \n     would apply to dividends with respect to taxable years of \n     RICs beginning after the date of enactment; the other \n     provisions generally would take effect on the date of \n     enactment.\n       Section 313. Exclude preliminary agreements from definition \n     of intangible property: The proposal would exclude from the \n     section 936(h)(3)(B) definition of intangible property any \n     ``preliminary agreement'' that is not legally enforceable. \n     This provision would apply to agreements entered into after \n     the date of enactment.\n       Section 314. Study of affiliated group interest allocation: \n     The Treasury Department would be directed to conduct a study \n     of the rules under section 864(e) for allocating interest \n     expense of members of an affiliated group. This study would \n     include an analysis of the effect of such rules, including \n     the effects such rules have on different industries. A report \n     would be required within six months.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join my \ncolleague, Senator Hatch, to introduce a bill to help American-owned \ncompanies compete in the world marketplace by simplifying our overly \ncomplicated international tax rules.\n  America's economic success depends more than ever before on our \nability to succeed in the international economy. When I came to the \nSenate, imports and exports together made up about 12 percent of our \neconomy. Today it is 30 percent and growing every day. So more jobs \nthan ever depend on exports and overseas operations.\n  I have worked through the Trade Subcommittee to lower foreign trade \nbarriers and encourage agreements to keep trade free and fair. I have \nsought to open foreign markets for Montana products like beef to wheat. \nAnd this work pays off.\n  According to a report prepared by the accounting firm Price \nWaterhouse last month, exports of goods alone in the United States in \n1996 supported almost 7 million direct and indirect jobs and account \nfor over 11 percent of our Gross Domestic Product. In Montana, these \nexports totaled almost one-half billion dollars and supported 58,000 \njobs in 1996.\n  But while our trade policies have been successful in many areas, our \nTax Code has failed to keep up. Its international provisions are \noutdated, unclear, complex, and duplicative. And the result is fewer \njobs and less prosperity here at home.\n  So Senator Hatch and I have joined in an effort to simplify our Code, \nremove duplicative or outmoded provisions, and provide incentives for \ntrade whenever possible.\n  This bill does not by any means cure all of the problems in the \ninternational tax arena. But it is a good starting point which \nsimplifies existing law, reduces the cost of compliance, and begins to \nmake rules more rational and more mindful of the competitiveness of \nU.S. businesses. The major provisions include:\n\n       Putting U.S. companies entering into joint ventures in \n     foreign markets on an equal footing with their foreign \n     competitors by eliminating the so-called 10-50 foreign tax \n     credit basket rules.\n       Rationalizing the anti-deferral rules by eliminating \n     provisions that duplicate other clauses of the Internal \n     Revenue Code. This is essential if U.S. financial services \n     companies are to keep their leading edge in foreign markets.\n       Guaranteeing that the export tax incentive provided by the \n     foreign sales corporation rules would apply to U.S. software \n     sold overseas, and to approved sales of U.S.-made military \n     goods overseas.\n       Putting mutual funds on the same footing as individual \n     companies in their ability to attract foreign investors, \n     increasing their investment capital.\n       And making it easier for utilities to bid for construction \n     projects overseas.\n\n  These things will make us more efficient and more competitive. It \nwill allow companies to put less effort into accounting and filling out \ntax forms, and more into producing, competing, and creating jobs. And \nthat is what we need, today, and even more so tomorrow.\n  We live in a global economy, Mr. President, and we must help American \ncompanies compete in this economy if we hope to continue an expansion \nin which a quarter of our growth already comes from exports. The \nInternational Tax Simplification for American Competitiveness Act is a \nmajor step in that direction.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Hatch and my other colleagues \non the Finance Committee to have its provisions incorporated into the \nreconciliation bill we will soon be considering.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. McConnell, Mr. \n        Santorum, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Craig, Mr. Grassley, \n        Mr. Daschle, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 845. A bill to transfer to the Secretary of Agriculture the \nauthority to conduct the census of agriculture, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                 the census of agriculture act of 1997\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that \nwill transfer the census of agriculture from the Department of Commerce \nto the Department of Agriculture [USDA]. I am pleased that the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, Senator \nHarkin, as well as Senators McConnell, Santorum, Daschle, Roberts, \nLeahy, Kerrey, Baucus, Landrieu, Cochran, Conrad, Johnson, Craig, and \nGrassley have joined me as cosponsors of this bill.\n\n  In recent years the census of agriculture has been conducted every 5 \nyears. Agricultural producers nationwide are asked questions regarding \ntheir production and sales. The census of agriculture is the only \nsource of consistent, county level statistics on agricultural \noperations throughout the United States. It also provides national and \nState data. The census of agriculture is useful in monitoring the \ncurrent status of, as well as documenting changes in, the agricultural \nindustry. The number of farms, a major piece of data resulting from the \ncensus, is taken into account in the allocation of funding for several \nUSDA programs.\n\n[[Page S5361]]\n\n  Last year Congress provided funds to USDA to allow USDA, in \ncooperation with the Department of Commerce, to conduct the next census \nwithout any substantive changes in scope, coverage, or timing. This \ntransfer of funding necessitates the transfer of the authority.\n  Transferring the authority for the census of agriculture to the USDA \nmakes common sense. This move would integrate the agricultural \nstatistics programs of the two Departments and eliminate duplication. \nUSDA states that cost savings will result with one agency given primary \nauthority over the content of the census as well as dissemination of \nits results.\n  The issue of moving the census surfaced during final conference \ncommittee deliberations on the 1996 Federal Agricultural Improvement \nand Reform Act. Given the time constraints of that conference, a \nprovision to transfer the census of agriculture to USDA was not \nincluded in the bill. Subsequent legislation was passed by the House, \nbut did not receive approval from the Senate before the end of the \nsession.\n  Last year, the Department of Commerce expressed some interest in \nchanging the definition of a farm, which is now defined as sales of \n$1,000 or more per year. While USDA has stated there will be no \nsubstantive changes with how the upcoming census is carried out, it is \nmore logical to provide the authority to set the definition to the \nDepartment whose programs would be most affected by a change.\n  Many agricultural associations and organizations, including the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation, support the transfer of the census of \nagriculture to USDA. Last month, USDA proposed legislation which is \nvirtually identical to this bill.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support of this legislation. I ask \nunanimous consent that the bill and a section-by-section analysis of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 845\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to remove the \njurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to license \nprojects on fresh waters in the State of Hawaii; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              the federal power act amendment act of 1997\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, the State of Hawaii, its delegation in \nCongress, and conservation organizations throughout the State are \ndeeply concerned about Federal efforts to regulate hydroelectric \nprojects on State waters. Across the United States, the question of who \nshould have authority for hydropower regulation--the State or the \nFederal Government--is very contentious. But in the case of the fresh \nwater streams of Hawaii, the answer is clear. The State of Hawaii, not \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, should have the authority for \nhydropower regulation in Hawaii, if the Commission finds it has no \nmandatory jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act.\n  Those who care for Hawaii's rivers and streams recognize that \nunnecessary Federal intervention may have serious repercussions for our \nfresh water resources and the ecosystems that depend upon them.\n  The State of Hawaii has demonstrated its commitment to protect stream \nresources by instituting a new water code, adopting instream flow \nstandards, launching a comprehensive Hawaii stream assessment, and \norganizing a steam protection and management task force.\n  The Federal interest in protecting the vast interconnected river \nsystem of North America is misplaced in our isolated mid-Pacific \nlocale. The issues of interstate commerce, protecting military ports, \nor long interstate rivers are not applicable.\n  Therefore, I am introducing legislation to terminate FERC's voluntary \njurisdiction over hydropower projects on the fresh waters of the State \nof Hawaii. This legislation is nearly identical to one passed by the \nSenate during the 103d Congress. In 104th Congress, the Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee again approved the bill. I will \ncontinue to fight for the passage of this legislation in the 105th \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COATS (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Ashcroft, Mr. Coverdell, and Mr. Gregg):\n  S. 847. A bill to provide scholarship assistance for District of \nColumbia elementary and secondary school students; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n  THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA STUDENT OPPORTUNITY SCHOLARSHIP ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, today is a very important day for students \nin the District of Columbia. Today, I join Senator Lieberman, Senator \nBrownback, Senator Ashcroft, and Senator Gregg in introducing the \nDistrict of Columbia Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of 1997, also \nknown as the DC SOS Act. The DC SOS Act provides immediate relief to \nthousands of the District's neediest students who are consigned to \nfailing, violent public schools. This bill is a direct response to the \nneeds of thousands of families in our Capital City who have, for too \nlong, been expected to accept under-performing and often violent \nschools for their children. The DC SOS Act provides real educational \nopportunities to almost 4,000 District students.\n  Many of you may remember that a very similar initiative was \nintroduced by former Representative Gunderson, and included in the 1996 \nD.C. appropriations bill. At that time, a majority of the Senate, 56 \nSenators in all, were supportive of the idea to provide scholarships to \npoor students in the District of Columbia. Tragically, that program, \nwhich would have benefited 5,000 of our Nation's most needy students, \nwas blocked by the threat of a filibuster.\n  During the 1996 D.C. Appropriations debate, many of those who opposed \nproviding scholarships for poor District students argued that the \ninitiative was opposed by the residents of the District. That argument \ncannot be used this time. A recent bipartisan survey conducted in the \nDistrict of Columbia found that fully 64 percent of Washingtonians \nwould send their children to private school if they had the option and \nif money were not an issue; 61 percent of single parents think that \ncreating a school choice program for the District is an excellent or \ngood use of taxpayer dollars. And those most likely to opt out of the \npublic system are residents of the wards 7 and 8, the areas with the \nmost troubled public schools. Clearly, the residents of the District \nare ready for a change.\n  But these surveys should not surprise us. The D.C. schools have not \nimproved since the defeat of the D.C. scholarship program in 1996. \nRather, the schools got so bad that the D.C. Control Board fired \nSuperintendent Franklin Smith, stripped control of the school from the \nD.C. Board of Education, and installed a new Chief Executive and \nSuperintendent, retired Army Gen. Julius W. Becton, Jr. Perhaps General \nBecton can turn the D.C. school system around. But I am not willing to \ntell a family who fears for the safety of their child that they should \nwait and given General Becton 5 or 10 years to test his approaches, \nespecially because changes have been promised by five new \nsuperintendents in the last 15 years.\n  In February of this year, the Washington Post ran a five-part series \non the D.C. school system, chronicling its complete breakdown. A school \nsystem where jobs for bureaucrats are more important than providing \ntextbooks. A school system that employs almost nine times more central \noffice administrators than the national average, despite a decreasing \nstudent population, and a shortage of qualified teachers and \nprincipals.\n  Many of the district's 152 schools are in a state of terrible \ndisrepair. Students and teachers contend with leaking roofs, bitterly \ncold classrooms, and thousands of fire code violations. Yet, in 1996, \nthe D.C. Board of Education allocated $1.4 million for its own use, an \namount far greater than that spent by neighboring counties, and \n$200,000 more than is spent by the Chicago school system, which is five \ntimes larger.\n  Unfortunately, these problems of infrastructure are minor concerns \ncompared to violence and basic educational failure. Violence in the \nschools is at an alltime high--both student on student, and student on \nteacher--even as the violent crime rate in the country as a whole \ndrops. And stories of academic mediocrity have become so common that \nthey have lost their power to shock. Why is there no public outcry that \nthe D.C. school district, which spends the most per pupil of any \ndistrict in the country, has the Nation's lowest reported scores on the \nNAEP exams? Where is the outrage that only 35 percent of students are \nreading at grade level?\n  Students are routinely promoted regardless of whether they have \nprogressed in their studies and graduate from the school system with \nlittle to show for their 12 years of schooling. Eighty-five percent of \nD.C. public school graduates who enter the University of the District \nof Columbia need 2 years of remedial education before beginning their \ncourse work toward degrees. And more than half of all graduates who \ntook the U.S. Armed Forces Qualification Test in 1994 failed. This last \nstatistic is particularly troubling, because it blocks a traditional \nescape route from disadvantage.\n  We are asking poor, inner-city children and their parents to tolerate \ncircumstances that most middle-class and affluent Americans would not \ntolerate for one moment. Why should these families have to suffer \nviolence and the lack of educational opportunities for another week, \nlet alone the years that General Becton himself admits it will be \nbefore reform has any effect?\n  But those of us concerned about this issue face an obstacle. No one \nseems outraged enough about the betrayal of these children by \nindifferent adults to make major changes. Not suburban whites, who are \noften satisfied with their schools. Not politicians, some of whom are \neither blindly obedient to teachers unions or may simply have different \npolitical constituencies than these kids and their parents.\n  The DC SOS Act is an attempt to end this conspiracy of complacency. \nIn introducing this bill today, I join with a coalition of members in \nboth House of Congress who seek to provide scholarships for low-income \nstudents in the District of Columbia to enable them to attend the \npublic or private school of\n\n[[Page S5363]]\n\ntheir choice or to receive tutoring assistance. This bill is the single \nmost practical, immediate, effective way to help actual children, with \nflesh and blood and futures, rather than continuing to ignore this very \nserious situation.\n  I find it inconceivable that anyone, in good conscience, could \ncondemn the District's low income children to attend schools that not \nonly fail to educate them, but cannot even assure their personal \nsafety. Some of the public schools in this city have become wastelands \nof violence and despair. We cannot begin to imagine the fears of a \nmother who is forced, required, compelled to send her child through \nbarbed wire and metal detectors into a combat zone, masquerading as an \neducational institution.\n  The introduction, and ultimate passage of this bill, will signal a \nfundamental shift in priorities. It would indicate to parents in the \nDistrict of Columbia and all across America that we care about their \nchildren more than we care about maintaining the status quo; that we \nunderstand the depth of the problem in our Nation's public schools and \nthat we are finally willing to address it.\n  Opponents of this bill should carefully consider what they would do \nif they had a child assigned to a school where physical attacks, \nrobberies, and drug sales were rampant. Low-income parents, who face \nthis circumstance every day, deserve a voice and a choice.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the D.C. Student \nOpportunity Scholarship Act of 1997. With this bill we signal our \nintention to provide a safe and effective school for every child in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this act, the District of \nColumbia Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of 1997, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 847\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PRECEDENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``District \n     of Columbia Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of 1997''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Public education in the District of Columbia is in a \n     crisis, as evidenced by the following:\n       (A) The District of Columbia schools have the lowest \n     average of any school system in the Nation on the National \n     Assessment of Education Progress.\n       (B) 72 percent of fourth graders in the District of \n     Columbia tested below basic proficiency on the National \n     Assessment of Education Progress in 1994.\n       (C) Since 1991, there has been a net decline in the reading \n     skills of District of Columbia students as measured in scores \n     on the standardized Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills.\n       (D) At least 40 percent of District of Columbia students \n     drop out of or leave the school system before graduation.\n       (E) The National Education Goals Panel reported in 1996 \n     that both students and teachers in District of Columbia \n     schools are subjected to levels of violence that are twice \n     the national average.\n       (F) Nearly two-thirds of District of Columbia teachers \n     reported that violent student behavior is a serious \n     impediment to teaching.\n       (G) Many of the District of Columbia's 152 schools are in a \n     state of terrible disrepair, including leaking roofs, \n     bitterly cold classrooms, and numerous fire code violations.\n       (2) Significant improvements in the education of \n     educationally deprived children in the District of Columbia \n     can be accomplished by--\n       (A) increasing educational opportunities for the children \n     by expanding the range of educational choices that best meet \n     the needs of the children;\n       (B) fostering diversity and competition among school \n     programs for the children;\n       (C) providing the families of the children more of the \n     educational choices already available to affluent families; \n     and\n       (D) enhancing the overall quality of education in the \n     District of Columbia by increasing parental involvement in \n     the direction of the education of the children.\n       (3) The 350 private schools in the District of Columbia and \n     the surrounding area offer a more safe and stable learning \n     environment than many of the public schools.\n       (4) Costs are often much lower in private schools than \n     corresponding costs in public schools.\n       (5) Not all children are alike and therefore there is no \n     one school or program that fits the needs of all children.\n       (6) The formation of sound values and moral character is \n     crucial to helping young people escape from lives of poverty, \n     family break-up, drug abuse, crime, and school failure.\n       (7) In addition to offering knowledge and skills, education \n     should contribute positively to the formation of the internal \n     norms and values which are vital to a child's success in life \n     and to the well-being of society.\n       (8) Schools should help to provide young people with a \n     sound moral foundation which is consistent with the values of \n     their parents. To find such a school, parents need a full \n     range of choice to determine where their children can best be \n     educated.\n       (c) Precedents.--The United States Supreme Court has \n     determined that programs giving parents choice and increased \n     input in their children's education, including the choice of \n     a religious education, do not violate the Constitution. The \n     Supreme Court has held that as long as the beneficiary \n     decides where education funds will be spent on such \n     individual's behalf, public funds can be used for education \n     in a religious institution because the public entity has \n     neither advanced nor hindered a particular religion and \n     therefore has not violated the establishment clause of the \n     first amendment to the Constitution. Supreme Court precedents \n     include--\n       (1) Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972); Pierce v. \n     Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925); and Meyer v. \n     Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923) which held that parents have \n     the primary role in and are the primary decision makers in \n     all areas regarding the education and upbringing of their \n     children;\n       (2) Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388 (1983) which declared a \n     Minnesota tax deduction program that provided State income \n     tax benefits for educational expenditures by parents, \n     including tuition in religiously affiliated schools, does not \n     violate the Constitution;\n       (3) Witters v. Department of Services for the Blind, 474 \n     U.S. 481 (1986) in which the Supreme Court ruled unanimously \n     that public funds for the vocational training of the blind \n     could be used at a Bible college for ministry training; and\n       (4) Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District, 509 U.S. \n     1 (1993) which held that a deaf child could receive an \n     interpreter, paid for by the public, in a private religiously \n     affiliated school under the Individual with Disabilities \n     Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.).

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues \nSenators Coats and Brownback in introducing the District of Columbia \nStudent Opportunity Scholarship Act of 1997, also known as the DCSOS \nAct.\n  This legislation is quite similar to the provision that passed the \nHouse last year as part of the D.C. appropriations bill but failed to \nmake it through conference. It would create a modest tuition \nscholarship fund that would enable 2,000 low-income students in the \nDistrict to attend the public, private, or parochial school of their \nchoice. It would also provide direct aid to an additional 2,000 public \nschool students who want to improve their academic skills through \nafter-school tutoring.\n  But the circumstances surrounding this proposal have changed \ndramatically since it was considered last year, and I think it's \nimportant to make our colleagues aware of what's happened over the \ncourse of the last several months as they consider the bill we're \nintroducing today.\n  Most immediately, the deeply troubled D.C. school system has now hit \nrock-bottom. Last fall, the District Control Board officially declared \nthe schools in crisis, stripped the elected school board of its \nauthority, and authorized an emergency board of trustees to take over \nthe city's public schools.\n  In taking these drastic steps, the Control Board issued a report \ndocumenting the utter dysfunction of this school system--test scores \nranking among the worst in the Nation, students and teachers subjected \nto violence at twice the national average, gross mismanagement of \nbudget and personnel, buildings literally falling apart, and a tragic \nmisplacement of priorities that puts job preservation ahead of the job \nof educating the city's children.\n  But perhaps the most damning indictment of the D.C. schools came in a \nsingle sentence included in the report: the longer students stay in the \nDistrict's public school system, the Control Board concluded, the less \nlikely they are to succeed educationally. I would urge my colleagues to \nthink about the import of that statement. Instead of helping these \nchildren learn more with each passing year, the D.C. schools in many \ncases have actually become hazardous to the academic health of its \nstudents.\n  This conclusion should not be all that surprising when you take a \ncloser look at the environment in which these kids are trying to learn. \nFor instance, in April we saw a shocking breakdown of discipline at the \nWinston Education Center. Several fourth-graders slipped unnoticed into \na sideroom right outside an ongoing class and engaged in oral sex, with \ntwo of the children's parents claiming their children were sexually \nassaulted. When the principal learned of the incident, his first \nreaction was to judge the sexual activity consensual. And earlier this \nmonth, Washington Post columnist Colbert King reported that a fifth-\ngrade class at the Harrison Elementary School had gone without a \nteacher for the past 4 months. This outrageous situation may well have \ncontinued had King not exposed it and put pressure on the \nadministration to correct it.\n  To force children to attend these schools, where the breakdown is so \ncomplete a class can go four months without a teacher, is simply \nunconscionable. But that is exactly what is happening in the District \nof Columbia, where thousands of students are trapped in decrepit, \ndangerous, and disenfranchising schools simply because they cannot \nafford any alternative.\n  That is why we believe there is an urgent need to pass the DCSOS Act. \nThat acronym is not an accident, for this program would provide at \nleast 2,000 of the most disadvantaged families in the District with an \neducational lifeline, a chance to seek out a school that they believe \nwill offer their child a brighter future. It would give these families \nthe same option that thousands of other families have already exercised \nby pulling their children from the D.C. public schools or moving out of \ntown altogether.\n  Some defenders of the status quo have tried for some time to get us \nto believe that the residents of this city don't want that kind of \nchoice. But a poll that was released this week should shatter that \nmisguided myth once and for all. This survey found that nearly two-\nthirds of public school parents would send their kids to private \nschools if money weren't an issue. The poll also shows that there is a \nstrong base of support for the scholarship program we're proposing \nright out of the gate, before we've done anything to educate the public \nabout it. And most important, it shows that the families we're trying \nto help would welcome this assistance, with 62 percent of low-income \nparents saying that the kind of choice we're offering would improve the \nquality of education for District children.\n\n  Some of the opponents of this legislation will continue to argue that \nthis program, like other attempts to expand opportunities for poor \nfamilies, will harm or actually ruin the public schools. To suggest \nthat this modest program could make a school system already in crisis \nany worse defies common sense. In truth, this is a case of the only \nthing we have to fear is fear itself--that is, the fear of moving \nbeyond the status quo. Knowing that the D.C. schools have hit rock \nbottom, we shouldn't be closing off any options,\n\n[[Page S5367]]\n\nwhich is exactly what influential columnist William Raspberry wrote \nlast week when he endorsed giving choice a chance in the District.\n  We need to get past the red herring argument that we must choose \nbetween choice and the public schools. Simply put, supporting this \nscholarship program is not the same as abandoning the public school \nsystem. This is not an either-or equation. And to help prove that to \nthe citizens of the District, we have gone out of the way in this \nlegislation to make sure that the funding for these scholarships does \nnot come at the expense of the city's public schools. This is new money \nand that point should not be overlooked.\n  Mr. President, the truth is that we fervently hope that the Board of \nTrustees and CEO Gen. Julius Becton can rescue this system and make the \nfundamental reforms necessary to give these students the education they \ndeserve, and we will do what we can to support their efforts. Senator \nBrownback and I, as chairman and ranking member of the Senate's D.C. \nOversight Subcommittee, made that very pledge to General Becton at a \nhearing we held in April.\n  But this mission is at a minimum going to take several years, which \nbegs the question, what happens to those many students who have no \nchoice but to attend schools that most parents who could afford it have \nlong since abandoned?\n  We believe that we have a moral obligation to offer those children a \nway out. That is why many of us view this question not just as a matter \nof education, but a question of fairness. This is all about our values, \nspecifically the value we place on giving every child--no matter their \nincome, where they live or how they live--the opportunity to fulfill \ntheir God-given promise.\n  No one is claiming that this scholarship program is a magic bullet. \nBut we strongly believe it will give at least 2,000 disadvantaged \nstudents a shot at a better life. We also believe that by providing \nsome competition to the public schools, this program will accelerate \nthe pace of reform within the D.C. school system. Across the country, \nthe growing numbers of charter schools and private scholarship programs \nare forcing public school systems to confront their failures and \nbuilding pressure on them to take radical actions to improve the \nquality of their educational programs. This is starting to happen \nalready in the District, and we are optimistic that this legislation \nwill intensify that movement here.\n  If nothing else, this legislation will create a program that will \nhelp us test what impact choice has on improving the educational \nopportunities of poor families in urban areas, and thereby help us make \ninformed decisions in the future about whether to expand this kind of \ninitiative to other cities. There have been some promising signs coming \nout of the choice programs in Milwaukee and Cleveland, but the reality \nis we don't know with much certainty whether expanding choice will \nproduce noticeable results. This legislation could establish a national \nexperiment, and provide us with some real answers to the critical \nquestions we've been wrestling with. It's for that very reason we call \nfor a thorough evaluation of the D.C. scholarship program in our \nlegislation.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that it is time to give choice a \nchance in the District. We cannot in conscience continue to ignore the \nplight of these children any longer. They deserve an opportunity to \nbreak out of the nightmarish cycle of poverty, dependency, and violence \nand to live the American dream. This bipartisan legislation will begin \nto restore hope to some of these families, and I would strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, one of my highest priorities as the \nchairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, Restructuring, and the District of Columbia, is to make \nsure the children in the Nation's capital are receiving the quality \neducation they deserve. The District's public schools, unfortunately, \nhave failed too many students in providing the education they deserve. \nThe District of Columbia Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of 1997 \nwould change this by giving low-income students the chance to get the \neducation they need.\n  Our subcommittee held a hearing a few weeks ago to explore options to \nimprove public education in the District. Mr. President, I know there \nare schools which are working and where students are thriving in their \nlearning environment. I had the privilege to visit Stuart-Hobson Middle \nSchool. I was impressed by the success of the program at Stuart-Hobson \nand how the students took pride in their education. This school, \nhowever, is one of a few exceptions in the District Public School \nSystem.\n  The facts about the District public schools speak for themselves: \nonly 22 percent of fourth grade students are at or above basic reading \nachievement levels; students on average consistently score below the \nnational average of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills; students \nconsistently score below the national Scholastic Aptitude Test [SAT]. \nWe cannot continue to trap these students in an educational system that \nis failing them.\n  Gen. Julius Becton, chief executive officer and Superintendent of the \nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools, and the District of Columbia \nEmergency Transitional School Board of Trustees have said that they \nwill make significant improvements by the year 2000, and I recognize \nand respect the work that lies ahead of them. But, Mr. President, the \nyear 2000 is 3 school years away. In 3 school years, a child progresses \nthrough grades one through three in which they learn to read, write, \nadd, subtract, etc. In 3 school years, a high school student gains the \nskills and preparation they need for college or for a job. These 3 \nschool years are too valuable to trap these students in the public \nschool system that has not delivered.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senator Coats and \nSenator Lieberman in introducing this legislation that focuses on the \nindividual student in the District of Columbia Public Schools. By \nproviding up to $3,200 in individual scholarships to low-income \nfamilies who will choose the school for their children, this bill would \ngive these students the chance to make sure the next 3 school years do \nnot go to waste. Improving the chances for these children to get the \neducation they need is one of the most fundamental elements to restore \nthe Nation's capital into the shining city the United States deserves.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 848. A bill to direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nthrough the Health Care Financing Administration, to expand and \nstrengthen the demonstration project known as the Medicare Telemedicine \nDemonstration Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            THE RURAL TELEMEDICINE DEMONSTRATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nmy colleague, Senator Baucus of Montana, the Rural Telemedicine \nDemonstration Act of 1997.\n  The vast potential of telemedicine technology is clearly under-\nutilized. I believe that the answer to growing concerns regarding \naccess and affordability of quality health care services in rural \nAmerica is telemedicine. Let me describe just a few of the difficulties \nof rural health care in my home State of Alaska and explain why \ntelemedicine is our long-awaited answer.\n  Alaska encompasses 586,412 square miles. It is one-fifth the size of \nthe contiguous United States; 120 times larger than the State of Rhode \nIsland; and larger than the three largest States in the union combined. \nIf a map of Alaska were superimposed on a map of the lower 48 States, \nAlaska would touch South Carolina, Mexico, California, and the United \nStates-Canadian border. In short, Alaska has 1 million acres of land \nfor every day of the year.\n  Geography is another defining characteristic of Alaska. My State has \na climate characterized by significant season fluctuations in \ntemperature and precipitation and a topography characterized by \nmountains, wetlands, forests, and rugged coastlines.\n  Communities and villages are scattered throughout the vast regions of \nAlaska. And though Alaska contains 586,412 square miles, it only has \n12,200 miles of roads. Vast areas are completely unconnected by roads, \nwith access only available by airplane, boat, snowmachine, or dogsled.\n\n[[Page S5368]]\n\n  Meeting the health care needs of these communities and villages is a \ndaunting task. Residents have difficulty due to geography, lack of \nproviders and poverty. Although excellent medical facilities and \ntertiary care centers are available in Anchorage, direct connection to \nthese facilities from most of the State is not possible other than by \nair transportation. Consequently, geographically, 74 percent of the \nState is in medically underserved areas.\n  Telemedicine is the cost-effective and practical answer to the Alaska \ndilemma. Currently, there is an exciting project underway known as the \nAlaska Telemedicine project. This consortium of Alaskan health care \nproviders and telecommunication carriers has been diligently working to \nunite health care in Alaska. This project has successfully united the \nNative health corporations, military medical facilities, and public and \nprivate hospitals of Alaska.\n  The fragmented nature of health care delivery in Alaska and Alaska \nsatellite-based narrow-band telecommunications infrastructure, along \nwith the geography and climate of Alaska, make Alaska an ideal place \nfor the Alaska Telemedicine project to flourish.\n  In 1995, the Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA], pursuant to \na mandate in 42 U.S.C. 1395(b)(1) which directs HCFA to establish \ndemonstration projects that explore innovative methodologies of \nMedicare cost-savings, developed a telemedicine Medicare reimbursement \nproject for rural America. Five demonstration sites were established in \nfour States: Iowa, West Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia. The \npurpose of these programs was to investigate Medicare reimbursement for \ntelemedicine in rural locations.\n  Unfortunately, the HCFA study of rural telemedicine contains a \nglaring omission: The study does not include any sites in rural Western \nlocations. The omission of the rural West, which contains extremely \nremote and frontier locations will result in a deficient and likely \ninaccurate study for rural telemedicine.\n  Our legislation will expand the HCFA project to better represent \nrural America. A site in Alaska and in Montana will be included. \nMontana, like Alaska, experiences significant difficulties in providing \nhealth care services in rural areas. Montana's five independent \ntelemedicine projects that have formed a united alliance will also be \nincluded in the HCFA project.\n  Mr. President, the goal of telemedicine Medicare reimbursement is to \nensure that the elderly of America who reside in inaccessible rural \nareas will be allowed to have access to quality health care in the most \ncost-effective manner--via telecommunication networks. Establishing \nMedicare reimbursement stabilizes telemedicine technology, and will \nlikely lead to widespread coverage of telehealth services by private \ninsurers.\n  Senator Baucus and my bill, will merely expand the current \ndemonstration project conducted by HCFA. By this expansion, the HCFA \nstudy will better represent rural telemedicine in the Nation. I ask \nthat my colleagues support the Rural Telemedicine Demonstration Act of \n1997.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 848\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Telemedicine \n     Demonstration Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Access to health care providers is critically important \n     to improving the health of individuals residing in rural \n     areas.\n       (2) Individuals residing in the rural areas of the Western \n     United States are severely underserved by both primary and \n     specialty health care providers.\n       (3) Telecommunications technology has made it possible to \n     provide a wide range of vital health care services to \n     individuals residing in remote locations and over vast \n     distances at a fraction of the costs associated with the \n     provision of such services without such technology.\n       (4) On February 17, 1997, the General Accounting Office \n     reported that Federal involvement in telehealth systems is \n     needed for the success of such systems.\n       (5) In order for telehealth systems to continue to benefit \n     rural communities, the medicare program under title XVIII of \n     the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) must \n     eventually reimburse the provision of health care services to \n     remote locations via telecommunication.\n       (6) The current Medicare telemedicine demonstration program \n     conducted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \n     through the Health Care Financing Administration, does not \n     include any sites in rural areas of the Western United \n     States. Without such sites, such demonstration program will \n     not provide accurate indicators of the success of \n     telemedicine.\n       (7)(A) The fragmented nature of Alaska's transportation \n     infrastructure, as well as extremes in geography, climates, \n     and ethnography create severe problems for health care \n     providers to provide health care services to the individuals \n     residing in Alaska.\n       (B) The Alaska Telemedicine Project is a statewide \n     telehealth project which overcomes infrastructure problems \n     within Alaska by uniting 40 public and private health care \n     providers across Alaska to provide health care services to \n     the residents of Alaska.\n       (8)(A) Health care providers in Montana also experience \n     significant difficulties in providing health care services in \n     rural areas. Five independent telemedicine networks in \n     Montana have formed the Montana Healthcare Telecommunications \n     Alliance (MHTA), an association of telemedicine service \n     providers representing not-for-profit and public medical and \n     mental health facilities throughout the State.\n       (B) The goal of the MHTA is to promote cost effective \n     statewide deployment of telemedicine services thereby \n     supporting public and private health care providers and \n     improving access to quality medical and mental health \n     services for all individuals residing in Montana.\n\n     SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary, through the Health Care \n     Financing Administration, shall expand the demonstration \n     project known as the Medicare telemedicine demonstration \n     program to include within such demonstration program the \n     Alaska Telemedicine Project (described in section 2(7)) and \n     the Montana Healthcare Telecommunications Alliance (described \n     in section 2(8)).\n       (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than March 1 of each \n     year that the demonstration project described in subsection \n     (a) is being conducted, the Secretary, through the Health \n     Care Financing Administration, shall submit a report to \n     Congress that contains--\n       (1) an evaluation of the effectiveness of such \n     demonstration project; and\n       (2) any legislative recommendations determined appropriate \n     by the Secretary.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated $2,000,000 to the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services to carry out the purposes of the demonstration \n     project described in subsection (a).\n\n

Con. Res. 31\n\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n       Whereas the Palestinian Authority Justice Minister Freih \n     Abu Medein announced last month that anyone selling land to \n     Jews was committing a crime punishable by death;\n       Whereas since this announcement three Palestinian \n     individuals were murdered in the Jerusalem and Ramallah areas \n     for, what would anywhere else in the world be considered \n     normal business activity--selling real estate;\n       Whereas recently Israeli police managed to foil the \n     attempted abduction of a fourth person;\n       Whereas Israeli security services have acquired evidence \n     indicating the intelligence services of the Palestinian \n     Authority were directly involved in at least 2 of these \n     murders;\n       Whereas subsequent statements by high-ranking Palestinian \n     Authority officials have justified these murders which have \n     further encouraged this intolerable policy;\n       Whereas the Palestinian Authority has failed to condemn the \n     policy of murdering people for business transactions;\n       Whereas this policy is in direct contravention to the peace \n     agreements already reached between the Palestinian Authority \n     and the State of Israel; and\n       Whereas credible evidence exists that the Palestinian \n     Authority has played an active role in these murders and in \n     enforcing this policy: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the Clinton administration should thoroughly \n     investigate the Palestinian Authority role in enforcing this \n     racist policy and should immediately report to the Congress \n     its findings;\n       (2) the Palestinian Authority, with Yasser Arafat as its \n     chairman, must immediately issue a public and unequivocal \n     statement denouncing these acts and this policy;\n       (3) this policy is an affront to all those who place high \n     value on peace and basic human rights; and\n       (4) the United States should not provide foreign assistance \n     to the Palestinian Authority until this policy is reversed.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Connie \nMack, Kit Bond, and Arlen Specter to introduce a concurrent resolution \ncondemning the Palestinian Authority for the killing of Palestinians \nfor selling land to Israelis. This legislation is being offered \nconcurrently in the House by my colleagues, Congressmen Jon Fox and \nJerry Weller.\n  Mr. President, we are offering this resolution because it is \nappalling that Yasir Arafat, to whom we provide millions of dollars in \naid, is allowing his so-called police officers from the Palestinian \nAuthority to carry out assassinations of Arab land dealers for their \nsales of land to Jews. Arafat terms these dealers ``isolated traitors'' \nfor their actions and has thereby given his approval to these killings.\n  Thus far, three land dealers have been killed, execution style with a \nbullet to the back of the head, all by Palestinian Authority police \nofficers. The Israeli police have already arrested one man in the \nkilling of the first land dealer, Farid Bashiti, and earlier in the \nweek they arrested four Palestinian officers attempting to kidnap \nanother land dealer. According to a story in today's Ha'aretz (a \nnewspaper in Israel) the detained Palestinian police officers have \ngiven information that links Tawfik Tirawi, the head of security in \nRamallah, under Palestinian Authority control.\n  At this time, I would ask unanimous consent that the text of this \narticle be included in the Record.\n  This is an interesting state of affairs that we have here. The United \nStates provides funding to the Palestinian Authority, they violate the \nagreements they have signed with the Israelis, and we go about our way \nas if nothing has happened. Arafat's Palestinian Authority mismanages \nthe funds it has and we provide more. This is outrageous and \nunfortunate.\n  The world must realize that Israel, while keeping its agreements with \nthe Palestinians, is held to a different standard, harassed, \ncriticized, and denigrated for building condominiums at Har Homa, on \nterritory that is its own, perfectly legal according to the Oslo \nagreement but nevertheless condemned as flagrantly violating the peace. \nYet where is the criticism of the terrorism practiced by the \nPalestinians? Where are the U.N. resolutions condemning these summary \nexecutions by the Palestinian police? Yasir Arafat pushed for the U.N. \nto condemn the building at Har Homa, yet he brands extrajudicial \nkillings as justifiable for traitors. What a despicable contradiction.\n  Mr. President, we offer this resolution to call attention to these \nhorrible killings by Palestinian police sanctioned by the PLO in \nviolation of every standard of international human rights, and to call \nattention to the fact that Yasir Arafat's PLO has not changed its \nspots; it has not reformed. Why, we ask, does the United States \ncontinue to allow these acts to take place?\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution as well as to examine \nthis issue to understand Yasir Arafat's behavior.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Ha'aretz, June 5, 1997]\n\n   Palestinian Security Official Detained in Israel: Colonel Tirawi \n                      Ordered Land Dealers Murders\n\n                    (By Eitan Rabin and Amira Hass)\n\n       Israeli security officials rejected the claims of their \n     Palestinian counterparts that no Palestinian agents were \n     involved in the recent murders of land dealers.\n       ``The Palestinians have made a political decision to kill \n     anyone who sells land to Jews, and in recent days they have \n     even added names to their list of suspected dealers,'' a \n     senior security source said.\n       Three land dealers were killed in the past month following \n     the declaration of the Palestinian Authority official in \n     charge of justice, Freih Abu-Meddien, that selling land to \n     Jews is a crime punishable by death.\n       The Palestinian Authority has repeatedly denied any \n     involvement in the murders. The head of Palestinian \n     intelligence, Amin al-Hindi said reiterated this at a \n     Ramallah news conference yesterday. Commenting on reports \n     that Israel had issued a warrant for the arrest of a \n     Palestinian Authority official, Al-Hindi said the \n     Palestinians had not received any information to this effect. \n     But he warned of a grave escalation in the situation if any \n     senior Palestinian was detained.\n       Al-Hindi added that the Palestinian security branches are \n     investigating the land dealer murders, even though the \n     killings took place in areas under Israeli security \n     responsibility.\n       Al-Hindi charged Israel of using the murders to cover up \n     its own failure to fulfill its commitments in the peace \n     accords and to deflect debate over settlement policy.\n       From questioning Palestinian security officials detained in \n     Israel, Israeli security forces have obtained testimony \n     linking the Palestinian Authority to the murders. One \n     testimony points to specific involvement of Tawfik Tirawi, \n     the head of security in Ramallah. According to questioning of \n     the detainees, orders to security forces to act came in part \n     from Abu-Meddien.\n       In one case, security forces met with a land dealer from \n     East Jerusalem, and forced him to pay a ransom to save his \n     life.\n       In a related development, a Nazareth-based weekly put out \n     by the Democratic Front for Peace and Equality, headed by \n     Knesset member Azmi Beshara, has published a list of names of \n     well-known Palestinians who are believed to have sold land to \n     Jews between 1918-1945.\n       The list includes the name of Palestinian Arab leaders from \n     the period. The Voice of Palestine radio sharply attacked the \n     article, primarily because the list included the name of the \n     grandfather of Faisal Husseini, who holds the Jerusalem \n     portfolio in the Palestinian Authority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5370-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5371-S5372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SENATE RESOLUTION 96--PROCLAIMING NATIONAL SAFE PLACE WEEK\n\n  Mr. CRAIG submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

Res. 97\n\n       Whereas 1997 marks the fiftieth year since the European \n     Recovery Program, or what came to be called the Marshall \n     Plan, was first conceived and proclaimed by General George \n     Catlett Marshall while he was serving as Secretary of State \n     of the United States.\n       Whereas the Marshall Plan has been hailed by leaders of \n     World War II allied and enemy countries alike as the most \n     magnanimous act by Americans in history;\n       Whereas the Marshall Plan made possible new measures of \n     trans-Atlantic cooperation through the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization and other institutions;\n       Whereas these institutional developments have profoundly \n     enhanced the security, freedom, and prosperity of the United \n     States and the Atlantic Community generally;\n       Whereas new challenges have arisen which call for \n     recommitment to and reinvigoration of these institutions and \n     for their continued viability;\n       Whereas creative thought and rededication to the ideals and \n     principles undergirding the Marshall Plan are now necessary \n     in order to assure the preservation and perfection of these \n     institutions; and\n       Whereas the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the \n     Marshall Plan provides a fitting opportunity for rededication \n     of commitments to these institutions: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) that magnanimity underlies the Marshall Plan, the \n     dedication to public service and integrity of its author, and \n     the efforts by the Marshall Foundation in Lexington, \n     Virginia, the Marshall International Center in Leesburg, \n     Virginia, and the Friends of Marshall, Uniontown, \n     Pennsylvania, to continue in American life the values for \n     which General George Catlett Marshall stood;\n       (2) that all Americans should rededicate themselves to the \n     ideals of public service, hard work, integrity, and \n     compassion which General Marshall represents to this day in \n     American society; and\n       (3) that the values that inspired the initiation of the \n     Marshall Plan should continue to be cherished by the people \n     of the United States.\n       Sec. 2. It is, further, the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should issue a proclamation designating the month \n     of June 1997 as ``George C.

Mr. President, as we mark the annual celebration \nof Small Business Week, I take great pleasure in acknowledging the \nachievements of the estimated 22.1 million small businesses in this \ncountry. Small businesses play an integral role in the American \neconomy, generating half the gross domestic product, and driving \nAmerica forward in terms of product development, employment, and \ningenuity.\n  Small businesses employ more than 50 percent of our private work \nforce and have been credited with the creation of two out of every \nthree jobs. Studies have also shown that they produce more than twice \nas many significant innovations per employee as large firms. But beyond \nthe statistics, the successes of small businesses continue to prove \nthat the American dream is still a reality.\n  Small businesses provide most American workers with their first jobs. \nAnd for each job that a small business creates, one more American has \nthe opportunity to prosper. Small businesses also play a major role in \nmoving our economy forward, creating jobs, generating revenue, and \ndeveloping new products and services that keep American business on the \ncutting edge.\n  In my own State of Maryland, we have seen the extraordinary things \nthat can be accomplished when creative entrepreneurs are determined to \nsucceed. I want to share just a few of those stories.\n  The 1997 Maryland Small Business Person of the year is Jamie Clark, \nwho began his Internet service company, ClarkNet, out of a family barn \nin Ellicott City, MD. Jamie is deaf, and recognized the Internet as a \npowerful resource, a place where he and other deaf people could conduct \nbusiness as easily as the hearing. With a $35,000 loan and three \nvolunteers, who were also deaf, Jamie built a company that today \nemploys well over 30 people and had sales totaling $2.5 million last \nyear, up from less than $60,000 when ClarkNet began just 4 years ago.\n  As someone with deep roots in Maryland--Jamie's grandfather was a \ncircuit court judge in Howard County and his father a State senator for \n24 years, 4 of those as president of the Senate--Jamie is an active \nmember of the community, serving on the Deaf and Hard of Hearing \nEntrepreneurs Council, the Howard County Chamber of Commerce, the \nBetter Business Bureau, and the Baltimore-Washington Venture Group.\n  Maryland's Small Business Exporter of the Year last year, Bruce \nLawson of Finksburg, MD, has turned a hobby into a business that is an \nindustry leader. Bruce started his company, Brass Instruments, after \nhelping his father--a retired french horn player in the Baltimore \nSymphony Orchestra--repair his friends' musical instruments. Appalled \nat the quality of the horns they were repairing, Bruce started making \nhorns himself. Today, Brass Instruments is the top french horn maker in \nthe world.\n  Another former Maryland Small Business Person of the Year is Dorothy \nWhite, of Columbia, MD, who started cleaning houses when her husband \nfell ill. Dorothy's work was so impressive that her employers began \nasking her to clean their offices as well. What evolved was Dorothy's \nmultimillion-dollar business, Miracle Services. Like many Maryland \nbusinesses, Dorothy's company also has flourished under the 8(a) \nprogram, through which she has received numerous Government contracts.\n\n  The 1995 Regional Small Business Exporter of the Year also hails from \nMaryland. After immigrating from Poland to Baltimore, Jon Sakowski \nrealized that plastic piping could make all the difference in Poland's \nplumbing system. When he could not find a Polish buyer who could afford \nthe product, Jon began installing the piping for free in Poland's \nchurches, schools, and hospitals. Then, taking a major financial risk, \nJon exported the piping to Poland--without a buyer--and warehoused it \nhimself, selling the piping off piece by piece rather than in bulk.\n  We in Maryland are very proud of individuals like Jamie Clark, Bruce \nLawson, Dorothy White, Jon Sakowski and the many other operators of \nsmall businesses in our State who, often beginning with very little, \nhave accomplished so much. More than 97.8 percent of Maryland's full-\ntime firms have fewer than 500 employees, and there are an additional \n131,000 individuals who are self-employed. The significance of these \nbusinesses to Maryland's economy is evident in study after study, such \nas the Small Business Administration's recent report that Maryland \nfirms with fewer than 20 employees increased employment by 10.4 percent \nbetween 1991 and 1995.\n  Minority-owned businesses also have made great strides in recent \nyears. Between 1987 and 1992, Maryland's number of women-owned \nbusinesses rose by 48.7 percent, its number of African-American owned \nfirms rose 65 percent and its number of Hispanic-owned firms rose 148.7 \npercent.\n  Yet despite this progress, much remains to be done. Minority-owned \nfirms in Maryland are selling 30 percent below the national average, \nand bankruptcies and failures have increased. Given the important \neconomic and social roles played by minority-owned businesses, it is \nessential that we strengthen our efforts to help these underserved \nmarkets succeed.\n  Mr. President, as someone who has benefited personally from the \nopportunities afforded to small business in this country--I spent my \nyouth working in my parents' Greek restaurant on Maryland's Lower \nEastern Shore--I know how important it is to small business owners, \nemployees, and customers that they continue to thrive. Small business \nsuccess not only translates into jobs and economic growth, it also \ntranslates into a sense of pride and self-respect on the part of owners \nand workers and the heartening affirmation that the American dream is \nstill alive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5374-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5374-S5375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE CONGRESSIONAL AWARD\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, in 1979, Congress created an \naward which is specifically designed for young people. This special \nprogram, the Congressional Award, recognizes young Americans who make \ncommitments to community service and self-improvement. I would like to \ntake a few moments of Senate business to discuss this program and the \nimportant role it plays in promoting volunteerism.\n  The Congressional Award is a non-partisan, public-private partnership \nwhich teaches young people that they can make a difference in their \ncommunities. The program is noncompetitive. Participants set individual \ngoals based on their own abilities. Once these goals are achieved, they \ncan earn bronze, silver, or gold medals. I would emphasize that each \nCongressional Award is earned--not won. Any 14- to 23-year-old, \nregardless of their life circumstances or physical and mental \nabilities, can earn the award.\n  Mr. President, this program truly promotes community service. Since \nthe first award was presented in 1982, 1.5 million hours have been \nattributed to volunteerism. In the last 12 months alone, recipients of \nthe Congressional Award throughout the country performed more than \n63,000 hours of community service. Some examples of the volunteer \nprojects include assisting elderly shut-ins, distributing food for the \nneedy, producing a handbook of volunteer opportunities at the United \nWay, and donating a narcotics K-9 to a sheriff's department.\n  Recently, I have chartered the Congressional Award Program in my own \nState, along with the other members of the Pennsylvania delegation. I \nencourage each of my colleagues to promote this valuable program. The \nCongressional Award benefits everyone involved--the participants, their \nadult sponsors, and the communities at large. I would also note that \nwhile this program is a public-private partnership, it does not receive \nits funding\n\n[[Page S5375]]\n\nfrom the Government. It is funded entirely through the private sector.\n  Not long ago, I had the honor of participating in the Volunteer \nSummit in Philadelphia, PA. The success of this event suggests that \nAmericans are eager to help those in need. They simply need more \ninformation about how to do so.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong advocate of volunteerism, and I \nsincerely believe that this program inspires a sense of civic \nresponsibility in our young people. The Congressional Award is an \neffort Congress can be proud it initiated on behalf of our next \ngeneration. By working together, we can make this volunteer opportunity \nand learning experience available to all young Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5374-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE ``BILL AND SHEL SHOW'' CELEBRATES 40 YEARS ON THE AIR\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to two men \nwho have become an institution in my hometown of Crowley, LA.\n  For 40 years now, Bill Williams and Shel Kanter have hosted the very \npopular ``Bill and Shel Show'' on radio station KSIG-AM. Each weekday \nmorning, Bill and Shel have entertained and informed thousands of \nlisteners throughout Acadia Parish and the surrounding area. For most \nlisteners of the ``Bill and Shel Show,'' it's hard to imagine starting \nthe day without them and their reports of the latest local news, \ncommunity events, and the all-important school updates, including the \nschool lunch menus.\n  As anyone who has tried to raise funds for a charitable cause in \nCrowley knows, a kind or encouraging word from Bill and Shel can \nsometimes make the difference between success or failure. Bill and \nShel, of course, have always been most generous with kind words for the \nvarious worthy causes in and around Crowley.\n  It wasn't too long ago that the ``Bill and Shel Show'' was threatened \nwith extinction. When KSIG Radio changed ownership, the new owners \nbriefly considered canceling the show. Of course, as one might imagine, \nthe enormous outcry of protest from the community quickly persuaded the \nstation's new management that its initial decision had been perhaps \nhasty and unwise. Today, I am happy to report that Bill and Shel \ncontinue to entertain and inform their many listeners and, presumably, \nwill continue to dominate the local airwaves for many years to come.\n  In this day and time when all of us decry the decline in the spirit \nof community and cohesiveness that once was the hallmark of small towns \nall across our land, the ``Bill and Shel Show'' serves as a reminder of \na time when small towns like Crowley--where neighborliness, community \nspirit, and civic pride still thrive--were the norm, not the exception. \nIt is people like Bill Williams and Shel Kanter who help make Crowley a \nplace where people are truly connected by a common purpose and a \nsincere concern for the well-being of the entire community.\n  I congratulate the owners and management of KSIG Radio for their \ndecision to keep Bill and Shel on the air. And I congratulate Bill and \nShel for 40 years of broadcasting excellence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5375-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     THE EIGHTH ANNUAL REMEMBRANCE OF THE TIANANMEN SQUARE MASSACRE\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, on June 4, 1989, the People's \nRepublic of China perpetrated a bloody massacre against her own people. \nThousands of freedom-seeking people took to the streets only to be put \ndown violently by the long arm of the Chinese Government. Today, 8 \nyears later, what has changed with that Government to reassure us that \nsuch atrocities will not happen again? Not much. Those in power remain \nin power, and they express no remorse. The only significant change is \nthat every major dissident in China today is imprisoned.\n  Today, those same rulers in Beijing, their princeling children, and \nthe military leaders of the People's Liberation Army strengthen \nthemselves through operating commercial activities in the United \nStates. We allow a regime willing to use violence against its own \npeople, surely capable of directing that violence outwardly, to develop \nand strengthen through profits obtained in the United States. This is \nintolerable and must be stopped.\n  On the occasion of the eighth annual remembrance of the Tiananmen \nSquare massacre, I call upon the President and Congress to work \ntogether to address this gross error in U.S. policy which threatens \neven our own national security. This must be an essential element of a \nnew China policy which creates effective ways to address U.S. trade, \nhuman rights, and security concerns.\n  We have the opportunity of the 1997 MFN debate to address our \nconcerns with, and even support for, China. We must use this \nopportunity to engage in an earnest debate over the proper form of \nengagement. We should not accept the simple refrain, engagement is \nbetter than containment as a substitute for a substantive \npolicy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5375-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE TINNER HILL HERITAGE FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nTinner Hill Heritage Foundation. This Saturday, just across the Potomac \nRiver in Falls Church, VA, a street festival will celebrate the birth \nof the modern civil rights movement in Virginia.\n  In the late 1800's, Charles and Mary Tinner bought the top of a hill \nin Falls Church and it has been known as Tinner Hill ever since. \nCurrently, the seventh generation of Tinners now live on the hill that \nbears the family name. While the longevity of the Tinner family in and \nof itself is impressive, what transpired in June 1915 is what will be \ncelebrated this weekend. That year, the Falls Church Town Council \nadopted an ordinance to segregate the residences of the town. This \nwould mean that many families of African ancestry would have to give up \nthe homes they owned. Dr. E.B. Henderson, a resident of Tinner Hill, \norganized the Colored Citizens Protective League and filed a suit to \nprevent enforcement of the ordinance. Dr. Henderson then called a \nmeeting to form the first rural branch of the NAACP in the Nation. \nJoseph Tinner, son of Charles, became its first president. As a result, \nthe town council reversed the ordinance. Over the next 50 years, the \nHendersons, Tinners, and others organized civil rights activities that \nset a precedent and a model for the rural South.\n  Today, the Tinners and the Hendersons share the hill with a diverse \nmix of businesses that represent many cultural backgrounds. We all owe \na great debt to the brave former inhabitants of Tinner Hill who risked \nthere lives and livelihoods to defend the Bill of Rights and to start a \nmovement that has had far reaching consequences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5375-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5375-S5376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO THE NORTHEAST PEANUT LEAGUE\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the Northeast Peanut League \n[NEPL] will celebrate its annual All-Star Day on June 8. I would like \nto take a few moments of Senate business to recognize the NEPL and to \ndiscuss the opportunities it offers to more than 7,000 boys and girls \nbetween the ages of 5 and 16 in the Philadelphia area.\n  Founded in 1981, the NEPL provides recreational activities for \nchildren who are not as advanced in their athletic abilities. This \norganization is based on the concept of simply having fun. The league \nmakes sports a positive learning experience by enhancing the emotional, \nphysical, social, and educational well-being of children. These teams \nallow children to realize their potential in elaborate all-star events, \nplayoff games, and league awards. In short, the NEPL provides a \nnurturing environment where all children--regardless of their physical \nor mental abilities--can play, develop a sense of pride, and receive \nthe fanfare previously reserved for the ``A'' leagues.\n  Another important service the NEPL provides is substance abuse \neducation. Each year, the league distributes thousands of drug \nprevention brochures to the children and their parents. Moreover, the \nleague sponsors essay contests which encourage children to express \ntheir concerns about the drug epidemic. Winners of this essay contest \nand the Youth Work Award receive their prizes on the annual All-Star \nDay.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Northeast Peanut League for the athletic \nand educational opportunities it offers to the children of \nPhiladelphia. I ask\n\n[[Page S5376]]\n\nmy colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's best wishes for \ncontinued success to the children, coaches, parents, officials, staff, \nand sponsors of the Northeast Peanut League.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5375-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE POLITICS OF THE YEAR 2000 COMPUTER PROBLEM\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I spoke on Tuesday of this week \nabout recent findings on the technological dimension of the year 2000 \ncomputer problem. I rise today to warn of the yet unseen political \ndimension of the problem.\n  Newsweek's June 2d cover story, ``The Day the World Shuts Down,'' \noffered a telling scenario in which Vice President Gore, while \ncampaigning for President in 2000, spends all of his time trying to \njustify why he hadn't addressed this issue. To wit: ``imagine Al Gore's \nspending the entire election campaign explaining why he didn't foresee \nthe crisis.''\n  Vice President Gore is not alone here. Imagine 4 to 500 Congressmen \ndoing the same. Come 2000, each of us will be held accountable if we \nhave failed to deal effectively with the ``Y2K'' problem. Not a single \nMember of Congress right now, excepting those who can successfully pass \nthe blame, will be absolved. Both parties will face a wholesale \nclearing of the decks. The deluge of blame will occur in the legal \ncommunity, as well. Newsweek cited a conservative estimate of 1 \ntrillion dollars worth of litigation resulting from this crisis--more \nthan three times the yearly cost of all civil litigation in the United \nStates.\n  Make no mistake, almost all experts agree there will be no ``silver \nbullet'' fix. Correcting this problem is labor intensive and very time \nconsuming. Millions of lines of computer code have to be reviewed and \nchanged--in many computer languages so outdated they are foreign to \nyounger programmers. And as Newsweek stated, the bug ``affects \neverything from ATM's to weapons systems. Virtually every government, \nState, and municipality, as well as every large, midsize, and small \nbusiness in the world, is going to deal with this--in fact, if they \nhaven't started already its just about too late.''\n  If American families are overtaxed by the IRS, improperly charged by \ntheir creditors, denied Social Security benefits, and faced with a \nconstantly malfunctioning civil infrastructure, the blame will fall \nsquarely on the shoulders of their Representatives in Washington.\n  As Samuel Johnson observed, the prospect of hanging concentrates the \nmind. This prospect--the political repercussions--could finally get us \nup and running. We are not now. I have a first day bill, S. 22, \ncreating a joint commission to take on the task as a national \nemergency. It is just that. No movement on my bill thus far. At this \nrate be ready to be out of a job in 2001.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5376-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE 100TH BIRTHDAY OF COURTNEY WHEELER\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nCourtney Wheeler of Beckley, WV, who celebrated her 100th birthday on \nMay 29, 1997.\n  Courtney Wheeler was born in 1897 in Summers County, WV, the oldest \nof 13 children born to Thomas Joseph and Rosa Belle Berkley. She \nmarried her husband, Roy Wheeler in 1913 and the two of them had six \nchildren before he passed away in 1936. Courtney has shown tremendous \ncourage in life in dealing with the loss of her husband at an early age \nand the loss of four of her children. She has been an inspiration to \nall who know her on how to deal with life's tragedies in a strong and \ngraceful manner.\n  In addition to her six children, Courtney Wheeler has a total of 94 \ndescendants. She has 22 grandchildren, 36 great grandchildren, 29 \ngreat-great grandchildren and 1 great-great-great grandchild. She has \ndefinitely been blessed with a large and loving family.\n  Throughout her life, Courtney has been a loving and caring person to \nher family and friends. She has always maintained a cheerful spirit and \nhas been an example to all. She has been an avid gardener of both \nflowers and vegetables her entire life, and is known far and wide for \nher cooking skills.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \npay tribute to Alice Lieberman, the mother of my former executive \nsecretary Sylvia Nolde. Alice Lieberman is a woman of grace and \nstrength and a role model for all ages. In testament of her service to \nher community and her positive impact on the youth of our Nation, I am \nsubmitting ``A Senior Portrait'', written by Ms. Abby Altshcul. The \nfollowing was written by Abby for her essay on her college admissions \napplication to Cornell University, where she was accepted.\n\n                           A Senior Portrait\n\n       With Congress pushing for cuts in Medicare and the baby \n     boomers struggling to stay young, irreverence for old age \n     seems to be at an all time high. Fortunately, a few \n     teenagers, who have at one point lived in Charlottesville, \n     Virginia still hold great respect for their elders. The \n     reason for this is Alice Lieberman, an 85-year-old Jewish \n     grandmother who has become the matriarch for the city's \n     Jewish community. These teems fondly remember chicken dinners \n     at her house and Friday night services by her side at \n     congregation Beth Israel. She had been a role model as a \n     long-time active member of Hadassah (a Jewish women's \n     organization), even assuming the presidency at the age of \n     eighty. Her fifty plus year marriage to Myer Lieberman and \n     commitment to her family has been an inspiration in this age \n     of high divorce rates and dysfunctional families. Her care \n     for her husband when he went to a nursing home led the way to \n     her volunteer work at Cedars Nursing Home. Alice even \n     influenced a girl named Abby to join her and work at the \n     Cedars for her bat mitzvah community service project and to \n     continue to visit the elderly friends they had made after the \n     bat mitzvah. Alice inherited this sense of duty from her \n     mother and passed it on to her two daughters, a teacher and a \n     congressional aide, who continue to volunteer while retired.\n       For many of her ``young friends'' it became a threat rather \n     than a chore to go to synagogue on Friday night and sit \n     quietly next to her. She transmitted the comfort and \n     tranquility she received from the prayers to Abby and anyone \n     else who was lucky enough to be seated beside her. One of \n     Abby's earliest memories is of sitting in services and \n     drawing a picture of her best friend, Alice, who sat next to \n     her. Alice still proudly displays the drawing next to Abby's \n     senior photo in her dining room. Ever since Abby moved away \n     two years ago, services haven't been as meaningful or \n     enjoyable without Alice. Her devotion is an inspiration to \n     many Jews especially the young people whom she effects.\n       The vitality Alice displays brings a whole new meaning to \n     the phrase ``aging gracefully.'' She goes everywhere and does \n     everything on her own without fear, even after a fall a few \n     years ago that resulted in a broken hip and landed her in a \n     nursing home for a few weeks. She entertains often and \n     continues to be an important part of Hadassah as head of \n     their ongoing and most successful fundraiser. Some people use \n     their golden years to relax and let the world serve them, but \n     for Alice Lieberman it is a chance to imbue the next \n     generation with motivation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5376-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5376-S5377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RURAL DEMONSTRATION ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today Senator Murkowski and I \nintroduced a bill called the Rural Telemedicine Demonstration Act of \n1997.\n  As the Senate knows, Senator Murkowski and I represent States where a \ngood number of our constituents live in rural areas. Individuals living \nin States like Montana often live in counties that are underserved by \nspecialty health care providers.\n  Due to new technology made possible by advances in fiber optics, it \nis now easier for rural citizens to be seen by specialty health care \nproviders.\n  Using this technology, a person living in Culbertson, MT, who would \nnormally drive 300 miles for specialty\n\n[[Page S5377]]\n\nmedical care in Billings, can now be ``seen'' by a physician via \ntelemedicine. But, in order for telemedicine systems to be a success in \nrural States like mine, Medicare must eventually reimburse telemedicine \nproviders. This bill is the first step in that direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5376-5", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REMARKS OF FORMER SENATOR ROMAN L. HRUSKA (R-NE) AT THE DEDICATION OF \n                THE NEW FEDERAL COURTHOUSE IN OMAHA, NE\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, last Friday a distinguished former \nMember of the United States Senate, Roman Hruska, was honored during a \ngroundbreaking ceremony for a new Federal courthouse to be constructed \nin downtown Omaha. This new Federal facility will be named the Roman L. \nHruska United States Courthouse.\n  I had the honor of knowing Senator Hruska when I served as \nadministrative assistant to former Congressman John Y. McCollister (R-\nNE), my friend and mentor, in the 1970's. Senator Hruska served on the \nSenate Appropriations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee as \nits ranking member. Several of my colleagues still serving today no \ndoubt recall Senator Hruska and his contributions to our work here in \nthe Senate. He is still going strong at 92 years of age and continues \nto stay involved in the Omaha community.\n  Much of his work on the Senate Judiciary Committee remains with us \ntoday. Whether it was the creation of the Legal Services Corporation, \nrevision of the Federal bankruptcy laws, reform of the Federal criminal \ncode or amendments to the Federal antitrust laws, his imprint can be \nfound. Senator Hruska always considered himself a work horse rather \nthan a show horse and his numerous contributions to our Federal legal \nand justice system bear that out.\n  That is why it is so fitting that the new Federal courthouse in Omaha \nhas been named after him. His lifelong work as a public servant and \nlawyer was dedicated to making our system of laws fair, just, and \nworkable for all citizens not just a privileged few. This is especially \ntrue with the Federal judiciary. Senator Hruska worked tirelessly to \nensure that the Federal court system and the judiciary would be run by \npeople of integrity, intellect, courage, and empathy for all the \npeople--traits that he exhibited throughout his career.\n  Mr. President, the new Hruska Courthouse is a welcome addition to \ndowntown Omaha. It will meet the immediate needs of the Federal \njudiciary and other agencies that support the judicial system like the \nU.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Attorneys Office, U.S. Probation Service, \nU.S. Pretrial Service and several other Federal agencies. The complex \nis designed to permit future expansion if needed. It will fit the \ntraditional solid architecture of downtown Omaha but have new \ntechnology to meet the demands of the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the remarks delivered by Senator Hruska at \nthe groundbreaking ceremony be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n                   Remarks by Senator Roman L. Hruska\n\n       It is with great humility that I thank my friends for their \n     many kind remarks here this afternoon. In particular, I wish \n     to single out the graciousness of my friend Jim Exon for his \n     selfless contribution to this special honor I receive today. \n     I also thank Senator Kerrey for his kind remarks.\n       For me, there is no better way to join together my love for \n     Nebraska, the City of Omaha, and a commitment to our system \n     of justice and the federal judiciary than being honored by \n     having my name associated with the new federal courthouse to \n     be built on this site.\n       Throughout my many years of service in Washington, DC, my \n     heart still remained in Omaha. As I addressed the business of \n     the U.S. Senate, the interests of Nebraska were always \n     foremost in my mind. Since retiring from the Senate more than \n     twenty years ago, I have tried to continue that commitment to \n     our community.\n       During my years as a public servant, I tried to follow a \n     simple set of principles which I believe also represent the \n     basic beliefs and feelings of my fellow Nebraskans.\n       I believed then and still believe in less government, not \n     more. I believed then and still believe that the courts \n     should defer to the legislatures in the matter of law-making. \n     I believed then and still believe that a truly independent \n     judiciary of the highest order of excellence is essential to \n     enforcement of the expressed will of the majority and the \n     protection of the fundamental rights of those in the \n     minority. I believed then and still believe that our judicial \n     system is the last bulwark against attacks on individual \n     liberty and freedom.\n       Democracy and individual freedom are sometimes fragile \n     things. Fortunately, they are now on the march around the \n     world. Gratefully, they have become our birthright and will \n     be further nurtured by this new complex.\n       But, the challenge remains great. Crime, breakdown of the \n     family, corruption and civil disorder are still present in \n     our society; even here in Omaha. We need to support actively \n     our police, prosecutors and judges as they carry out their \n     important responsibilities to uphold the law.\n       Looking at all of you assembled here and thinking about the \n     many years I have devoted to public service, I am heartened \n     for our future. Young leaders are emerging--many gathered \n     here today--who will carry on the principles I believe in and \n     who represent the best of our nation and state.\n       I am gratified and truly humbled by this occasion. Thank \n     you all for being here. Thank you all for your many \n     kindnesses and courtesies over the years. Thank you all for \n     this wonderful honor which you have bestowed upon me.\n       God bless the State of Nebraska and God bless \n     America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5377-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5377]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      THE 175TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RHODE ISLAND HISTORICAL SOCIETY\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to recognize the Rhode Island \nHistorical Society on the occasion of its 175th anniversary.\n  Founded in 1822, the Rhode Island Historical Society was established \nfor the purpose of rescuing artifacts and records pertaining to the \nhistory of our State and spreading the legacy of Rhode Island history. \nThe society today represents the fourth oldest historical society in \nthe United States and remains as one of the noble guardians of American \nhistory and culture. Over the years the society's repository of Rhode \nIsland history and culture has grown under the stewardship of \ngenerations of knowledgeable scholars, dedicated staff, and the \ngenerosity of gracious benefactors.\n  From its humble beginnings, the society has served as a haven for \nprecious artifacts which serve to record and preserve the rich history \nof Rhode Island. Today, we mark not only the past accomplishments of \nthe Rhode Island Historical Society, but we pause at an exciting \nthreshold as we embark upon the creation of Heritage Harbor.\n  Housed at the site of a former power plant at the head of \nNarragansett Bay, the historical society will lead a consortium of \nmuseums and cultural organizations in forming Heritage Harbor. The new \ncommunity will bring together the stories and treasures of the Ocean \nState through entertainment and enlightenment. Remaining true to Rhode \nIsland's founder Roger Williams, this new endeavor will be a lively \nexperiment. It will teach, entertain, and inspire. The Heritage Harbor \npromises to bring together the diverse cultures and communities of \nRhode Island to celebrate the time, traditions, and our many \ncontributions to collective greatness of this Nation.\n  Mr. President, I would ask that my colleagues join me in applauding \nthe Rhode Island Historical Society as we mark this milestone of 175 \nyears, celebrating its legacy, both past and future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5377-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5377-S5378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO VINCENT MARCONI JR., PORTSMOUTH STUDENT, AND WINNER OF THE \n                      NATIONAL PEACE ESSAY CONTEST\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Vincent Marconi Jr., a Portsmouth Senior High School \nstudent, on winning the first place in the State-level competition of \nthe 10th annual National Peace Essay Contest sponsored by the United \nStates Institute of Peace. This is certainly an accomplishment of which \nhe should be very proud and I salute him for his achievement.\n  The contest, which is open to students in all American high schools, \nis designed to encourage serious and realistic thinking about issues of \ninternational conflict resolution. Vincent was asked to write an essay \non managing and implementing peace agreements.\n  Vincent will receive a $750 college scholarship and will compete for \nnational awards of up to $5,000.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a group of \noutstanding students from my home State of Connecticut. Each of these \nyoung people has been recognized by the greater Hartford regional YWCA \nfor essays they wrote on the elimination of racism. As authors of the \nwinning essays, these young people attended the second annual ``In the \nCompany of Women'' luncheon with featured speaker Maya Angelou. I was \nprivileged to attend that luncheon and meet some of the essay contest \nwinners. Their words have inspired me and I am proud to share some of \ntheir insight with you today.\n  Danalyn Elder of Weaver High School in Hartford, says ``I do not \nconsider color (except perhaps if I am saying it is beautiful.)'' \nCourtney Yuen of Hall High School in West Hartford talks about dreams \n``* * * that offer a glimpse of a world without racism * * *'' Richardo \nSolomon of Bloomfield High School quotes Dr. Martin Luther King in \nconsidering whether people can ``* * * search deep down in their hearts \nto see a world without racism.''\n  In her winning essay, Julie Meslin explains that ``A world without \nracism would not be an easy place to live.'' Julie concludes, however, \nthat * * * ``we would be pioneers in a movement that the human soul has \nlonged for since the beginning of time. And it would be worth it.'' \nFrederick Jelks of Bloomfield High School describes the pursuit of a \nworld without racism as a collective effort of individuals regardless \nof race or heritage. This effort, he explains, ``will not happen over \nnight. The change will come about gradually * * * we may speed up that \nday when we can all kiss the glass of equality.''\n  In his essay entitled ``Color Me This,'' Greg Binstock of Hall High \nSchool considers the innocence of a young girl who loves all the colors \nof the rainbow equally and sees no reason to segregate the black and \nred pieces in a checkers game. In a moving biographical sketch, Radmila \nKhamzina shares her experiences with racism in her home country of \nAzerbaijan, and her insights on racism here in America.\n  Cheryl Vasquez of Wethersfield High School also uses personal \nexperiences to share her thoughts on a world without racism. As a \nPuerto Rican girl, Cheryl has felt the pain of racism. In the end, she \nconcludes that ``A world without racism would be a world of more hope, \na world of more dreams and a world of equality as God intended it to \nbe.'' Samantha Allaire of Manchester High School discusses a world \nwithout racism in which all employees receive equal opportunity and \nequal pay. This would produce a ``more efficient and productive \nworkforce altogether.''\n  In his short story about a world without racism, Jamilla Deria of \nWeaver High School imagines a scenario in which his ``Little Africa'' \nis inhabited by people of every nationality, living in harmony. In this \nworld, Jesus has ``an afro and piercing black skin instead of having \nblonde hair and blue eyes.'' This seemingly mixed up world is, in the \nend, ``groovy man, real groovy.'' Simshindo Msola of Weaver High School \ntalks about the devastating effects that racism has had on members of \nthe black community. The elimination of racism would enable African-\nAmericans and indeed all people to perform to their fullest potential \nand ``People would begin to have a positive and good attitude about \nthemselves, and society at large would benefit and improve.''\n\n  Nayoka Rose of Weaver High School sees a world without racism at ``. \n. . the time of birth and death.'' Infants lay side by side in a \nnursery, regardless of color, creed or heritage, and at death we lay \nside by side as ``. . . death knows no color or race.'' Michelle Davis \nof Weaver High School imagines a world without racism in which we would \nnot have war, fewer people would be incarcerated and more people would \nhave jobs. This world, Michelle says, does not have to be a dream.\n  Mizzara Belton of Weaver High School says that ``The thought of \nexcluding racism from my world is a joy.'' She envisions a society \nwhere the color of one's skin would not affect the treatment you \nreceive in a department store, your educational opportunities or \nprospects for employment. Finally, Kelly Citroni of Bolton High School \nconsiders those who have died as a result of racism. The holocaust and \nslavery might never have happened, there would be no Ku Klux Klan, and \nDr. Martin Luther King would not have been killed at the hands of a ``. \n. . person prejudiced against his skin color.'' Our world, Kelly \nconcludes, would experience ``dramatic change for the better'' without \nracism.\n  I am extremely proud of these young people and their thought-\nprovoking essays. Each student is able to describe the beauty of a \nworld without racism while sharing personal experiences and dreams.\n  These Connecticut students are well aware of the effects of racism. \nMost of them have experienced first-hand the pain of hatred and \nprejudice. Their essays, however, illustrate the hope that lies in each \nand every city throughout our great country. One must only stop to \nlisten to the dreams of our youth to see that blossoms of hope and \noptimism are flourishing among us. These young people can help us \nappreciate that we do not have to live with racism. If we close our \neyes and imagine all people are one, we can envision the joy of a world \nwithout racism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5378-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING DAVID GIULIANI\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is no secret to my colleagues \nthat perhaps the greatest contributor to our Nation's economic success \nis the hard work, perseverance and entrepreneurial spirit of America's \nsmall businessowners. It is, therefore, appropriate that the U.S. Small \nBusiness Administration has honored Washington State businessman, Mr. \nDavid Giuliani, as the National Small Business Person of the Year. Mr. \nGiuliani is president and chief executive officer of the Bellevue, WA, \nbased Optiva Corp. which manufactures the Sonicare brand of \ntoothbrushes. Starting Optiva as a technology transfer project from the \nUniversity of Washington in 1988, Mr. Giuliani has overseen the \ncompany's progression from a startup business to an employer of 250 \nwith sales of over $50 million in 1995. With growth of this kind it is \nnot surprising that, last October, Inc. Magazine recognized Optiva as \nthe second-fastest growing private company in the entire nation. To \ncelebrate its success at the production of its millionth toothbrush \nlast year, Mr. Giuliani's company gave away more than 1,000 Sonicare \ntoothbrushes to individuals who couldn't afford them on their own.\n   Mr. President, I am proud to represent a State that is home to such \nan outstanding businessman and citizen. Mr. Giuliani certainly deserves \nthe title of Small Business Person of the Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5378-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5378-S5379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         COMMENDING MARK D. CHAMBERLAIN FOR HIS ACT OF BRAVERY\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I recently received a letter that \nremarked upon the bravery and fortitude of a former U.S. Coast Guard \nmember, Mark D. Chamberlain.\n  On a chilly, rainy winter day, three generations of the Chamberlain \nfamily, Dale, Mark, and Justin set out on snowshoes in a wooded area of \nLyndonville, VT. After 5 hours of trekking in the woods, the eldest \nChamberlain, Dale, attempted to forge an ice-covered river when the ice \ngave way and dragged him under. Mark, his son, managed to grab a hold \nof his coat and pull him back to safety amid the chunks of ice and \nstrong river currents. Despite the fact that Dale was numb with cold, \nMark assured his father that he would be fine and convinced him to \nbegin walking. Mark led the party back to their vehicle and the three \nChamberlains returned safely to the warmth of their home.\n  Mark Chamberlain, not only set an heroic example for his son, Justin, \nto admire and follow, he also demonstrated the strength of the bonds \nthat tie families together.\n  Mr. President, I ask that an article about this experience which \nappeared in the Caledonian-Record be reprinted in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n[[Page S5379]]\n\n              [From the Caledonian-Record, March 10, 1997]\n\n           St. Johnsbury--Father Credits Rescue To Daring Son\n\n                           (By Andrew Turner)\n\n       Dale Chamberlain knows a thing or two about life, now that \n     he's looked death in the face and survived to tell about it.\n       On March 2, Chamberlain was snowshoeing with his son Mark \n     and grandson Justin on his property in Lyndonville when \n     tragedy nearly struck.\n       As Chamberlain tells it, the weather was about 45 degrees \n     and drizzly that day, the kind of mid-winter thaw that \n     deceives snow travelers so often\n       Chamberlain, his son and grandson, had been trekking the \n     woods near the South Wheelock River for about five hours, he \n     estimated, before coming to the river.\n       ``We were making tracks back to the river. I could hear the \n     roar of the water draining into channels in the ice Arriving \n     at the river, I could see a possible way to cross,'' \n     Chamberlain stated.\n       He said he began the attempt to cross and the way was \n     slippery. Water covered the ice to roughly 6 inches deep in \n     parts and he was able to use his ski poles to stabilize \n     himself, poking the ice ahead of him to make sure that it was \n     solid.\n       ``I punched a hole in one area (and) the ice let go in the \n     whole area around me. I went into the water and under the \n     ice,'' Chamberlain recounted.\n       Chamberlain floundered in the water helplessly, his head \n     just above the surface as ice continued to break away, making \n     it impossible to grasp onto anything firm. Hindering him was \n     the fact that his snowshoes had become tangled around each \n     other. He couldn't move his arms or legs.\n       ``My muscles were going numb. The only thing I was really \n     aware of was the roar of the rushing water,'' he said.\n       The next thing that he remembered was the feeling of his \n     son's hand on the back of his waterlogged jacket, tugging him \n     out of the current of the water and eventually to the shore.\n       ``He talked to me and assured me I was OK. He said he was \n     going to stand me up. He said it wouldn't do me any good to \n     just lie there,'' Chamberlain said.\n       Eventually they were able to get to their cars and make it \n     home, and to warmth. Chamberlain never received medical \n     treatment but was comforted by the fact that he had a son who \n     challenged adversity to save his father's life.\n       ``Thanks to the quick thinking and strength of my son I am \n     still among the living. I now know that no matter how much \n     experience you have in the woods the unexpected can always \n     happen. I just thank God for Mark's ability to analyze the \n     situation and spring into action immediately,'' he \n     said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5378-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL RACE FOR THE CURE\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to lend my voice today to \nthe thousands of women and men who are supporting the search for a cure \nto breast cancer.\n  Breast cancer is still the leading cause of mortality among American \nwomen between the ages of 35 and 54. In fact, odds are that one in \nevery eight women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime.\n  The encouraging news is that early detection is very effective in \ncurbing this disease. At the same time we continue efforts to find a \ncure, we must be equally diligent in our efforts to educate women about \nthe importance of regular clinical and self examinations for breast \ncancer.\n  On June 7, Americans all over the country will again have the \nopportunity to show their concern by participating in the 1997 National \nRace for the Cure. The race is a series of 5k runs and a 1-mile walk \nsponsored by the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation in Dallas.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, their spouses and staff to support the \nCapitol Hill Race for the Cure on June 7, where more than 50,000 are \nexpected to participate. This event will help raise money for breast \ncancer research and education and bring us all closer to the day when a \ncure is found. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5379-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO MERCYMOUNT COUNTRY DAY SCHOOL, 1997 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF \n                      EDUCATION BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievement of Mercymount Country Day School of Cumberland, RI, which \nwas recently honored as a U.S. Department of Education Blue Ribbon \nSchool.\n  As I think all in this chamber know, it is a highly regarded \ndistinction to be named a Blue Ribbon School, since these schools \nrepresent some of the cream of our educational crop. Through an \nintensive selection process beginning at the State level and continuing \nthrough a Federal Review Panel of 100 top educators, many of the very \nbest public and private schools in the Nation are identified as \ndeserving of this honor. These are schools that are particularly \neffective meeting local, State, and national goals. But, Mr. President, \nthis honor is not about determining who is best, it is about learning \nwhat works in educating today's children--the leaders of tomorrow.\n  Now, more than ever, it is important that we make every effort to \nreach out to students, that we truly engage and challenge them, and \nthat we make their education come alive. At the Mercymount Country Day \nSchool in Rhode Island, partnerships between parents and teachers have \nmade an enormous difference in the education of their students. They \nhave understood that the quality of education depends not only upon the \nefforts of schools and government; it also depends upon the ideas and \ninnovation of parents and community. At Mercymount, parent-teacher \ncooperation has brought computers into the classroom, and their ``Pull \nthe Plug'' on TV initiative has helped students get away from \ntelevision sets and into reading and other challenging activities. \nMercymount has also developed a wonderful fine arts program, and as \nresearch has shown, the pursuit of education in the arts at an early \nage improves a child's cognitive ability. Again, Mercymount is making a \nhuge difference in the lives of its students.\n  Mr. President, the Blue Ribbon School initiative shows us the very \nbest we can do for students, and the techniques that can be replicated \nin all schools to help all students learn. I am proud to say that in \nRhode Island we can look to a school like Mercymount Country Day. Under \nthe leadership of its principal, Sister Martha Mulligan, its capable \nfaculty, and its improved parents, Mercymount will continue to be a \nshining example for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5379-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5379-S5384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n       In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the \n     Secretary of the Senate herewith submits the following \n     report(s) of standing committees of the Senate, certain joint \n     committees of the Congress, delegations and groups, and \n     select and special committees of the Senate, relating to \n     expenses incurred in the performance of authorized foreign \n     travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22\n                                                       U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES FOR TRAVEL FROM JAN. 1 TO MAR. 31, 1997\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total\n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                            Name of  currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.\n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenator Jeff Bingaman:\n    Singapore..............................

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nimmediately proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination on the Executive Calendar: Calendar No. 115, Elizabeth \nMoler, to be Deputy Secretary of Energy. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and statements relating to the nomination appear \nat this point in the Record, the President be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action, and the Senate then return to legislative session.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nbe brief because I know a lot of Senators want to depart, this will be \nthe only opportunity we will have to express the hope that we could do \nbetter than what we have done this week, as good as it has been. The \nPresident has indicated tonight that he would be prepared to return the \nbill, the supplemental bill, to us tonight. There is no reason why, \ngiven that we could not vote on it tomorrow and send it back in time \nfor him to sign it before the end of the week, because we are not going \nto be in--that is the announcement made by the majority leader--many of \nus believe that we need to vote against adjournment simply because it \nis our hope to stay in until the President returns the bill, giving us \nthe opportunity to vote on it one more time this week.\n  I thank the majority leader for yielding. I have no objection to the \nunanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination considered and confirmed is as follows:\n\n                          Department of Energy\n\n       Elizabeth Anne Moler, of Virginia, to be Deputy Secretary \n     of Energy.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Elizabeth Anne (Betsy) Moler brings a \nstrong record to the Deputy Secretary of Energy position. She has \nperformed very ably in her previous leadership of the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, and her past background with the Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee will stand her in good stead in \ndealings with Congress. Two of her many accomplishments with FERC \ninvolved crafting order 636, which unbundled and largely deregulated \nthe natural gas pipeline industry. And since 1992, she has led the \nCommission's deregulation of electricity utility markets--and she can \nnow continue that leadership through her role within the Department. In \nall her previous assignments, Betsy Moler has demonstrated a keen \nanalytical approach to complex issues. The Department will benefit from \nher abilities.\n  She has a formidable task ahead of her, together with Secretary Pena, \nto attack the stifling bureaucratic foundations of the Department and \nroot out the serious inefficiencies that plague the Department's \noperations. Quickly moving to external safety and health regulation of \nthe national laboratories, on a time scale far shorter than the \nleisurely one proposed by the Department, and slashing the micro-\nmanagement of the Department will be challenges exceeding those that \nshe faced at FERC.\n  I look forward to working with Deputy Secretary Betsy Moler and \nSecretary Pena to help shape the Department into a critical and highly \nvalued contributor to national priorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5384-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

MARSHALL MONTH\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 97 \nsubmitted earlier today by Senator Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 97) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate that the President\n\n[[Page S5385]]\n\n     should designate the month of June 1997, the 50th anniversary \n     of the Marshall Plan, as George C. Marshall Month, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on June 5, 1947--50 years ago today--Gen. \nGeorge Catlett Marshall, delivered remarks at Harvard University's \ncommencement exercises which would change the course of history. In \nthat speech, General Marshall outlined the necessity for and goals of \nwhat would later be known as the Marshall plan.\n  In 1947, 2 years after the end of World War II, Europe was struggling \nto recover from the devastation of the war. Millions were dead, 5,000 \ncities had been destroyed, and countless industries laid in ruin. Yet, \nwhile recognizing the very apparent physical destruction, Marshall \nremarked during his speech that, ``this visible destruction was \nprobably less serious then the dislocation of the entire fabric of \nEuropean economy.''\n  Marshall continued, ``It is logical that the United States should do \nwhatever it is able to do to assist in the return of the normal \neconomic health in the world, without which there can be no political \nstability and no assured peace.''\n  In the following years, over $13 billion in economic relief and \ntechnical assistance was provided to the 16 European nations which \nchose to participate in the program. From 1948 to 1951, the 4 years of \nthe Marshall plan, industrial production in Europe increased 36 \npercent.\n  With the return of economic stability, political stability throughout \nWestern Europe soon followed. As a result, Europe--and indeed the \nentire Western World--has enjoyed an unprecedented period of peace and \nprosperity.\n  For his vision and commitment, General Marshall received the Nobel \nPeace Prize in 1953.\n  Several years after the enactment of the Marshall plan, Winston \nChurchill wrote, ``Succeeding generations should not be allowed to \nforget his achievements and his example.'' I am proud to say that two \norganizations in the Commonwealth of Virginia are dedicated to \npreserving and promoting in society Marshall's ideals and values of \ndisciplined selfless service, hard work, integrity and compassion. They \nare the George C. Marshall Foundation and the George C. Marshall \nInternational Center.\n  The George Marshall Foundation, located in Lexington, VA, overlooks \nthe campus of Marshall's alma mater, the Virginia Military Institute. \nIn addition to a memorial to a great American leader, the George \nMarshall Foundation building contains a museum, archive and library for \nresearch concerning his life and times. The foundation's programs \ninclude scholarly publications and conferences and public education on \nU.S. military and diplomatic history in the 20th century.\n  The George C. Marshall International Center is located in Leesburg, \nVA, at the Dodona Manor, the home of George Marshall. The George \nMarshall International Center seeks to ensure that Marshall's vision \nand legacy are not forgotten by preserving Dodona Manor for posterity \nand fostering educational programs. ``The Marshall Plan: Against All \nOdds,'' a documentary film underwritten by the center will air on PBS \non Saturday, June 6 at 9 pm.\n  Tonight, the George Marshall International Center and George Marshall \nFoundation will host a gala dinner honoring the Soldier-Statesman and \nhis influence on the 20th century.\n  On April 23, 1997, I introduced Senate Joint Resolution 27 to \ndesignate the month of June 1997, the 50th anniversary of George \nMarshall's speech, as George C. Marshall Month. The resolution \nrecognizes the efforts of the George Marshall Foundation in Lexington, \nVA, the George Marshall International Center in Leesburg, VA, and the \nFriends of Marshall in Uniontown, PA, to continue in American life the \nvalues for which Gen. George Catlett Marshall stood.\n  Further, this resolution calls upon all Americans to rededicate \nthemselves to the ideals of public service, hard work, integrity, and \ncompassion which General Marshall represents to this day in American \nsociety.\n  Senate Joint Resolution 27 was favorably reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee on June 3 and is before the full Senate today. I \nask my colleagues to support this important resolution today as a \nfitting tribute to an extraordinary American.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution \nappear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The resolution was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 97), with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 97\n\n       Whereas 1997 marks the fiftieth year since the European \n     Recovery Program, or what came to be called the Marshall \n     Plan, was first conceived and proclaimed by General George \n     Catlett Marshall while he was serving as Secretary of State \n     of the United States.\n       Whereas the Marshall Plan has been hailed by leaders of \n     World War II allied and enemy countries alike as the most \n     magnanimous act by Americans in history;\n       Whereas the Marshall Plan made possible new measures of \n     trans-Atlantic cooperation through the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization and other institutions;\n       Whereas these institutional developments have profoundly \n     enhanced the security, freedom, and prosperity of the United \n     States and the Atlantic Community generally;\n       Whereas new challenges have arisen which call for \n     recommitment to and reinvigoration of these institutions and \n     for their continued viability;\n       Whereas creative thought and rededication to the ideals and \n     principles undergirding the Marshall Plan are now necessary \n     in order to assure the preservation and perfection of these \n     institutions; and\n       Whereas the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the \n     Marshall Plan provides a fitting opportunity for rededication \n     of commitments to these institutions: Now, therefore, be it.\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) that magnanimity underlies the Marshall Plan, the \n     dedication to public service and integrity of its author, and \n     the efforts by the Marshall Foundation in Lexington, \n     Virginia, the Marshall International Center in Lessburg, \n     Virginia, and the Fiends of Marshall, Uniontown, \n     Pennsylvania, to continue in American life the values for \n     which General George Catlett Marshall stood;\n       (2) that all Americans should rededicate themselves to the \n     ideals of public service, hard work, integrity, and \n     compassion which General Marshall represents to this day in \n     American society; and\n       (3) that the values that inspired the initiation of the \n     Marshall Plan should continue to be cherished by the people \n     of the United States.\n       Sec. 2. It is, further, the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should issue a proclamation designating the month \n     of June 1997 as ``George C. Marshall Month'' and calling upon \n     the people of the United States to observe George C. Marshall \n     Month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I just express my appreciation to the \ndistinguished leadership and to the Members of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/05/senate-section/article/S5384-5", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
