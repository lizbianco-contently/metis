The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Bob Perret, a \ncongressional fellow in my office, have floor privileges during the \npendency of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday the chairman of the Energy and \nWater Subcommittee and I came to the floor with this bill, the fiscal \nyear 1999 appropriations bill, for the programs, projects, and \nactivities of the Department of Energy, Corps of Engineers, the Bureau \nof Reclamation, and other independent agencies. I support this $21 \nbillion bill. It is not a perfect bill, but it is a very good bill. We \nworked under very extreme conditions in order to get the bill to the \npoint that we have. This is a balanced bill. We did our best to \naccommodate everyone's priorities and projects.\n  Mr. President, on the way back to my office yesterday evening I was \nwith some of the staff, and I asked one of the staff, ``What is that \nyou're carrying?'' And I am not exaggerating, it was a folder, a big \nlooseleaf notebook. And he said they were the requests from Members for \nprojects in this bill.\n  We did our best. We did not make everyone happy. We tried to make \nsure that we had a balanced approach so that States could meet their \nneeds.\n  We did not get all the cooperation that I would like to have had from \nthe administration. They cut $1.5 billion from water projects. This \nleft us with projects unfinished, left us with projects that simply \nneeded to go forward. So we had to rearrange this pot to the point we \nare now here.\n  So I recommend this bill to my colleagues. This is a bill that \nincludes\n\n[[Page S6508]]\n\nabout $21 billion for essential services in the Department of Energy \nand the construction and maintenance of water projects around the \nNation.\n  I hope that, as my friend from Washington has said, Members will come \nforward and offer amendments. We have a limited amount of time. And I \nwould suggest that if we do not get some amendments coming soon--this a \nvery important appropriations bill--that we should move to third \nreading and move on to something else.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2713\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Domenici, for Senator \nInouye, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] for Mr. Inouye, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2713.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 18, add the following before the period:\n       ``:Provided further, The Secretary of the Interior is \n     directed to use not to exceed $200,000 of funds appropriated \n     herein to provide technical assistance in a study of measures \n     to increase the efficiency of existing water systems \n     developed to serve sugar cane plantations and surrounding \n     communities in the State of Hawaii''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, our desires not yet having been met, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2714\n\n (Purpose: To add provisions of Amendment No. 2420 relating to tobacco \n                                policy)\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2714.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have the floor; do I not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I won't be long. I will accommodate the \nmanager of the bill.\n  Let me just say this is an amendment that reflects where we were \nyesterday on what we consider to be one of the most important issues \nfacing our country. I am hopeful that we can come back to this \nlegislation again, as we debated it yesterday. The tobacco bill may \nhave died last night, but the tobacco issue is very much alive.\n  We have noted that as legislation is presented to the Senate we have \nno recourse but to continue to press for final consideration, to get a \nvote, and ultimately to pass legislative changes that will allow us to \nconfront the remarkable problems that we are facing in our country \ntoday. In South Dakota, 45 percent of teenagers now are addicted to \nsmoking or are smoking--45 percent. Every day, thousands of children \ncontinue to light up for the first time.\n  Many of us feel that even though we lost parliamentarily yesterday, \nthat we have no choice but to continue to press this issue, to continue \nto force the Senate to consider ways with which to resolve this matter.\n  As I said, there ought to be principles that unite us, principles \nthat Republicans and Democrats can agree with, principles that would \nallow the FDA to regulate tobacco as a drug, principles that would \nallow us to come up with an orchestrated national effort to discourage \nsmoking among teenagers, principles that recognize the importance of \nresearch as we continue to confront the myriad of health problems that \nare directly related to smoking and addiction. Those are principles \nthat ought to unite us.\n  I don't think anyone ought to come to any conclusion that somehow \nbecause the McCain bill died last night that we now can wash our hands \nof this issue, that we now are going to move that aside and think that \neverything is just fine with regard to the schedule or with regard to \nthis particular issue. It isn't. We are not going to be fine until we \nhave come to some conclusion about this. It doesn't really matter what \nlegislation comes before the Senate. We are going to be compelled, \neither in the form of amendment or in a motion to proceed, to force the \nSenate, to whatever extent we can, to stay focused on this issue until \nwe resolve it. We are open for suggestions on how we might break this \nimpasse, how we might resolve this matter. We are certainly prepared to \nsit down with our colleagues and come up with a piece of legislation \nthat will work.\n\n  We will not let this issue die. We believe very strongly that it must \ncontinue. That is, in essence, what this amendment does. This \namendment, for the information of all of my colleagues, simply takes us \nback to the McCain bill and the managers' amendment. The managers' \namendment was added after a great deal of consultation with Members on \nboth sides of the aisle. The managers' amendment and the McCain bill \npassed, I remind my colleagues, on a vote of 19-1 out of the Commerce \nCommittee.\n  So this is an opportunity, once again, to use a vehicle to start the \nnegotiations to allow us to come to closure on this issue. I had hoped \nwe could do it sooner rather than later. This is an important bill. I \nhope we can get on to energy and water. I hope we can deal with all of \nthe appropriations bills. Those bills have to be dealt with, but at the \nsame time, many of us believe that tobacco has to be dealt with as \nwell. Our effort to deal with it will have to be in the form of \namendments or in the form of our motions to proceed so long as we \nhaven't found any closure on how we ultimately resolve this very, very \nimportant national issue.\n  I hope we can have a good debate on this amendment. I hope we can \nhave some good give-and-take about what we might do, as a Senate, \nRepublicans and Democrats, to break this impasse and ultimately to pass \nmeaningful tobacco legislation this month.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as the Democratic leader said, what he has \nproposed now is that instead of dealing with the normal appropriations \nbills before the Senate, we should go back to a debate which has taken \nthe last 4 weeks of the Senate's time and ignore everything else that \nis appropriate in the Senate business.\n  Last evening, in the last vote, his position fell eight votes shy of \ngetting a necessary budget waiver because of its immense cost to the \npeople of the United States. This proposal, obviously, is equally \nsubject to such a point of order, one that I expect that the majority \nleader is likely to interpose soon. The result will be identical. In \nother words, it is simply a frustrating waste of the Senate's time when \nthe Senate ought to be engaged in the business that is before us, and \nthat is the energy and water appropriations bill.\n  I share one sentiment with the Democratic leader. I believe that the \nSenate should pass a bill relating to tobacco. I don't believe that it \nshould be\n\n[[Page S6509]]\n\nanything like the bill that was before us yesterday, by any stretch of \nthe imagination. But if we are to pass legislation on the subject, it \nis going to require more understanding and more tolerance of one side \nto the other than evidenced in the course of the last 3 or 4 weeks. It \nclearly is not going to be accomplished by the kind of amendment that \nwas placed before the Senate at this point.\n  Awaiting further instructions from the majority leader, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nickles pertaining to the introduction of S. 2187 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nMcCain bill, and I urge my colleagues not to revive this job-busting \nand budget-busting bill in committee. Like the wicked witch, it is \ndead, and I am delighted that its tortured life is over. I would like \nto reflect on this past month of debate on the tobacco bill, Mr. \nPresident, and I want to say a few words about this bill and its \neffects.\n  Mr. President, tobacco has a long and proud heritage in North \nCarolina. Since Colonial times, hard-working men and women have \nsupported their families on tobacco, whether by coaxing tobacco from \nthe ground or by processing it into the products used by consumers \nacross the country.\n  On that note, Mr. President, I want to say a few words in defense of \nthe people we have heard least about during this endless debate. I'm \ntalking about the hard-working men and women of the tobacco \nmanufacturing facilities. We hear all about Big Tobacco, Mr. President, \nbut they're the folks who will suffer if this bill is not stopped. Many \nthousands of North Carolinians earn their livings in tobacco \nmanufacturing and distribution. They work in the plants and in the \nwarehouses, in the factories and on the loading docks, and on the \ninterstates transporting the product.\n  These are good jobs, Mr. President, good jobs with good wages and \ngood benefits. This bill puts those working people in its cross hairs. \nIt is no secret to the people of my State that, in their declaration of \nwar on tobacco, President Clinton and Vice President Gore assaulted the \nheart of our agricultural heritage. The anti-tobacco armies and the \ntrial lawyers created the most serious threat to face the tobacco \nfamily in many years.\n  Just look at the line-up in Congress. Just look at the overwhelming \nsupport in the Democratic caucus for this bill. Democratic Senator Dick \nDurbin wails that tobacco is the only government-supported crop ``with \na body count.'' Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy decries tobacco with \ncharacteristic bluster and charges the industry with ``the insidious \nand shameful poisoning of generations of children.'' If we defeat this \nbill, Mr. President, it will be with the help of just a couple of \nDemocrats. Where are the defenders of the working folks?\n  This is not about Big Tobacco, Mr. President, it's about hard-working \nmen and women. The unions and I don't always agree, Mr. President, but \nI want to insert into the Record a statement from the North Carolina \nA.F.L.-C.I.O. They hit the nail on the head--this is about saving our \njobs and saving our communities--and I stand with the working folks \nagainst the liberals, the trial lawyers, and the other special \ninterests bent on destroying jobs.\n  Phillip Morris and R.J. Reynolds major employers in North Carolina. \nI'm proud of the working men and women at these factories. They're not \nthe most popular folks on Capitol Hill these days, but that fact just \nspeaks volumes about the confused values up in Washington, because we \nshould honor their hard work not try to throw them out of their jobs. \nAnd they're not the only ones who will lose their jobs. These taxes \nwill cripple countless businesses.\n  The McCain bill seeks to increase retail cigarette prices as much as \n$4.98 in real terms by 2004, tapering off to $3.80 by the year 2007. I \nam informed that this could lead to a reduction of nearly 50 percent in \nretail cigarette sales, along with large-scale increases in illegal \nsmuggling activities, and that will cost American jobs.\n  By 2004, the year in which the payments under the McCain proposal \npeak, the loss in cigarette sales will lead to devastating economic \nconsequences, and it will be the working men and women who will feel \nthis pain. The economic models show that the price increases--and the \neffects of increased foreign smuggling--could lead to job losses \napproaching 1,152,974 workers nationally. That is a mind-boggling \nnumber, just think of 1,152,974 disrupted lives, all those hopes and \ndreams thrown into doubt and chaos. These are real people, supporting \nreal families, working in diverse businesses. They are not just tobacco \nmanufacturing workers, but also convenience store clerks, line workers \nin paper mills, long distance truckers, and graphic artists in \nadvertising agencies.\n  For example, in North Carolina, it is estimated that the impact of \nthis proposal will lead to a total loss of 48,691 direct jobs. The \neffect would be similar to a lay-off of this magnitude from a single \nemployer, Mr. President, with the total impact on the community \napproaching 161,953 jobs. The implications of the McCain bill would be \nsimilar to laying off all of the 40,100 employees of both Burlington \nIndustries in Greensboro and Family Dollar Stores of Charlotte.\n  However, most of these jobs are in communities that do not have any \nother industries of comparable size, so it is highly doubtful whether \ndisplaced workers would be able to find new jobs near home. Some \nsupporters of the tobacco bill have questioned whether this matters. \nThey claim that displaced workers can just move to where the jobs are. \nWell, that's not good enough. People have roots in their communities. \nAny farmer will tell you that you risk killing a plant when you pull \nout its roots and move it. People are no different.\n  And even if displaced workers can find new jobs without displacing \ntheir families and abandoning their communities, they are not likely to \nbe able to match their current salaries and benefits. These are not \nwealthy people. These are working people. They simply cannot afford to \nlose a significant portion of their income.\n  We can reduce underage tobacco use. But we won't do it by punishing \nthe innocent and honorable men and women who work in the tobacco \nindustry. And we won't do it by destroying the economic engine that has \nsupported their communities for generations. Mr. President, the men and \nwomen who work in the tobacco industry and the people who depend upon \nthem deserve our respect and support. They have earned it. Please join \nwith me in giving it to them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the statement from the North Carolina \nAFL-CIO be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  North Carolina Unions Stand Up for Tobacco Jobs: Urge Political and \n  Business Leaders To Save State's Economy by Joining Fight for Fair \n                               Settlement\n\n       Raleigh.--``Save Our Jobs, Save Our Communities,'' was the \n     rally call of the state AFL-CIO and its unions representing \n     workers in the tobacco and related industries. They're \n     gravely concerned with the negative impact on North Carolina \n     jobs and the economy if current tobacco legislation pending \n     in the U.S. Congress becomes law.\n       The unions want political and business leaders to stand up \n     for workers in tobacco and related industry, who will lose \n     their jobs if the right tobacco deal is not passed in \n     Washington.\n       ``I'm here today to speak up for the thousands of hard-\n     working North Carolina men and women whose jobs are \n     threatened by tobacco proposals coming out of Washington, \n     D.C.,'' said James Andrews, president of the North Carolina \n     AFL-CIO. ``These workers have been forgotten by the elected \n     officials who are more concerned about politics then stopping \n     underage smoking and keeping good jobs in our communities.''\n       ``The nation needs an end to the tobacco wars,'' he added. \n     ``Like everyone in this country, we want to stop kids from \n     smoking. The unions in the industry have consistently\n\n[[Page S6510]]\n\n     supported strong, effective controls on youth access to \n     tobacco. However, we also want to make sure any proposal \n     protects our jobs.''\n       Pending legislation in the U.S. Senate would devastate many \n     communities in the state, the union leaders charge. ``The \n     McCain bill now before the Senate would destroy jobs, \n     bankrupt the industry and create a black market in which its \n     impossible to protect our children,'' said T.J. Warren of the \n     Bakery Confectionery and Tobacco Workers Union.\n       Last June when the State Attorneys General worked out a \n     settlement with the tobacco industry, the unions had high \n     hopes of ending the tobacco wars with legislation that helped \n     national health goals but at the same time preserved jobs.\n       ``I am tired of hearing about proposals that destroy jobs \n     and increase taxes in the name of tobacco reform \n     legislation,'' said Warren. ``Many members of Congress want \n     to punish the tobacco companies. But, multinational tobacco \n     firms aren't going to be punished. They'll switch production \n     to low-wage countries and thrive. No one gets punished except \n     the U.S. grower and worker and the communities in which we \n     live, work and spend our consumer dollars.''\n       ``If tobacco moves overseas our plant will close. It cannot \n     be converted to produce other products. More than 90% of what \n     Acusta Corporation makes in Brevard is sold to cigarette \n     companies. We make cigarette papers, foil, package and \n     cellophane,'' said Jerry Stuart, president of Paperworkers \n     local union 1971. ``In the western part of North Carolina \n     good jobs are scarce. If our plant closed it would be an \n     economic disaster area. Not only would Paperworkers be out of \n     work but many small businesses and even small towns would \n     close up.''\n       ``Our members do not want their children to smoke, but they \n     don't want to lose their jobs. These drivers who have \n     established a middle class way of life would be forced into \n     the working poor,'' said Chip Roth of the Teamsters Union. \n     ``The Attorneys General came to a reasonable settlement that \n     will crack down on teen age smoking while allowing the \n     industry to continue.''\n       ``I'm convinced a nation as resourceful as ours can devise \n     national legislation that ends the tobacco wars and fulfills \n     our national public health goals without destroying quality \n     U.S. jobs and devastating the communities in which we live \n     and work,'' said Andrews. ``I refuse to believe that a nation \n     built on freedom and fairness through compromise cannot give \n     the nation what it needs--an end to the tobacco wars and a \n     clear, predictable future for our jobs and families.''\n       The unions would support a legislative solution that:\n       Gives Americans a clear, predictable future where kids \n     don't smoke, public health goals are met and smokers and non-\n     smokers alike have their rights respected.\n       Maintains the U.S. manufacture and export of a product that \n     both domestic and foreign consumers want, thereby preserving \n     U.S. jobs and communities.\n       Avoids unfair and regressive taxes that single our some \n     individuals to bear the burden while making possible an \n     immensely profitable black market in which we cannot control \n     cigarette sales.\n       Ends the uncertainty of unpredictable litigation and \n     relentless regulatory battles and brings stability to the \n     industry and its jobs.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the \npending Daschle amendment violates section 302(f) of the Budget Act and \nthat it would cause the Energy and Water Subcommittee to exceed its \n302(b) allocation.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n\n\n                     motion to waive the budget act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act to permit \nconsideration of the amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for the information of all Members, they \nshould understand that this amendment on the part of the Democratic \nleader does not take us back to where we were yesterday. This is a bill \nthat might best be called Commerce 2. It does not include any of the \ndrug provisions; it does not include a repeal of the marriage penalty; \nit does not even include the Gregg amendments or the Durbin amendments. \nIt does not include the amendment that was one of mine that was passed \nto limit attorneys' fees. In effect, this doesn't take us back to \nyesterday afternoon, it takes us back to 4 weeks ago. I hope that \nMembers will overwhelmingly deny this.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on the \nmotion to waive.\n\n\n                              Quorum Call\n\n  Mr. REID.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator withhold that for 2 minutes so I can \nmake a comment?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will withhold for some debate, but not \nfor the offering of an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have just seen an opportunity for the \nSenate to address the issue of public health for the children of this \ncountry once again, with the introduction of the legislation by Senator \nDaschle.\n  This is going to be the first of many attempts to try to ensure that \nthe Senate is going to take action to try to protect the young people \nof this country. That is what this issue is all about. What we have \njust seen as a result of the vote is that the Republican Party is \nstonewalling action here in the U.S. Senate and, evidently, still \nkowtowing to the power of big tobacco and their campaign contributions.\n  We are not going to be silent on this issue, and we are going to \ncontinue to raise it. We believe that it is the most important public \nhealth issue, certainly for the children of this Nation, and it is an \nissue that is not going to go away.\n  So maybe today there is one more opportunity, by a narrow margin, to \ndefeat those forces and for a reasonable and responsible approach on \nthis issue. This issue is not going to go away. Our Republican friends \nhad better get used to addressing it because they are going to have the \nopportunity to do it many more times until we get responsible action \nhere, where the Senate is responding to the people's needs, the \nfamilies' needs, not the interest of big tobacco.\n  This amendment by Senator Daschle would have given the Senate a \nsecond chance--an opportunity to reconsider its ill advised action of \nlast night. A minority of Republicans used a transparent parliamentary \nploy to frustrate the will of a majority of the Senate. The two votes \nlast night proved that a bipartisan majority of the Senate supports \ntough antismoking legislation. It also proved that an obstructionist \ngroup of Republicans will stop at nothing to prevent fair consideration \nof the McCain bill. Those Republicans put the interest of the tobacco \nindustry above the health of America's children. For the last four \nweeks, they have parroted the messages being broadcast in cigarette \ncompany advertisements. Last night, they gave their votes as well as \ntheir voices to Big Tobacco.\n  This issue will not go away. It will haunt the Republicans until they \nallow the bipartisan majority which exists to pass strong antismoking \nlegislation to do so. Just as the Democratic leader brought the issue \nback to the floor today, we will bring it back again and again. This \nwillful band of Republican obstructionists may have killed a bill last \nnight and blocked consideration of the Daschle amendment today, but \nthey cannot kill an idea whose time has come. Make no mistake, the time \nhas come to protect our children from the evil influence of the tobacco \nindustry.\n  The times has come to stop 3,000 children a day from beginning to \nsmoke.\n  The time has come to save those children from a lifetime of addiction \nand premature death caused by smoking-induced illness.\n  The time has come to raise the price of cigarettes so they will not \nbe easily affordable to children.\n  The time has come to stop the tobacco industry's targeting of \nchildren with billions of dollars of seductive and misleading \nadvertising.\n  The time has come to protect millions of nonsmokers from the health \nhazards of secondhand smoke.\n  The time has come to prevent the 400,000 deaths caused each year by \ntobacco use.\n  No power on Earth--not even the Republican leadership of the Senate--\ncan stop an idea whose time has come. The time has come for the Senate \nto reject the perverse influence of Big Tobacco, and to do what is \nright for America's children.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, first I just have to say to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts that I am always sort of offended with the idea that \nif someone doesn't agree with him, they are suddenly a captive of \nspecial interests. I think that is very unfair. There are people who \nhave different views, legitimate views, and I think they should be free \nto express those.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \ndebate only until 12 noon.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nwanted to ask for a few minutes before we enter into that debate.\n  I am not submitting an amendment. I just wanted to have the right to \nmake a comment for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I absolutely have no objection to that. We are simply \nasking that the Senate proceed to debate until 12 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to join my colleague, Senator \nKennedy, in expressing what just happened here in the Senate. We just \nlost an opportunity to, in effect, begin with a clean bill. The \ncomplaint yesterday was that the bill had been too loaded down. The \ncomplaint yesterday was that the process had gotten away from us. In \neffect, what Senator Daschle did was put us back in the place where we \nbegan, to a committee piece of legislation that came to the floor by a \nvote of 19 to 1. And it was a piece of legislation, before the Lugar \namendment was put in, before the liability amendment of Senator Gregg \nhad passed, before the marriage penalty, before the Coverdell\n\n[[Page S6512]]\n\ndrug plan, before all of those things that were accused of loading it \nup. So, in effect, we had an opportunity to really start from scratch \nlearning the lessons that the Senate had learned over the course of the \nlast 3 weeks. But once again that was rejected.\n  As the Senator from Massachusetts said, this will be revisited. This \nissue is not one that will go away. As I said previously, you can run \nbut there is no way to hide with respect to the responsibility that is \nexpected for our children in the efforts to reduce teenage smoking. \nThat will be revisited.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, the McCain bill is dead, and I say good \nriddance. It was nothing more than a massive tax increase on working \nAmericans to fund an expansion of the Federal government. However, I \nsuspect that we will revisit the tobacco issue, and I want to ensure \nthat my colleagues remain aware of a critical issue to the people of my \nState. I'm talking about thousands of tobacco farm families. These are \npeople who depend on tobacco farming for their livelihood and who share \na long and proud heritage.\n  Mr. President, my farmers are hurting, and we're losing more and more \nof them every year. The tobacco quota continues to drop, but not their \ncredit payments, so they're getting squeezed to the limits. Some of \nthem are well past their limits and were forced off their farms.\n  I believe that we will face the tobacco issue again next year. \nCertainly, whether or not we do a small and far less expensive youth \naccess bill without a tax increase at the end of this year, we will \nreturn to the so-called tobacco settlement next year. If we return to \nthis bill next year--not in a politically charged atmosphere just five \nmonths from Election Day--it will be far easier to manage this process \nand to come up with a reasonable bill that addresses the needs of all \nparties. That means farmers, and that is a critical point, because they \nare the folks on the front line and under fire in this war on tobacco.\n  We need to address this issue in a calm and reasonable atmosphere, \nnot this hysteria, and I look forward to that debate. The men and women \nof the tobacco family need some certainty. If the Democrats want to \ncontinue their war against tobacco--and I want to point out that just \ntwo Democrats voted to kill the McCain bill--I say ``protect the \nfarmers'' because they are the innocent victims of this unfair assault. \nThis is indeed an unparalleled assault on their crop.\n  The farmers need help--and a settlement bill must include this help--\nin order to restructure their debt to a manageable level. A long-term \npayment scheme will not service their debt because tobacco production \nwill continue to drop. These farmers fear that the creditors will call \nthe loans and the fire sales that follow will depress land and \nequipment prices. They can't sustain this assault by their own \ngovernment.\n  I want to be sure that the next generation of farmers have \nopportunities to grow tobacco, and I will fight to make sure that they \nhave those tools, because they are the future of our nation. They grow \nour food. In Sampson County, North Carolina, where I live, you see the \nslogan ``Support agriculture or try used food,'' and that sums it up. \nWe cannot let our farmers suffer. We will not let our farmers suffer.\n  I look forward to this debate--I hope it will be a reasonable one \nrather than a tax-and-spend bonanza--and I look forward to the effort \nto prepare our farmers for the future.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I intend to offer an amendment at an \nappropriate time, probably around noon. What I want to talk about is \nnational policy with respect to renewable energy.\n  I started on this issue back when I first came to Congress, which was \nin 1975, when this Nation woke up and realized that we were very \nvulnerable to the supply of oil. At that time, you may remember, we had \nlines of cars waiting for gasoline. We had terrible shortages. We \nrealized that this Nation, in order to make sure that it had a future, \nhad to do something about it. Working with my friends in the House, at \nthat time we established a wind energy program, which is still going \nstrong. We also increased the funding in research into solar energy and \nthe advantages that it gives to our society to recognize that the Sun \nis a tremendous source of energy and that it can be harnessed. We also \nlooked at biomass options as well.\n  Subsequent to that, when I came to the Senate, I also worked with the \ncommittee that handles it on the authorizing side. We developed a \nnational policy. I had hoped that national policy would have mandated \nthe course of action necessary to get this Nation to have 30 percent of \nits energy supplied by renewable sources. However, every word of my \namendment was adopted except one, and that one was, instead of \n``shall,'' it said ``may.'' That kind of switched things around as far \nas its importance. But the importance to continue to move forward to \nshift our dependence on foreign oil is something that has not gone \naway.\n  At that time, we established a chart of where we ought to be. Right \nnow, under that chart of going towards 30 percent of our energy to come \nfrom renewable, it is at 10 percent. That is where we are supposed to \nbe on course. We are not. We are at 8 percent.\n  What has happened now in this bill is that we have seen that \nrenewables are cut and whereas, although things are perhaps more \npopular, or whatever items are increased, renewables are cut. Last year \nwe got an additional $20 million approved, but when it got to \nconference, it disappeared. We are not making the kind of progress that \nthis Nation needs in order to be able to become less dependent and, \nhopefully, someday independent of foreign sources.\n  If we look at the world situation now, we should understand that the \nlargest amount of oil right now to take out of the ground, so to speak, \nis not available. The Crimean, which is one of the most volatile areas \nin the world, has the most oil that has to be looked to for the future. \nI think it is about 70 percent of what is available at the world level. \nThe second area is the Persian Gulf. Obviously, neither of those is \nvery close to us. So our dependency is increasing.\n  If you want to take a volatile area, you ought to take Crimea, right \nin the middle of one of the most volatile situations right now, \nincluding the areas of Pakistan all the way up through to Russia at the \nother end. And you have Iran and Iraq in the area. Those are areas that \nthe pipelines would have to go through. Incredibly, also with expanding \navailability of nuclear weapons, these are very fragile areas. To think \nthat we would have to rely upon them is very difficult. The same is \ntrue also, of course, with the Persian Gulf. Everyone is familiar with \nthe problems we had in the Persian Gulf and the nonreliability at \ncertain times of the availability of that oil.\n\n  The question is, What should we do? We decided years ago that we \ncould get to 30 percent, really, with utilization and to a large extent \nof biomass, as well as wind and solar energy, and that we could do it \nwith little or no increase in the cost of availability of the fuel, but \nit could give us the kind of utility we need. As I pointed out, we have \nnot made any progress in recent years. In fact, we are sliding back \nfrom where we ought to be.\n  So the amendment that Senator Roth and I will offer today is about \npriorities. I think we all agree that increased domestic energy \nproduction should be a priority. We would agree that a lower balance of \npayments should be a priority. We would stand up to U.S. companies \nselling U.S. manufactured energy technologies in overseas markets. We \nwould cheer the increased jobs, which would mean for every State in the \nNation. We would support the small companies across this Nation working \nto capture the booming global energy market. We would make it a \npriority to increase domestic energy production and promote clean air. \nBut that is not what has happened here. The bill before us further \nwhittles away at our Nation's efforts to wean itself from foreign oil.\n  The priorities in the bill for our Nation's energy policy go back \nyears. This legislation will erode our efforts to develop technologies \nthat increase domestic energy production. This bill ends commitments \nmade to small energy companies that depend on Federal\n\n[[Page S6513]]\n\nassistance to enter the giant global energy market. The funding levels \ncontained here reduce our Nation's efforts to make major advancements \nin energy development, energy that is affordable, that is a clean, and, \nmost importantly, made in America.\n  Today, Senator Roth and I offer an amendment to increase our Nation's \ninvestment in clean domestic production. The amendment would restore \nfunding to the Department of Energy's renewable research and \ndevelopment budget.\n  Mr. President, the fiscal year 1999 energy and water appropriations \nbill cuts funding for solar, cuts funding for wind, cuts funding for \nbiomass, cuts funding for hydrogen, cuts funding for geothermal, and \ncuts funding for hydropower research and development by $120 million, \nor 33 percent below the administration's request, and $20 million from \nthe fiscal year 1998 level. This $380 million account takes a $120 \nmillion cut. The amendment we offer today simply attempts to add back \nhalf this level, or $70 million, to the renewables budget.\n\n  A vote for this amendment is a vote to reduce our country's \ndependence on foreign oil from rogue nations like Iraq. A vote for this \namendment is a vote to support small businesses all across the United \nStates that produce clean renewable energy products. A vote for this \namendment is a vote to help the same small businesses grab onto a chunk \nof that rapidly growing export market for renewable products. A vote \nfor this amendment is a vote for cleaner air for our children.\n  Mr. President, I am going to address each of these reasons of why my \ncolleagues should support this bill in turn.\n  Nearly half of all of our Nation's oil is imported today. These \nimports account for almost $60 billion, or 36 percent; 36 percent of \nthe trade deficit is in this one area. These are U.S. dollars being \nshipped overseas to the Middle East which could be put to better use \nhere at home.\n  Consider the following chart, chart No. 1. This chart shows that the \nU.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that we will import \neven more of our oil, two-thirds of all oil we consume, by the year \n2020. That means we will continue to be held hostage by oil-producing \nnations, including rogue nations like Iraq.\n  This chart, as you can see way out here, shows we are just going to \nhave increased prices in oil and all sorts of difficulty as we get out \nto 2020. U.S. petroleum imports are expected to reach two-thirds of \nconsumption in the year 2020.\n  Our second chart, Mr. President, shows that we are not alone in our \nincreasing dependence on foreign sources of oil. The Energy Information \nAdministration also predicts that by the year 2020 the Persian Gulf \nwill supply one-half of the world's oil exports--one-half. Why would we \ncontinue to increase our addiction to that very volatile area of the \nworld?\n  We can reduce our dependence on Persian oil by continuing our \ninvestment in a clean domestic energy. I believe that these charts \ndemonstrate very clearly that action must be taken. The goals that we \nset a few years ago to say that we should be at 30 percent of \nrenewables must be adhered to.\n  Chart No. 3 shows that the United States currently obtains 8 percent \nof our energy from renewable sources. That is OK, but we can do better. \nWe should do better. We must do better. In fact, in 1991, during \nconsideration of the Policy Act, the Congress agreed to an amendment to \nboost our percentage of renewable power to 20 percent by the year 2000 \nand 30 percent by the year 2010. How will we ever get there if we keep \ncutting our commitment to the small businesses across the Nation that \nare moving forward with these technologies?\n  Chart No. 3, as you can see, indicates what we had in 1996. We had \npetroleum, 38.1 percent; nuclear, 7.6; renewables, 7.9; coal, 22.4; \nnatural gas, 24 percent.\n  This percentage--7.9--if we were on target, if we were doing what we \nagreed to do when the act was passed, would now be 10 percent. It is \nnot approaching the goal that we have agreed upon as a national \npriority.\n  Chart No. 4 shows that renewable energy is produced in every State in \nthe United States. I think all Senators ought to take that into \nconsideration. What you are doing is hurting the small businesses \nlocated in every State in the United States. Every Senator in the \nUnited States is a stakeholder in the debate we are having on the floor \ntoday.\n\n  Let us take a look now at the next chart that we have. I think \npictures make points better than words. I want to share with you \npictures of a variety of renewable energy projects across the country.\n  This is chart No. 5. It shows the Kotzebue Electric Association \nvillage power project. It is in Alaska. It is a wind project coming \nabout from the bill that was put into effect at the end of the 1970s.\n  This project will reduce emissions from diesel power and will reduce \nfuel transport costs to villagers. It is in existence. It is one that \nis easily replicated. It should be available, but we need to have more \nassistance, and we cannot cut back on that assistance which has been so \nproductive in getting us the improvements we have had.\n  Chart No. 6, this shows you the geographic distribution throughout \nour Nation. It shows that in the State of Oklahoma we have taxpayer \ndollars employing a geothermal heat pump in the State capitol building. \nThis is geothermal, which obviously is another available energy supply, \nbut we still need to have the research and the ability to replicate and \nduplicate and to find out better ways to be able to tap and utilize \ngeothermal.\n  Chart No. 7 gets to another--this one is where we have the most \navailability in this Nation and where we can proceed without in any way \nhampering the present energy sources. We have the ability in this \nNation with all its agricultural resources to produce biomass energy \nwhich would allow us to go forward to get to the targeted goals. But \nthat is cut back.\n  This is the Bioten Biomass Plant, Red Boiling Springs, TN. This \nproject produces energy from sawdust and will test other biomass fuels \nincluding wood residues and agricultural wastes.\n  The next one we have is chart No. 8, which is the Stirling Dish \nConcentration Engine at Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM--\na great State, New Mexico. This system, created through a public/\nprivate partnership, uses heat generated by the Sun's rays to produce \nutility grade electric power.\n  The next is a solar-powered school speed limit sign. This is an \ninteresting use of solar energy--reducing dependence on electric power \nand ensuring that it works anytime the Sun is up, whether there are \nclouds or not.\n  Chart No. 10 is entitled ``Waterfront Office Buildings.'' Mr. \nPresident, not only do these projects currently help, but they will not \nbe moving forward as fast as they could if we don't at least put some \nof the money back that is used to fund it. Waterfront office buildings, \nthese are located in Louisville, KY. These buildings are heated and \ncooled by geothermal heat pumps, saving the hotel $25,000 per month in \nutility costs.\n  Mr. President, these are the types of things we are looking at.\n  I see my good friend and cosponsor is here. If he would like to take \nsome time, I am happy to yield the floor to him.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the Senator. I appreciate his offer as I am in a \nconference on IRS and it is important that I get back there as promptly \nas possible.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to speak briefly on this most important \namendment.\n  Mr. President, as you know, Senator Jeffords and I are offering an \namendment today that will restore funding for renewable energy programs \nin the fiscal year 1999 energy and water appropriation's bill. The \nrenewable energy program has been cut by 33 percent below the \nadministration request and $27 million below fiscal year 1998 levels. \nThis amendment would add $70 million back to the renewable budget \nrestoring all programs to fiscal year 1998 levels and boosting some \nprograms 10-20 percent more. Even with these increases, America's \ninvestment in wind, solar, biomass, and other clean energy technologies \nwill be well below the funding levels of 3 years ago.\n  Mr. President, renewable energy technologies represent our best hopes \nfor reducing air pollution, creating jobs and decreasing our reliance \non imported oil and finite supplies of fossil fuels. Whatever one's \nposition on the\n\n[[Page S6514]]\n\nissue of climate change--these programs promise to supply economically \ncompetitive and commercially viable exports. I believe that the nation \nshould be looking toward alternative forms of energy, not taking a step \nbackward by cutting funding for these important programs.\n  My own state of Delaware has a long tradition in solar energy. In \n1972, the University of Delaware established one of the first \nphotovoltaic laboratories in the nation. The university has been \ninstrumental in developing photovoltaic cells, the same type of \ntechnology that powers solar watches and calculators.\n  Delaware has a major solar energy manufacturer, Astro Power, which is \nnow the fastest growing manufacturer of photovoltaic cells in the \nworld. In collaboration with the University of Delaware and Astro \nPower, Delaware's major utility--Delmarva Power & Light--has installed \nan innovative solar energy system that has successfully demonstrated \nthe use of solar power to satisfy peak electrical demand. Through this \ncollaboration, my State has demonstrated that solar energy technology \ncan be an economically competitive and commercially viable energy \nalternative for the utility industry.\n  It is vital that we continue to manufacture these solar cell products \nwith the high performance, high quality, and low costs required to \nsuccessfully compete worldwide.\n  Investment in Department of Energy solar and renewable energy \nprograms has put us on the threshold of explosive growth. Continuation \nof the present renewable energy programs is required to achieve the \ngoal of a healthy photovoltaic industry in the United States.\n  While the solar energy industries might have evolved in some form on \ntheir own Federal investment has accelerated the transition from the \nlaboratory bench to commercial markets in a way that has already \naccrued valuable economic benefits to the nation. Solar energy \ncompanies--like Astro Power--have already created thousands of jobs and \nhelped to reduce our trade deficit through exports of solar energy \nsystems overseas, mostly to developing nations, where 2 billion people \nare still without access to electricity.\n  International markets for solar energy systems are virtually \nexploding, due to several key market trends. Most notably, solar energy \nis already one of the lowest cost options available to developing \ncountries that cannot afford to build large, expensive centralized \npower generation facilities with elaborate distribution systems.\n  The governments of Japan, Germany, and Australia are investing \nheavily in aggressive technology and market development in partnership \nwith their own solar energy industries. Until recently, Japan and \nGermany held the lead in world market share for photovoltaics; the \nUnited States has only recently recaptured international market \ndominance.\n  Cutting funding for commercializing these technologies would have a \nchilling effect on the U.S. industry's ability to compete on an \ninternational scale in these billion-dollar markets of today and \ntomorrow. The employment potential of renewables represents a minimum \nof 15,000 new jobs this decade with nearly 120,000 the next decade.\n  Mr. President, I might also add biomass is another form of renewable \nenergy with great potential. While traditionally biomass includes the \nuse of wood chips and trash to create electricity, Maryland and \nDelaware are exploring the opportunities to use poultry manure as a \nbiomass fuel. Manure used in this manner would not be spread on fields, \na practice implicated by some as a cause of the recent outbreaks of \npfiesteria.\n  The electricity generated by the plant could then be sold to electric \ncompanies, the ash from the burning manure could be marketed as an \nenvironmentally sensitive fertilizer. In England the poultry litter \nfueled electric plants produce over 38.5 megawatts of power and burn \n440,000 tons of chicken manure a year.\n  The Jeffords/Roth amendment will restore the renewable energy \naccounts so that poultry manure fired plants and other renewable \nopportunities may become a real possibility in the future.\n  It is imperative that this Senate support renewable energy \ntechnologies and be a partner to an energy future that addresses our \neconomic needs in an environmentally acceptable manner. My State has \ndone and will continue to do its part. I hope my colleagues in the \nSenate will look to the future and do their part in securing a safe and \nreliable energy future by supporting this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware for \nhis very eloquent statement and for his dedication to trying to get \nthis Nation on the course it needs to be, to get off its dependency on \noil. It has been a pleasure working with him over the years, and I look \nforward to continuing to do so.\n  I also would like to add two other Senators as cosponsors of this \namendment: Senator Moynihan of New York, and also Senator Allard from \nColorado.\n  Mr. President, when I turned over the discussion to Senator Roth, we \nwere in the middle of going through charts which demonstrate right now \nthe tremendous effort that is going on, and what needs assistance to \nmake it even better, because we are sliding behind the results at this \npoint of where we ought to be from these charts.\n  The last one I showed, to start over again, is the Waterfront Office \nBuilding in Louisville, KY, where they are using geothermal--which, \nincidentally, can use heat to cool, which is sometimes a little \nconfusing. But the way it uses its geothermal, it saves this hotel \n$25,000 a month.\n  Now, let us take a look at some of these other charts so everyone \nhere has a better opportunity to understand the depth of interest and \nthe depth of participation in this Nation by private enterprises which \nare trying to reduce the Nation's dependence upon oil. That enthusiasm \nis out there, but it needs to be assisted. It needs to be demonstrated \nthat we can even do better than we are doing, and we are nowheres doing \nas much as we used to be.\n  The next chart, chart 11, indicates several States have greater wind \npotential than California, where the vast majority of wind development \nhas occurred to date. The top 20 States for wind energy potential \ninclude North Dakota, Texas, Kansas, South Dakota, Montana, Nebraska, \nWyoming, Oklahoma, Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado, New Mexico, Idaho, \nMichigan, New York, Illinois, California, Wisconsin, Maine and \nMissouri. That just gives you an idea. We should add Vermont to that. \nRecently, we have opened our own wind production in the southern part \nof the State. But this shows the States right now, the top 20 States, \nas measured by their energy projections for wind. Obviously, wind is \npretty free and there is a lot of it in this country. In fact, there is \na lot of it right here in this Chamber, but we do need to better \nutilize it for a more effective presentation of our efforts to be able \nto save energy.\n  Now, let's look at the next chart we have, chart 12. Consider the two \nquotes on this chart. The first quote reads:\n\n       In 1995, worldwide wind-power generation capacity was 4,900 \n     megawatts. . . .\n\n  That is 1 million watts. That was China alone.\n\n  The second quote reads:\n\n       In the past 10 years, PV sales worldwide have more than \n     quadrupled . . . In developing countries, demand has risen \n     significantly, fueled by the recognition that PV systems are \n     an attractive option to rural electrification in isolated, \n     inaccessible communities that are distant from the power--\n\n  Sources. Those are photovoltaics. PV is photovoltaics, taking the Sun \nand converting it, through utilization usually of silicon, to \nelectricity. It is a wonderful source. It is free. It comes from the \nSun, and it is increasing worldwide.\n  As it says here:\n\n       In the past years, PV sales worldwide have more than \n     quadrupled . . . In developing countries, demand has risen \n     significantly, fueled by the recognition that photovoltaic \n     systems are an attractive option for rural electrification in \n     isolated, inaccessible communities that are distant from the \n     power grid and have small electric requirements.\n\n  This is a tremendous source for exporting our technology and our \nsystems around the world. In fact, when I was in the House, I did get \nan amendment attached which made demonstration projects at our \nembassies throughout the world to demonstrate how usable the Sun is to \nproduce power and how effective it is.\n\n[[Page S6515]]\n\n  In the past 10 years alone, photovoltaic sales worldwide have more \nthan doubled. That is chart No. 12. American renewable businesses are \ntaking advantage of these markets.\n  Consider this chart, chart No. 13. This chart shows a wind turbine \nproduced by a small wind turbine manufacturer in my State. This turbine \nwas built in Vermont and exported to Ontario, Canada. There is a large \nmarket for export of U.S. wind turbines to northern communities in \nAlaska, Canada and Russia. This is a picture of one. We have several of \nthese in Vermont now. They are throughout the world, and they are not \nat all offensive. They are quiet. They make a lot of energy. This is a \nlarge market for companies in this country.\n  Although America is still a leader in developing renewable energy \ntechnologies, this lead may slip if we lower our renewable research and \ndevelopment funding. Europe and Japan continue to subsidize their \nrenewable industry, putting U.S.-based companies at severe \ndisadvantage.\n  For example, Japan, Germany and Denmark use tied aid, offer financing \nand provide export promotion for their domestic industries, and our \nindustries have to compete with that. It is very difficult to do, but \nbecause of the success and the fact that we have advantages, they have \nbeen able to survive with great difficulty without having that \nassistance or loans. This is not the time to lose our lead or to cut \nfunding out to this important industry.\n  Mr. President, there is one final reason why my colleagues should \noverwhelmingly support this amendment. This amendment is a vote for the \nenvironment. Renewable energy is largely free of the pollutants \nregulated by the Clean Air Act.\n  Chart No. 14 demonstrates this. Consider this geothermal power plant \nin Dixie Valley, NV. This plant, which produces electricity for 100,000 \npeople produces no NOX emissions and 5 percent as much \nSOX and CO2 as a coal-fired power plant of the \nsame size. Five percent, that is 95 percent reduction in the production \nof those pollutants. We need more of these plants, like the one in \nDixie Valley, NV.\n  Renewable energy can have other environmental benefits as well. \nConsider the following projects, all of which turn waste products into \nenergy.\n\n  Chart No. 15: Westinghouse Power Connection. This one is a biomass \ngasification test facility in Paia, Island of Maui, HI. A pilot project \ndemonstrates potential to convert agricultural waste--sugar cane--into \nelectricity. Again, back to biomass which has incredible use available \nto us.\n  The next chart shows Wheelabrator Shasta Energy Co., a biomass \nproject in Shasta County, CA. This project converts wood wastes that \nwould otherwise end up in landfills into 49 megawatts of electric \npower.\n  The next chart--if I am right, we should have 50, one for every \nState. We will see how we turn out here. This is the BC International \nCorporation biomass ethanol plant in Jennings, LA. This plant will be \nretrofitted to produce ethanol from sugar cane, bagasse and rice waste.\n  The next chart will also demonstrate the number of plants we have \nspread throughout the country. This is in Connecticut; a fuel cell \npower plant, Groton, CT. The fuel cell plant uses hydrogen from \nlandfill gas that otherwise would be wasted to create electricity. It \nis another indication of the tremendous breadth of expertise we have in \nthis Nation to produce. All we have to do is make sure we don't cut \nback in their planning and ability to create many of the experimental \nplants.\n  Let me now conclude by, again, reminding everyone, we are proposing \nto add $70 million in our amendment to the Department of Energy's \nsolar, wind and renewable budget. Federal support for renewable energy \nresearch and development has been a major success story in the United \nStates. Costs have declined, reliability has improved, and a growing \ndomestic industry has been born. More work still needs to be done in \nbasic research at our national labs and applied development to bring \ndown the costs of production even further. This is a tremendous \nopportunity for this Nation to develop industries which will help us \nreduce our trade deficits.\n  This is not a vote which pits Senators from one region of the country \nagainst Senators from another region. I think I have shown that all \nregions of the country benefit from renewable energy. This is not a \nvote which pits probusiness Senators against proenvironmental Senators. \nI think I have shown that renewable energy is a clean, environmentally \nbeneficial industry. This is not a vote which pits Democrats against \nRepublicans.\n  Chart No. 19: Consider this quote from former President Bush in \nSeptember 1991. President Bush stated:\n\n       We must encourage environmentally responsible development \n     of all U.S. energy resources, including renewable energy. \n     Renewable energy does reduce demand upon our other finite \n     natural resources. It enhances our energy security, and \n     clearly, it protects the environment.\n  So just before I offer the amendment, I would like to thank my \ncolleagues who are cosponsoring it with me and urge--urge--my \ncolleagues to sincerely consider the tremendous advantages which this \namendment will have and to remind you, at present, we are cutting \nback--while going forward on other less necessary projects--we are \ncutting back on that which is most critical to the future of this \nNation in its ability to gain the semblance of energy independence. We \nare slipping behind the chart and the goals that we have established. \nWe cannot cut back in the funding that will help us get there.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a table which \nsets forth the provisions in the amendment.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n

OFFSETTING REDUCTIONS.\n\n       Each amount made available under the headings ``non-defense \n     environmental management'', ``uranium enrichment \n     decontamination and decommissioning fund'', ``science'', and \n     ``departmental administration'' under the heading ``Energy \n     Programs'' and ``construction, rehabilitation, operation and \n     maintenance, western area power administration (including \n     transfer of funds)'' under the heading ``Power Marketing \n     Administrations'' is reduced by 1.586516988447 percent.\n       Prior year balances may not be reduced if they are \n     obligated under an existing written agreement or contract to \n     laboratories, universities or industry.\n       Appropriate use of funds to support meetings and technical \n     conferences are allowed consistent with DOE's mission.\n       Funding increases for this amendment are for cost-shared \n     RD, deployment, and technology transfer via technical and \n     trade associations and allied non-governmental organizations.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Jeffords/Roth \nAmendment to the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, which \nwill substantially increase funding for renewable energy programs.\n  The Jeffords/Roth amendment is critical to an industry that will be \nat the forefront of energy production in the next century. Renewable \nenergy will bring major economic benefits and major environmental \nbenefits to the nation. This amendment provides us with the opportunity \nto become leaders in this booming global market.\n  At the same time, increased renewable energy technology will decrease \nour dependence on foreign oil and reduce the trade deficit. We will \nhave greater protection from harmful oil price shocks. Funding for \nrenewable energy now will clearly strengthen our competitiveness in the \nworldwide energy market for the 21st century.\n  Equally important, the Jeffords/Roth amendment reaffirms the nation's \ncommitment to the environment. Renewable energy enables us to reduce \nthe emissions from other energy sources that are polluting our air and \nwater. It helps to curb the largest current source of pollution in the \nUnited States--energy production and energy use. Bringing innovative \nresearch from the laboratory to the market will also ensure the \nprotection of our limited natural resources for a sustainable future.\n  Currently, millions of Americans already obtain electricity from \nrenewable energy sources. These advances are just a hint of the \npossibilities of cleaner, safer energy production in the years ahead. \nThis amendment allows the U.S. to maintain its leading role in global \nclean energy technology. I support this amendment, and I commend \nSenators Jeffords and Roth for their leadership in protecting our \nenvironment and our economy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have the pleasure of joining Senator \nJeffords to rise in support of the renewable energy programs within the \nEnergy and Water Appropriations bill. First, I would like to thank \nSenator Domenici for accepting the Jeffords/Roth amendment to increase \nfunding for these vital programs. With the dramatic changes taking \nplace in the energy sector, our nation is faced with many opportunities \nto increase our consumption of renewable energy sources. There are two \ntrends in the energy sector converging to make this change possible--\nutility restructuring and decreasing costs for renewable energy.\n  In my home State of Vermont, renewable technology companies are \nbuilding wind turbines that are used in Europe, the Far East and South \nAmerica. Unfortunately, the United States is behind much of the world \nin adopting wind and other renewable energy technology. Much more work \nneeds to be done to spur the utilization of renewable energy. Although \nthe cost of renewable energy has decreased significantly over the last \ndecade, it still must compete against the artificially low cost of \nfossil energy. As we see the level of mercury and other heavy metals \nincrease in our lakes while the views of our mountains are obscured by \nair pollutants--the need to find alternative sources of energy becomes \nall the more vivid.\n  Recent articles have highlighted the public's interest in maintaining \nrenewable power as an option for meeting their energy needs. The last \ntwo decades have witnessed a decline in the cost of renewable energy. \nResearch by the Energy Department and the commitment of private energy \ncompanies has produced this decline. As a nation, we must build upon \nthis partnership and encourage the private sector to continue to \ndevelop cost-reducing technology. Unfortunately, the recent trend in \nfederal research funding has not supported this partnership.\n  Wind Energy Research and development program has been extraordinarily \nsuccessful in bringing down the cost of wind-generated electricity. To \nallow expansion of this large resource base, and to allow wind energy \nto be competitive in an era of utility restructuring that emphasizes \nlow initial cost and independent power projects, significant \nimprovements to the technology are still needed to reach the Program's \ngoal of 2.5 cents per kilowatt by 2000. In addition, research and \nanalysis relating to restructuring in the electric utility industry \nshould be conducted on issues associated with integration of wind and \nother renewable energy systems into an increasingly competitive \nindustry framework.\n  Vermont is also leading the country in the deployment of biomass \ntechnology--both large and small. We are proud that the Department of \nEnergy selected the McNeil Plant in Burlington to conduct a full scale \ndemonstration of biomass gasification. In February, the project made \nhistory when the plant produced gas for fuel from wood chips. The \neffort at McNeil to demonstrate how our country can produce energy from \nrenewable crops makes sense to Vermonters who have already embraced \nbiomass as a renewable source of energy. Twenty State office buildings \nand eighteen schools use biomass for heat during the winter.\n  By increasing funding for renewable energy by $65 million, the \nJeffords/Roth amendment will help us make this leap. Mr. President, \nthis amendment makes sense for our future and our children's future. \nOur children should be able to enjoy sustainable, clean and renewable \nenergy.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I compliment and applaud the Senator from Vermont and those \nwho have joined in this amendment. As we have said earlier, the \nadministration recommended a higher level for this particular program--\nsolar and renewable. The movers of this amendment have also recommended \nthat this\n\n[[Page S6517]]\n\nbody move higher with solar and renewable. I think that their efforts \nare certainly to be congratulated.\n  It is a very difficult bill, as we have explained on other occasions. \nThere is a limited amount of money to do a number of different things. \nThe Senator from Vermont has done a very good job of explaining the \nimportance of renewable energy in this country. Of course, he mentioned \na number of programs in Nevada that are important. We have geothermal. \nWe have solar that we are working on. So we certainly look forward to \nworking with him on this amendment.\n  I am waiting for the manager to come back. I think there is a good \nchance we may accept this amendment. I know it is acceptable on this \nside.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, after discussions with the chairman of \nthe subcommittee and the ranking member, I understand that we are in a \nposition where the amendment can be accepted with striking a certain \nprovision. I am doing that and am going to accept that proposition with \nthe understanding that there will be a strong effort to fight to \nmaintain the amendment as best they can in the committee of conference, \nbecause the history has been that on these amendments, which have been \naccepted in the past, they kind of disappear in conference. But I have \nthe good-faith-effort commitment of the Senator from New Mexico, and I \naccept that, as I know him and I know his character; and the same with \nthe Senator from Nevada.\n  So, Mr. President, I now move to amend my amendment by striking all \nafter line 8 on page 3 of the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would you not do that for a moment?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I withdraw my request.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't want any misunderstanding. I don't want the \nSenator withdrawing that based upon a unilateral statement that he has \nmade.\n  I think I must make my statement in the Record.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then the Senator can do whatever he wants--leave it in \nand we have a fight or take it out and we accept it.\n  Mr. President, I am not committing that I will return in the \nconference with this fully funded. I don't know that I can do that. \nWhat I am suggesting is I will do my dead-level best. I don't go there \nwith the intention of throwing the amendment away. I go there intending \nto try to see if we can fund it. I have every confidence that we will \nfind some money to exceed what is in the bill. Now, whether it can be \nexactly this amount or not, I have no idea at this point. That will be \nthe dynamics, and a lot of things in the amendment that are very \ndifficult that I am not agreeing to right now.\n  I am agreeing to accept the amendment and we will take it to \nconference on those terms. The Senator can rely on what I have just \nsaid.\n  With that, if he will remove the handwritten part that was added, \nthat is fine. If he does not want to, then clearly I don't have any \nreluctance to having a full-blown debate on this amendment today. I \nhave plenty of time. I don't want to do that if we can get it done the \nway we have just talked about, otherwise we will just proceed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have already said that I appreciate the \noffer of the amendment by the Senator from Vermont and the statement by \nthe Senator from Delaware.\n  I have indicated that Senator Domenici and I have had and will work \nto increase the number that we have in this bill. We have all been to \nconferences and we will do the very best we can. I believe in these \nprograms. I think it would be to everyone's interest that we go ahead \non that basis. I don't think it would serve anyone's interest, after we \nhave agreed to accept this amendment, to now have a full debate on it. \nIf, in fact, my friend from Vermont wants one, we can do that. There \nare things in the program we can all talk about that I think would be \nbetter left for a later time.\n  But I will do my share with the chairman of the subcommittee, with \nthose of us on this side of the aisle in the conference, to do \neverything we can to raise the number as high as we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to modify his amendment?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I want to, first of all, make a comment or two. I thank \nboth the leaders on this bill. I respect their comments. I also know \nthat you cannot promise anything when you get into conference, but I \nwill also be watching very carefully because in the past we have not \nhad any success in holding these amendments.\n  I understand, though, that the administration is strongly in favor of \nmore funding. I understand there may be additional funding in the \nhealth provision, so I expect that we will be able to get a significant \nincrease at this time.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2715, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has the modification taken place?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The modification has not taken place yet.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I send a modification of my amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, (No. 2715) as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 21, lines 2 and 3, strike ``$699,836,000, to remain \n     available until October 1, 2000, of which'' and insert \n     ``$758,854,000, to remain available until October 1, 2000, of \n     which not less than $3,860,000 shall be available for solar \n     building technology research, not less than $72,966,000 shall \n     be available for photovoltaic energy systems, not less than \n     $21,617,500 shall be available for solar thermal energy \n     systems (of which not less than $3,000,000 shall be available \n     for the dish/engine field verification initiative), not less \n     than $35,750,000 shall be available for power systems in \n     biomass/biofuels energy systems, not less than $41,083,500 \n     shall be available for transportation in biomass/biofuels \n     energy systems (of which not less than $3,000,000 shall be \n     available to fund the Consortium for Plant Biotechnology \n     Research), not less than $38,265,000 shall be available for \n     wind energy systems, not less than $4,000,000 shall be \n     available for the renewable energy production incentive \n     program, not less than $7,000,000 shall be available for \n     solar program support, not less than $5,087,500 shall be \n     available for the international solar energy program, not \n     less than $680,000 shall be available for solar technology \n     transfer, not less than $5,000,000 shall be available for the \n     National Renewable Energy Laboratory, not less than \n     $31,250,000 shall be available for geothermal technology \n     development, not less than $5,000,000 shall be available for \n     the Federal building/Remote power initiative, not less than \n     $16,325,500 shall be available for program direction,''.\n       On page 36, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__ OFFSETTING REDUCTIONS.\n\n       Each amount made available under the headings ``non-defense \n     environmental management'', ``uranium enrichment \n     decontamination and decommissioning fund'', ``science'', and \n     ``departmental administration'' under the heading ``Energy \n     Programs'' and ``construction, rehabilitation, operation and \n     maintenance, western area power administration (including \n     transfer of funds)'' under the heading ``Power Marketing \n     Administrations'' is reduced by 1.586516988447 percent.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have no further debate on the \namendment. We are going to accept it.\n  I will make a little comment about what happened to the budget from \nthe President of the United States as it pertains to this bill. First \nof all, the President of the United States, in the budget he submitted \nto the U.S. Congress, is responsible for the fact that we don't have \nenough money to do the renewables that the distinguished Senator from \nVermont comes to the floor and adds money for. The President of the \nUnited States took the water projects of this country--and these are \nnot pet projects, these are the ports that have to be dredged in our \ncountry, dams that have to be built for flood protection, just a whole \nlitany of them everywhere--he cut them $1.3 billion.\n  Frankly, all I can see in that kind of a cut is that he expected us \nto put the money back because we could not have kept the Corps of \nEngineers together with their projects out across our land. We could \nnot have kept a viable program. Mr. President, $1.3 billion is a \ndramatic cut from what was needed for funding at the acceptable rate \nthat the\n\n[[Page S6518]]\n\nprojects were in last year--not new ones. That money makes up the same \npot of money from whence comes all of the DOE's nondefense research \nprojects and all the water projects.\n  So we start off with that one pot of money, short $1.3 billion, and \nthe President picked and chose what he would like to increase. As a \nmatter of fact, he increased certain water projects that he has been \nfor and forgot about the water projects that the rest of the Congress \nhas been for, including very important projects.\n  Now, in order to get around that, we had to find money from places \nthat he had dramatically increased. Even at that, we only funded those \nprojects at between 60 and 70 percent, meaning it will cost us more \nmoney in the long run, the projects will be delayed, and some of them \nare very big, important projects for commerce such as ports that are to \nbe dredged, with facilities to be built.\n  It wasn't, when we put this bill together, that with some kind of \ngusto we set about to dramatically reduce the programs that are the \nsubject matter before the Senate right now. It was that we had an \nobligation to fund that fund at 60 or 70 percent. That is all we could \ndo for the myriad of water projects across this land which have a \ntremendous economic impact and which save much property and save much \nlife when they are completed.\n  Now, that puts in the position we are when we come to the floor here. \nEverybody understands that we are not going to have it much easier in \nconference, although thanks to the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee a little more money was allocated to this committee than the \nPresident's budget because of the water project dilemma that I have \njust described.\n  Now, that is the essence of why this bill has difficulty. It is not \neven funded in many areas as high as it was last year. Certainly, the \nwater projects don't have sufficient resources to stay on the course \nthat was there. That was the best course, the optimum course, in terms \nof efficiency and getting the projects done so that we would save lives \nand save property at the earliest time.\n  Having said that, with no objection from the ranking member on the \nother side, we will accept this amendment and do our very best in \nconference to see that solar energy and the items mentioned in the \namendment, that the funding is increased from what we had in our bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2715), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Jeffords for his cooperation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the chairman of the committee as well as the \nranking member for their assistance in this. I am hopeful we are making \nan important step forward here in our energy self-reliance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in stark contrast to the last 3\\1/2\\ \nweeks, this bill is moving along very rapidly. I announce to the Senate \nthat we can, indeed, finish this bill by midafternoon. The amendments \nthat we are aware of that have come either through the minority, \nthrough my good friend, Senator Reid, or through our side, are being \nworked on and we don't think there is a rollcall vote necessary on any \nof those. There is one amendment that the distinguished Senator from \nIndiana, the junior Senator from Indiana, intends to offer. It is not \nrelated exactly, to this bill, but he indicates that he will be here \nabout 2 o'clock.\n  In the meantime, we are going to try to work on the amendments we \nhave and see if we can put a package together and accept them. That \nwill be all we will have until 2 o'clock, unless some Senator has some \namendment of which we are unaware.\n  I really want to make sure that everybody knows I have checked with \nthe leader. He knows of no other business on this bill, and he wants to \nfinish this afternoon. By 2 o'clock I hope we can have the Indiana \nSenator call up his amendment. Again, I indicate that is the last \namendment we know about.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we would like to go to third reading early \nthis afternoon. I say, also, to elaborate on what my friend from New \nMexico says, there has been a lot of partisan rancor on this floor the \nlast several weeks. But as I said when we introduced this bill \nyesterday, there are times on this Senate floor--a lot more often than \npeople are led to believe--when things move along very well, in a \nbipartisan fashion. There is no better example of that than every year \nwhen we get to the appropriations bills. Sometimes we have partisan \nproblems, but not often. I think the two leaders of this Appropriations \nCommittee, the senior Senator from Alaska and the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia, have set a very good tone as to how we should move on \nthese bills. They work very well together, and they have for many \nyears. The Senator from New Mexico and I have worked together for a \nnumber of years on this bill.\n\n  This is a good bill, a very important bill for this country, not only \nfor domestic purposes, water projects, but also for the security of \nthis Nation. Much of what is in this $21 billion appropriations bill \ndeals with security of this Nation, our nuclear arsenal--the safety and \nreliability of our nuclear arsenal.\n  So I say to my friends in the Senate that not everything we do is \npartisan in nature. There are certain things that rise above that. This \nbill is one of those times when partisanship should have no bearing, as \nit hasn't in the last several years.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have already stated for the Record and \nfor the Senators what the situation is on this bill.\n  The managers' staffs are working on a managers' wrap-up amendment, \nwhich we think we can have done by 2 o'clock. Senator Coats will be \nhere to offer an amendment. There will be nothing we can do until 2 \no'clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6507-6", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, today an announcement was made by the \nPresident that we are going to have a new Secretary of Energy, Bill \nRichardson, a former Congressman from the State of New Mexico, now our \nambassador to the United Nations.\n  In 1982, I came to the Congress with Bill Richardson. We were both in \nthe class of 1982. He had a long and distinguished career in the House \nwhere he served honorably on a number of committees, including \nCommerce. Of course, during the time he was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, he did some very unusual but very important diplomatic \nmaneuvers--freeing various people held as political prisoners, and \nother efforts, which were extremely important, not only to this country \nbut for world peace. The President had recognized that and he selected \nBill Richardson to be our ambassador to the United Nations, where he \nhas served honorably.\n  The need for former Congressman Richardson, now Ambassador \nRichardson, to return to Washington has been noticed by the President. \nAs a result of Secretary Pena retiring, we now have a tremendous need \nfor someone who understands Washington, and certainly Bill Richardson \ndoes that; someone who understands Government, and certainly Bill \nRichardson does understand Government; someone who has an understanding \nof the importance of the Energy Department, and Bill Richardson has \nthat understanding based upon\n\n[[Page S6519]]\n\nhis being from New Mexico where so much dealing with things nuclear \nhave taken place for the last 60 years.\n  So, Mr. President, I am elated and enthused about the new Secretary \nRichardson. He has big shoes to fill, as Secretary Pena has done an \noutstanding job. Secretary Pena has approached his job in a bipartisan \nfashion. Even though he is part of this administration, he has reached \nout to Chairman Domenici and the ranking member of this subcommittee in \ntrying to be fair and reasonable in his approach to issues that are so \nimportant to this country and to the world.\n  I applaud and commend the administration for selecting Bill \nRichardson to be the next Secretary of Energy.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6518-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6519]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONGRATULATING THE DETROIT RED WINGS ON WINNING THE 1998 STANLEY CUP\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak on S. Res. 251, which has \nbeen introduced by myself and Senator Abraham, which I am confident \nwill be passed later on today. This resolution congratulates the \nDetroit Red Wings for their second successive Stanley Cup victory. \nTuesday night, the Red Wings defeated the Washington Capitals 4 to 1. \nThis is the second time in 2 years that the Red Wings have swept the \nStanley Cup finals--four straight.\n  In perhaps the most moving and memorable moment of the evening, after \nthe victory, the Stanley Cup was placed in the lap of Vladimir \nKonstantinov, who was injured after last year's Stanley Cup victory in \nan automobile accident. I have come to know Vlady and his wife Irina \nduring this past year, when they have recovered, at least partly, from \nthat terrible tragedy of a year ago. What is extraordinarily moving is \nthe way the Red Wings--indeed, all the Red Wings' fans--have become a \ncloser family as a result of that accident, the way they have \nsurrounded Vlady with love and support. The whole town--indeed, our \nwhole State and to some extent the entire country--has come to the \nsupport of Vladimir Konstantinov. When he was pushed in his wheelchair \naround the ice at the MCI Center on Tuesday night, with the Stanley Cup \nin his lap, surely we reached a new height in terms of what family \nmeans and what family is all about.\n  The Red Wings have surely the greatest hockey fans on Earth. Detroit \nlives and breathes hockey, and there are a legion of fans all over our \nState and throughout the country who came to the MCI Center on Tuesday \nnight. There was a sea of red shirts in the stands. I was one of those \nwho had the pleasure of being there to see this very, very special \nvictory. I also, though, want to not just pay my respects and \nappreciation to the players who brought home the cup again, and the \nKonstantinovs and those who supported that team, but also to the Caps \nfans who treated the Red Wings fans in the audience with such decency \nand civility.\n\n  I have been to a lot of Red Wings games away from home where that was \nnot true, where the opponents' fans, indeed, were quite hostile to \ntheir opponents. But on Tuesday night, as was true on Saturday night, \nthe Caps fans treated us very, very civilly indeed. And when it came \nthat moment, that very magic moment in the third period when the fans \nwere serenading Vlady, who was sitting up with Irina in the stands, the \nCaps fans joined with the Red Wings fans in the arena singing, ``Vlady, \nVlady, Vlady.'' That was also a moment I will always remember and \ncherish. Our captain, Steve Yzerman, won the Conn Smythe Trophy, \ndeservedly so. He has been an extraordinary role model for so many \nyoung players, as Detroit Red Wings before him were role models for \nhim.\n  Speaking just for one more moment on that subject, when I was young \nand my brother Sander was young, we used to go down to Olympia \nfrequently with my mother, going up to the cheapest seats available, \nthree flights up in the balcony, where we rooted for an earlier \ngeneration of great Red Wings, the so-called Production Line of Sid \nAbel, Gordie Howe and Ted Lindsay, and our great goalie Terry Sawchuck \nin those years, in the fifties, who brought home the Stanley Cup on \nmany occasions to Detroit.\n  That has happened again this week. The Red Wings fans, perhaps a \nmillion of them, have just finished celebrating in a parade down \nWoodward Avenue from the Fox Theater to the Hart Plaza. The Hart Plaza, \nby the way, is named after a former U.S. Senator, one who touched the \nhearts and the souls of this body, Phil Hart. The place where that \nparade started was the Fox Theater, and it was very appropriate that \nthat be the place because that theater has been restored by the \nIlitchs, Mike and Marian Ilitch, who are the owners of the Detroit Red \nWings. I only wish I could be there to greet my friends the Ilitchs in \nperson today, to thank them again for what they have done for our city. \nBut how sweet that victory was, how moving that victory was, how \nimportant these events are in terms of gluing our communities together, \nbringing us together as family.\n  With the shouts of, ``Go, Wings, go!'' still ringing in my ears, they \nnow can savor the victory of a Stanley Cup. Just as their names are \nengraved on that cup, so their names will be engraved in this \nresolution when it passes, after Senator Abraham has an opportunity to \nget to the floor.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6519-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6519-S6521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand that we are in morning \nbusiness. However, the pending business, beginning at 2 o'clock, is the \nEnergy and Water appropriations bill. I will make a couple of comments \nabout the legislation brought to the floor by Senator Domenici and the \nranking member, Senator Reid.\n  I am a member of the Subcommittee on Energy and Water, and I support \nthis piece of legislation. I think Senator Domenici and Senator Reid \nhave done a wonderful job. I understand that a lot of the details of \nthis legislation will not be discussed at great length today, but I \nwant to mention a couple of things in this bill just for purposes of \nalerting people that there are some significant problems that are being \naddressed, especially in the State of North Dakota, in this \nlegislation.\n  One piece of this legislation deals with funding for something called \nthe Garrison Diversion Project. Now, that is a foreign language to most \npeople, and no one really would be expected to know much about the \nGarrison Diversion Project in North Dakota. But I want to give some \nhistory, just for a few brief minutes, about this project and why it is \nimportant.\n  Many years ago, the Missouri River--which was an aggressive, large \nriver coming out of the mountains in Montana--was untamed, and during \nthe spring flooding it would race down over its banks, and in the lower \nregions of the Missouri River down in Kansas City and elsewhere you \nwould have massive flooding, flooding, in fact, all the along the way, \nincluding cities in North Dakota. It became a huge problem. Federal \nofficials said let us try to harness the Missouri River with a series \nof dams. They proposed a series of ``stem'' dams on the Missouri River \nand one would have been in North Dakota.\n  In the 1940s, the Federal officials said the folks downstream want \nthe river harnessed so it won't flood, so they don't have all the \nproblems downstream. What we would like to do is build a dam in your \nState. We would like to have a flood come to your State--behind the \ndam--that comes and stays forever. The flood in your State of North \nDakota will be a 500,000-acre flood about the size of the State of\n\n[[Page S6520]]\n\nRhode Island. So they said to North Dakotans--in the 1940s--if you will \nallow us to put a permanent flood in your State by building a dam and \ndamming up the water behind it, put a permanent flood that comes and \nstays forever in your State, we will give you the ability to move that \nwater behind that dam in that reservoir around the State for a whole \nrange of important purposes, including municipal, rural and industrial \nwater needs.\n  People of North Dakota thought, that is not a bad deal. We will \naccept the flood that comes and stays forever, but then we will get \nthis promise from the Federal Government of being able to take water \nfrom behind that dam and moving it around the State to improve water \nsupplies to farmsteads, cities and so on in North Dakota, to provide \nwater for industrial development and a whole range of things that will \ncreate more economic growth in the State.\n  So they built the dam. President Eisenhower came out and dedicated \nthe dam. Then they created the flood. So the dam is there, the flood \ncame, the flood stayed, and we have a Rhode Island-size flood in our \nState forever.\n  So we got the cost, we are now hosts to a permanent flood, but we \nhave not yet gotten all of the benefits. And that is what the Garrison \nDiversion Project and the funding in this bill is about.\n  With the consent of the Presiding Officer, I will show my colleagues, \nor at least provide a demonstration today for those watching, the \nquality of water that we are talking about in some of our communities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I brought to the floor a little container \nof water. Now I know this looks very much like coffee. It is not \ncoffee. It is well water from a well at Keith and Ann Anderson's place \nin North Dakota. The water that comes from that well, looking like the \ncolor of coffee, is water that will be replaced by water behind the \nGarrison Dam from the Missouri River.\n  That new water, the fresh water, coming out of the mountains from \nMontana in that large reservoir now in North Dakota can be moved around \nour State and can replace this water and we will have safe, wholesome \nand healthy drinking water in communities and on farmsteads in our \nState.\n  That is one part of this project. This chart shows what I have just \nshowed a moment ago, the color of some of this water, the quality of \nthe water that is being used, forced to be used in some communities, in \nsome farmsteads in North Dakota and why we must find a supplemental \nsupply for it. That is what this project is about. Water delivered to \nrural North Dakota by pipeline behind the reservoir looks like this \nclear water, and it replaces this brown water.\n  Is that good for people's health? Of course it is. Is it good for our \nState? Is it a good investment in our future? Of course it is. Is it, \nmore importantly, keeping a promise to a State that got the cost of a \nflood that comes and stays, keeping the promise to be able to use that \nwater for economic development for our future? Yes, that is an \nimportant promise for this government to keep. For that, I appreciate \nthe work of the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Nevada \ntoday on this piece of legislation.\n  I will make a point about one additional provision in this \nlegislation dealing with some construction money for what is called an \nemergency outlet at Devils Lake, ND. I show a photograph that was taken \nin 1965. This is a woman standing next to the bottom of a telephone \npole. She is looking up to the top of the pole. The pole actually ended \nabout here. This lake, is now way up to here, far, far above her head. \nThis is Devils Lake, which is part of a basin the size of the State of \nMassachusetts. It is one of two closed basins in the United States. One \nis the Great Salt Lake and one is Devils Lake.\n\n  In this basin the water runs down, just like any funnel, except there \nis no place for it to go. This lake has gone up and up and up. You can \nsee, relative to this picture in 1965, where the water is today. This \ngraph shows it even better. It shows what has happened over 150 years \nwith respect to the water level. It is at 1,445.5 feet now. The \ncumulative damages from all of this are substantial: hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, threatening people's homes, inundating farmland, \nthreatening cities. This has been a huge problem, and there is no \nobvious solution for it--at least there is no one obvious solution.\n  We are working on a range of things to try to resolve and respond to \nthis issue: No. 1, upland storage, up in the upper part of the basin, \nto store water so it doesn't flow down to the lake, building dikes to \nprotect cities; No. 3, raising roads, which is expensive, we have had \nto raise roads and then raise them again; No. 4, an emergency outlet to \ntry to take some pressure off of that lake--an emergency outlet that \nwould go over to the Sheyenne River. That is what is in this piece of \nlegislation--another component of financing for an emergency outlet \nfrom Devils Lake.\n  I know for those who have never seen or heard of Devils Lake that \nthis doesn't mean very much. But this means almost everything to the \npeople in the region and who are now threatened every day by this lake \nthat continues to rise. The lake has doubled in size and tripled in \nvolume in just a few short years. It now threatens a very substantial \ncity in our State, cripples an economy, inundates roads, and it is a \nvery, very serious problem.\n  The piece of legislation before us provides another increment of \nconstruction funding for an emergency outlet. The outlet would not be \nhuge; it would not be an outlet sufficient to let a lot of water off of \nthe lake. But the outlet would remove a foot to a foot and a half a \nyear of water from the lake depth. Marginally, over a period of years, \nit would help to take some pressure off of that lake.\n  So that is the story of these two projects. Once again, I wanted to \nsimply indicate that both of them are very important. We have had the \ncooperation of the chairman of the subcommittee, the ranking member, \nand others, on the appropriations subcommittee, to get some funding for \nboth of these projects. Both projects will be good investments in our \ncountry and in our country's future.\n  I commend the Chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee, Mr. \nDomenici, and the ranking member, Mr. Reid, for the consideration given \nto the people of North Dakota in the Fiscal Year 1999 Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill. The people of North Dakota are most thankful for \nthe Appropriations Committee's support of the state's priority water \nprojects, particularly the Devils Lake emergency outlet and the \nGarrison Diversion project.\n  I am privileged to serve on the Subcommittee and I note that Senator \nDomenici, in his statement before the Full Committee, remarked that he \nwas able to provide only between 60-70 percent of the optimal funding \nlevel for water project construction in this bill. He faced enormous \ndifficulties in this bill brought on by a budget request which was $1.8 \nbillion below the level required to continue ongoing construction \nprojects at their optimal level.\n  In the face of these difficulties, the Subcommittee supported funding \nfor an emergency outlet from Devils Lake--a body of water that normally \nhas no natural outlet. It's a body of water that is rising inexorably \nand with a vengeance, displacing people, rendering formerly productive \nfields and roads useless. The devastating flooding in the Devils Lake \nregion is very similar to recent flooding at Salt Lake, Utah--the other \nmajor closed basin in the United States.\n  A headline this week from a local newspaper reads: ``Economic costs \nof Devils Lake flood are staggering.'' More than 170 homes have had to \nbe moved. Damage to roads, bridges, and other property is estimated at \naround $250 million. And 70,000 acres of prime land have disappeared. \nThe long-term effects of this flood emergency on personal incomes, on \nregional agriculture and local businesses, and on the local tax base \nare as yet undetermined. But the short-term impacts are unmistakable as \nbankruptcies multiply, farm auctions become routine, and local \ngovernments scratch to pay for mounting costs with dwindling revenues.\n  The Senate Subcommittee and Full Committee honored the President's \nrequest for funding to address this emergency. Some predictions are \nthat the lake could keep on rising and eventually spill into the \nSheyenne River, resulting in a flood of unknown magnitude, but sure to \nresult in the loss of\n\n[[Page S6521]]\n\nkey roads, vital infrastructure and thousands of acres of farmland. \nSuch an uncontrolled outflow from the east end of the lake, with \nextremely high levels of dissolved solids, would create environmental \nhavoc for the water supplies of downstream communities.\n  For these reasons and others, the Committee wisely provided \nadditional funding for an emergency outlet from the west end of the \nlake, where water quality is compatible with the Sheyenne River. \nControlled releases would also be managed so as to avoid any downstream \nflooding.\n  I would further point out to my colleagues that the project must meet \ntough fiscal and engineering tests, besides complying strictly with the \nNational Environmental Policy Act and the Boundary Waters Treaty of \n1909. The latter requirement involves full consultation with the \nInternational Joint Commission in order to address potential concerns \nof the Government of Canada.\n  Finally, let me emphasize that the appropriation for an outlet bars \nthe use of these funds to build an inlet to Devils Lake. Despite the \nlingering fears of some interests, neither the FY 1999 appropriations \nnor the prior appropriations would allow for an inlet. Moreover, \npending legislation to revise North Dakota's main water development \nproject, the Garrison Diversion Unit, includes no provision for either \nan inlet to or an outlet from Devils Lake. This reflects a joint \ndetermination by the bi-partisan elected leadership of North Dakota on \nhow to proceed with these projects.\n  This FY99 funding bill also addresses another emergency situation \nnear Williston, North Dakota. There again rising waters are threatening \nto render useless thousands of acres of farmland in the Buford-Trenton \nproject and to displace farmers. The funding provided by the Senate \nwill allow for the purchase of easements which are authorized under the \nWater Resources Development Act of 1996. This is another extremely \nimportant project which the Senate has supported at a reasonable level.\n  The Subcommittee has added $6 million to the budget request the \nGarrison Diversion project, in order to meet the federal responsibility \nfor critical water development needs in our state. Let me state that \nthe key to economic development in North Dakota is water development \nand that the key to water development is the Garrison Diversion \nproject.\n  Let me illustrate the importance of this project. Garrison funding \nwill ensure that Indian tribes can provide clean drinking water to \ntribal members that often have to use some of the worst water in the \nnation. It will also deliver reliable water supplies for irrigation, \nindustry, and residential use in semi-arid regions of the state and to \ncommunities whose normal drinking water looks more like tobacco juice. \nMoreover, the bill will continue to support environmental enhancements \nand wildlife habitat by means of such Garrison programs as the Wetlands \nTrust.\n  In a word, the Garrison funding will help to fulfill the federal \ncommitment to develop a major water project in North Dakota to \ncompensate the state for the loss of 500,000 acres of prime farmland. \nThis land was flooded behind the garrison Dam in order to offer flood \nprotection and inexpensive hydro power to states downstream.\n  I would also advise my colleagues that North Dakota's elected leaders \nare working on legislation to revise the Garrison project to meet the \nstate's contemporary water supply needs in a fiscally and \nenvironmentally responsible way. The Garrison revision bill will \nrefocus the project to provide municipal, rural and industrial water \nsupplies to regional water systems, Indian reservations, and the Red \nRiver Valley while enhancing fish and wildlife habitat.\n  Finally, the bill before the Senate has supported funding which will \nallow the Army Corps of Engineers to proceed on a long-term flood \nprotection plan for the city of Grand Forks, North Dakota on the Red \nRiver. Approximately one million dollars included will be used for \npreparatory studies and planning of the permanent levees to protect the \nsister cities of Grand Forks, North Dakota and East Grand Forks, \nMinnesota that were devastated in the catastrophic floods of 1997.\n  My purpose today is to thank the leadership of the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee, and the Full Committee leadership, Mr. Stevens and Mr. \nByrd, for addressing in this bill projects of critical importance to \nNorth Dakota. Their leadership is appreciated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently in morning business, \nand Senators are permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6519-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6521-S6523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DELAYS IN SENATE ACTION ON JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, just a couple of weeks ago, I commented in \nthe Congressional Record on the Senate majority's poor record in acting \non judicial nominees, especially noting those judicial nominees who are \neither minorities or women. I included a recent letter from the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus, which calls upon the Senate Republican \nleadership to allow votes on the Latino judicial nominees who have \nlanguished in the Senate for far too long.\n  I have also spoken often about the crisis in the second circuit and \nthe need for the Senate to move forward to confirm the nominees to that \ncourt who are pending on the calendar. Judge Sonia Sotomayor is just \nsuch a qualified nominee, and she is one being held up by the \nRepublican majority, apparently because some on the other side of the \naisle believe she might one day be considered by President Clinton for \nnomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, should a vacancy arise.\n\n  Last week, a lead editorial in the Wall Street Journal discussed this \nsecret basis for the Republican hold against this fine judge. The \nJournal reveals that these delays are intended to ensure that Sonia \nSotomayor not be nominated to the Supreme Court, although it is hard to \nfigure out just how that is logical or sensible.\n  In fact, how disturbing, how petty, and how shameful: Trying to \ndisqualify an outstanding Hispanic woman judge by an anonymous hold.\n  I have far more respect for Senators who, for whatever reason, wish \nto vote against her. Stand up; vote against her. But to have an \nanonymous hold--an anonymous hold--in the U.S. Senate with 100 Members \nrepresenting 260 million Americans, which should be the conscience of \nthe Nation, should not be lurking in our cloakrooms anonymously trying \nto hold up a nominee. If we want to vote against somebody, vote against \nthem. I respect that. State your reasons. I respect that. But don't \nhold up a qualified judicial nominee.\n  I was asked last week by Neil Lewis of the New York Times about this \ncircumstance. He correctly reported my response in a front page story \nthis last Saturday. I am offended by this anonymous effort to oppose \nher prompt confirmation by stealth tactics. Here is a highly qualified \nHispanic woman judge who should have been confirmed to help end the \ncrisis in the Second Circuit more than three months ago.\n  The times Argus recently included an editorial entitled ``Partisan \nNonsense'' on this hold. The editorial notes that Judge Sotomayor rose \nfrom a housing project in the Bronx to Princeton, Yale and a federal \ncourt appointment by President Bush, a Republican. The editorial notes \nthat the stalling tactics are aggravating the judicial emergency faced \nby the Second Circuit caused by judicial vacancies for which the \nRepublican leadership in the Senate refuses to consider her, and \nanother worthy nominee. The editorial concludes by urging me to make \n``a lot of noise over this partisan nonsense.''\n  I don't always follow the editorials in my home State. But this one I \nam happy to follow.\n  I will continue to speak out on behalf of Judge Sotomayor and all the \nqualified nominees being stalled here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Judge Sotomayor in not the only woman or minority judicial nominee\n\n[[Page S6522]]\n\nwho has been needlessly stalled. Indeed, if one considers those \nnominees who have taken the longest to confirm this year, we find a \ndisturbing pattern:\n  Hilda Tagle, the only Hispanic woman the Senate has confirmed this \nyear, took 32 months to be confirmed as a district court judge for the \nSouthern District of Texas. That is more than two-and-one-half years.\n  Judge Richard Paez, currently a district court judge and a nominee to \nthe Ninth Circuit, was first nominated in January 1996. Twenty-nine \nmonths latter, Judge Paez's nomination remains in limbo on the Senate \ncalendar.\n  Nor have we seen any progress on the nomination of Jorge Rangel to \nthe Fifth Circuit or Anabelle Rodriquez to the District Court for \nPuerto Rico, although her nomination was received in January 1996, \nalmost 29 months ago.\n  For that matter, we have seen the President's nomination of Judge \nJames A. Beaty Jr., the first African American nominated to the Fourth \nCircuit, stalled for 30 months, since December 1995. The situation in \nthe Fourth Circuit was the topic of a Washington Post editorial past \nSaturday. We have seen the attack on Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson, \nwho would have been the first African-American woman to serve on the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania, but who was forced to withdraw. We \nhave seen the nomination of Clarence Sundram held up since September \n1995, almost 33 months.\n  In his annual report on the judiciary this year on New Year's Day, \nthe Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court observed: ``Some \ncurrent nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate \nJudiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed \nonly 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it \nconfirmed in 1994.'' He went on to note: ``The Senate is surely under \nno obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the \nnecessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.'' \nWhich of course is absolutely correct.\n  For some unexplained reason, judicial nominees who are women or \nracial or ethnic minorities seem to take the longest in the Senate. Of \nthe 10 judicial nominees whose nominations have been pending the \nlongest before the Senate, eight are women and racial or ethnic \nminority candidates. A ninth has been delayed in large measure because \nof opposition to his mother, who already serves as a judge. The tenth \nis one who blew the lid off the $1.4 million right-wing campaign to \n``kill'' Clinton judicial nominees.\n  Pending on the Senate calendar, having been passed over again and \nagain, are Judge Sonia Sotomayor, Judge Richard Paez, Oki Mollway and \nRonnie White. Held up in committee after two hearings is Clarence \nSundram. Still without a hearing are Anabelle Rodriquez, Judge James A. \nBeaty Jr., and Jorge C. Rangel. What all these nominees have in common \nis that they are either women or members of racial or ethnic \nminorities.\n  Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the \nSenate--and all of its member--are obligated to fulfill. In its \nunprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees in the 104th and \n105th Congresses, the Senate is shirking its duty. The Senate \nmajority's choices as they stall Hispanic, women and minority nominees \nis wrong and should end.\n  Mr. President, I have served here for nearly 24 years. I know Members \nof the Senate. I have enormous respect for so many of them, Republicans \nand Democrats alike. The vast majority of Senators I have served with \ndo not have any bias or ethnic bias against people. They do not have a \nreligious bias. They do not have a gender bias. But somehow ethnic and \ngender biases have crept into the stalling of these nominations.\n  If Senators are opposed to any judge, bring them up and vote against \nthem. But don't do an anonymous hold, which diminishes the credibility \nand respect of the whole U.S. Senate.\n  I have had judicial nominations by both Democrat and Republican \nPresidents that I intended to oppose. But I fought like mad to make \nsure they at least got a chance to be on the floor for a vote.\n  I have stated over and over again on this floor that I would refuse \nto put an anonymous hold on any judge; that I would object and fight \nagainst any filibuster on a judge, whether it is somebody I opposed or \nsupported; that I felt the Senate should do its duty.\n  If we don't like somebody the President nominates, vote him or her \ndown. But don't hold them in this anonymous unconscionable limbo, \nbecause in doing that, the minority of Senators really shame all \nSenators.\n  With that, Mr. President, I see Senators have come back to the floor \nfor their debate. So I ask unanimous consent that copies of the \neditorials of the Times Argus and the Washington Post, and the report \nfrom the New York Times, which I referred to, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From The Times Argus, June 15, 1998]\n\n                           Partisan Nonsense\n\n       You may never have heard of a federal district judge named \n     Sonia Sotomayor, and it appears that several key Republicans \n     are hoping you never will. They'd like her to simply vanish \n     from the nation's political radar screen, but Vermont's Sen. \n     Patrick Leahy is among those who stand in their way.\n       It appears these political foes of President Clinton are \n     afraid that if they confirm Judge Sotomayor's nomination to \n     the 2nd District U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, as Clinton \n     has proposed, her next stop will be a seat on the United \n     States Supreme Court.\n       Although Sotomayor grew up in the sprawling housing \n     projects of the Bronx, where success stories are less than \n     commonplace, she managed to graduate with high honors from \n     Princeton, become editor of the Yale Review and earn a \n     reputation as an effective federal prosecutor.\n       In 1992, she was appointed to the federal bench by then-\n     President George Bush. That would seem to suggest she had \n     bipartisan support, but that was before some nervous \n     Republicans began to fear there may soon be an opening on the \n     Supreme Court. That opening, they worried, would allow \n     Clinton to nominate Sotomayor, a woman and an Hispanic.\n       Of course there is no vacancy on the high court, nor has \n     there been any clear signal that there will be one any time \n     soon. Justice John Paul Stevens, who many believe will be the \n     first of the present batch of justices to retire, has already \n     hired his clerks for the next court session. In addition, \n     Sotomayor's name was not on a list of recommended nominees \n     the Hispanic National Bar Association submitted to Clinton.\n       But even if there was a pending vacancy, what is it about \n     Judge Sotomayor that would make Republicans so worried? Is it \n     that she's Hispanic? Is it that she's too liberal, or too \n     much a judicial activist?\n       For the record nobody is saying, but off the record, some \n     Senate aides concede their bosses are worried she would, \n     indeed, be an activist. Interestingly, conservative \n     supporters of Judge Sotomayor's nomination vehemently \n     disagree with that assessment.\n       Enter Sen. Leahy, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary \n     Committee. In blunt terms, Leahy has criticized the \n     Republicans who, behind the scenes and not for attribution, \n     are seeking to scuttle Sotomayor's nomination.\n       ``Their reasons are stupid at best and cowardly at worst,'' \n     Leahy told a New York Times reporter. ``What they are saying \n     is that they have a brilliant judge who happens to be a woman \n     and Hispanic and they haven't the guts to stand up and argue \n     publicly against her on the floor. They just want to hide in \n     their cloakrooms and do her in quietly.''\n       Those are strong words, particularly for the United States \n     Senate, but Leahy's anger is genuine and justified.\n       The campaign against Judge Sotomayor began on the editorial \n     pages of the ultra-conservative Wall Street Journal and was \n     given much wider exposure when it was taken up by Rush \n     Limbaugh, the right wing radio talk show host.\n       The Journal was upset with Sotomayor's ruling that a \n     coalition of New York businesses promoting a program for the \n     homeless had violated federal law by not paying the minimum \n     wage. This, in the Journal's opinion, constituted ``judicial \n     activism.''\n       But a well-known conservative, Gerald Walpin, has rushed to \n     Sotomayor's defense and his message is worth heeding.\n       ``If they had read the case they would see that she said \n     she personally approved of the homeless program but that as a \n     judge she was required to apply the law as it exists,'' \n     Walpin commented. ``She wrote that the law does not permit an \n     exception in this case. That's exactly what conservatives \n     want a non-activist judge who does not apply her own views \n     but is bound by the law.''\n       What's particularly aggravating by the stalling tactics of \n     Clinton's foes is that they come at a time of major judicial \n     delays caused by the existing vacancies on the bench Judge \n     Sotomayor would fill. The chief judge of the circuit, a \n     conservative Republican, has written about having to declare \n     ``judicial emergencies'' because of these vacancies.\n       We hope Sen. Leahy makes a lot of noise over this partisan \n     nonsense.\n\n[[Page S6523]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                [From the New York Times, June 13, 1998]\n\n             G.O.P., Its Eyes On High Court, Blocks a Judge\n\n                           (By Neil A. Lewis)\n\n       Washington, June 12--Judge Sonia Sotomayor seemed like a \n     trouble-free choice when President Clinton nominated her to \n     an appeals court post a year ago. Hers was an appealing \n     story: a child from the Bronx housing projects who went on to \n     graduate summa cum laude from Princeton and become editor of \n     the Yale Law Journal and then a Federal prosecutor.\n       Moreover, she had been a trial judge since 1992, when she \n     was named to the bench by the last Republican president \n     George Bush.\n       But Republican senators have been blocking Judge \n     Sotomayor's elevation to the appeals court for a highly \n     unusual reason: to make her less likely to be picked by Mr. \n     Clinton for the Supreme Court, senior Republican \n     Congressional aides said in interviews.\n       The delay of a confirmation vote on Judge Sotomayor to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, based \n     in New York, is an example of the intense and often byzantine \n     political maneuverings that take place behind the scenes in \n     many judicial nominations. Several elements of the Sotomayor \n     case are odd, White House officials and Democrats in Congress \n     say, but the chief one is the fact that there is no vacancy \n     on the Supreme Court, and no firm indication that there will \n     be one soon. Nor is there any evidence of a campaign to put \n     Judge Sotomayor under consideration for a seat if there were \n     a vacancy.\n       Judge Sotomayor's nomination was approved overwhelmingly by \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee in March. Of the judicial \n     nominees who have cleared the committee in this Congress, she \n     is among those who have waited the longest for a final vote \n     on the floor.\n       Senate Republican staff aides said Trent Lott of \n     Mississippi, the majority leader, has agreed to hold up a \n     vote on the nomination as part of an elaborate political \n     calculus; if she were easily confirmed to the appeals court, \n     they said, that would put her in a position to be named to \n     the Supreme Court. And Senate Republicans think that they \n     would then have a difficult time opposing a Hispanic woman \n     who had just been confirmed by the full Senate.\n       ``Basically, we think that putting her on the appeals court \n     puts her in the batter's box to be nominated to the Supreme \n     Court,'' said one senior Republican staff aide who spoke on \n     the condition of anonymity. ``If Clinton nominated her it \n     would put several of our senators in a real difficult \n     position.''\n       Mr. Lott declined through a spokeswoman to comment.\n       Judge Sotomayor sits on Federal District Court in \n     Manhattan, and the aides said some senators believe that her \n     record on the bench fits the profile of an ``activist \n     judge,'' a description that has been used by conservatives to \n     question a jurist's ability to construe the law narrowly. It \n     is a description that Judge Sotomayor's supporters, including \n     some conservative New York lawyers, dispute.\n       Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on \n     the Judiciary Committee, was blunt in his criticism of the \n     Republicans who are blocking a confirmation vote. ``Their \n     reasons are stupid at best and cowardly at worst,' he said.\n       ``What they are saying is that they have a brilliant judge \n     who also happens to be a woman and Hispanic. and they haven't \n     the guts to stand up and argue publicly against her on the \n     floor,'' Senator Leahy said. ``They just want to hide in \n     their cloakrooms and do her in quietly.''\n       The models for the strategy of putting candidates on \n     appeals courts to enhance their stature as Supreme Court \n     nominees are Judge Robert H. Bork and Judge Clarence Thomas. \n     Both were placed on the Court of Appeals for the District of \n     Columbia Circuit in part to be poised for nomination to the \n     Supreme Court. Judge Bork was denied confirmation to the \n     Supreme Court in 1987 and Judge Thomas was confirmed in 1991, \n     in both cases after bruising political battles.\n       The foundation for the Republicans's strategy is based on \n     two highly speculative theories: that Mr. Clinton is eager to \n     name the first Hispanic person to the Supreme Court and that \n     he will have such an opportunity when one of the current \n     justices, perhaps John Paul Stevens, retires at the end of \n     the current Supreme Court term next month.\n       Warnings about the possibility of Judge Sotomayor's filling \n     Justice Stevens's seat was raised by the Wall Street \n     Journal's editorial pages this month, both in an editorial \n     and in an op-ed column by Paul A. Gigot, who often reflects \n     conservative thinking in the Senate.\n       Although justices often announce their retirements at the \n     end of a term, Justice Stevens has not given a clue that he \n     will do so. He has, in fact, hired law clerks for next year's \n     term. The Journal's commentary also criticized Judge \n     Sotomayor's record, particularly her March ruling in a case \n     involving a Manhattan business coalition, the Grand Central \n     Partnership. She rules that in trying to give work experience \n     to the homeless, the coalition had violated Federal law by \n     failing to pay the minimum wage.\n       Gerald Walpin, a former Federal prosecutor who is widely \n     known in New York legal circles as a staunch conservative, \n     took issue with the Journal's criticism.\n       ``If they had read the case they would see that she said \n     she personally approved of the homeless program but that as a \n     judge she was required to apply the law as it exists,'' he \n     said. ``She wrote that the law does not permit an exception \n     in this case. That's exactly what conservatives want: a \n     nonactivist judge who does not apply her own views but is \n     bound by the law.'' Mr. Bush nominated Judge Sotomayor in \n     1992 after a recommendation from Daniel Patrick Moynihan, New \n     York's Democratic Senator.\n       It also remains unclear how some Senate Republicans came to \n     believe that Judge Sotomayor was being considered as a \n     candidate for the Supreme Court. Hispanic bar groups have for \n     years pressed the Clinton Administration to name the first \n     Hispanic justice, but White House officials said they are not \n     committed to doing so. The Hispanic National Bar Association \n     has submitted a list of six candidates for the Supreme Court \n     to the White House. But Martin R. Castro, a Chicago lawyer \n     and official of the group, said Judge Sotomayor's name is not \n     on the list.\n       The only Republicans to vote against her in March were \n     Senator John Kyl of Arizona and Senator John Ashcroft of \n     Missouri. The committee's other conservative members, \n     including Orrin G. Hatch of Utah and Strom Thurmond of South \n     Carolina, voted in her favor. Mr. Kyl and Mr. Ashcroft both \n     declined to comment today.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 13, 1998]\n\n                          Unpacking the Court\n\n       The saga of the North Carolina seats on the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the 4th Circuit is a caricature of the power \n     individual senators have to hold up judicial nominations. In \n     1990 Congress added some seats to the 4th Circuit, including \n     one for North Carolina. to this day--7\\1/2\\ years later--that \n     seat remains vacant. The reason is a byzantine power play by \n     Sen. Jesse Helms.\n       The first nomination to the ghost seat was made by \n     President Bush in 1991. He picked a conservative district \n     court judge and Helms favorite named Terrence Boyle. That \n     nomination was dropped--much to Mr. Helm's fury--when Mr. \n     Bush subsequently lost the 1992 election. Since then Mr. \n     Helms has stymied President Clinton's efforts to fill the \n     seat. When President Clinton named Rich Leonard to it late in \n     1995, Mr. Helms blocked the nomination, and the Senate never \n     acted on it. With no prospect of success, the nomination was \n     not resubmitted in the next Congress. What's more, since \n     Judge Dixon Phillips Jr. took senior status in 1994 and \n     thereby opened another North Carolina slot on the court, Mr. \n     Helms has also blocked the administration's attempts to fill \n     that seat. As a result, the president's choice--U.S. District \n     Judge James Beaty Jr.--has been in limbo for 2\\1/2\\ years \n     without getting even a hearing. Mr. Helms has not even \n     indicated to the administration what sort of nominees might \n     be acceptable.\n       Mr. Helms has argued in talks with the administration that \n     the court needs no more judges--a point on which he is, \n     ironically, supported by the 4th Circuit's own conservative \n     chief judge, Harvie Wilkinson III. Mr. Helms, however, was \n     making no such argument when Judge Boyle was up for the slot. \n     And it's a bit difficult to imagine him making the same point \n     now were the president's nominees not likely to add a little \n     ideological--and, for that matter, ethnic--diversity to one \n     of the most conservative courts in the country. Mr. Clinton's \n     nominees would, indeed, change the 4th Circuit--which covers \n     Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, West Virginia and North \n     Carolina--and the arch-conservative senator cannot be \n     required to relish this prospect.\n       But ultimately the Constitution gives the president, not \n     individual senators, the power to name judges. And Mr. \n     Helms's effort to keep the court conservative by keeping it \n     small is an improper aggrandizement of his own rule.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if I have time left, I yield it back. I \nyield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6521-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6523-S6524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  MR.

Mr. President, today I take a moment to acknowledge the \nnew ``Building a Better World'' Award which CH2M HILL, an employee-\nowned company which is headquartered in Denver, has initiated. William \nD. Ruckelshaus, Chairman of BFI and former EPA Administrator, was \npresented with CH2M HILL's inaugural ``Building a Better World'' award \nin ceremonies at the Smithsonian Institution's Castle in Washington, DC \non May 6, 1998.\n  CH2M HILL created this award to recognize the contributions of \nprivate citizens or organizations that reflect the company's core \nbusiness value of making technology work to build a better world. The \nwork of its 7,000 employees worldwide involves assisting public and \nprivate sector clients in planning, design, program management, and \noften construction for drinking water, wastewater management, hazardous \nwaste management, transportation, nuclear waste cleanup projects, and \nindustrial activities.\n  In choosing a recipient for this inaugural award, the selection panel \nsought to define a level of excellence that would make this award \nespecially significant to succeeding recipients. Three key criteria are \nestablished for CH2M HILL's ``Building a Better World'' award:\n  Honorees must be deemed to have made a significant difference in \nimproving the lives and prospects of people and society.\n  Contributions of honorees must be judged to be exceptional in nature \nand their impact substantial, distinctive and enduring.\n  Honorees must demonstrate an extraordinary and exemplary exercise of \nleadership and commitment.\n  In honoring Mr. Ruckelshaus with the ``Building a Better World'' \naward, CH2M HILL noted his long standing and continuing efforts in \nadvancing environmental protection, practicing corporate \nresponsibility, affecting sustainable development, and inspiring \ndynamic public and private citizenship. ``Taken apart from one another, \nMr. Ruckelshaus' accomplishments in business leadership, government \nservice and environmental stewardship are extraordinary in there own \nright'' said Ralph R. Peterson, CH2M HILL President and CEO. ``Taken \ncollectively they form a masterwork of civic character.''\n  In establishing the ``Building a Better World'' award, CH2M HILL \nplans to honor people it knows firsthand to have made constructive, \nsignificant and lasting contributions to improving the lives and \nprospects of people and society. The award will be presented on a \nregular basis as deemed appropriate by the CH2M HILL Board of \nDirectors.\n  Mr. President, this special award by a leading Colorado-based company \nprovides another example of corporate interest and support for making \nthe world we live in a better place.\n  I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6524-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6524-S6529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2138) making appropriations for energy and water \n     development for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I will shortly be sending an amendment to \nthe desk. Let me just explain to my colleagues what it is I am \nattempting to do.\n  This is not the first time I have been on the floor of the Senate \ntalking ``trash,'' not the kind of trash that immediately comes to mind \nwhen you use that phrase but trash meaning garbage. In fact, another \nSenator just came by a few minutes ago and said, ``This amendment you \nare offering is garbage.'' I said, ``You are exactly right; it is \ngarbage.'' It is all about garbage. It is all about municipal solid \nwaste, which is a diplomatic term for garbage, the stuff that each of \nus throws out every day from our kitchen--puts in a plastic bag, puts \nout at the curb once or twice a week, picked up by a local truck and \ntaken to what we think is a local landfill nearby.\n  Unfortunately, the State I come from, Indiana, has become the local \nlandfill for a number of States that do not have enough landfill \ncapacity or find it cheaper to load it on a train, load it on a truck, \nsend it overnight down our Nation's railways or highways, and drop it \noff in the State of Indiana. Over the past several years, we have been \nthe recipient of millions upon millions upon millions of tons of out-\nof-State trash without any ability as a State to put reasonable \nrestraints and restrictions on receipt of that out-of-State trash in \norder to manage our environment and manage our own destiny in terms of \nhow we dispose of this municipal solid waste.\n  The Supreme Court has denied States their individual efforts to \nregulate this, saying that it is a violation of the commerce clause of \nthe Constitution. But the courts have also been clear to point out the \nfact that if Congress affirmatively enacts legislation or constraints \non the importation of out-of-State trash, or exportation of out-of-\nState trash, it will be constitutionally acceptable. It is just simply \none of those areas where States cannot do it individually but Congress \ncan give them the authority to do that.\n  We have learned a lot of things over the last several years. I have \noffered this legislation now five times. This is the sixth. We offered \nit in 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995, and in 1996, and in each of those years \nthe Senate has passed this legislation. We now come here for the sixth \ntime because we have been unable to secure passage in the other House, \nor, when we have, it has been dropped in conference. Various other \nmeans have been used to defeat the purpose of finally accomplishing \nwhat I believe is a reasonable restraint and reasonable solution to the \nproblem that we face.\n  Now, Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls have won six titles. This \nis my sixth try to win one. I have five defeats, and I hope not to get \nthe sixth defeat. So that we have Jordan and the Bulls on the one hand \ncarrying around the trophy with astounding success, and we have Coats \non the other hand loaded up with bags of trash brought in from out of \nState marked X defeat in 1990; X defeat in 1992; X defeat in 1994, et \ncetera, et cetera.\n  Now, I cannot blame my colleagues in the Senate. I cannot do that \nbecause through negotiation each time we have been able to work out our \ndifferences. We have been able to recognize that there are exporting \nStates that have needs and there are importing States that have \nproblems, and that finding a solution that merely benefits the \nimporting States puts the exporting States in a very difficult \nposition.\n  So with the help of my friend from New York, Senator D'Amato, and the \nhelp of my friends, on a bipartisan basis we have been able to reach an \naccommodation which recognizes the need for importing States to have to \nhave reasonable restraints on the amount that they can handle and at \nthe same time gives those exporting States time to put in place \nmechanisms of their own to deal with their trash or to enter into \narrangements with our State so that we can have some type of reasonable \ncontrol over that.\n\n  We have learned those lessons, sometimes the hard way, but we have \nalways been able to reach an agreement and a consensus, and the Senate \nhas been tremendously supportive in the end of my efforts to do this. I \nam disappointed that we have not had that same kind of support in the \nHouse of Representatives. I hope we can as we try once again to \nconvince our colleagues that this is a problem that needs a solution, \nthat we have a solution that takes care of the problems that are facing \nimporting States as well as exporting States.\n  The amendment I am going to offer today is the interstate solid waste \ntitle of S. 534, which passed twice in the last Congress. That title \nwas carefully negotiated. What we are offering is that title in its \nentirety with a minor modification. We are even now negotiating that \nmodification as I speak.\n\n[[Page S6525]]\n\n  Specifically, to repeat what I have said on this floor many times, \nthis amendment will allow a Governor, if requested by an affected local \ncommunity, to ban out-of-State solid waste at landfills or incinerators \nthat did not receive out-of-State municipal solid waste in 1993, a \nbenchmark year.\n  Let me repeat that because it is a critical point to understand. A \nGovernor is given the authority to ban receipt of out-of-State waste at \na landfill that did not receive out-of-State waste in 1993 if, and only \nif, it is requested by the local community. If the local community \nwants to receive the out-of-State waste, if they want to enter into a \ncontract with a hauler or the State wants to enter into a contract with \nanother State, they are permitted to do so. The Governor only has the \nauthority if the community asks him to do so and if they meet the test \nin terms of whether or not they received the waste in 1993. The \nGovernor is also given the authority to freeze, not eliminate but \nfreeze, out-of-State municipal solid waste at 1993 levels at landfills \nand incinerators that received solid waste during 1993. The Governor, \nhowever, may not ban or limit municipal solid waste imports to \nlandfills or incinerators if they have what is called a host community \nagreement that specifically authorizes out-of-State waste. So if a \ncommunity wants it, fine. But if a community feels it is overwhelmed \nand cannot receive it, then it can request the Governor to either ban \nor freeze, depending on the particular situation that exists.\n  Just as an example of this, we have small communities, small \ncounties, in Indiana with landfills that were designed to serve the \nsolid waste needs of those communities within that jurisdiction, say, \nfor a 20- or 25-year period of time. They have gone out on a limb with \na bond issue or they have come up with the financing to finance this \nlandfill, and they suddenly find that in the period of 12 months or 18 \nmonths the entire landfill is filled to capacity, leaving the solid \nwaste jurisdiction in dire straits, no longer able to take care of \ntheir own generated municipal solid waste simply because their landfill \nwas clogged up and filled up with waste coming not from their area, not \neven within their State, but sometimes long hauled halfway across the \ncountry or brought down from another State so it is totally out of \ntheir control.\n  Since we started offering this amendment, shipments across the \nborders have continued. Large importers continue to be adversely \nimpacted. We have been a net importer in the State of Indiana for over \n7 years. In 1996, we imported 1.8 million tons of out-of-State trash. \nLast year, we received the largest amount ever, 2.7 million tons. From \n1996 to 1997, our trash imports have increased by 37 percent and our \nhands are tied. We cannot control what comes across our borders and \ninto our landfills unless we have legislation that gives us the \nauthority to do that.\n  I do not want to take a lot of time; I know we are trying to move \nthis bill along. Let me just conclude by saying I am not arguing for an \noutright ban on all waste shipments between States. There are examples \nof effective and efficient cross-border waste management. My own State \nof Indiana has several communities which have traditionally worked with \nother communities in neighboring States to receive solid waste. But we \nmust give States some role in making waste management decisions. \nWithout congressional authority, we will be unable to play any role \nwhatsoever.\n\n  We must have a say in how much we receive. We must have the ability \nto enter into contracts. We do have to recognize the needs of exporting \nStates, but we also have to balance those needs with importing States. \nWe have legislation, which this Senate has passed overwhelmingly on a \nbipartisan basis, with exporters and importers agreeing that this is a \nproper balance. I am simply reintroducing what has already been \naccepted by this Senate with, as I said, a modest modification that \neven at this point we are discussing with export States to see if we \ncan reach some agreement on that so this legislation can go forward.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2716\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very appreciative of the problems \nwhich Senator Coats has alluded to as they relate to those States which \nare the recipients of large amounts of refuse, solid waste that comes \nfrom other States. Indeed, if I were a Senator from one of those States \nin which local communities, sometimes private landfill operations, \nenter into agreements and take large quantities, millions of tons of \nsolid waste coming in, I would certainly understand why it is the \nGovernor and/or the local officials would like to have some control \nwith respect to the amount that comes in.\n  Having said that, I am appreciative of the Senator's recognition of \nour concern, notwithstanding that we are a State, New York, that \nexports millions of tons annually because we simply do not have the \nability to keep it, and are now closing down the largest landfill in \nthe world, which will be closed in the year 2001. This is a concern to \nus, a very important and valid concern to the City of New York and to \nthe State as well. If a law, and/or an agreement is entered into which \nwould preclude us from using those areas for which we have negotiated \nlong-term contracts, and indeed would restrict us, particularly at a \ntime when landfills are closing down in New York and the problem will \nbecome more acute, we recognize we have to deal with those problems.\n  Indeed, there are a number of contingencies which are being examined \nto dispose of this waste in the most environmentally sound and cost-\neffective manner. Plans are being developed, facilities are being \nbuilt, land sites, new land sites within the State, are being utilized. \nThere are a number and variety of communities that have entered into \nprograms to recycle and to cut down on the volume. However, this is a \nmonumental problem. Therefore, I appreciate the recognition by my \ncolleague and friend of this problem, and I am going to ask that we \nhave an opportunity--and I recognize people want to move on with this \nbill--to examine it carefully.\n  I tell you, I respect, again, the candor of my colleague, Senator \nCoats, when the fact is the threshold, the ratcheting down threshold \nhas been reduced from when last this legislation was accepted. We \npassed this overwhelmingly and we worked together cooperatively, and I \nthink it passed by something like 94 to 6. It was an overwhelming vote. \nBut that was in 1995. Since then, while the Senator is pointing out \nthat his State is getting more garbage, we are producing more that does \nnot go into landfills within our State, and therefore ratcheting down \nis something we could not feel comfortable with. This Senator could not \nsay we will be ready to accept limitations that are further eroded and \nreduced. That is a very real problem.\n  Second, the legislation is tied to a date, as my colleague indicates, \nthat says, ``those landfills that were receiving material, solid waste \nfrom out of State, as of 1993.''\n  There have been, I am sure, a number of landfills that have opened up \nsince 1993. So what this legislation would do, if passed in its present \nform, it would effectively deny New York or other States that export \ngarbage the opportunity to continue that relationship they have with \nlandfills or operations that have opened subsequent to 1993. I have to \ntell you, I do not know at this point how many tons of waste we would \nthen not be able to dispose of, but it could be significant. If we were \nto have had a dozen additional sites nationwide opened up, we \nwould find ourselves in a situation where we could no longer use them \nto dispose of any of the waste.\n\n  So I would have to ask my friend to consider updating the 1993 date \nas a date to determine how you would ratchet this down. It would \ncertainly have to be something closer to--and, indeed, in 1995 we used \n1993. It would seem to me as we are into 1998, we\n\n[[Page S6526]]\n\nwould expect at least that same kind of consideration. Without even \nstudying it, it would seem to me we would have to put in that date, if \nwe are going to maintain some kind of symmetry. Those landfills that \nwere in operation as of 1996, that that would be appropriate if we are \ngoing to maintain symmetry.\n  Again, I haven't had a chance to check this with our State and \nascertain whether in this short time they could tell us how many \nlandfill sites have been opened, even between 1996 and today. But that \nis a concern, and I share that with my colleague.\n  We have not had an opportunity to really discuss this. Yet, I am \ndeeply appreciative of his concerns and his offer to try to work this \nout. So I hope that before attempting to move to vote on this, that we \ncould see if we cannot get some cooperative agreement. I do not know \nwhat other colleagues in some of the exporting States would feel, but I \nam still of a mind that if we can be accommodating and meet our needs, \nI want to do that. But these are two very real concerns.\n  No. 1, we cannot ratchet down an amount when we are producing more \ngarbage than ever before, one that we had agreed to back in 1995. And, \nsecond, we would have to do something with the date of grandfathering \nthose landfills. We would have to bring them up to a more current \nposition so as to determine those which we may be using today which we \nwere not using heretofore.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I ask the Senator from New York, and the Senator \nfrom Indiana, are they going to try to iron out the differences that \nhave been alluded to?\n  Mr. COATS. I would hope we could. I talked to the Senator from New \nYork, indicating we are flexible in terms of moving this on. I agree \nwith the Senator there may be some need to have additional \nnegotiations. Since the Senate passed this before and this language has \nbeen acceptable, we could agree to go back to the original ratchet, the \noriginal number used as the baseline for ratcheting down. We dropped it \n100,000 tons--we could go back to the 750,000, if that would be \nacceptable and allow us to go forward with this. There is no way we \ncan, I believe, derive an answer to the Senator's second \nquestion, which is using 1999 as a different base than 1993.\n\n  I assumed all along, based on the assurances given to us by the \nSenator from New York and other exporting States in the past, that \ndevelopment of in-State facilities was accommodating more and more of \ntheir municipal waste. In fact, I was assured of that several years \nago. If they just had a 2-, 3-, 4-year flexibility, they would have \ntheir own in-State capacity or at least have the capacity that would \nallow them not to significantly increase the exports.\n  I think we can work that out. I would like, obviously, to move this \nalong and pass the bill. We all know it is a long way from ever getting \nto conference because of concerns in the House on other issues. But if \nthere is any way the Senator from New York can see to, one, agree to \nour offer to go back to the original figure on the ratchet basis from \n650,000 to 750,000 and then my assurances that we will work with him \nand work with Members of the House and his delegation to address this \nother question--which I don't think we have the answer to at this point \nand can't get it in the short amount of time that the chairman wants to \nmove this appropriations bill--I am certainly open to that.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I can address a question to the Senator \nfrom Indiana.\n  Do you know if your staff has had conversations with the senior \nSenator from New Jersey? Because he usually has had a question on this.\n  Mr. COATS. We have not. All I know is, what we are offering here is \nexactly what the Senator from New Jersey agreed to and voted for in the \npast.\n  Mr. REID. I will say, on the minority side, we will be willing to \naccept this. I do have to get a clearance from Senator Lautenberg, who \nis testifying at this time, and I am sure we can get that done very \nquickly.\n  Mr. COATS. I think it is important that I go forward and ask \nunanimous consent to modify my amendment to change the figure on page \n2----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, I don't think you need unanimous \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2716, As Modified\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to modify my amendment by \nchanging the figure on line 25, page 2, of the amendment from ``650,000 \ntons'' to ``750,000 tons.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  Mr. COATS. With that, Mr. President, I will tell the Senator from \nNevada that he can assure the senior Senator from New Jersey that what \nis being offered here is identical to what was offered and agreed to in \nthe past by the Senator and is exactly the same legislation in regard \nto the municipal solid waste section of that bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me say this: First of all, I \nappreciate the Senator's recognition of the fact that the ratchet \nfigure has to be the same, or should be, and moving to do that. I \nunderstand he brings these requests at the request of his Governor. I \ndo have a very serious concern, and that is, if one reads the \nlegislation, it says:\n\n       In 1999 a State may ban 95 percent of the amount exported \n     to a State in 1993.\n\n  That is a serious concern, understanding that, again, we are now 3 \nyears further down the road. I don't know what the impact will be \ntoday. It is one thing to say, ``Well, we agreed to that 3 years ago.'' \nI am concerned, and, again, if we are going to talk about symmetry, at \nthe very least it seems to me that that figure will have to read \n``exported to a State in 1996,'' so that we maintain the same 2 years, \nthe 2-year differential.\n  I feel much more comfortable in saying let's move the process. And, \nindeed, if there are other things that have to be done, hopefully in \nconference we can work that out with the assurance of the chairman and \nthe ranking member that we can deal with other areas. But these are \nissues of very significant proportions as they relate to our local \ngovernments.\n\n  While I can understand the concern when an area is being inundated \nand people feel there is nothing they can do--the local legislatures--I \nunderstand that. I ask my colleague to understand what our concerns are \nif we have no place and valid contracts have been entered into \nsubsequent to 1993 and we find now, as a result of moving along with \nthis, they no longer have a place to dispose of it.\n  Even moving it to 1996, I say, may not be sufficient, because we may \nhave--and not in the State of Indiana, but in other jurisdictions--\nopened up facilities or are presently using facilities that have been \nopened maybe last year, and here I am in a position that I will be \nagreeing that these facilities will no longer be possibly available to \nus. That is why I am concerned, absent that information.\n  If we go along with the year 1996, I hope my friend will recognize \nthat is a very real accommodation, as opposed to 1993, and then take it \non good faith that we will examine this, so that even if it goes to \nconference, we might have to lodge some kind of objection if we found \nthat subsequent to 1996 there were facilities that were open that were \nsubstantial and necessary for us to accommodate the disposal of this \nwaste. I want to be accommodating, but I have to state it in this \nmanner so that we can both protect the interests of our States and our \ncitizens. I think that is about as far as I can go on this.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from New York, I \nwill state a couple of things.\n  No. 1, we passed this legislation in 1996. So the agreement that we \nhad reached relative to using 1993 was acceptable to the State of New \nYork, the State of New Jersey, and other exporters just in the last \nCongress. In fact, we passed it twice in the last Congress. There was \nno request at that time, in 1996, to change the base year from--in \nfact, we offered 1993 or 1994, and 1993 was a more acceptable year--\nthere was no request then to address the concern that the Senator from \nNew York has just raised relative to having to change\n\n[[Page S6527]]\n\nthat base year to accommodate what might be perceived as increased \nexports.\n  Secondly, I will state again for the Record that we have been \nrepeatedly assured by exporters--by exporting States that all they \nneeded was a little bit of time to develop more of their own capacity \nand that actually I think it would be just as logical a request from \nthe Senator from Indiana or anybody from an importing State to request \nthat we use a lower amount rather than a higher amount, because 10 \nyears ago everybody said, this won't be a problem; 10 years ago, people \nsaid 5 years from then it wouldn't be a problem, because all they \nneeded was 3 or 4 years to sort of get their own act together.\n  We understood that, and we understood the prodigious volumes of \nmunicipal waste they were generating. The population in the Senator's \nState I don't believe has significantly increased. In fact, I think \nthey are losing population.\n  I don't know that they are necessarily generating more waste, unless \npeople are eating more than they used to. It might be. The economy is \ngood. Maybe there is more waste to dispose of. My daughter has moved to \nNew York, so my wife and I go up and we eat out. I suppose that is out-\nof-State consumption. We try to eat everything we order, I will state \nfor the record, so that we don't generate any more waste that can be \nsent back to Indiana. I don't think it is good for the Senator from \nIndiana to go to New York, generate waste that then is packed up that \nnight and shipped by truck and dumped in my landfill in my hometown.\n  I don't understand the need to increase or to look on the assertion \nor the basis that they have less disposal capacity now than before when \nwe have been assured on the floor that all they needed was just a few \nyears to provide more in-State capacity and that would alleviate our \nproblem. We have made very significant concessions in terms of \naddressing the concerns of the exporting States.\n  My original legislation that I offered back in 1990 gave the Governor \nthe outright authority to flat out ban any garbage from out of State. \nAnd that passed the U.S. Senate.\n  We have the votes to do that. There are about 31 States that are \nimporters. They are the ones that get dumped on. There are just a \nhandful of States that generate the exports. But we recognize that \nproblem. They are high-density States and generate a lot of waste.\n  We recognized their problem. And we address their problem. And, in so \ndoing, we made considerable concessions about what we would continue to \nreceive, that if a community or a municipal waste disposal jurisdiction \nwanted to take out-of-State waste, enter into a contract to do that, \nwhy, we would allow that to take place. We said the Governor could not \noutright ban; he could only freeze at certain levels.\n  We adjusted the baseline amounts so that we would continue to receive \nprodigious amounts of waste--all trying to be a good neighbor, trying \nto help out a State until they could develop their own disposal \ncapacity.\n  Now, New York is a big State. There is a lot of room in New York to \nput--a lot bigger than the State of Indiana. I just assumed----\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. I will be happy to yield in a moment.\n  I just assumed the State of New York was taking advantage of some of \nthat space outside of Manhattan to address those needs and by now we \nwould not even need to be here addressing this. But something has not \nhappened; therefore, I think to go back to the original agreement that \ngives States some authority to make reasonable rules relative to how \nmuch they receive and so that they can manage their own environmental \naffairs, something that has been approved and accepted by every Member \nin this body in the past, I think that is a reasonable way to proceed.\n  I just answer the Senator from New York by saying, I think it would \nbe just as reasonable if I were here asking for lower baseline numbers \nrather than higher, but I am willing to stay where we were because that \nis what we worked so hard to agree on just in the last Congress.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Well, if the Senator would yield just for an \nobservation, and I observe--and I am looking at the summary of the \namendment. When I look at the summary of the amendment, as drawn, it \nsays, in 1999, greater than 1.4 million tons or 90 percent of the \namount exported in 1993. Now, what we would be agreeing to is that \nwithin less than 6 months--within 5\\1/2\\ months--that we would agree \nthat the following amounts could not be greater than 1.4 million tons \nor 90 percent of the amount exported in 1993. What I am saying is, I am \nwilling to go along with the 1.4 million tons or 90 percent of that \nexported in 1996. OK.\n  Now, let me also say that in 1 year and 5\\1/2\\ months--if you go to \nthe next year--it says in 2000, greater than 1.3 million tons. You go \ndown to 1.3 million or 90 percent of the amount exported in 1999.\n  So what I am suggesting is that I cannot in good conscience support \nan agreement when I do not know what we have done between 1993 and to \ndate. But I am willing to take it up to 1996. And we are talking about \n5 months. And then within a year you get the second figure that \ntriggers off. So I am just talking about 1 year.\n  You cannot ask us to put ourselves in the position to have us sign \noff on this. I think even taking 1996 is Russian roulette to the \nextent--I hate to say it is Russian roulette--but at least there is a \nsymmetry between what we did before. And I only do this on the basis \nthat when we go to conference, if indeed we have some severe problems, \nI will notify the committee. And if the Governor's office advises us \nthere is no way they can possibly do it, I will notify the committee. \nAnd I think they would act responsibly to make the necessary changes or \nto drop the legislation.\n\n  I have to be candid with you on this, so I suggest that is about as \nfar as I could possibly go at this time. And I do it in the spirit of \naccommodation.\n  Mr. COATS. So Mr. President, as I understand it, the Senator is \nproposing that relative to the export ratchet----\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes.\n  Mr. COATS. Only for the year 1999----\n  Mr. D'AMATO. No.\n  Mr. COATS. The first line of the summary--only for the year 1999, the \nSenator would like to change the base year from 1993 to 1996.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is right.\n  Mr. COATS. Is that correct?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Sure. That is correct. And what I am suggesting--in \nother words, in 1999, 1.4 million or 90 percent of the amount exported \nin 1996; and I hope we can get that amount. Hopefully, the State will \nbe able to give us those numbers, and hopefully all States would be \nable to give us those numbers. And thereafter I would say we have an \nagreement, because we are then holding to--if you read in 2000, it says \ngreater than 1.3 million tons or 90 percent of the amount exported in \n1999. So we are, then, at least, taking it on a rational basis as it \nrelates to how much was actually exported.\n  Mr. COATS. Well, let me say this to the Senator. First of all, I know \nthat, given the 4 weeks we spent on the tobacco legislation, things are \ndesperately behind. We are desperately behind the curve, and I know the \nSenate is anxious to move this appropriations bill forward as well as \nthe agriculture appropriations, which I believe is coming next.\n  In the interest of expediting that schedule, I would be willing to \naccept that change offered by the Senator from New York if it would \nallow us to move forward, and with the understanding that we have a \nmutual agreement here to sit down and try to work this out.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. If there are any other--yes.\n  Mr. COATS. Given the fact that we do not have the answers to the \nquestion, I think the Senator and I--and we worked on this before--we \ncould probably work out an acceptable arrangement which could help \neverybody. If we could get that assurance and move forward with it, I \nwould be willing to make that change.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I am grateful to both Senators for trying to work this \nmatter out. Senator Lautenberg--I have spoken to him on the telephone. \nHis staff is here on the floor. He should be here\n\n[[Page S6528]]\n\nmomentarily. Hopefully, he will sign off on this after speaking to the \ntwo, the Senator from Indiana and the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Let me again suggest that with those two changes, the \nchange of the 750,000 tons, which the Senator has already made in his \namendment, and that of changing the 1999 agreement to reflect the \namount exported in 1996, if the Senator would make that amendment, I am \nwilling then to accept the amendment with the proviso and understanding \nand the gentlemen's agreement being that any other difficulties we will \nsee if we can work out. And then we would rely on the committee \nchairman and the ranking member to help us and aid us in any further \nlegislative language that might be needed.\n  Mr. COATS. Well, Mr. President, I certainly think we have the makings \nof an offer here, if we can get clearance from the rest--the Senator \nfrom New Jersey who helped in the past to reach this compromise. \nObviously, nothing has changed. In fact, it probably changed a little \nmarginally for the better for the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think if you want to work on that language --and I \nunderstand Senator Lautenberg is going to have to express his views; \nand he will be here momentarily. I wonder, I say to the Senator, if you \nmight agree with me that Senator Allard from Colorado, who wants to \nspeak to the bill--he is not going to offer an amendment--could speak \nfor up to 10 minutes while you are working on this.\n  Mr. COATS. I have no objection.\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I want to thank the \nchairman for allowing me the time to speak for a few minutes on the \nbill.\n  I rise in support of Senate bill 2138 making an appropriation for \nenergy and water development. I also want to make a few comments in \nregard to the Jeffords-Harkin amendment, which was adopted a little bit \nearlier on in the day, which was to restore funding to the renewable \nenergy account in the 1999 energy and water appropriations bill we are \nnow debating.\n  First of all, I thank the chairman for his diligence and hard work in \nworking with my office on issues that are very important to the State \nof Colorado. Last year, you worked hard with our delegation, and are \ncontinuing to work with this delegation. I am comfortable with the \nlegislation in the form that it is being reported out of the Senate.\n  I also recognize that there is a lot of work, or some work, that has \nto be done in conference committee and maybe a few issues yet that \nstill have to be resolved as far as this particular bill is concerned.\n  Let me just say a little bit about the priorities that I have as \nsomebody who represents Colorado and what I am thinking about as far as \nthose priorities are concerned. First of all, research programs that \nwill benefit from this funding should be a national priority. They are \nenergy-type research, and they are very, very important to the future \nof this country and having us not rely on foreign sources for our \nenergy. It is well known that nearly half of all our Nation's oil is \nimported and that these imports account for 36 percent of the U.S. \ntrade deficit.\n  American renewable energy and energy-efficient technologies help \noffset fuel imports. They build our domestic economy, and they \nstrengthen our national security. Renewable power is an attractive \nenergy source for the future. Alternative fuels such as propane, \nnatural gas, ethanol, and methanol are clean fuels and are largely free \nof the pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act. Renewable energy will \nprovide clean and inexhaustible energy for millions of consumers.\n  Specifically, funding for renewable energy technology is important to \nmy home State of Colorado. My State supports several energy-efficient \npilot programs as well as established renewable energy sources. Some of \nthe Nation's best wind and solar resources are in Colorado, and many of \nmy constituents currently rely on renewable energy.\n  These are not far-fetched research projects that we are talking \nabout. My State, for example, has many ranchers who are currently using \nsun and wind energy in the management of their lands, providing for \ntheir energy needs.\n  Colorado is also the proud home of the National Renewable Energy \nLaboratory, referred to as NREL--the leading renewable energy research \nlaboratory in the Nation, I might add. NREL conducts the needed \nresearch and develops and demonstrates sustainable-energy technologies. \nThis lab relies heavily on the funding included in this amendment.\n  In addition, there are many entrepreneurs who are counting on funding \nfrom the Department of Energy to continue improving and increasing \navailability of renewable energy technology. There are 132 businesses \nin Colorado that specialize in renewable-energy-related products and \nservices. Congress must continue to support research for renewable \nenergy.\n  We also need to support the partnerships among the Government \nresearch entities, universities, and businesses. These cooperative \nefforts ensure that the research produces applicable results and \nfurthers our goal of increasing our use of renewable energy resources.\n\n  In past years, I have sponsored environmental awareness seminars with \nColorado State University to promote the use of alternate fuels. I am a \nformer member of the House Renewable Energy Caucus, and I recently \nbecame the chairman of the newly formed bipartisan Senate Renewable and \nEnergy Efficiency Caucus. I am a strong proponent of using renewable \nenergy sources, and I believe we should continue to support that \nresearch, perfect the technology, and expand the use of renewable \nresources.\n  I thank my colleagues from Vermont and Delaware for their efforts to \nprotect funding for renewable energy.\n  The next point I want to make is very, very important. While I do \nsupport the intent of the Jeffords-Roth amendment, I want to highlight \none portion that I hope the conferees will change. One of the offsets \nincluded in the amendment is a 1.5 percent decrease in funding for \ncleanup of nondefense nuclear sites that are no longer utilized. One of \nthose sites is the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, which I \nwill talk about further a little bit later on. My hope is to have this \nsite cleaned up by 2006. In order to do that, it will require every \ndollar that has been appropriated for it in this bill. While in this \ninstance I support the Roth-Harkin amendment, in the future I will have \ndifficulty doing so if this same offset is included. In other words, \nthe priority as far as my State is concerned, we spend every dollar to \nclean up Rocky Flats, but if we can do that, if we can put more money \nin renewable labs without taking away from the dollars, I can be \nsupportive. I want it clear that my top priority is the cleanup of the \nRocky Flats facility.\n  On that topic, Mr. President, I further thank Mr. Domenici and Mr. \nReid for their hard work on the energy and water appropriations \nlegislation.\n  There is a lot of talk about surpluses nowadays. While I know that \nMr. Domenici's subcommittee was not the beneficiary of any surplus, \ntherefore it is a very pleasant surprise that he was able to find the \nfunds necessary for an accelerated cleanup of Rocky Flats. In fact, I \nnote that he provides $32 million over the administration's request to \nbe sure that we remain as close to a 2006 closure date for Rocky Flats \nas possible.\n  As Mr. Domenici knows, this has been a very important issue for me \nsince I came to the Senate last year. The basis of my concern is the \nproximity of Rocky Flats to over 2 million Coloradans. This makes the \nsite one of the biggest potential threats to the Denver metro area. \nRocky Flats is home to tons of plutonium that needs to be removed from \nColorado. The funding in this bill will help achieve that end.\n  Furthermore, I note the dramatic upward swing in funding from fiscal \nyear 1997 to date. In fiscal year 1997, $487 million was appropriated \nfor Rocky Flats cleanup. In fiscal year 1998, that number jumped to \n$632 million. Today's bill proposes $657 million for cleanup. If we can \nhold this amount, we should be able to safeguard this material and \nclose Rocky Flats in an expeditious manner.\n  Again, I close my remarks by complimenting the chairman on his hard \nwork on both the budget and this appropriations bill and tell him how \nvery\n\n[[Page S6529]]\n\nmuch I appreciate his sensitivity to the problems we have in my State, \nparticularly in regard to cleanup of Rocky Flats.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say to Senator Allard and to the \npeople of your State, because the community of interests have come \ntogether--and much of that is attributable to your leadership--we are \nnow able to say to all of the country that we finally have one of these \nsites that must be cleaned up, that has a date, a date certain, that it \nwill be cleaned up. Now, that is a rarity.\n  If the American people knew how long it takes us to clean up one of \nthese sites because of a variety of reasons--some of which are not very \ngood, yet we are stuck with them--they would be delighted, as I am, \nthat we now have one that can be cleaned up and completed and we can \nsay this is part of history in that area, and the surrounding \ncommunities are rid of this waste.\n  We saw that daylight, and we put in extra money. We are not \napologetic in a tight budget year to say we put more in because we have \nto have some successes. We are busy spending our taxpayers dollars in \nprojects of cleanup that we cannot even tell you will ever get cleaned \nup. Some of the things causing that we can't even change here on the \nfloor of the Senate unless we go back and undo State law and have more \nhearings and look at contracts. Maybe that ought to be done, because \nthere is a bit of irrationality regarding some of the projects of \ncleanup that now turn out to be situations where, when the project was \nin full bloom and operating to produce whatever it was producing for \nthe nuclear deterrent system, they had fewer workers then than they \nhave cleaning up. The Senator probably found that in his research as he \nfamiliarized himself with this particular dilemma.\n  I am very pleased that people like you went to the community and \nclearly indicated that there aren't a lot of options. If they don't \nwant to let some of these things happen, it will all stay there. You \ntold me that. You took the lead in convincing many people that those \nwho didn't want one thing done, unless it was absolutely beyond \nperfection, with no possible risks involved for anyone or anything, \nthat we wouldn't move a bit of this waste under those conditions. I \nlaud you for that. I am glad we found money to put in to take care of \nit quickly.\n  Mr. ALLARD. If the Senator will yield for a moment, I will do \neverything in my power to make sure this money is spent wisely on that \nproject. We are trying, through our office, to make sure it is well \nspent. My commitment to you is, we are working hard to help you in \noverseeing that it is spent responsibly.\n  Again, we appreciate your sensitivity to the urgency of this \nmatter. And like you, I hope that when we get this cleaned up, we can \nagain clean up sites all over the country with similar situations. I \nappreciate the high priority you have given this particular site. I \nthank the chairman.\n\n  (Mr. SMITH of Oregon assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we want to say to the leadership of the \nSenator's community there in his State, at least you understand we \ndon't have a clean project that is going to go on forever. We are not \npast that stage in some areas. Some people think that paychecks by the \nhundreds of millions ought to be coming on for another 100 years. I \ndon't know how we are going to be able to do that. Costs will keep \ngoing up. We have to find some satisfactory ways, with our \nintelligence, science, and innovation, to do some of these things \nbetter. That is what is happening there.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Michigan \nwants to state the purpose for going into morning business. Does he \nwant 5 minutes as if in morning business, or 10 minutes?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I respond. Earlier today a resolution was \nintroduced to commemorate the victory of the Detroit Red Wings. I would \nlike to complete the action on that, and if we had 5, no more than 10 \nminutes, certainly this would be done.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Michigan have up to 10 minutes for the purpose he just stated, and \nthen, after that time has expired, we return to the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6524-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6529-S6530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONGRATULATING THE DETROIT RED WINGS ON WINNING THE 1998 NATIONAL \n                 HOCKEY LEAGUE STANLEY CUP CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 251, which was \nintroduced earlier today by Senator Levin on his behalf and my behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 251) to congratulate the Detroit Red \n     Wings on winning the 1998 National Hockey League Stanley Cup \n     Championship and proving themselves to be one of the best \n     teams in NHL history.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I was initially going to seek to dispense \nwith the reading of the resolution. But it sounds so good that I could \nnot help to want to hear and allow our gallery to hear, as well, those \nwords.\n  We in Michigan, and hockey fans, I think, throughout the world, are \nexcited by the victory Tuesday night of the Detroit Red Wings in the \nStanley Cup hockey finals.\n  Earlier today, Senator Levin, on his behalf and my own, introduced a \nresolution to commemorate that victory. I will not take the time of the \nSenate to read the entire text of that resolution again. But I would \nlike to stand here today to acknowledge and express the pride that he \nand I and the Detroit Red Wings fans, not only in Michigan but \neverywhere else, have as the team on Tuesday won its second consecutive \nStanley Cup hockey championship.\n  Last Friday, I had the opportunity to host the visit of the Stanley \nCup itself to the Senate. We had the chance to share with our \ncolleagues a little bit about the history of that most ancient trophy, \nwhich commemorates each year the winner of hockey's ultimate \nchampionship.\n  As I say, this is the second straight year that championship has been \nwon by the Detroit Red Wings. It is also the second straight year that \nthe Red Wings have won the championship with a four-game sweep, clearly \nan indication of the talent and the abilities of this team.\n  I think this year's victory was also special for a variety of other \nreasons that I would like to mention.\n  First, as evident throughout the season and certainly during the \nfinal days of the playoffs, this victory was special because of the \npresence in the players' spirits and minds, and then ultimately at the \narena itself, of Vladimir Konstantinov, one of the stars of last year's \nchampionship who was innocently the victim of an auto accident and \ninjury that made it impossible for him to play this year. We all wish \nhim a speedy recovery, although he is still wheelchair bound.\n\n  It was a special win because the players dedicated the season to him \nand to the team trainer, Sergei Mnatsakanov, who likewise had been \ninjured in that automobile accident.\n  It marked the eighth straight Stanley Cup victory for Scotty Bowman, \nand that ties him with his mentor, Toe Blake, for the most victories of \nthis championship in the history of the NHL.\n  It was a special victory because team captain Steve Yzerman, in his \n15th season, was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy, which is a trophy that \ngoes to the most valuable player in the playoffs. Those of us who have \nfollowed Red Wing hockey throughout that time\n\n[[Page S6530]]\n\nknow just how much he has meant not only to Detroit hockey but hockey \nin the NHL, one of the great players of all time.\n  We in Michigan refer to Detroit as ``Hockeytown U.S.A.'' That has \nbeen our designation, but I think this victory, coupled with last \nyear's victory, will make it clear, to everyone who may have had some \ndoubts as to where the ultimate center of hockey spirit in this country \nis, that at least until they are dethroned, Detroit, MI, is that center \nand the Detroit Red Wings are the team that deserve the accolades they \nwere able to achieve on Tuesday night.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the resolution and \npreamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the resolution be \nprinted in the Record at the appropriate place as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 251), with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 251\n\n       Whereas on June 16, 1998, the Detroit Red Wings defeated \n     the Washington Capitals, 4-1, in Game 4 of the championship \n     series;\n       Whereas this victory marks the second year in a row that \n     the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup in a four game sweep;\n       Whereas the Stanley Cup took its first trip around the rink \n     in the lap of Vladimir Konstantinov, the Red Wings defenseman \n     who was seriously injured in an accident less than a week \n     after Detroit won the Cup last year;\n       Whereas Vladi and his wife Irina, whose strength and \n     courage are a source of pride and inspiration to our entire \n     community are an exemplary Red Wings family and Vladi's \n     battle is an inspiration to all Americans;\n       Whereas Marian and Mike Ilitch, the owners of the Red Wings \n     and community leaders in Detroit and Michigan, have brought \n     the Stanley Cup back to Detroit yet again;\n       Whereas the Red Wings, as one of the original six NHL \n     teams, have always held a special place in the hearts of all \n     Michiganders;\n       Whereas it was a profound source of pride for Detroit when \n     the Wings brought the Cup back to Detroit in 1954 and 1955, \n     the last time the Wings won consecutive NHL championships;\n       Whereas today, Detroit continues to provide Red Wings fans \n     with hockey greatness and Detroit, otherwise known as \n     ``Hockeytown, U.S.A.'' is home to the most loyal fans in the \n     world;\n       Whereas the Red Wings are indebted to Head Coach Scotty \n     Bowman, who has brought the Red Wings to the playoffs 3 times \n     in the last 4 years, and with this year's victory, has earned \n     his eighth Stanley Cup victory, tying him with his mentor Toe \n     Blake for the most championships in league history;\n       Whereas the Wings are also lucky to have the phenomenal \n     leadership of Team Captain Steve Yzerman, who in his \n     fifteenth season in the NHL, received the Conn Smythe Trophy, \n     given to the most valuable player in the NHL playoffs;\n       Whereas each one of the Red Wings will be remembered on the \n     premier sports trophy, the Stanley Cup, including Slava \n     Fetisov, Bob Rouse, Nick Lidstrom, Igor Larionov, Mathieu \n     Dandenault, Slava Kozlov, Brendan Shanahan, Dmitri Mironov, \n     Doug Brown, Kirk Maltby, Steve Yzerman, Martin Lapointe, Mike \n     Knuble, Darren McCarty, Joe Kocur, Aaron Ward, Chris Osgood, \n     Kevin Hodson, Kris Draper, Jamie Macoun, Brent Gilchrist, \n     Anders Eriksson, Larry Murphy, Sergei Federov, and Tomas \n     Holmstrom: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the U.S. Senate congratulates the Detroit \n     Red Wings on winning the 1998 National Hockey League Stanley \n     Cup Championship.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I again thank the Senator from New Mexico \nfor giving us the chance to do this today. I appreciate his indulgence. \nI thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call for the regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2713\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is amendment No. 2713.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection to Senator Inouye's amendment No. \n2713.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2713) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is it correct \nthat the Coats amendment is now the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask Senator Coats what is his \npleasure.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we are awaiting word from New Jersey, one \nof the States that is affected by this amendment, an exporting State. \nWe are assured that we will have an answer one way or the other. It \nreally rests in their hands. I think we have consensus to go forward, \nbut there seems to be a problem with that State. I see the Senators \nfrom those States now. I think we will be able to give an answer very \nshortly.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I can say to my friend, the manager of \nthe bill--and I say this with some reluctance because I have such great \nrespect for the junior Senator from Indiana--I have received calls from \nConnecticut, Montana, and there are others----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Illinois.\n  Mr. REID. Illinois. I think the New Jersey problem is not the \nproblem. There are many problems related to this. This is not going to \ngo away. I wish I had better news, but we have a number of States that \nare very concerned about this.\n  If I can get the attention of the Senator from Indiana, I do not \nthink the Senator from Indiana heard what I said. I say this with the \ngreatest respect for my friend from Indiana, we have not only received \ncalls from the New Jersey delegation, but have received calls from \nIllinois, Montana, Connecticut. Some people may not have a concern with \nthis bill but have one of their own dealing with the transportation of \nwaste, trash. I just have told them to stay in their offices until we \nsee if we can get this worked out. I am really concerned about this \nkind of bogging things down, for lack of a better description.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I had a discussion earlier with the Senator \nfrom New Mexico. I had a discussion with the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. I told the Senator from New Mexico that it is \nnot my intention to bog down this bill. I understand the dilemma the \nSenate is in due to the 4 weeks we spent on the tobacco bill without \nresolution. We have appropriations bills that need to move.\n  I assured the Senator from New Mexico that it was not my intent to do \nthis. I was operating on the assumption that the agreement that we so \ntorturously reached in 1996, that received the unanimous support of \nevery Senator, including the Senators from New York and the Senators \nfrom New Jersey, including the Senators from Illinois and exporting \nStates, after days and weeks and months of negotiations, that that \nwould still be operative.\n  Now it seems that everything has changed. I am not going to insist on \nmy rights to allow this amendment to tie up this appropriations bill. I \nthink there is important work in the Senate that needs to be done. I \nwill just say to my fellow Senators, this is an issue that is not going \nto go away. I said it in 1990. I have said it every year since. It has \npassed the Senate five times, sometimes by unanimous consent, sometimes \nby 94 votes.\n  Importing States are at a tremendous disadvantage, and they have no \nsay in the ways in which they can manage their own environmental \ndestiny as it regards municipal solid waste. Exporting States can \ncontinue to make promises about what they are going to do. The fact of \nthe matter is they apparently are not delivering on those promises. We \nwere assured time after\n\n[[Page S6531]]\n\ntime that if they just bought a little more time, they would achieve \nthe capacity necessary to deal with their own waste, but they found it \nconvenient to ship it somewhere else so that somebody else can deal \nwith their problems.\n  It appears now that the evidence is in that they are not doing \nanything to deal with their own waste, and that puts those of us who \nare importing States at a great disadvantage. By the way, that is 31 \nStates.\n  We agreed we are going to continue to work on this. We will continue \nto work on this. We will attempt to achieve another consensus so that \nwe can move this legislation, but, in the meantime, I think it is \nimportant that we go ahead with other work in the Senate that has been \nplanned.\n  With that in mind, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 2716, as modified) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana, the \nvery distinguished Senator from Indiana. I thank him personally for \naccommodating us today. I think he does make a point, and maybe he \nshould not give up, because it seems to me, with a little bit of \nnegotiation--this catches some people by surprise--but we have cleared \nthat very bill--well, it was an amendment when we cleared it. We had \ntaken it to the House and had trouble in the House with it. Clearly, we \nhaven't had problems in the Senate. The situation is such that somebody \ncan talk on it and not let us vote. The distinguished Senator from \nIndiana agrees with the Senator from New Mexico--and I thank him for \nthat--that we ought to proceed and finish this bill. That is what he \nhas done. I very much appreciate it, and the Senate appreciates it.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I can also elaborate on what my friend, \nthe manager of the bill, has said, there is no Senator in this body who \nhas been more diligent on an issue than has the Senator from Indiana \nbeen on this issue of transportation of waste. He has rendered a great \nservice not only to the people of the State of Indiana, but this \ncountry. I join in his appreciation for the Senator from Indiana \nallowing this bill to move forward.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have one amendment that is working \nits way through the clearance process, but it has not been cleared yet. \nHaving said that, it is my understanding that there is no amendment \npending at this point, is that correct, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 2717 through 2725, en bloc\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send to the desk nine amendments and \nask that they be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes \n     amendments numbered 2717 to 2725, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

No objection.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No objection on your side?\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendments, en bloc.\n  Without objection, the amendments are agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2717 through 2725), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senators from New \nMexico and Nevada for including an idea that I proposed in the \nmanagers' amendment to the energy and water appropriations bill. I am \nconfident that together we will lessen the risk that former Soviet \nscientists will help any rogue state to build nuclear, chemical or \nbiological weapons.\n  This amendment does two things. First, it earmarks an additional $15\n\n[[Page S6532]]\n\nmillion for the Department of Energy's Initiative for Proliferation \nPrevention, or IPP, program which was unfairly cut from the President's \nbudget request. And second, it earmarks start-up funds for the \n``nuclear cities'' initiative that was endorsed by both Vice President \nAl Gore and Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin.\n  Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention, or IPP, is a program that \ncreates employment opportunities for former Soviet arms specialists by \nhelping them develop their ideas for commercially viable goods and \nservices. As an idea reaches fruition, IPP brings the arms specialists \ninto joint ventures with outside investors, who gradually take over the \nfunding. For example, thanks to IPP, a U.S. firm is working with \nUkrainian scientists to develop and market a device for decontaminating \nliquids. This device will enable the Ukrainian dairy industry to \nproduce fresh milk despite the lingering effects of the Chernobyl \nreactor meltdown.\n  IPP had a slow start. It is hard to come up with really viable \ncommercial ventures, to find investors, and to make sure they can \ninvest safely.\n  The executive branch thought that IPP had unspent funds from past \nyears. So they cut its budget by 50 percent--down from $30 million to \n$15 million.\n  But IPP has begun to take off. As of this April, 15 projects had \nachieved completely commercial funding and 77 had found major private \ncofunding. As a result, IPP does not have unobligated funds lying \naround.\n  Now is not the time to cut the IPP program. Rather, we should \nencourage IPP and the many weapons specialists in the former Soviet \nUnion who are searching for new careers in the civilian economy, by \nmaintaining IPP's funding stream.\n  The ``nuclear cities'' initiative is an effort to improve employment \nopportunities for Russian personnel from their nuclear weapons labs and \nmanufacturing facilities. This initiative, too, will focus on finding \ncommercially viable projects and bringing in outside investors. The \nchallenge is to find projects that can work at these somewhat isolated \ncities, which are more or less the Russian equivalent of Los Alamos.\n  When we fun the ``nuclear cities'' initiative, we get two benefits. \nFirst, Russia's Minister of Atomic Energy has announced that they will \ndownsize their nuclear weapons establishment. And second, by providing \ncivilian job opportunities for the personnel who are let go, we will \nhelp protect against Russian weapons specialists going off to work for \nprograms in states like Iran, Iraq or Libya.\n  The ``nuclear cities'' initiative was developed by a group of U.S. \nand Russian specialists, and was endorsed at the last meeting of the \nGore-Chernomyrdin commission. Later this spring, Energy Secretary Pena \nand Russian Atomic Energy Minister Adamov also endorsed it.\n  According to the group that developed this new initiative, it can \nusefully spend up to $30 million in fiscal year 1999. I don't know how \nmuch the executive branch will want to devote to ``nuclear cities,'' \nbut my amendment gives them the opportunity to fund a realistic \nprogram.\n   By earmarking funds both for the ''nuclear cities'' initiative and \nfor the IPP program, moreover, we make sure that the price of the new \ninitiative will not be the death an existing program. If there is clear \noverlap between the IPP program and the ``nuclear cities'' initiative, \nsuch overlap should be eliminated. But I have the distinct impression \nthat there are excellent IPP projects that will have nothing to do with \nRussia's ``nuclear cities,'' and such projects should not be \nsacrificed.\n  Once again, I thank and congratulate the senior Senator from New \nMexico and the senior Senator from Nevada. They have given us a fine \nexample of bipartisan cooperation and effectiveness.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Fiscal Year \n1999 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill. This is a bill \nthat addresses many of our Nation's most critical water infrastructure \nrequirements, as well as important energy research functions, and \nmanagement of our nuclear waste and environmental remediation programs. \nThis bill is also a component of our national security portfolio, due \nto the atomic weapons production programs of the Department of Energy \nthat are funded in this bill.\n  In approving the recommendations of the subcommittee, the committee \nhas reported a bill that does an excellent job of balancing the many \ncompeting demands which fall within the jurisdiction of the Energy and \nWater Development Subcommittee. I wish to commend the subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Domenici, for all his hard work in crafting the bill \nbrought before the Senate, together with his very able counterpart, \nSenator Reid. While both of these Senators come from the arid west, \nwhere the water management issues are very different from the \nchallenges facing other regions of the country, they have been very \nresponsible in trying to maintain critical investments in flood control \nand navigation and irrigation, while also ensuring that our energy \nresearch and nuclear waste management and weapons production \nresponsibilities are met.\n  Their task was made particularly difficult this year by the \ndisgraceful budget request for Fiscal Year 1999 put forward by the \nadministration for the Army Corps of Engineers. Despite strong support \nfor an aggressive Corps construction program from both sides of the \naisle and all regions of the country, the administration proposed a \nsignificant reduction in spending for Corps construction--some $689 \nmillion, or 47 percent, below last year's funding level.\n  This budget gap created a huge hole that needed to be filled, and I \ncommend our committee chairman, Senator Stevens, for his sensitivity to \nthe challenges presented to the Energy and Water Development \nSubcommittee by the President's request. Senator Stevens knows all too \nwell the value and need for critical infrastructure investments that \nwill help communities enhance their economic opportunity. I was pleased \nto join with the chairman in recommending a 302(b) allocation to the \nEnergy and Water Development Subcommittee which was substantially above \nthe President's request and above a freeze for the non-defense \ndiscretionary portion. Nonetheless, the requests for funding far \nexceeded the subcommittee's allocation.\n  Nearly every state had ongoing water projects that the Corps \nexpressed a capability of being able to execute at a program level far \nin excess of the President's request. So to try and maintain ongoing \nprojects, as well as to protect investments, funding was added to many \nof these projects. The costs associated with the administration's \nshort-sighted proposal were considerable. Not only would there have \nbeen increased costs due to the additional time it would have taken to \ncomplete projects, but there would also have been considerable contract \ntermination costs associated with ending or reducing work that had been \ninitiated recently.\n  So I commend the subcommittee members for their fine work. Their \nresponsiveness to local concerns will mean a great deal to the \ncommunities in my state that were on the short end of the \nadministration's budget. In places like Marmet, the Greenbrier Basin, \nand the Tug Fork Valley, where people have been waiting years for \nassistance from the Federal government to improve upon flood control \nand enhance navigation channels that feed our economy, this bill will \nbe of great assistance. I have seen the mud, muck, and misery that \naccompany flooding when the waters rise in the creeks and streams and \nrivers that flow through the mountains of West Virginia. Some criticize \nthese types of projects. I contend that they are critical to improving \nthe lives and enhancing the safety of our constituents.\n  Mr. President, as is true with most appropriations bills, not every \nSenator has 100 percent of his or her priorities addressed fully. That \nis the very essence of compromise and balance, which are at the center \nof what it takes to produce an acceptable, and signable, appropriations \nbill. The President, in gutting the Corps' construction program, \nproposed significant increases to programs favored by the \nadministration. But every Senator should be clear that, to pay for \nthose increases, the President proposed reductions in funding requested \nfor flood protection and other water infrastructure development. I \ncommend Senator Domenici and Senator Reid for trying to maintain \nstability across the multitude of programs funded in this bill.\n\n[[Page S6533]]\n\n  Finally, I wish to acknowledge the very fine work done on this \nappropriations bill by the majority and minority staff of the Energy \nand Water Development Subcommittee--Alex Flint, David Gwaltney, Greg \nDaines, Liz Blevins, Lashawnda Leftwich, and Sue Masica. There are many \ndetails associated with all of the water projects and energy research \nitems in this bill, and this team does an excellent job of serving not \nonly Senators Domenici and Reid, but also all other Senators.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few comments \nconcerning S. 2138, the Fiscal Year 1999 Energy and Water Development \nAppropriation Bill.\n  The West Columbus Floodwall Project is an extremely important \ninfrastructure project currently under development by the City of \nColumbus and the Army Corps of Engineers. Once completed this project \nwill protect over 2,800 acres of urban development, and approximately \n6,200 homes and businesses. Construction of this $118 million project \nwas initiated in 1993 and was on schedule and budget for completion in \n2002.\n  The fiscal year 1999 civil works budget request for the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers provided only $1.8 million for continued \nconstruction of this important project. The Committee increased the \nfiscal year 1999 funding to a total $7.5 million. Although I am \ngrateful for the Committee's action, I am concerned because this \nproject requires $16 million to keep it on track and moving forward.\n  Mr. President, this project is unlike a lot of other flood projects \nin that it does not provide vitally needed flood protection for West \nColumbus until it is fully completed. Funding for this project at less \nthan $16 million could delay it for up to one year and this area will \ncontinue to be exposed to an increased potential for flood damages of \nup to $455 million. In addition, the homeowners and businesses in this \narea will face continued zoning restrictions, and development of 2800 \nacres will be delayed.\n  The city of Columbus has been damaged in the past by severe flooding \nof the Scioto River, which runs through the heart of its downtown. In \n1913, 1937 and 1959, the city was devastated by flood disasters \nresulting in millions of dollars in damage to commercial and \nresidential property, destruction of homes and businesses, and the loss \nof many lives. In 1990 and 1992, the city again experienced serious \nflood scares. If the West Columbus project were in place during \nprevious recent flood events, damages would have been prevented.\n  Mr. President, during the December 1990 rainfall and flood event, \ninundation and localized flood damages occurred in the Phase 1B/\nMcKinley Avenue area. The Scioto River rose to a flood level \napproaching a 20-year frequency. If the project features had been in \nplace at that time, the interior runoff would have drained to the \nstormwater pump station ST-8 and would have been pumped out of the \ninterior. Instead, an existing storm sewer flap gate was held shut by \nthe high Scioto River flood stage, preventing the interior runoff from \ndraining to the river. Adjacent businesses were flooded until the \nScioto River receded to a level that permitted the flap gate to open \nand allow interior runoff to drain to the river.\n  During the July 1992 storm, rainfall in excess of 4 inches fell over \nthe interior area along with a moderate rise in the Scioto River. An \nexisting storm sewer flap gate was held shut and interior runoff could \nnot drain to the river. If the proposed Dodge Park stormwater pump \nstation had been available, it could have pumped excess runoff to the \nriver, thus preventing flood damages that occurred along Rich Street.\n  Mr. President, I understand that sufficient funding was not available \nfor the many critically needed flood protection projects contained in \nthis bill. For this reason I will not offer an amendment, however, I \nthought it was important to express my concerns and address the \npotential impacts of not funding this project at the required level of \n$16 million. I am pleased that the House was able to fully fund this \nproject in their bill and it is my hope that during Conference, the \nSenate will recede to the House's position and provide $16 million for \nthe West Columbus Floodwall Project.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern about the \nportion of this bill dealing with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \nand particularly the Committee report. While I appreciate that Senators \nDomenici and Reid have made very significant changes to an earlier \nversion of the report, I remain troubled.\n  Let me say first that I am a supporter of nuclear energy. I believe \nit can be part of the solution to solving the world's energy, \nenvironment and global warming problems. But in order for there to be a \nfuture for this industry, it is critical for the public to maintain \nconfidence in the industry--a confidence that must be supported by a \nstrong, competent and effective Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  I do not believe that the current NRC over-regulates, inspects too \nmuch, enforces too much or has adopted an overly restrictive body of \nregulations. I base this conclusion on the extensive oversight I \nconducted as chairman during the 103rd Congress of the Clean Air and \nNuclear Regulation subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee; the oversight work I have conducted during the last three \nyears as a member of the Environment Committee, particularly growing \nout of my concern about the shutdown of Connecticut's nuclear power \nplants; and two extensive reports prepared for me by the General \nAccounting Office.\n  In fact, I believe that as a result of new safety initiatives \nundertaken by NRC Chairman Jackson, such as: limiting inappropriate use \nof enforcement discretion; requiring utilities to verify whether they \nare operating in accordance with their design basis; undertaking a \nreview of NRC oversight of changes made by utilities without prior NRC \napproval; improving the inspection process;, increased attention to use \nof quantitative performance indicators; and reforms of the senior \nmanagement oversight process, the NRC has finally moved toward \nregaining some of the public confidence which is so important. Also \ncritical to restoring this confidence has been Chairman Jackson's \nopenness and responsiveness to the public, including whistleblowers. \nMany of these initiatives came in response to a very unfortunate \nsituation in Connecticut, where the nuclear power plants were shut down \nand put on the NRC Watch List of most troubled plants.\n  I appreciate that the Appropriations Committee believes that there \nshould be an in-depth review of the NRC. As a member of the Senate \nEnvironment Committee with authorization oversight responsibilities, I \nhave been urging the Committee to conduct hearings on the NRC since the \nstart of the Congress. In particular, I have urged the Committee to \nhold a hearing to examine the issues raised in two General Accounting \nOffice reports : one prepared for Senator Biden and me, Nuclear \nRegulation: Preventing Problem Plants Requires More Effective NRC \nAction, and one prepared for Congressman Dingell and me on \nwhistleblower protections.\n  The GAO raised serious concerns about instances in the past in which \nthe NRC has neither taken aggressive enforcement action nor held \nnuclear plant licensees accountable for correcting their problems on a \ntimely basis. The GAO criticized the NRC for problems in the inspection \nprocess, such as not including timetables for the completion of \ncorrective action and for not evaluating the competency of the \nlicensees' plant managers as part of the on-going inspection process. \nIn addition, the GAO found that the senior management meeting, designed \nto focus attention on those plants with declining safety performance, \nwas not serving its goal of being an early warning tool.\n  To her credit, Chairman Jackson has responded to many of these GAO \nrecommendations positively and swiftly. Nevertheless, oversight \nhearings are needed to evaluate the NRC's responses.\n  Finally, although I appreciate that the Committee increased the NRC's \nfunding levels from the subcommittee's approach and eliminated any \ndirections to cut nuclear reactor safety, I am still concerned that the \nbill includes $17.3 million less in funding than the NRC's budget \nrequest. I think a more prudent approach would be to have a detailed \ndiscussion of the NRC's proposed initiatives in the authorizing\n\n[[Page S6534]]\n\nEnvironment Committee to avoid any negative impact on the NRC's ability \nto maintain a strong, healthy regulatory program for nuclear power \nplants or to limit any new initiatives that the NRC believes are \nimportant. In the 103rd Congress, I was pleased that we were able to \nreport an authorizing bill for the NRC, but unfortunately it did not \nbecome law. We need to move forward again with such a bill.\n\n\n           tooele city wastewater treatment and reuse project\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, the Chairman of the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee, a question related to a project in my State. Am I correct \nin stating that the bill before the Senate today contains $3 million in \nfunding for the Tooele City Wastewater Treatment and Reuse Project?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from New \nMexico's support for this project. I have recently become aware of a \nproblem with this project related to the Bureau of Reclamation's \ninterpretation of the project's authorization which I hope we can \nclarify. As the Senator knows, I am a strong advocate for the concept \nof water recycling and reuse. In arid States such as ours we simply \nhave to make every gallon of available water stretch as far as we can. \nIt is for that reason that I sponsored the legislation that eventually \nbecame Public Law 104-266. The passage of that legislation expanded the \nBureau of Reclamation's water recycling program and authorized the \nTooele City project. Under this program the Bureau is authorized to \ncontribute up to twenty-five percent of the cost of planning, designing \nand constructing water recycling and reuse projects.\n  The Tooele Wastewater Treatment and Reuse project is designed to \nreclaim 2.25 million gallons of effluent daily and utilized the \nreclaimed water for a variety of non-potable uses permitted by Utah \nState law. Unlike some other States, Utah permits the utilization of \nwater treated to secondary--as opposed to advanced secondary or \ntertiary--standards for certain non-potable uses. In formulating the \nTooele project, the City has always anticipated the utilization of \nsecondary effluent in conformance with State law. Now the Bureau of \nReclamation has informed the City that it will not provide funds \nappropriated by Congress for that portion of the Tooele project that \nprovides secondary treatment. I have searched the authorizations for \nthe Title XVI program and the Tooele project high and low and can not \nfind a statutory basis for the Bureau's position. Had Congress wished \nto limit the use of title XVI funds in this manner, it certainly could \nhave done so. It did not.\n  Mr. President, I remain hopeful that we can resolve this matter \nbefore this bill goes to Conference. However, in the event that we are \nnot successful, I would like to ask the Chairman to entertain the \npossibility of Conference Report language, if necessary, to clarify \nthis matter.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate the Senator from Utah's concerns. I would \nbe happy to work with him to resolve this issue.\n\n\n                               Rodeo Lake\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise for a brief colloquy with the \nmanager of the bill. I would like to thank the chairman for his \ngenerous work to fund the Rodeo Lake project near Othello, Washington. \nThis project will help alleviate a serious flooding problem in Central \nWashington state. There has been some confusion, however, regarding the \nCorps of Engineers' involvement in the project. I understand that, \nbecause of the water at Rodeo Lake directly affects projects maintained \nby the Bureau of Reclamation, the committee intends for the Corps to \ncoordinate its efforts with the Bureau of Reclamation. Is my \ndescription of the committee's intentions correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Chairman for the clarification and for the \nhard work on this bill.\n\n\n                       devils lake, north dakota\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, page 44 of the committee report \naccompanying S. 2138, the fiscal 1999 Energy and Water Development \nAppropriation bill, includes a section on funding provided in the bill \nfor construction of a flood control outlet at Devils Lake, North \nDakota. At the end of the short section, the committee report states \nthat, ``[i]t is expected that such circumstances would also be such \nthat granting of a waiver under the emergency provision of the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act would be appropriate and that the provision of \nthe 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty would be met.''\n  I am trying to understand how this report language corresponds with \nlanguage in the bill for Devils Lake. As reported by the committee, \npages 6 and 7 of the bill lay out a detailed set of rigorous criteria \nthat must be met before any funds can be obligated by the Secretary for \nactual construction of the outlet. Two of those criteria, full \ncompliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the \n1909 Boundary Waters Treaty seem to be preempted by the committee in \nthis report. I ask the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Subcommittee, Senator Domenici, if the committee report \nlanguage in any way supercedes the bill language? Moreover, is the \ncommittee attempting to provide a waiver or some form of relief under \nNEPA or the Boundary Waters Treaty?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his continued \ninterest and involvement in the Devils Lake matter. The answer to both \nof the Senator's questions is ``no.'' The bill language that you cited, \nwhich was originally negotiated by the two of us, Senator Bond and our \ncolleagues from North Dakota last year, would be fully applicable. The \ncommittee report does not waive NEPA, the Boundary Waters Treaty or any \nof the other conditions found in the bill language. In summary, the \nExecutive Branch would need to fulfill the economic and technical \njustifications, the reporting and budgeting requirements, as well as \nthe NEPA and Boundary Waters Treaty terms, before any of the \nappropriated funds can be expended for outlet construction. The report \nlanguage signals our expectation that the Executive Branch would make \nfull use of the emergency provision currently available under NEPA and \nthat all steps would be taken to expeditiously fulfill the requirements \nof the Boundary Waters Treaty in the event that rising lake levels \nwarrant accelerated construction of the outlet.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I appreciate my colleague's clarification. I chaired a \nhearing on Devils Lake before the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks late last year and am committed to addressing the terrible \nflooding problems experienced there. However, I am convinced that the \npeople of North Dakota, Minnesota, Canada, and the U.S. taxpayers will \nall be served more effectively if we go about this project in the right \nway. To do that, we need the appropriate reviews, studies and \njustifications by the Army Corps of Engineers, State Department and \nothers. In that context, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \ninclude in the Congressional Record a January 28, 1998, Army Corps \nmemorandum, signed by the then-Acting Assistant Secretary John H. \nZirschky, that details the agency's policy on NEPA compliance and the \nproposed outlet at Devils Lake. I ask unanimous consent that the \nmemorandum be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the memorandum was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of the Army, Office of the Assistant \n           Secretary, Civil Works,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 1998.\n\n\n               memorandum for the director of civil works\n\n     Subject: National Environmental Policy Act Compliance, Devils \n       Lake Outlet, North Dakota\n       The Corps has been working hard to solve the flooding \n     problems at Devils Lake. The St. Paul District has been \n     raising the levees at the city of Devils Lake and the design \n     of an emergency outlet is well underway. I commend your \n     staff, Mississippi Valley Division and the St. Paul District \n     for their accomplishments to date.\n       A statutory requirement for constructing an outlet from \n     Devils Lake is compliance with the National Environmental \n     Policy Act (NEPA). On December 10, 1997, the Corps briefed my \n     staff and a representative of the Office of Management and \n     Budget (OMB) on the proposal for compliance with NEPA. On \n     December 19, 1997, my staff briefed senior\n\n[[Page S6535]]\n\n     staff of the OMB and the White House Council on Environmental \n     Quality (CEQ) on the proposal.\n       The purpose of the December 19, 1997 meeting was to discuss \n     the St. Paul District's ``expedited'' schedule for NEPA \n     compliance. That schedule calls for constructing the outlet \n     before the NEPA process is completed. This is an exception \n     that would require a waiver from the normal NEPA process. \n     While the flooding problem at Devils Lake is an emergency, \n     and while adoption of a NEPA compliance process completed \n     following construction may be necessary at some point in \n     time, the decision to carry out a NEPA process as outlined in \n     the District's ``expedited'' schedule is considered \n     premature. Supporting a waiver at this time is difficult \n     since we have not yet decided to construct the outlet nor \n     have we completed its design. The controversial nature of the \n     outlet project, and the extent of other ongoing activities by \n     the Corps and others to mitigate for the flooding were also \n     factors in this decision.\n       It is critical that the Corps continues to keep this \n     project as a high priority. We should proceed with the \n     planning, NEPA compliance, and design of the outlet as \n     quickly as possible. The studies and report being prepared to \n     comply with the Fiscal Year 1998 Energy and Water Development \n     Appropriations Act should also be expeditiously completed. To \n     ensure that the report complies with the congressional \n     directives, it should be subjected to technical and policy \n     reviews before submitted to this office. We should also \n     continue to budget for the outlet.\n       It is also very important that the NEPA process complies \n     fully with the July 1, 1997, memorandum from the CEQ on \n     transboundary impacts of the outlet project. Likewise, the \n     NEPA process should be undertaken so that it will give us a \n     sound basis for consultation with the International Joint \n     Commission, and with Canada under the ``Boundary Waters \n     Treaty of 1909.''\n       At this time, we should not plan to use a NEPA process that \n     assumes that we construct the outlet before the NEPA process \n     is completed. Our objective is to comply fully with the NEPA \n     by completing the Environmental Impact Statement and Record \n     of Decision using a normal NEPA process. In this regard, on \n     January 12 our staffs developed guidance that allowed the St. \n     Paul District to initiate the NEPA scoping process on January \n     14, 1998. The District should revise the schedule they \n     proposed for the ``normal'' NEPA process, and identify \n     opportunities to complete this work by December 1999. While I \n     understand that the coordination phase of the NEPA process \n     may be time dependent, I believe that ways to shorten the \n     data collection and evaluation phases can be found to shorten \n     the current forty month schedule. Regarding data collection \n     and evaluations, these activities should be programmed in a \n     way that will provide us with increasingly greater levels of \n     detail, so that we can decide, if necessary, to start the \n     outlet at anytime using an emergency NEPA process. Unless an \n     emergency waiver is obtained sooner, we should be in a \n     position to start construction by Spring 2000.\n       The enclosed paper was prepared to help explain the \n     ``Action Plan.'' This plan will allow the Corps to meet its \n     legal obligations, make more informed decisions by maximizing \n     the use of new information on both lake level predictions and \n     environmental impacts, and stay positioned to start \n     construction on the outlet when necessary. I ask that HQUSACE \n     provide the leadership necessary to achieve these objectives.\n                                                 John H. Zirschky,\n         Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works).\n       Enclosure.\n\n   Devils Lake Emergency Outlet, North Dakota National Environmental \n                   Policy Act Compliance Action Plan\n\n       National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance is an \n     integral part of the decision making process for the Devils \n     Lake outlet. To be able to construct the outlet as soon as \n     possible--yet comply fully with NEPA--the Corps will use the \n     following principles:\n\n\n                               Principles\n\n       Reducing flooding at Devils Lake is a high priority for the \n     Administration.\n       Engineering and design work on the outlet will proceed on \n     schedule, allowing the start of construction, if necessary, \n     by May 1999.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Unless otherwise stated, completion and submission dates \n     presented in this paper are those developed by the St. Paul \n     District of the Corps of Engineers. New dates are noted by \n     ``*'' after the date.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       A decision to start construction on the outlet will be \n     based on the best available information and be legally \n     defensible.\n       A decision to start construction will comply with the \n     Fiscal Year 1998 Energy and Water Development Appropriations \n     Act, and other laws and treaties; and\n       National Environmental Policy Act compliance will proceed \n     on a fast track.\n\n\n                              Action Plan\n\n       From an engineering standpoint, the Corps St. Paul District \n     believes it can be in a position to start construction of the \n     outlet by may 1999. To meet this date, the design of the \n     outlet should be completed by August 1998 and pipe should be \n     ordered in October 1998. By August 1998, the Project \n     Cooperation Agreement should be ready to be executed with the \n     State of North Dakota. The State could then be ready to \n     acquire lands needed for the project. The report necessary to \n     comply with the Fiscal Year 1998 Energy and Water Development \n     Appropriations Act is scheduled to be prepared, reviewed and \n     approved in time to be submitted to Congress by August 1998. \n     Plans and specifications are to be completed by march 1999. \n     The Corps would continue to budget for funds for design and \n     construction of the outlet.\n       Regarding the NEPA compliance, several options were \n     considered, including starting construction before the NEPA \n     process is completed. Starting construction before the NEPA \n     process is completed requires a Council of Environmental \n     Quality waiver from the normal NEPA compliance process under \n     the emergency provision of NEPA. Such waivers are unusual and \n     require substantial justification. Without such justification \n     the legal risk would be great given the diverse interest and \n     positions on the outlet. In view of the stipulations in the \n     Fiscal Year 1998 Energy and Water Development Appropriations \n     Act that must be met before construction can be started and \n     that the design of the outlet is not yet complete, we believe \n     that it is premature to make the waiver decision at this time \n     and that we should proceed with the NEPA process. However, in \n     view of the lake level trends of the past few years at Devils \n     Lake, the NEPA review would be expedited, and NEPA compliance \n     activities would be organized in a tiered fashion that will \n     maximize its utility at any given time regarding a decision \n     to start construction on the outlet through the emergency \n     NEPA waiver. This approach should not result in an \n     unacceptable slow down of outlet construction, if necessary, \n     since the engineering and design work will be completed on \n     schedule.\n       The St. Paul District initiated the formal NEPA process on \n     October 21, 1997, and an initial scoping meeting was held on \n     January 14, 1998. unless a waiver from NEPA is needed sooner, \n     the goal is to complete the NEPA process by December 1999*. \n     As noted above, NEPA data collections, evaluations, impact \n     assessments, and coordination activities should be programed \n     to be concurrent, at minimum allowed times, and at \n     increasingly greater degrees of detail, so that we can save \n     time and make more informed and supportable decisions \n     regarding carrying out the outlet under an emergency NEPA \n     process, if necessary. As an example, the question of the \n     need to start construction under an emergency NEPA process \n     can be revisited after the 1998 runoff predictions are \n     released and the Corps has completed the report required by \n     the Fiscal Year 1998 Energy and Water Development \n     Appropriations Act.\n       In summary, this action plan allows the Corps to meet its \n     legal obligations, make more informed decisions by maximizing \n     the use of new information on both lake level predictions and \n     environmental impacts, and stay positioned to start \n     construction on the outlet when necessary.\n           OASA (CW) POC:\n                                                 Michael L. Davis,\n         Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Policy and \n           Legislation).\n                                                   James J.

Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nChairman of the Subcommittee in a colloquy concerning funding for the \nrestoration of Assateague Island National Seashore.\n  I am deeply concerned that the Committee was not able to provide \nfunding for so-called ``new start'' construction projects of the Army \nCorps of Engineers. I understand that the House Committee has also \nadopted a no new starts policy. The Corps of Engineers was scheduled to \ninitiate an authorized and approved mitigation project for the North \nEnd of Assateague Island National Seashore in Fiscal 1999 and without \nfunding, it appears that this project will have to be postponsed. This \nis a particular problem because the northern end of Assateague was hit \nvery hard by two northeastern storms which slammed the mid-Atlantic \ncoast this past February causing severe erosion and overwash \nconditions. In its current condition, the seashore is extremely \nvulnerable to breaching should another storm hit the coast. The \nintegrity of the National Seashore and the area's coastal bays are at \nrisk.\n  Fortunately, the Corps will be able to make emergency repairs to the \nstorm-damaged section under the authority of Public Law 84-99, \nproviding some additional protection to the island over its current \ncondition. But it would be far better if the approved restoration \nproject could be initiated and completed as soon as possible.\n  I recognize the difficult constraints that the Committee faced in \ncrafting this bill but, given the critical nature of this project, I \nask if the Chairman would be willing to work with me and Senator \nMikulski in the Conference Committee to address Assateague's needs \nshould additional funding become available.\n\n[[Page S6536]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Committee understands the importance of this \nproject and will work in Conference to see what develops.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chairman for his consideration of this \nproject. Assateague is one of the most important restoration projects \nin Maryland. The environmental, economic and ecological value of the \nAssateague Seashore is extraordinary. It is not just a Maryland \npriority, it is a national priority.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chairman for these assurances.\n\n\n                   transfer of the st. georges bridge\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am wondering if the Ranking Member of the \nSubcommittee will engage in a colloquy with me regarding the St. \nGeorges Bridge in my State of Delaware.\n  Mr. REID. I would be pleased to yield to my colleague from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my friend. Mr. President, recently in the newly \npassed highway bill, TEA-21, the Secretary of the Army was directed to \ntransfer the right, title and interest of the St. Georges Bridge in \nDelaware, to the State of Delaware. The transfer is necessary to \nfacilitate a retransfer of the bridge to a private entity for the \npurposes of demonstrating the effectiveness of large-scale composites \ntechnology. If the transfer is completed within 180 days the Secretary \nis directed to provide $10,000,000 to the State for rehabilitating the \nbridge.\n  I rise to ask the Senator from Nevada, in his capacity as Ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee, to seek his commitment in working with me \nand the Army Corps of Engineers to ensure that this transfer and the \n$10 million payment occurs as authorized.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I am aware of the transfer of the bridge and the \nprovision in TEA-21. You have my pledge that I will do all I can to see \nthat the Army Corps of Engineers will carry this out as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                     grand prairie region, arkansas\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the senior Senator \nfrom New Mexico in a colloquy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to join the senior Senator from \nArkansas in a colloquy.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, many of us in Arkansas have been working \nfor several years to reverse a critical ground water resource problem \nthat is developing in our region and will ultimately affect the entire \ncountry.\n  Throughout this century, aquifers in the lower Mississippi River \nValley have been falling due to high demand and relatively low \nrecharge. The United States Geological Survey has found that current \ntrends by the year 2015 will reduce the saturated thickness of the \naquifers to the point that soils will begin to compact, recharge will \nnot be possible, and the aquifer will effectively be dead, along with \nnearly half of the U.S. rice industry. Because of the magnitude of this \nproblem, state and local efforts to correct it will never succeed \nwithout assistance from the federal government. In that event, a \nregional economic collapse will occur, a major environmental resource \nwill forever be lost, and our legacy to future generations will carry a \nlasting shadow of irresponsibility.\n  The President's Budget Request provided $11.5 million for the Grand \nPrairie Region. I understand the difficulty the Senate Energy and Water \nAppropriations Subcommittee faced in trying to fund many worthwhile \nprojects. Unfortunately, the Grand Prairie Project was not funded in \nthis bill. It is also my understanding that the House Energy and Water \nAppropriations Bill provides the full Budget Request of $11.5 million \nfor the Grand Prairie project.\n  I ask the Chairman, Senator Domenici, for his support in accepting \nthe House level when this legislation is considered in conference.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from Arkansas for his comments. The \nSenator is correct. The Subcommittee had great difficulty in providing \nfunds for several needed and worthwhile projects. I understand the \nimportance and national significance of the Grand Prairie Project and \npledge my support in conference for Grand Prairie if there are \nsufficient resources.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Chairman for his efforts.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a \ncolloquy. Last year, the Senator and I discussed the energy generation \nproblems facing rural areas of the United States. The Chairman wisely \nincluded funding in the Fiscal Year 1998 Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill to address this problem. In rural areas, energy \ndistribution systems are often more difficult and expensive to \nestablish. As a result, communities are often forced to rely on more \npolluting fuel sources because they have lower up front capital costs. \nThe Jeffords amendment the Chairman accepted this morning increases \nfunding for the Remote Power Initiative to $5 million. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, the Senator is correct. In Fiscal Year 1998 and \n1999 we included funding for the Remote Power Initiative to support \ndeployment of solar, wind, fuel cell, biomass, and other energy \ntechnologies in remote areas to address their energy challenges. Last \nyear, you highlighted the energy demands and environmental constraints \nof ski area operations as one example of this problem facing remote \nareas. As you noted, ski areas in Vermont were one of the leading \nsources of NOx emissions due to use of inefficient and \npolluting diesel engines for operations. This is the kind of problem \nthe subcommittee had in mind when proposing the Remote Power \nInitiative.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I want to thank the Chairman for including funds for the \nRemote Power Initiative again this year. This Initiative offers the \nDepartment of Energy an opportunity to build partnerships with the ski \nindustry to deploy efficient and environmentally-friendly renewable \nenergy technologies to reduce energy use and emissions. Partnerships \ncould also involve environmental technology vendors and service \nproviders who may be interested in cost sharing.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with the Senator from Vermont and believe there \nis a real need to address remote power problems in cold weather areas. \nI support using some of the funds in the Remote Power Initiative for \nthe purposes you described.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chairman and look forward to working with him \nand the Department of Energy to bring together ski operators and the \nrenewable energy technology industry to discuss technology and policy \nissues, and determine appropriate actions and next steps.\n\n\n                        biomass ethanol research\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to ask a question of the \nchairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from New Mexico, and the \nranking member of the subcommittee, the Senator from Nevada; is it the \nunderstanding of the chairman and ranking member that there are enough \nfunds available in the Solar and Renewable Resources Technologies/\nBiofuels Energy Systems account to continue the feasibility study and \nproject development of a biomass ethanol plant in Plumas County, \nCalifornia?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. Funding is available under this bill \nfor the Department of Energy under the Biofuels Energy Systems account \nthat could be used to study the feasibility of the Plumas County \nproject.\n  Mr. REID. That is my view as well. I would urge the DOE to consider \nsupporting this project in fiscal year 1999.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senators.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, it is my understanding that western \nstates and the western electric power industry have been engaged in \nintensive efforts to create a competitive and reliable western \nelectricity market covering all or parts of 14 states, two Canadian \nprovinces and northern Mexico. I believe this is exactly the type of \nlocal cooperative action Congress hoped for in the enactment of the \nEnergy Policy Act of 1992. I ask the Chairman, does the budget contain \nfunds to help western states work with the electric power industry to \npromote competitive and reliable electricity markets in the Western \nInterconnection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Is it the Committee's intent that the Department of \nEnergy is to give priority in the expenditure of such funds to \nassisting western states which are collectively working with the \nindustry on a gridwide basis to promote competitive and reliable \nregional electricity markets?\n\n[[Page S6537]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                   western area power administration\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I understand that the Western Area Power \nAdministration and The Bureau of Reclamation are considering raising \nrates for the power necessary to operate irrigation systems in the \nEastern Division of the Pick-Sloane Missouri Basin Project. The purpose \nof these agencies is not to raise revenue. Rather, these agencies are \ndesigned to provide reliable and affordable power for multi-purpose \neconomic development.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree Senator Burns, affordable power rates for \nirrigation districts are vital to all those living in the western \nUnited States.\n  Mr. BURNS. This is especially true considering the recent drought and \nlow wheat prices that we have been experiencing throughout the region. \nThe farmers in this region simply cannot afford the burden that this \nrate increase will place on them.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that the situation now facing many of \nthese farmers and ranchers is dire. You make a very compelling argument \nagainst raising rates and production costs for an industry that is \nalready facing disaster.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank Senator Domenici for his recognition of this \nproblem. I will fully commit myself to working with him to resolve this \nsituation as soon as possible.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a \ncolloquy. Senator Domenici, I would like to thank you and Senator Reid \nfor your willingness to boost funding for the Department of Energy's \nimportant solar and renewable programs. I am especially pleased to see \nan increase in funding for the biomass energy systems account. In \nVermont, work is continuing at the McNeil Generation Plant in \nBurlington to demonstrate the effectiveness of biomass gasification. \nThis is an important renewable technology which will help our country \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Earlier this year the Department of Energy agreed to a modification \nof the contract for the McNeil project which resulted in a $6 million \nincrease in the Department's contribution to the South Burlington \nfacility. These funds will be matched dollar for dollar by the partners \nwho are participating with DoE in this important renewable program. \nBecause the contract modification was not reached until after the \nPresident had submitted his Fiscal Year 1999 budget proposal, that \nincrease was not reflected in the funding request for the biomass \nenergy systems account. It is my understanding that the increase in \nfunding for biomass energy systems includes the $6 million needed for \nthe Department to meet its obligations under the contract for the \nMcNeil facility.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I concur with the Senator from Vermont as to the \nimportance of the Vermont gasifier. I concur that it would be desirable \nto provide funds for that project. In conference, as we reach agreement \nwith the House on the allocation of funds for Biomass, I will work to \nprovide that funding.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the energy and \nwater development appropriations bill and to take a few moments to \nengage in a colloquy with the chairman of the subcommittee on one of \nthe many important programs being funded in the bill. That would be the \ntechnology transfer and education programs funded under Atomic Energy \nDefense Activities. These programs are an important investment in the \nfuture of the country, by leveraging the facilities, expertise, and R \nresults funded by the Department's defense missions to the benefit of \nbroader national science, technology, and education objectives. We have \nseen some important spin-offs over the years from DOE defense-related \nresearch, and this funding will ensure that we continue to see both \nspin-off and the flow of technology, ideas, and trained personnel into \nthe labs, to the benefit of the Department's important statutory \nmissions.\n  One example of a technology partnership area of importance, and which \nI hope the Department will fully fund in fiscal year 1999, is the \nAdvanced Computational Technology Initiative, or ACTI. The ACTI program \nmakes available to smaller oil and gas producers the computational and \nsimulation resources of the national laboratories. One component of the \nACTI program over the years, the Advanced Reservoir Management program, \nhas funded advances in complex computational database management and \nelectronic information systems that have been of benefit both to the \noil and gas industry and DOE's defense programs.\n  I know that my colleague from New Mexico, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, is a strong supporter of our oil and gas industry. I \nwould urge him to maintain funding of the ACTI program at the level of \nthe President's request as this bill moves forward to conference.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I completely agree with my colleague. We are united in \nour support for the oil and gas industry in New Mexico. The bill that I \nhave brought forward today provides full funding for the ACTI program \nat the President's requested level. The program is one of a series of \ntechnological partnerships between the DOE national laboratories and \nindustry which are producing real value to the U.S. economy. I plan to \nmaintain this strong support for ACTI and other technology partnerships \nat DOE as this bill moves forward to enactment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank my colleague, Senator Inhofe, for engaging in \nthis dialogue to clear up confusion surrounding section 3(b) of S. \n1279, the Indian Employment, Training and Related Services \nDemonstration Act Amendments of 1998.\n  Mr. INHOFE. What exactly does section 3(b) of S. 1279 purport to do?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. It attempts to clarify inconsistencies in implementing \nPublic Law 102-477. Over the past four years, tribes have attempted to \nintegrate both programs into their 477 plans. They have received at \nbest, inconsistent responses from the BIA. On several occasions the \nBureau approved the integration, and other times integration was \nrejected. The Bureau confirmed this confusion at a May 13, 1997 Indian \nAffairs Committee hearing when it submitted conflicting testimony \nregarding its approval of including the JOM program into tribal plans. \nSection 3(b) makes clear that ``at the option of a tribe'' funds under \nboth the General Assistance and Johnson O'Malley programs may be \nintegrated into tribal 477 plans.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Is it true that your bill will not affect in any manner \nthe current regulations and requirements established by the Department \nof the Interior with regard to the Johnson O'Malley program?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. That's correct. In fact, I have here a letter from the \nAssistant Secretary of Indian Affairs, which states that while they \nsupport section 3(b)'s integration of Johnson O'Malley, ``the program \nmust continue to be conducted in accordance with its authorizing \nstatute.'' Another letter dated March 28, 1998 states that the JOM \nparent committee will continue to have the authority to approve and \ndisapprove tribal plans to integrate funds within the 477 program. I \nask unanimous consent that each of these letters be placed in the \nrecord.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Johnson O'Malley program is a supplemental education \nprogram designed to benefit Indian children aged 3 through grade 12 \nattending public schools. I'm concerned that permitting tribes the \noption to use these funds within employment and training plans will \npermit tribes to instead use these funds for post-high school adult \nemployment training programs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I agree with your concern, and that is why I amended \nthe original language of the bill to expressly require tribal \ngovernments wishing to integrate these funds into their 477 programs to \ninclude adequate assurances that such funds will be used only for those \nintended beneficiaries, children aged 3 through grade 12. I would, \nhowever, like to make clear that with the onset of welfare reform upon \nus, tribal governments must be afforded adequate flexibility to \nadminister the limited federal resources available. This bill attempts \nto provide that added flexibility.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank Senator Campbell for clearing up these concerns. \nI'm encouraged by the assurances that the Johnson O'Malley Program will \nnot be adversely affected by this measure.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, S. 2138, the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations Act, 1999, complies with the Budget Act's \nsection\n\n[[Page S6538]]\n\n302(b) allocation of budget authority and outlays.\n  The reported bill provides $20.9 billion in budget authority and \n$13.1 billion in new outlays to fund the civil programs of the Army \nCorps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, certain independent \nagencies, and most of the activities of the Department of Energy. When \noutlays from prior year budget authority and other actions are taken \ninto account, this bill provides a total of $20.7 billion in outlays.\n  For defense discretionary programs, the bill is at its allocation for \nbudget authority and below its allocation for outlays by $2 million. \nThe Senate- reported bill also is below its nondefense discretionary \nallocation by $38 million in budget authority and $1 million under its \nallocation for outlays.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n           S. 2138, ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS, 1999--SPENDING COMPARISONS, SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                                     [Fiscal Year 1999, dollars in millions]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Defense       Nondefense         Crime         Mandatory         Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n    Budget authority............          12,030           8,909  ..............  ..............          20,939\n    Outlays.....................          11,818           8,899  ..............  ..............          20,717\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority............          12,030           8,947  ..............  ..............          20,977\n    Outlays.....................          11,820           8,900  ..............  ..............          20,720\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority............          12,298           9,003  ..............  ..............          21,301\n    Outlays.....................          11,875           9,150  ..............  ..............          21,025\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority............  ..............  ..............  ..............  ..............  ..............\n    Outlays.....................  ..............  ..............  ..............  ..............  ..............\n \n  SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED\n               TO:\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority............  ..............             -38  ..............  ..............             -38\n    Outlays.....................              -2              -1  ..............  ..............              -3\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority............            -268             -94  ..............  ..............            -362\n    Outlays.....................             -57            -251  ..............  ..............            -308\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority............          12,030           8,909  ..............  ..............          20,939\n    Outlays.....................          11,818           8,899  ..............  ..............          20,717\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNOTE.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the passage of \nS. 2138, the FY99 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. In \nparticular, I thank my colleagues for approving $6 million for U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers' funding for the harbor dredge in Portland, \nMaine.\n  I have supported the timely advancement of the harbor dredging \nbecause of public safety and environmental concerns and the project is \nthe top priority for the state. Portland Harbor badly needs dredging, \nand it is to the great credit of the Portland Harbor Dredge Committee, \nmade up of officials from the state, local, not-for-profit agencies and \nthe private sector that the dredging project is now ready to begin, at \nleast a year ahead of what the US Army Corps of Engineers expected. \nCorps officials had already made it clear that the project needed to \nbegin this next winter in order to minimize environmental impacts, but \ncould not be started until environmental determinations were made. The \nDredge Committee, working together since 1994, was successful in \nobtaining the necessary permits, including allowing the bulk of the \ndredged material from Portland Harbor to be deposited at sea.\n  As I pointed out in the Budget Committee back in March when I first \nbrought up the harbor dredging during Budget Reconciliation, the Corps \nproject simply could not wait another year for funding to be included \nin the federal budget. It is to the credit of the state, the \nsurrounding communities and the agencies working for the dredging that \nthe project is ready to begin, and the window for the dredging to occur \nso as to mitigate the environmental risks, according to the Corps, is \nfrom October, 1998 to April, 1999. This should now be possible if the \nSenate funding level is protected in conference with the House.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Domenici and his Appropriations \nSubcommittee for federal funding for the Ft. Fairfield levee in rural \nNorthern Maine, and also for including language in the appropriations \nbill that will allow construction of a levee to protect the town \nagainst further flooding. This Corps small flood control project is \nconsidered essential to the economic survival of Fort Fairfield. The \ntown has experienced severe flooding over the last several years, and \nas recently as two months ago, was once again on emergency alert \nbecause of river flooding, and some senior citizens had to be evacuated \nfrom the their homes.\n  Back in April 1994 alone, flood waters exceeded the 100-year flood \nplain and caused an estimated $7 million in property damages to \nbusinesses and residences. The town is prepared to embark on a \nredevelopment project once a levee has been built to prevent future \nfloods. Once again, we thank the appropriations committee for realizing \nthe importance of the levee to me and to this small rural town in \nNorthern Maine.\n  Mr. REID. The Department of Energy is negotiating a contract \ninvolving the Nevada Test Site and the Western Area Power \nAdministration to purchase 5 to 10 megawatts of solar energy on behalf \nof the Nevada Test Site. A single bidder; the Corporation for Solar \nTechnologies and Renewable Resources, has been selected through a \ncompetitive process and the Department is in the process of determining \non what terms it should enter into such a contract.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I concur with the Senator from Nevada's understanding \nof the current circumstances regarding the status of that contract. I \nunderstand the Department of Energy has engaged in a rigorous review to \ndetermine at what price and for what period of time it should enter \ninto such a contract.\n  Mr. REID. This would be an unusual contract. However, it also offers \nsome tremendous potential. If implemented correctly, this effort could \ndemonstrate the viability of large scale commercial development of \nsolar energy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have reviewed the current situation and have been in \ncontact with senior officials in the Department of Energy who have \nprovided me with assurances that, while unusual, this contract has been \nsubject to rigorous review and, on balance, is worthwhile because of \nthe value that could be derived from demonstrating the use of solar \nenergy on this scale. For this reason, and subject to the continued \nreview of the Department, I am willing to recommend that the Department \nproceed with its negotiations on this contract.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his support of this \ninnovative effort and would also like to note the diligent efforts of \nmy colleague from Nevada, Senator Bryan who has dedicated a great deal \nof attention to this initiative. I concur with the value he sees in \nthis opportunity as well as the value that may accrue to the Nevada \nTest Site in its efforts to identify new missions and responsibilities. \nSolar and renewable energy demonstration is one of those areas for \nwhich the Nevada Test Site has unique national capabilities and I look \nforward to further work in this regard.\n\n[[Page S6539]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6530-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6530-S6539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

If there is no further debate on the \namendment, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2713) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is it correct \nthat the Coats amendment is now the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask Senator Coats what is his \npleasure.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, we are awaiting word from New Jersey, one \nof the States that is affected by this amendment, an exporting State. \nWe are assured that we will have an answer one way or the other. It \nreally rests in their hands. I think we have consensus to go forward, \nbut there seems to be a problem with that State. I see the Senators \nfrom those States now. I think we will be able to give an answer very \nshortly.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I can say to my friend, the manager of \nthe bill--and I say this with some reluctance because I have such great \nrespect for the junior Senator from Indiana--I have received calls from \nConnecticut, Montana, and there are others----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Illinois.\n  Mr. REID. Illinois. I think the New Jersey problem is not the \nproblem. There are many problems related to this. This is not going to \ngo away. I wish I had better news, but we have a number of States that \nare very concerned about this.\n  If I can get the attention of the Senator from Indiana, I do not \nthink the Senator from Indiana heard what I said. I say this with the \ngreatest respect for my friend from Indiana, we have not only received \ncalls from the New Jersey delegation, but have received calls from \nIllinois, Montana, Connecticut. Some people may not have a concern with \nthis bill but have one of their own dealing with the transportation of \nwaste, trash. I just have told them to stay in their offices until we \nsee if we can get this worked out. I am really concerned about this \nkind of bogging things down, for lack of a better description.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I had a discussion earlier with the Senator \nfrom New Mexico. I had a discussion with the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. I told the Senator from New Mexico that it is \nnot my intention to bog down this bill. I understand the dilemma the \nSenate is in due to the 4 weeks we spent on the tobacco bill without \nresolution. We have appropriations bills that need to move.\n  I assured the Senator from New Mexico that it was not my intent to do \nthis. I was operating on the assumption that the agreement that we so \ntorturously reached in 1996, that received the unanimous support of \nevery Senator, including the Senators from New York and the Senators \nfrom New Jersey, including the Senators from Illinois and exporting \nStates, after days and weeks and months of negotiations, that that \nwould still be operative.\n  Now it seems that everything has changed. I am not going to insist on \nmy rights to allow this amendment to tie up this appropriations bill. I \nthink there is important work in the Senate that needs to be done. I \nwill just say to my fellow Senators, this is an issue that is not going \nto go away. I said it in 1990. I have said it every year since. It has \npassed the Senate five times, sometimes by unanimous consent, sometimes \nby 94 votes.\n  Importing States are at a tremendous disadvantage, and they have no \nsay in the ways in which they can manage their own environmental \ndestiny as it regards municipal solid waste. Exporting States can \ncontinue to make promises about what they are going to do. The fact of \nthe matter is they apparently are not delivering on those promises. We \nwere assured time after\n\n[[Page S6531]]\n\ntime that if they just bought a little more time, they would achieve \nthe capacity necessary to deal with their own waste, but they found it \nconvenient to ship it somewhere else so that somebody else can deal \nwith their problems.\n  It appears now that the evidence is in that they are not doing \nanything to deal with their own waste, and that puts those of us who \nare importing States at a great disadvantage. By the way, that is 31 \nStates.\n  We agreed we are going to continue to work on this. We will continue \nto work on this. We will attempt to achieve another consensus so that \nwe can move this legislation, but, in the meantime, I think it is \nimportant that we go ahead with other work in the Senate that has been \nplanned.\n  With that in mind, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 2716, as modified) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana, the \nvery distinguished Senator from Indiana. I thank him personally for \naccommodating us today. I think he does make a point, and maybe he \nshould not give up, because it seems to me, with a little bit of \nnegotiation--this catches some people by surprise--but we have cleared \nthat very bill--well, it was an amendment when we cleared it. We had \ntaken it to the House and had trouble in the House with it. Clearly, we \nhaven't had problems in the Senate. The situation is such that somebody \ncan talk on it and not let us vote. The distinguished Senator from \nIndiana agrees with the Senator from New Mexico--and I thank him for \nthat--that we ought to proceed and finish this bill. That is what he \nhas done. I very much appreciate it, and the Senate appreciates it.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I can also elaborate on what my friend, \nthe manager of the bill, has said, there is no Senator in this body who \nhas been more diligent on an issue than has the Senator from Indiana \nbeen on this issue of transportation of waste. He has rendered a great \nservice not only to the people of the State of Indiana, but this \ncountry. I join in his appreciation for the Senator from Indiana \nallowing this bill to move forward.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have one amendment that is working \nits way through the clearance process, but it has not been cleared yet. \nHaving said that, it is my understanding that there is no amendment \npending at this point, is that correct, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 2717 through 2725, en bloc\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send to the desk nine amendments and \nask that they be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes \n     amendments numbered 2717 to 2725, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

No objection.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No objection on your side?\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendments, en bloc.\n  Without objection, the amendments are agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2717 through 2725), en bloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senators from New \nMexico and Nevada for including an idea that I proposed in the \nmanagers' amendment to the energy and water appropriations bill. I am \nconfident that together we will lessen the risk that former Soviet \nscientists will help any rogue state to build nuclear, chemical or \nbiological weapons.\n  This amendment does two things. First, it earmarks an additional $15\n\n[[Page S6532]]\n\nmillion for the Department of Energy's Initiative for Proliferation \nPrevention, or IPP, program which was unfairly cut from the President's \nbudget request. And second, it earmarks start-up funds for the \n``nuclear cities'' initiative that was endorsed by both Vice President \nAl Gore and Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin.\n  Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention, or IPP, is a program that \ncreates employment opportunities for former Soviet arms specialists by \nhelping them develop their ideas for commercially viable goods and \nservices. As an idea reaches fruition, IPP brings the arms specialists \ninto joint ventures with outside investors, who gradually take over the \nfunding. For example, thanks to IPP, a U.S. firm is working with \nUkrainian scientists to develop and market a device for decontaminating \nliquids. This device will enable the Ukrainian dairy industry to \nproduce fresh milk despite the lingering effects of the Chernobyl \nreactor meltdown.\n  IPP had a slow start. It is hard to come up with really viable \ncommercial ventures, to find investors, and to make sure they can \ninvest safely.\n  The executive branch thought that IPP had unspent funds from past \nyears. So they cut its budget by 50 percent--down from $30 million to \n$15 million.\n  But IPP has begun to take off. As of this April, 15 projects had \nachieved completely commercial funding and 77 had found major private \ncofunding. As a result, IPP does not have unobligated funds lying \naround.\n  Now is not the time to cut the IPP program. Rather, we should \nencourage IPP and the many weapons specialists in the former Soviet \nUnion who are searching for new careers in the civilian economy, by \nmaintaining IPP's funding stream.\n  The ``nuclear cities'' initiative is an effort to improve employment \nopportunities for Russian personnel from their nuclear weapons labs and \nmanufacturing facilities. This initiative, too, will focus on finding \ncommercially viable projects and bringing in outside investors. The \nchallenge is to find projects that can work at these somewhat isolated \ncities, which are more or less the Russian equivalent of Los Alamos.\n  When we fun the ``nuclear cities'' initiative, we get two benefits. \nFirst, Russia's Minister of Atomic Energy has announced that they will \ndownsize their nuclear weapons establishment. And second, by providing \ncivilian job opportunities for the personnel who are let go, we will \nhelp protect against Russian weapons specialists going off to work for \nprograms in states like Iran, Iraq or Libya.\n  The ``nuclear cities'' initiative was developed by a group of U.S. \nand Russian specialists, and was endorsed at the last meeting of the \nGore-Chernomyrdin commission. Later this spring, Energy Secretary Pena \nand Russian Atomic Energy Minister Adamov also endorsed it.\n  According to the group that developed this new initiative, it can \nusefully spend up to $30 million in fiscal year 1999. I don't know how \nmuch the executive branch will want to devote to ``nuclear cities,'' \nbut my amendment gives them the opportunity to fund a realistic \nprogram.\n   By earmarking funds both for the ''nuclear cities'' initiative and \nfor the IPP program, moreover, we make sure that the price of the new \ninitiative will not be the death an existing program. If there is clear \noverlap between the IPP program and the ``nuclear cities'' initiative, \nsuch overlap should be eliminated. But I have the distinct impression \nthat there are excellent IPP projects that will have nothing to do with \nRussia's ``nuclear cities,'' and such projects should not be \nsacrificed.\n  Once again, I thank and congratulate the senior Senator from New \nMexico and the senior Senator from Nevada. They have given us a fine \nexample of bipartisan cooperation and effectiveness.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Fiscal Year \n1999 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill. This is a bill \nthat addresses many of our Nation's most critical water infrastructure \nrequirements, as well as important energy research functions, and \nmanagement of our nuclear waste and environmental remediation programs. \nThis bill is also a component of our national security portfolio, due \nto the atomic weapons production programs of the Department of Energy \nthat are funded in this bill.\n  In approving the recommendations of the subcommittee, the committee \nhas reported a bill that does an excellent job of balancing the many \ncompeting demands which fall within the jurisdiction of the Energy and \nWater Development Subcommittee. I wish to commend the subcommittee \nchairman, Senator Domenici, for all his hard work in crafting the bill \nbrought before the Senate, together with his very able counterpart, \nSenator Reid. While both of these Senators come from the arid west, \nwhere the water management issues are very different from the \nchallenges facing other regions of the country, they have been very \nresponsible in trying to maintain critical investments in flood control \nand navigation and irrigation, while also ensuring that our energy \nresearch and nuclear waste management and weapons production \nresponsibilities are met.\n  Their task was made particularly difficult this year by the \ndisgraceful budget request for Fiscal Year 1999 put forward by the \nadministration for the Army Corps of Engineers. Despite strong support \nfor an aggressive Corps construction program from both sides of the \naisle and all regions of the country, the administration proposed a \nsignificant reduction in spending for Corps construction--some $689 \nmillion, or 47 percent, below last year's funding level.\n  This budget gap created a huge hole that needed to be filled, and I \ncommend our committee chairman, Senator Stevens, for his sensitivity to \nthe challenges presented to the Energy and Water Development \nSubcommittee by the President's request. Senator Stevens knows all too \nwell the value and need for critical infrastructure investments that \nwill help communities enhance their economic opportunity. I was pleased \nto join with the chairman in recommending a 302(b) allocation to the \nEnergy and Water Development Subcommittee which was substantially above \nthe President's request and above a freeze for the non-defense \ndiscretionary portion. Nonetheless, the requests for funding far \nexceeded the subcommittee's allocation.\n  Nearly every state had ongoing water projects that the Corps \nexpressed a capability of being able to execute at a program level far \nin excess of the President's request. So to try and maintain ongoing \nprojects, as well as to protect investments, funding was added to many \nof these projects. The costs associated with the administration's \nshort-sighted proposal were considerable. Not only would there have \nbeen increased costs due to the additional time it would have taken to \ncomplete projects, but there would also have been considerable contract \ntermination costs associated with ending or reducing work that had been \ninitiated recently.\n  So I commend the subcommittee members for their fine work. Their \nresponsiveness to local concerns will mean a great deal to the \ncommunities in my state that were on the short end of the \nadministration's budget. In places like Marmet, the Greenbrier Basin, \nand the Tug Fork Valley, where people have been waiting years for \nassistance from the Federal government to improve upon flood control \nand enhance navigation channels that feed our economy, this bill will \nbe of great assistance. I have seen the mud, muck, and misery that \naccompany flooding when the waters rise in the creeks and streams and \nrivers that flow through the mountains of West Virginia. Some criticize \nthese types of projects. I contend that they are critical to improving \nthe lives and enhancing the safety of our constituents.\n  Mr. President, as is true with most appropriations bills, not every \nSenator has 100 percent of his or her priorities addressed fully. That \nis the very essence of compromise and balance, which are at the center \nof what it takes to produce an acceptable, and signable, appropriations \nbill. The President, in gutting the Corps' construction program, \nproposed significant increases to programs favored by the \nadministration. But every Senator should be clear that, to pay for \nthose increases, the President proposed reductions in funding requested \nfor flood protection and other water infrastructure development. I \ncommend Senator Domenici and Senator Reid for trying to maintain \nstability across the multitude of programs funded in this bill.\n\n[[Page S6533]]\n\n  Finally, I wish to acknowledge the very fine work done on this \nappropriations bill by the majority and minority staff of the Energy \nand Water Development Subcommittee--Alex Flint, David Gwaltney, Greg \nDaines, Liz Blevins, Lashawnda Leftwich, and Sue Masica. There are many \ndetails associated with all of the water projects and energy research \nitems in this bill, and this team does an excellent job of serving not \nonly Senators Domenici and Reid, but also all other Senators.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few comments \nconcerning S. 2138, the Fiscal Year 1999 Energy and Water Development \nAppropriation Bill.\n  The West Columbus Floodwall Project is an extremely important \ninfrastructure project currently under development by the City of \nColumbus and the Army Corps of Engineers. Once completed this project \nwill protect over 2,800 acres of urban development, and approximately \n6,200 homes and businesses. Construction of this $118 million project \nwas initiated in 1993 and was on schedule and budget for completion in \n2002.\n  The fiscal year 1999 civil works budget request for the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers provided only $1.8 million for continued \nconstruction of this important project. The Committee increased the \nfiscal year 1999 funding to a total $7.5 million. Although I am \ngrateful for the Committee's action, I am concerned because this \nproject requires $16 million to keep it on track and moving forward.\n  Mr. President, this project is unlike a lot of other flood projects \nin that it does not provide vitally needed flood protection for West \nColumbus until it is fully completed. Funding for this project at less \nthan $16 million could delay it for up to one year and this area will \ncontinue to be exposed to an increased potential for flood damages of \nup to $455 million. In addition, the homeowners and businesses in this \narea will face continued zoning restrictions, and development of 2800 \nacres will be delayed.\n  The city of Columbus has been damaged in the past by severe flooding \nof the Scioto River, which runs through the heart of its downtown. In \n1913, 1937 and 1959, the city was devastated by flood disasters \nresulting in millions of dollars in damage to commercial and \nresidential property, destruction of homes and businesses, and the loss \nof many lives. In 1990 and 1992, the city again experienced serious \nflood scares. If the West Columbus project were in place during \nprevious recent flood events, damages would have been prevented.\n  Mr. President, during the December 1990 rainfall and flood event, \ninundation and localized flood damages occurred in the Phase 1B/\nMcKinley Avenue area. The Scioto River rose to a flood level \napproaching a 20-year frequency. If the project features had been in \nplace at that time, the interior runoff would have drained to the \nstormwater pump station ST-8 and would have been pumped out of the \ninterior. Instead, an existing storm sewer flap gate was held shut by \nthe high Scioto River flood stage, preventing the interior runoff from \ndraining to the river. Adjacent businesses were flooded until the \nScioto River receded to a level that permitted the flap gate to open \nand allow interior runoff to drain to the river.\n  During the July 1992 storm, rainfall in excess of 4 inches fell over \nthe interior area along with a moderate rise in the Scioto River. An \nexisting storm sewer flap gate was held shut and interior runoff could \nnot drain to the river. If the proposed Dodge Park stormwater pump \nstation had been available, it could have pumped excess runoff to the \nriver, thus preventing flood damages that occurred along Rich Street.\n  Mr. President, I understand that sufficient funding was not available \nfor the many critically needed flood protection projects contained in \nthis bill. For this reason I will not offer an amendment, however, I \nthought it was important to express my concerns and address the \npotential impacts of not funding this project at the required level of \n$16 million. I am pleased that the House was able to fully fund this \nproject in their bill and it is my hope that during Conference, the \nSenate will recede to the House's position and provide $16 million for \nthe West Columbus Floodwall Project.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern about the \nportion of this bill dealing with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, \nand particularly the Committee report. While I appreciate that Senators \nDomenici and Reid have made very significant changes to an earlier \nversion of the report, I remain troubled.\n  Let me say first that I am a supporter of nuclear energy. I believe \nit can be part of the solution to solving the world's energy, \nenvironment and global warming problems. But in order for there to be a \nfuture for this industry, it is critical for the public to maintain \nconfidence in the industry--a confidence that must be supported by a \nstrong, competent and effective Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  I do not believe that the current NRC over-regulates, inspects too \nmuch, enforces too much or has adopted an overly restrictive body of \nregulations. I base this conclusion on the extensive oversight I \nconducted as chairman during the 103rd Congress of the Clean Air and \nNuclear Regulation subcommittee of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee; the oversight work I have conducted during the last three \nyears as a member of the Environment Committee, particularly growing \nout of my concern about the shutdown of Connecticut's nuclear power \nplants; and two extensive reports prepared for me by the General \nAccounting Office.\n  In fact, I believe that as a result of new safety initiatives \nundertaken by NRC Chairman Jackson, such as: limiting inappropriate use \nof enforcement discretion; requiring utilities to verify whether they \nare operating in accordance with their design basis; undertaking a \nreview of NRC oversight of changes made by utilities without prior NRC \napproval; improving the inspection process;, increased attention to use \nof quantitative performance indicators; and reforms of the senior \nmanagement oversight process, the NRC has finally moved toward \nregaining some of the public confidence which is so important. Also \ncritical to restoring this confidence has been Chairman Jackson's \nopenness and responsiveness to the public, including whistleblowers. \nMany of these initiatives came in response to a very unfortunate \nsituation in Connecticut, where the nuclear power plants were shut down \nand put on the NRC Watch List of most troubled plants.\n  I appreciate that the Appropriations Committee believes that there \nshould be an in-depth review of the NRC. As a member of the Senate \nEnvironment Committee with authorization oversight responsibilities, I \nhave been urging the Committee to conduct hearings on the NRC since the \nstart of the Congress. In particular, I have urged the Committee to \nhold a hearing to examine the issues raised in two General Accounting \nOffice reports : one prepared for Senator Biden and me, Nuclear \nRegulation: Preventing Problem Plants Requires More Effective NRC \nAction, and one prepared for Congressman Dingell and me on \nwhistleblower protections.\n  The GAO raised serious concerns about instances in the past in which \nthe NRC has neither taken aggressive enforcement action nor held \nnuclear plant licensees accountable for correcting their problems on a \ntimely basis. The GAO criticized the NRC for problems in the inspection \nprocess, such as not including timetables for the completion of \ncorrective action and for not evaluating the competency of the \nlicensees' plant managers as part of the on-going inspection process. \nIn addition, the GAO found that the senior management meeting, designed \nto focus attention on those plants with declining safety performance, \nwas not serving its goal of being an early warning tool.\n  To her credit, Chairman Jackson has responded to many of these GAO \nrecommendations positively and swiftly. Nevertheless, oversight \nhearings are needed to evaluate the NRC's responses.\n  Finally, although I appreciate that the Committee increased the NRC's \nfunding levels from the subcommittee's approach and eliminated any \ndirections to cut nuclear reactor safety, I am still concerned that the \nbill includes $17.3 million less in funding than the NRC's budget \nrequest. I think a more prudent approach would be to have a detailed \ndiscussion of the NRC's proposed initiatives in the authorizing\n\n[[Page S6534]]\n\nEnvironment Committee to avoid any negative impact on the NRC's ability \nto maintain a strong, healthy regulatory program for nuclear power \nplants or to limit any new initiatives that the NRC believes are \nimportant. In the 103rd Congress, I was pleased that we were able to \nreport an authorizing bill for the NRC, but unfortunately it did not \nbecome law. We need to move forward again with such a bill.\n\n\n           tooele city wastewater treatment and reuse project\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, the Chairman of the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee, a question related to a project in my State. Am I correct \nin stating that the bill before the Senate today contains $3 million in \nfunding for the Tooele City Wastewater Treatment and Reuse Project?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from New \nMexico's support for this project. I have recently become aware of a \nproblem with this project related to the Bureau of Reclamation's \ninterpretation of the project's authorization which I hope we can \nclarify. As the Senator knows, I am a strong advocate for the concept \nof water recycling and reuse. In arid States such as ours we simply \nhave to make every gallon of available water stretch as far as we can. \nIt is for that reason that I sponsored the legislation that eventually \nbecame Public Law 104-266. The passage of that legislation expanded the \nBureau of Reclamation's water recycling program and authorized the \nTooele City project. Under this program the Bureau is authorized to \ncontribute up to twenty-five percent of the cost of planning, designing \nand constructing water recycling and reuse projects.\n  The Tooele Wastewater Treatment and Reuse project is designed to \nreclaim 2.25 million gallons of effluent daily and utilized the \nreclaimed water for a variety of non-potable uses permitted by Utah \nState law. Unlike some other States, Utah permits the utilization of \nwater treated to secondary--as opposed to advanced secondary or \ntertiary--standards for certain non-potable uses. In formulating the \nTooele project, the City has always anticipated the utilization of \nsecondary effluent in conformance with State law. Now the Bureau of \nReclamation has informed the City that it will not provide funds \nappropriated by Congress for that portion of the Tooele project that \nprovides secondary treatment. I have searched the authorizations for \nthe Title XVI program and the Tooele project high and low and can not \nfind a statutory basis for the Bureau's position. Had Congress wished \nto limit the use of title XVI funds in this manner, it certainly could \nhave done so. It did not.\n  Mr. President, I remain hopeful that we can resolve this matter \nbefore this bill goes to Conference. However, in the event that we are \nnot successful, I would like to ask the Chairman to entertain the \npossibility of Conference Report language, if necessary, to clarify \nthis matter.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I appreciate the Senator from Utah's concerns. I would \nbe happy to work with him to resolve this issue.\n\n\n                               Rodeo Lake\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise for a brief colloquy with the \nmanager of the bill. I would like to thank the chairman for his \ngenerous work to fund the Rodeo Lake project near Othello, Washington. \nThis project will help alleviate a serious flooding problem in Central \nWashington state. There has been some confusion, however, regarding the \nCorps of Engineers' involvement in the project. I understand that, \nbecause of the water at Rodeo Lake directly affects projects maintained \nby the Bureau of Reclamation, the committee intends for the Corps to \ncoordinate its efforts with the Bureau of Reclamation. Is my \ndescription of the committee's intentions correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Chairman for the clarification and for the \nhard work on this bill.\n\n\n                       devils lake, north dakota\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, page 44 of the committee report \naccompanying S. 2138, the fiscal 1999 Energy and Water Development \nAppropriation bill, includes a section on funding provided in the bill \nfor construction of a flood control outlet at Devils Lake, North \nDakota. At the end of the short section, the committee report states \nthat, ``[i]t is expected that such circumstances would also be such \nthat granting of a waiver under the emergency provision of the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act would be appropriate and that the provision of \nthe 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty would be met.''\n  I am trying to understand how this report language corresponds with \nlanguage in the bill for Devils Lake. As reported by the committee, \npages 6 and 7 of the bill lay out a detailed set of rigorous criteria \nthat must be met before any funds can be obligated by the Secretary for \nactual construction of the outlet. Two of those criteria, full \ncompliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the \n1909 Boundary Waters Treaty seem to be preempted by the committee in \nthis report. I ask the distinguished chairman of the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Subcommittee, Senator Domenici, if the committee report \nlanguage in any way supercedes the bill language? Moreover, is the \ncommittee attempting to provide a waiver or some form of relief under \nNEPA or the Boundary Waters Treaty?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his continued \ninterest and involvement in the Devils Lake matter. The answer to both \nof the Senator's questions is ``no.'' The bill language that you cited, \nwhich was originally negotiated by the two of us, Senator Bond and our \ncolleagues from North Dakota last year, would be fully applicable. The \ncommittee report does not waive NEPA, the Boundary Waters Treaty or any \nof the other conditions found in the bill language. In summary, the \nExecutive Branch would need to fulfill the economic and technical \njustifications, the reporting and budgeting requirements, as well as \nthe NEPA and Boundary Waters Treaty terms, before any of the \nappropriated funds can be expended for outlet construction. The report \nlanguage signals our expectation that the Executive Branch would make \nfull use of the emergency provision currently available under NEPA and \nthat all steps would be taken to expeditiously fulfill the requirements \nof the Boundary Waters Treaty in the event that rising lake levels \nwarrant accelerated construction of the outlet.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I appreciate my colleague's clarification. I chaired a \nhearing on Devils Lake before the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks late last year and am committed to addressing the terrible \nflooding problems experienced there. However, I am convinced that the \npeople of North Dakota, Minnesota, Canada, and the U.S. taxpayers will \nall be served more effectively if we go about this project in the right \nway. To do that, we need the appropriate reviews, studies and \njustifications by the Army Corps of Engineers, State Department and \nothers. In that context, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \ninclude in the Congressional Record a January 28, 1998, Army Corps \nmemorandum, signed by the then-Acting Assistant Secretary John H. \nZirschky, that details the agency's policy on NEPA compliance and the \nproposed outlet at Devils Lake. I ask unanimous consent that the \nmemorandum be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the memorandum was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of the Army, Office of the Assistant \n           Secretary, Civil Works,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 1998.\n\n\n               memorandum for the director of civil works\n\n     Subject: National Environmental Policy Act Compliance, Devils \n       Lake Outlet, North Dakota\n       The Corps has been working hard to solve the flooding \n     problems at Devils Lake. The St. Paul District has been \n     raising the levees at the city of Devils Lake and the design \n     of an emergency outlet is well underway. I commend your \n     staff, Mississippi Valley Division and the St. Paul District \n     for their accomplishments to date.\n       A statutory requirement for constructing an outlet from \n     Devils Lake is compliance with the National Environmental \n     Policy Act (NEPA). On December 10, 1997, the Corps briefed my \n     staff and a representative of the Office of Management and \n     Budget (OMB) on the proposal for compliance with NEPA. On \n     December 19, 1997, my staff briefed senior\n\n[[Page S6535]]\n\n     staff of the OMB and the White House Council on Environmental \n     Quality (CEQ) on the proposal.\n       The purpose of the December 19, 1997 meeting was to discuss \n     the St. Paul District's ``expedited'' schedule for NEPA \n     compliance. That schedule calls for constructing the outlet \n     before the NEPA process is completed. This is an exception \n     that would require a waiver from the normal NEPA process. \n     While the flooding problem at Devils Lake is an emergency, \n     and while adoption of a NEPA compliance process completed \n     following construction may be necessary at some point in \n     time, the decision to carry out a NEPA process as outlined in \n     the District's ``expedited'' schedule is considered \n     premature. Supporting a waiver at this time is difficult \n     since we have not yet decided to construct the outlet nor \n     have we completed its design. The controversial nature of the \n     outlet project, and the extent of other ongoing activities by \n     the Corps and others to mitigate for the flooding were also \n     factors in this decision.\n       It is critical that the Corps continues to keep this \n     project as a high priority. We should proceed with the \n     planning, NEPA compliance, and design of the outlet as \n     quickly as possible. The studies and report being prepared to \n     comply with the Fiscal Year 1998 Energy and Water Development \n     Appropriations Act should also be expeditiously completed. To \n     ensure that the report complies with the congressional \n     directives, it should be subjected to technical and policy \n     reviews before submitted to this office. We should also \n     continue to budget for the outlet.\n       It is also very important that the NEPA process complies \n     fully with the July 1, 1997, memorandum from the CEQ on \n     transboundary impacts of the outlet project. Likewise, the \n     NEPA process should be undertaken so that it will give us a \n     sound basis for consultation with the International Joint \n     Commission, and with Canada under the ``Boundary Waters \n     Treaty of 1909.''\n       At this time, we should not plan to use a NEPA process that \n     assumes that we construct the outlet before the NEPA process \n     is completed. Our objective is to comply fully with the NEPA \n     by completing the Environmental Impact Statement and Record \n     of Decision using a normal NEPA process. In this regard, on \n     January 12 our staffs developed guidance that allowed the St. \n     Paul District to initiate the NEPA scoping process on January \n     14, 1998. The District should revise the schedule they \n     proposed for the ``normal'' NEPA process, and identify \n     opportunities to complete this work by December 1999. While I \n     understand that the coordination phase of the NEPA process \n     may be time dependent, I believe that ways to shorten the \n     data collection and evaluation phases can be found to shorten \n     the current forty month schedule. Regarding data collection \n     and evaluations, these activities should be programmed in a \n     way that will provide us with increasingly greater levels of \n     detail, so that we can decide, if necessary, to start the \n     outlet at anytime using an emergency NEPA process. Unless an \n     emergency waiver is obtained sooner, we should be in a \n     position to start construction by Spring 2000.\n       The enclosed paper was prepared to help explain the \n     ``Action Plan.'' This plan will allow the Corps to meet its \n     legal obligations, make more informed decisions by maximizing \n     the use of new information on both lake level predictions and \n     environmental impacts, and stay positioned to start \n     construction on the outlet when necessary. I ask that HQUSACE \n     provide the leadership necessary to achieve these objectives.\n                                                 John H. Zirschky,\n         Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works).\n       Enclosure.\n\n   Devils Lake Emergency Outlet, North Dakota National Environmental \n                   Policy Act Compliance Action Plan\n\n       National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance is an \n     integral part of the decision making process for the Devils \n     Lake outlet. To be able to construct the outlet as soon as \n     possible--yet comply fully with NEPA--the Corps will use the \n     following principles:\n\n\n                               Principles\n\n       Reducing flooding at Devils Lake is a high priority for the \n     Administration.\n       Engineering and design work on the outlet will proceed on \n     schedule, allowing the start of construction, if necessary, \n     by May 1999.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Unless otherwise stated, completion and submission dates \n     presented in this paper are those developed by the St. Paul \n     District of the Corps of Engineers. New dates are noted by \n     ``*'' after the date.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       A decision to start construction on the outlet will be \n     based on the best available information and be legally \n     defensible.\n       A decision to start construction will comply with the \n     Fiscal Year 1998 Energy and Water Development Appropriations \n     Act, and other laws and treaties; and\n       National Environmental Policy Act compliance will proceed \n     on a fast track.\n\n\n                              Action Plan\n\n       From an engineering standpoint, the Corps St. Paul District \n     believes it can be in a position to start construction of the \n     outlet by may 1999. To meet this date, the design of the \n     outlet should be completed by August 1998 and pipe should be \n     ordered in October 1998. By August 1998, the Project \n     Cooperation Agreement should be ready to be executed with the \n     State of North Dakota. The State could then be ready to \n     acquire lands needed for the project. The report necessary to \n     comply with the Fiscal Year 1998 Energy and Water Development \n     Appropriations Act is scheduled to be prepared, reviewed and \n     approved in time to be submitted to Congress by August 1998. \n     Plans and specifications are to be completed by march 1999. \n     The Corps would continue to budget for funds for design and \n     construction of the outlet.\n       Regarding the NEPA compliance, several options were \n     considered, including starting construction before the NEPA \n     process is completed. Starting construction before the NEPA \n     process is completed requires a Council of Environmental \n     Quality waiver from the normal NEPA compliance process under \n     the emergency provision of NEPA. Such waivers are unusual and \n     require substantial justification. Without such justification \n     the legal risk would be great given the diverse interest and \n     positions on the outlet. In view of the stipulations in the \n     Fiscal Year 1998 Energy and Water Development Appropriations \n     Act that must be met before construction can be started and \n     that the design of the outlet is not yet complete, we believe \n     that it is premature to make the waiver decision at this time \n     and that we should proceed with the NEPA process. However, in \n     view of the lake level trends of the past few years at Devils \n     Lake, the NEPA review would be expedited, and NEPA compliance \n     activities would be organized in a tiered fashion that will \n     maximize its utility at any given time regarding a decision \n     to start construction on the outlet through the emergency \n     NEPA waiver. This approach should not result in an \n     unacceptable slow down of outlet construction, if necessary, \n     since the engineering and design work will be completed on \n     schedule.\n       The St. Paul District initiated the formal NEPA process on \n     October 21, 1997, and an initial scoping meeting was held on \n     January 14, 1998. unless a waiver from NEPA is needed sooner, \n     the goal is to complete the NEPA process by December 1999*. \n     As noted above, NEPA data collections, evaluations, impact \n     assessments, and coordination activities should be programed \n     to be concurrent, at minimum allowed times, and at \n     increasingly greater degrees of detail, so that we can save \n     time and make more informed and supportable decisions \n     regarding carrying out the outlet under an emergency NEPA \n     process, if necessary. As an example, the question of the \n     need to start construction under an emergency NEPA process \n     can be revisited after the 1998 runoff predictions are \n     released and the Corps has completed the report required by \n     the Fiscal Year 1998 Energy and Water Development \n     Appropriations Act.\n       In summary, this action plan allows the Corps to meet its \n     legal obligations, make more informed decisions by maximizing \n     the use of new information on both lake level predictions and \n     environmental impacts, and stay positioned to start \n     construction on the outlet when necessary.\n           OASA (CW) POC:\n                                                 Michael L.

Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nChairman of the Subcommittee in a colloquy concerning funding for the \nrestoration of Assateague Island National Seashore.\n  I am deeply concerned that the Committee was not able to provide \nfunding for so-called ``new start'' construction projects of the Army \nCorps of Engineers. I understand that the House Committee has also \nadopted a no new starts policy. The Corps of Engineers was scheduled to \ninitiate an authorized and approved mitigation project for the North \nEnd of Assateague Island National Seashore in Fiscal 1999 and without \nfunding, it appears that this project will have to be postponsed. This \nis a particular problem because the northern end of Assateague was hit \nvery hard by two northeastern storms which slammed the mid-Atlantic \ncoast this past February causing severe erosion and overwash \nconditions. In its current condition, the seashore is extremely \nvulnerable to breaching should another storm hit the coast. The \nintegrity of the National Seashore and the area's coastal bays are at \nrisk.\n  Fortunately, the Corps will be able to make emergency repairs to the \nstorm-damaged section under the authority of Public Law 84-99, \nproviding some additional protection to the island over its current \ncondition. But it would be far better if the approved restoration \nproject could be initiated and completed as soon as possible.\n  I recognize the difficult constraints that the Committee faced in \ncrafting this bill but, given the critical nature of this project, I \nask if the Chairman would be willing to work with me and Senator \nMikulski in the Conference Committee to address Assateague's needs \nshould additional funding become available.\n\n[[Page S6536]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Committee understands the importance of this \nproject and will work in Conference to see what develops.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chairman for his consideration of this \nproject. Assateague is one of the most important restoration projects \nin Maryland. The environmental, economic and ecological value of the \nAssateague Seashore is extraordinary. It is not just a Maryland \npriority, it is a national priority.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chairman for these assurances.\n\n\n                   transfer of the st. georges bridge\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am wondering if the Ranking Member of the \nSubcommittee will engage in a colloquy with me regarding the St. \nGeorges Bridge in my State of Delaware.\n  Mr. REID. I would be pleased to yield to my colleague from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my friend. Mr. President, recently in the newly \npassed highway bill, TEA-21, the Secretary of the Army was directed to \ntransfer the right, title and interest of the St. Georges Bridge in \nDelaware, to the State of Delaware. The transfer is necessary to \nfacilitate a retransfer of the bridge to a private entity for the \npurposes of demonstrating the effectiveness of large-scale composites \ntechnology. If the transfer is completed within 180 days the Secretary \nis directed to provide $10,000,000 to the State for rehabilitating the \nbridge.\n  I rise to ask the Senator from Nevada, in his capacity as Ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee, to seek his commitment in working with me \nand the Army Corps of Engineers to ensure that this transfer and the \n$10 million payment occurs as authorized.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I am aware of the transfer of the bridge and the \nprovision in TEA-21. You have my pledge that I will do all I can to see \nthat the Army Corps of Engineers will carry this out as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                     grand prairie region, arkansas\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the senior Senator \nfrom New Mexico in a colloquy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be pleased to join the senior Senator from \nArkansas in a colloquy.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, many of us in Arkansas have been working \nfor several years to reverse a critical ground water resource problem \nthat is developing in our region and will ultimately affect the entire \ncountry.\n  Throughout this century, aquifers in the lower Mississippi River \nValley have been falling due to high demand and relatively low \nrecharge. The United States Geological Survey has found that current \ntrends by the year 2015 will reduce the saturated thickness of the \naquifers to the point that soils will begin to compact, recharge will \nnot be possible, and the aquifer will effectively be dead, along with \nnearly half of the U.S. rice industry. Because of the magnitude of this \nproblem, state and local efforts to correct it will never succeed \nwithout assistance from the federal government. In that event, a \nregional economic collapse will occur, a major environmental resource \nwill forever be lost, and our legacy to future generations will carry a \nlasting shadow of irresponsibility.\n  The President's Budget Request provided $11.5 million for the Grand \nPrairie Region. I understand the difficulty the Senate Energy and Water \nAppropriations Subcommittee faced in trying to fund many worthwhile \nprojects. Unfortunately, the Grand Prairie Project was not funded in \nthis bill. It is also my understanding that the House Energy and Water \nAppropriations Bill provides the full Budget Request of $11.5 million \nfor the Grand Prairie project.\n  I ask the Chairman, Senator Domenici, for his support in accepting \nthe House level when this legislation is considered in conference.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from Arkansas for his comments. The \nSenator is correct. The Subcommittee had great difficulty in providing \nfunds for several needed and worthwhile projects. I understand the \nimportance and national significance of the Grand Prairie Project and \npledge my support in conference for Grand Prairie if there are \nsufficient resources.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Chairman for his efforts.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a \ncolloquy. Last year, the Senator and I discussed the energy generation \nproblems facing rural areas of the United States. The Chairman wisely \nincluded funding in the Fiscal Year 1998 Energy and Water \nAppropriations bill to address this problem. In rural areas, energy \ndistribution systems are often more difficult and expensive to \nestablish. As a result, communities are often forced to rely on more \npolluting fuel sources because they have lower up front capital costs. \nThe Jeffords amendment the Chairman accepted this morning increases \nfunding for the Remote Power Initiative to $5 million. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, the Senator is correct. In Fiscal Year 1998 and \n1999 we included funding for the Remote Power Initiative to support \ndeployment of solar, wind, fuel cell, biomass, and other energy \ntechnologies in remote areas to address their energy challenges. Last \nyear, you highlighted the energy demands and environmental constraints \nof ski area operations as one example of this problem facing remote \nareas. As you noted, ski areas in Vermont were one of the leading \nsources of NOx emissions due to use of inefficient and \npolluting diesel engines for operations. This is the kind of problem \nthe subcommittee had in mind when proposing the Remote Power \nInitiative.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I want to thank the Chairman for including funds for the \nRemote Power Initiative again this year. This Initiative offers the \nDepartment of Energy an opportunity to build partnerships with the ski \nindustry to deploy efficient and environmentally-friendly renewable \nenergy technologies to reduce energy use and emissions. Partnerships \ncould also involve environmental technology vendors and service \nproviders who may be interested in cost sharing.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree with the Senator from Vermont and believe there \nis a real need to address remote power problems in cold weather areas. \nI support using some of the funds in the Remote Power Initiative for \nthe purposes you described.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chairman and look forward to working with him \nand the Department of Energy to bring together ski operators and the \nrenewable energy technology industry to discuss technology and policy \nissues, and determine appropriate actions and next steps.\n\n\n                        biomass ethanol research\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I wish to ask a question of the \nchairman of the subcommittee, the Senator from New Mexico, and the \nranking member of the subcommittee, the Senator from Nevada; is it the \nunderstanding of the chairman and ranking member that there are enough \nfunds available in the Solar and Renewable Resources Technologies/\nBiofuels Energy Systems account to continue the feasibility study and \nproject development of a biomass ethanol plant in Plumas County, \nCalifornia?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. Funding is available under this bill \nfor the Department of Energy under the Biofuels Energy Systems account \nthat could be used to study the feasibility of the Plumas County \nproject.\n  Mr. REID. That is my view as well. I would urge the DOE to consider \nsupporting this project in fiscal year 1999.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senators.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, it is my understanding that western \nstates and the western electric power industry have been engaged in \nintensive efforts to create a competitive and reliable western \nelectricity market covering all or parts of 14 states, two Canadian \nprovinces and northern Mexico. I believe this is exactly the type of \nlocal cooperative action Congress hoped for in the enactment of the \nEnergy Policy Act of 1992. I ask the Chairman, does the budget contain \nfunds to help western states work with the electric power industry to \npromote competitive and reliable electricity markets in the Western \nInterconnection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Is it the Committee's intent that the Department of \nEnergy is to give priority in the expenditure of such funds to \nassisting western states which are collectively working with the \nindustry on a gridwide basis to promote competitive and reliable \nregional electricity markets?\n\n[[Page S6537]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                   western area power administration\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I understand that the Western Area Power \nAdministration and The Bureau of Reclamation are considering raising \nrates for the power necessary to operate irrigation systems in the \nEastern Division of the Pick-Sloane Missouri Basin Project. The purpose \nof these agencies is not to raise revenue. Rather, these agencies are \ndesigned to provide reliable and affordable power for multi-purpose \neconomic development.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree Senator Burns, affordable power rates for \nirrigation districts are vital to all those living in the western \nUnited States.\n  Mr. BURNS. This is especially true considering the recent drought and \nlow wheat prices that we have been experiencing throughout the region. \nThe farmers in this region simply cannot afford the burden that this \nrate increase will place on them.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that the situation now facing many of \nthese farmers and ranchers is dire. You make a very compelling argument \nagainst raising rates and production costs for an industry that is \nalready facing disaster.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank Senator Domenici for his recognition of this \nproblem. I will fully commit myself to working with him to resolve this \nsituation as soon as possible.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a \ncolloquy. Senator Domenici, I would like to thank you and Senator Reid \nfor your willingness to boost funding for the Department of Energy's \nimportant solar and renewable programs. I am especially pleased to see \nan increase in funding for the biomass energy systems account. In \nVermont, work is continuing at the McNeil Generation Plant in \nBurlington to demonstrate the effectiveness of biomass gasification. \nThis is an important renewable technology which will help our country \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Earlier this year the Department of Energy agreed to a modification \nof the contract for the McNeil project which resulted in a $6 million \nincrease in the Department's contribution to the South Burlington \nfacility. These funds will be matched dollar for dollar by the partners \nwho are participating with DoE in this important renewable program. \nBecause the contract modification was not reached until after the \nPresident had submitted his Fiscal Year 1999 budget proposal, that \nincrease was not reflected in the funding request for the biomass \nenergy systems account. It is my understanding that the increase in \nfunding for biomass energy systems includes the $6 million needed for \nthe Department to meet its obligations under the contract for the \nMcNeil facility.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I concur with the Senator from Vermont as to the \nimportance of the Vermont gasifier. I concur that it would be desirable \nto provide funds for that project. In conference, as we reach agreement \nwith the House on the allocation of funds for Biomass, I will work to \nprovide that funding.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the energy and \nwater development appropriations bill and to take a few moments to \nengage in a colloquy with the chairman of the subcommittee on one of \nthe many important programs being funded in the bill. That would be the \ntechnology transfer and education programs funded under Atomic Energy \nDefense Activities. These programs are an important investment in the \nfuture of the country, by leveraging the facilities, expertise, and R \nresults funded by the Department's defense missions to the benefit of \nbroader national science, technology, and education objectives. We have \nseen some important spin-offs over the years from DOE defense-related \nresearch, and this funding will ensure that we continue to see both \nspin-off and the flow of technology, ideas, and trained personnel into \nthe labs, to the benefit of the Department's important statutory \nmissions.\n  One example of a technology partnership area of importance, and which \nI hope the Department will fully fund in fiscal year 1999, is the \nAdvanced Computational Technology Initiative, or ACTI. The ACTI program \nmakes available to smaller oil and gas producers the computational and \nsimulation resources of the national laboratories. One component of the \nACTI program over the years, the Advanced Reservoir Management program, \nhas funded advances in complex computational database management and \nelectronic information systems that have been of benefit both to the \noil and gas industry and DOE's defense programs.\n  I know that my colleague from New Mexico, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, is a strong supporter of our oil and gas industry. I \nwould urge him to maintain funding of the ACTI program at the level of \nthe President's request as this bill moves forward to conference.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I completely agree with my colleague. We are united in \nour support for the oil and gas industry in New Mexico. The bill that I \nhave brought forward today provides full funding for the ACTI program \nat the President's requested level. The program is one of a series of \ntechnological partnerships between the DOE national laboratories and \nindustry which are producing real value to the U.S. economy. I plan to \nmaintain this strong support for ACTI and other technology partnerships \nat DOE as this bill moves forward to enactment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank my colleague, Senator Inhofe, for engaging in \nthis dialogue to clear up confusion surrounding section 3(b) of S. \n1279, the Indian Employment, Training and Related Services \nDemonstration Act Amendments of 1998.\n  Mr. INHOFE. What exactly does section 3(b) of S. 1279 purport to do?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. It attempts to clarify inconsistencies in implementing \nPublic Law 102-477. Over the past four years, tribes have attempted to \nintegrate both programs into their 477 plans. They have received at \nbest, inconsistent responses from the BIA. On several occasions the \nBureau approved the integration, and other times integration was \nrejected. The Bureau confirmed this confusion at a May 13, 1997 Indian \nAffairs Committee hearing when it submitted conflicting testimony \nregarding its approval of including the JOM program into tribal plans. \nSection 3(b) makes clear that ``at the option of a tribe'' funds under \nboth the General Assistance and Johnson O'Malley programs may be \nintegrated into tribal 477 plans.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Is it true that your bill will not affect in any manner \nthe current regulations and requirements established by the Department \nof the Interior with regard to the Johnson O'Malley program?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. That's correct. In fact, I have here a letter from the \nAssistant Secretary of Indian Affairs, which states that while they \nsupport section 3(b)'s integration of Johnson O'Malley, ``the program \nmust continue to be conducted in accordance with its authorizing \nstatute.'' Another letter dated March 28, 1998 states that the JOM \nparent committee will continue to have the authority to approve and \ndisapprove tribal plans to integrate funds within the 477 program. I \nask unanimous consent that each of these letters be placed in the \nrecord.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Johnson O'Malley program is a supplemental education \nprogram designed to benefit Indian children aged 3 through grade 12 \nattending public schools. I'm concerned that permitting tribes the \noption to use these funds within employment and training plans will \npermit tribes to instead use these funds for post-high school adult \nemployment training programs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I agree with your concern, and that is why I amended \nthe original language of the bill to expressly require tribal \ngovernments wishing to integrate these funds into their 477 programs to \ninclude adequate assurances that such funds will be used only for those \nintended beneficiaries, children aged 3 through grade 12. I would, \nhowever, like to make clear that with the onset of welfare reform upon \nus, tribal governments must be afforded adequate flexibility to \nadminister the limited federal resources available. This bill attempts \nto provide that added flexibility.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank Senator Campbell for clearing up these concerns. \nI'm encouraged by the assurances that the Johnson O'Malley Program will \nnot be adversely affected by this measure.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, S. 2138, the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Appropriations Act, 1999, complies with the Budget Act's \nsection\n\n[[Page S6538]]\n\n302(b) allocation of budget authority and outlays.\n  The reported bill provides $20.9 billion in budget authority and \n$13.1 billion in new outlays to fund the civil programs of the Army \nCorps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, certain independent \nagencies, and most of the activities of the Department of Energy. When \noutlays from prior year budget authority and other actions are taken \ninto account, this bill provides a total of $20.7 billion in outlays.\n  For defense discretionary programs, the bill is at its allocation for \nbudget authority and below its allocation for outlays by $2 million. \nThe Senate- reported bill also is below its nondefense discretionary \nallocation by $38 million in budget authority and $1 million under its \nallocation for outlays.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n           S. 2138, ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS, 1999--SPENDING COMPARISONS, SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                                     [Fiscal Year 1999, dollars in millions]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Defense       Nondefense         Crime         Mandatory         Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n    Budget authority............          12,030           8,909  ..............  ..............          20,939\n    Outlays.....................          11,818           8,899  ..............  ..............          20,717\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority............          12,030           8,947  ..............  ..............          20,977\n    Outlays.....................          11,820           8,900  ..............  ..............          20,720\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority............          12,298           9,003  ..............  ..............          21,301\n    Outlays.....................          11,875           9,150  ..............  ..............          21,025\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority............  ..............  ..............  ..............  ..............  ..............\n    Outlays.....................  ..............  ..............  ..............  ..............  ..............\n \n  SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED\n               TO:\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority............  ..............             -38  ..............  ..............             -38\n    Outlays.....................              -2              -1  ..............  ..............              -3\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority............            -268             -94  ..............  ..............            -362\n    Outlays.....................             -57            -251  ..............  ..............            -308\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority............          12,030           8,909  ..............  ..............          20,939\n    Outlays.....................          11,818           8,899  ..............  ..............          20,717\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNOTE.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the passage of \nS. 2138, the FY99 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. In \nparticular, I thank my colleagues for approving $6 million for U.S. \nArmy Corps of Engineers' funding for the harbor dredge in Portland, \nMaine.\n  I have supported the timely advancement of the harbor dredging \nbecause of public safety and environmental concerns and the project is \nthe top priority for the state. Portland Harbor badly needs dredging, \nand it is to the great credit of the Portland Harbor Dredge Committee, \nmade up of officials from the state, local, not-for-profit agencies and \nthe private sector that the dredging project is now ready to begin, at \nleast a year ahead of what the US Army Corps of Engineers expected. \nCorps officials had already made it clear that the project needed to \nbegin this next winter in order to minimize environmental impacts, but \ncould not be started until environmental determinations were made. The \nDredge Committee, working together since 1994, was successful in \nobtaining the necessary permits, including allowing the bulk of the \ndredged material from Portland Harbor to be deposited at sea.\n  As I pointed out in the Budget Committee back in March when I first \nbrought up the harbor dredging during Budget Reconciliation, the Corps \nproject simply could not wait another year for funding to be included \nin the federal budget. It is to the credit of the state, the \nsurrounding communities and the agencies working for the dredging that \nthe project is ready to begin, and the window for the dredging to occur \nso as to mitigate the environmental risks, according to the Corps, is \nfrom October, 1998 to April, 1999. This should now be possible if the \nSenate funding level is protected in conference with the House.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Domenici and his Appropriations \nSubcommittee for federal funding for the Ft. Fairfield levee in rural \nNorthern Maine, and also for including language in the appropriations \nbill that will allow construction of a levee to protect the town \nagainst further flooding. This Corps small flood control project is \nconsidered essential to the economic survival of Fort Fairfield. The \ntown has experienced severe flooding over the last several years, and \nas recently as two months ago, was once again on emergency alert \nbecause of river flooding, and some senior citizens had to be evacuated \nfrom the their homes.\n  Back in April 1994 alone, flood waters exceeded the 100-year flood \nplain and caused an estimated $7 million in property damages to \nbusinesses and residences. The town is prepared to embark on a \nredevelopment project once a levee has been built to prevent future \nfloods. Once again, we thank the appropriations committee for realizing \nthe importance of the levee to me and to this small rural town in \nNorthern Maine.\n  Mr. REID. The Department of Energy is negotiating a contract \ninvolving the Nevada Test Site and the Western Area Power \nAdministration to purchase 5 to 10 megawatts of solar energy on behalf \nof the Nevada Test Site. A single bidder; the Corporation for Solar \nTechnologies and Renewable Resources, has been selected through a \ncompetitive process and the Department is in the process of determining \non what terms it should enter into such a contract.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I concur with the Senator from Nevada's understanding \nof the current circumstances regarding the status of that contract. I \nunderstand the Department of Energy has engaged in a rigorous review to \ndetermine at what price and for what period of time it should enter \ninto such a contract.\n  Mr. REID. This would be an unusual contract. However, it also offers \nsome tremendous potential. If implemented correctly, this effort could \ndemonstrate the viability of large scale commercial development of \nsolar energy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have reviewed the current situation and have been in \ncontact with senior officials in the Department of Energy who have \nprovided me with assurances that, while unusual, this contract has been \nsubject to rigorous review and, on balance, is worthwhile because of \nthe value that could be derived from demonstrating the use of solar \nenergy on this scale. For this reason, and subject to the continued \nreview of the Department, I am willing to recommend that the Department \nproceed with its negotiations on this contract.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his support of this \ninnovative effort and would also like to note the diligent efforts of \nmy colleague from Nevada, Senator Bryan who has dedicated a great deal \nof attention to this initiative. I concur with the value he sees in \nthis opportunity as well as the value that may accrue to the Nevada \nTest Site in its efforts to identify new missions and responsibilities. \nSolar and renewable energy demonstration is one of those areas for \nwhich the Nevada Test Site has unique national capabilities and I look \nforward to further work in this regard.\n\n[[Page S6539]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6530-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6539-S6548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                        animas-la plata project\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wanted to make a statement on a matter \nof concern to me in the FY 99 Energy and Water Appropriations \nlegislation. As my colleagues know, I have long been active in raising \nSenate awareness about the financial costs of moving forward with \ndevelopment and construction of the full-scale version of the Animas-La \nPlata project. I am concerned that Section 505 of the legislation \nbefore us may require the federal government to proceed with \nconstruction of the full-scale project, just at the time when the \nCongress is about to get additional information from the Bureau of \nReclamation about alternatives to that project.\n  As my colleagues will recall from the debate on an amendment I \noffered to the FY 98 Energy and Water Appropriations legislation on \nthis matter, the currently authorized Animas-La Plata project is a $754 \nmillion dollar water development project planned for southwest Colorado \nand northwest New Mexico, of which federal taxpayers are slated to pay \nmore than 65% of the costs.\n  As described in the Committee Report on the legislation now before \nthis body on page 80, the total federal cost associated with this \nproject is now more than $512 million.\n  Section 505 of this bill starts out sounding like a prohibition on \nfunds for the Animas-La Plata project. It states that none of the money \nin this bill is to be used ``to pay the salary of any officer or \nemployee of the Department of the Interior may be used for the Animas-\nLa Plata Project.''\n  However, the bill goes on to say that none of the money may be used \nfor the Animas-La Plata project except in two cases: ``(1) activities \nrequired to comply with the applicable provisions of current law; and \n(2) continuation of activities pursuant to the Colorado Ute Settlement \nAct of 1988.''\n  Mr. President, let me be clear, the applicable provisions of current \nlaw require the construction of the full project. And though Section \n505 of the bill before us is similar to language added by the other \nbody to the FY 98 Energy and Water Appropriations legislation and \nretained by the Conferees, it was never considered by this body.\n  Subsequently, Mr. President, I do not believe, as I will discuss in \ngreater detail, that Section 505 reflects either the position of this \nbody or the current status of Animas-La Plata.\n  I am concerned with Section 505 for two reasons. First, it is not \nconsistent with the activities proposed to be conducted by the \nAdministration with the $3 million in funds it requested for Animas La \nPlata, funds which are included in this bill.\n  As I described on the floor last year, in an attempt to resolve the \ndisputes surrounding Animas La Plata, Colorado Governor Roy Roemer and \nLieutenant Governor Gail Schoettler convened a discussion process in \nOctober of 1996 to resolve issues involving the principal parties in a \ndialogue about the Animas project in order to reach consensus.\n  The Roemer-Schoettler process produced two major alternatives for \nconsideration, one construction alternative and one non-construction \nalternative. As stated in the FY 99 Budget Justification issued by the \nDepartment of the Interior for the Animas La Plata project on page 223, \n``appropriate implementation activities'' for these alternatives ``will \nlikely depend upon further direction from Congress.''\n  This body knew that. At the time members voted on the amendment I \noffered last year to ensure a thorough evaluation, Roemer-Schoettler \nwas concluding and the Interior Department was about to embark on an \nevaluation of the Roemer-Schoettler alternatives. That evaluation has \nnot yet been completed and given to Congress.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the Interior Department's Budget \nJustification for FY 99 makes clear that these analyses are not yet \nfinished. On page 226, it states that ``work proposed for the Animas-La \nPlata project includes analysis of alternatives developed during the \nRoemer-Schoettler process and other subsequent activities.'' It \ncontinues, ``depending on actions taken subsequent to the development \nof alternatives through the Roemer-Schoettler process, FY 1999 work \ncould include finishing a study of alternatives, preparing cost share \nagreements, water rights settlement agreements, and repayment contracts \nand NEPA, Clean Water Act and other environmental compliance \nprocesses.''\n  Mr. President, this justification specifically says that the Interior \nDepartment is not intending to proceed with the original full-scale \nAnimas-La Plata Project in FY 99. The Interior Department, it says, \ninstead wants $3 million in FY 99 to finish a study of alternatives \nand, depending upon Congressional action and direction, it could \nundertake a number of activities related to the implementation of \nalternatives in FY 99.\n  Not only does Section 505 require the Interior Department to go back \nto planning and evaluating the old full-scale project, it also fails to \nrecognize the strong message that the Congress, project proponents and \nproject opponents all recognize the full-scale project is dead. After \n30 years, and now more than $70 million in appropriations to date, the \nproject costs of full-scale Animas-La Plata are too great, and there \nare too many lingering substantive questions to proceed with the \noriginal design.\n  The other body has twice voted to terminate funds for the full-scale \nAnimas La Plata project.\n  Last year, 42 members of this body supported my amendment to require \nthe Interior Department to provide a report to Congress on a revised \nproject plan for Animas-La Plata that would reduce the total cost of \nthe program to the Federal Government, satisfy the Ute water rights \nclaims, and ensure that no funds were expended for construction until a \nrevised project had been authorized by Congress.\n  The Senior Senator from Colorado (Mr. Campbell) has legislation \nbefore this body (S. 1771) to modify the Colorado Ute Water Rights \nSettlement of 1988 so that the Ute's claims would be satisfied by the \nconstruction of only a portion of the facilities that are proposed to \nbe built in the full-scale project. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee \nand the Senate Energy Committee are expected to hold a joint hearing on \nthat legislation next week. I have concerns about whether that \nlegislation will actually restrict the obligation the federal \ngovernment to the construction of only a portion of the original \nproject, but I was looking forward to having that discussion in the \nappropriate venue.\n  Mr. President, I too have legislatively supported the search for an \nalternative to Animas-La Plata. In fact, legislation that I introduced \non March 13, 1997 cosponsored by the Senator from Kansas (Mr. \nBrownback), the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg), and the Senator \nfrom Oregon (Mr. Wyden) and sponsored in the other body by my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin (Mr. Petri) and the Congressman from New York (Mr. \nDeFazio), deauthorizes the current Animas-La Plata project and directs \nthe Secretary of the Interior to work with the Southern Ute and Ute \nMountain tribes to find an alternative to satisfy their water rights \nneeds.\n  With all this focus on an alternative, the Senate should not be \nrequiring the Interior Department to proceed with the current project.\n  So why is Section 505 in the bill, Mr. President? The legislative \nlanguage seems to cast doubt on the Senate's intentions, and this \nSenator can only assume that we are appropriating money for the \noriginal project because there is some need to provide those who \nsupport a construction alternative with the ultimate insurance that it \nwill be built. Should a construction alternative be infeasible, and \nfrom a policy perspective it may be so, continuing to sock money away \nfor the original full-scale project provides a rationale for proceeding \nwith the project.\n  Mr. President, I am not certain how Congress ultimately will decide \nto proceed on this matter, but we are now engaged in evaluation of \nalternatives to the full-scale Animas project. I am certain, moreover, \nthat it is within the jurisdiction of this body's Energy Committee to \ndetermine the benefits of an alternative Reclamation project. \nAdditionally, it is the responsibility of this body's Indian Affairs \ncommittee to make certain that the federal government's legal \nresponsibilities to the Ute tribes under any sort of revised agreement \nare met. We should let these hearings move forward without \nlegislatively trumping any potential for implementing an alternative \nthrough Section 505.\n\n[[Page S6540]]\n\n  This Senate should not go backward and require the Interior \nDepartment to proceed with the full-scale Animas project. We have the \npotential, if we carry on with the activities the Interior Department \nproposes to conduct, to achieve significant savings and settle the \nUte's claims. The Roemer-Schoettler process generated two alternatives, \nwhich the Interior Department is studying. What is clear is that these \nalternatives have the potential to save the taxpayers between $500-$600 \nmillion. These savings will certainly not be realized if we proceed \nwith the full-scale Animas project as required by Section 505.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the managers have accepted my \namendment adding funds for two shoreline erosion projects along the \nDetroit River. The funds provided will allow reconnaissance surveys to \ngo forward to help develop longer term plans for the important ongoing \nand comprehensive effort to revitalize the Detroit waterfront. I call \nto the attention of my colleagues that the Detroit River has been named \nby the Administration as an American Heritage River. Such recognition, \ncombined with attention from the Army Corps and other Federal agencies, \nwill assist in these redevelopment efforts.\n  The managers have also accepted my and Senator Glenn's proposal to \nclarify that aquatic ecosystem restoration funds (section 206) can be \nused for sea lamprey barrier construction. The language in the \namendment does not place a limit on the Corps' use of section 206 funds \nfor this purpose. As my colleagues may know, the sea lamprey is a \ndevastating invasive species that has plagued the Great Lakes since it \nfirst appeared and these barriers play an important role in preventing \nthis species spread and population growth. The Corps can and should \nwork with the Great Lakes Fishery Commission to place these barriers in \nthe most efficient spots.\n  In addition, the managers have agreed to accept two important changes \naffecting contaminated sediments. The first is my and Senator Glenn's \nrecommendation to increase the funds available for development of \ntechnology to remediate contaminated sediments. This is a pressing \nproblem in the Great Lakes and across the country as EPA's recently \npublished inventory of sediment quality establishes. The amount \nprovided should help us make some progress in identifying cost-\neffective means of addressing this difficult pollution issue. The \nsecond is making it clear that the Corps can and Congress desires the \nCorps to spend funds to support the National Contaminated Sediment Task \nForce. This body was first authorized in WRDA 1992, but no \nAdministration has requested funds to make this Task Force operational. \nThe lack of funding for this body to date and the resulting lack of \nattention to this important matter must be changed.\n  I would also note that the Committee has significantly increased the \nplanning assistance to states, as I and my Great Lakes colleagues \nproposed, and that the Corps should use some of this increase to \nprovide technical assistance, as authorized in section 401 of WRDA, to \ncommunities working on developing Remedial Action Plans in Areas of \nConcern.\n  Mr. President, the diversion of Great Lakes waters out of the Great \nLakes Basin is a matter of great concern to those of us from the Great \nLakes region. Earlier this year, a Canadian firm announced plans and \nreceived permission from the Ontario Provincial government, permission \nwhich has since been withdrawn, to export water from Lake Superior to \nAsia. Also, the Army Corps has been considering a permit from a company \nin Wisconsin that wants to use ground water that would otherwise \ndischarge into Lake Michigan for an industrial process then send the \nwastewater out of the Basin into the Mississippi River watershed. These \nand other activities, including litigation on the latter action, \nhighlight the need for Congress to reemphasize that existing law \nprohibits such interbasin transfers, unless the process under the Water \nResources Development Act of 1986 is followed.\n  Last year, the managers accepted an amendment I offered to prohibit \nthe Corps from using appropriated funds to permit a diversion, though \nit was subsequently dropped in conference. Senators Glenn and Feingold \nand I had discussed offering a similar amendment to the FY99 bill \nclarifying that such permitting activities on the part of the Corps, \nand indeed, all Federal agencies, are prohibited under WRDA 1986 unless \nthe Great Lakes States unanimously approve of any diversion. However, \nthe Senator from Nevada, who also sits on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, has offered his assistance on this matter, which needs \nattention and clarification when and if the Senate prepares and \nconsiders a new Water Resources Development Act for 1998. I thank him \nfor that consideration and we will await our next opportunity.\n  The Committee bill includes some other important items for Michigan \nand the Great Lakes. They include:\n  $1.5 million for Corps' public facility research and development to \ncontrol zebra mussels and other invasive species.\n  $1 million for solar thermal energy dish/engine field verification, \nwhich would support work that has been done by Stirling Thermal Motors \nin Ann Arbor.\n  $3 million for accelerated demonstration of federally sponsored \nresearch for renewable energy production and environmental remediation \nproject at the Michigan Biotechnology Institute in Okemos.\n  $.5 million for Great Lakes sediment transport and modeling. The \nCorps can use these funds to develop models to target Areas of Concern, \nsuch as the Saginaw River, for preventive measures to control future \nsediment loadings,\n  $39.95 million for operation and maintenance (mainly dredging at 24 \nharbors, rivers and channels in Michigan), including $1.9 million for \nPentwater Harbor, which was not in the budget request.\n  $.5 million to begin preparation of the general design memo for \nreplacement lock at Sault Ste. Marie.\n  $6 million for aquatic ecosystem restoration. These funds can now be \nused to construct sea lamprey barriers, per the accepted amendment \nmentioned previously.\n  $70 million more than proposed by the Committee, per the Jeffords/\nRoth amendment, for solar and renewable energy research and \ndevelopment. This is the amount in the President's budget request.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill, despite the budget constraints \nthat the managers faced in putting it together. I look forward to \nworking with the managers and other Committee members on these \nimportant matters as they proceed to Conference.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to engage my \ndistinguished colleague, the Chairman of the Energy and Water \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Domenici, in a colloquy on an \nissue which could have a tremendous impact on the economies of Paducah, \nKentucky and Portsmouth, Ohio.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the magnitude of the job \ncuts that may occur as a result of the imminent privatization of the \nUnited States Enrichment Corporation (USEC). It is my understanding \nthat upwards of 1,700 jobs might be lost once the Corporation is \nprivatized. Further, I am told that 600 jobs could be lost even if USEC \nis not privatized and continues to operate as a federal corporation. In \nan effort to mitigate the loss of jobs at the Paducah and Portsmouth \nfacilities, I have drafted an amendment to ensure that dollars \ncurrently earmarked for the cleanup of USEC generated uranium tails, \nwhich is an extremely toxic material, remain dedicated to cleaning up \nthe Paducah and Portsmouth plants.\n  Mr. President, today USEC has accrued approximately $400 million on \nits books for the purpose of cleaning up the uranium waste generated by \nthe uranium enrichment process. It is my understanding, however, that \nthis money only remains available until USEC is privatized. At that \npoint, the funds will be transferred to the General Fund of the \nTreasury. I believe it would be a huge mistake if we allowed these \nfunds to be dumped into the General Fund, while we have a tremendous \nneed for this cleanup, and funds specifically dedicated for this \ncleanup. Ensuring that these funds will be spent to dispose of USEC's \nuranium waste at both of the Gaseous Diffusion plants, will also help \nto mitigate job losses\n\n[[Page S6541]]\n\nwhich occur as a result of privatization.\n  Although I will not offer my amendment today, I would like to discuss \nit with Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. Chairman, isn't it true that since its inception in 1993, the \nUSEC has created over 9,300 canisters of depleted uranium hexaflouride, \nwith over 6,000 located at Paducah? Also, hasn't USEC carried over $400 \nmillion on its balance sheet for the clean up of this waste stream?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct, USEC does maintain a fund \nspecifically earmarked for the cleanup of this material.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would ask the Chairman of the Energy and Water \nSubcommittee what will happen to both the cleanup liability and the \nfunds, upon the privatization of USEC. Won't the Department of Energy \n(DOE) accept full responsibility for the cleanup for this environmental \nliability, as provided under the 1996 USEC Privatization Act? Also, it \nis my understanding that the funds would be transferred to the General \nFund, and no longer specifically dedicated to funding USEC's \nenvironmental cleanup? Is this accurate?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The USEC privatization legislation sets a cut-off at \nthe date of privatization. Environmental liabilities that occur after \nthe date of privatization--when USEC is no longer government owned--are \nnot the responsibility of the Federal government. Liabilities incurred \nprior to that date--when USEC is government owned--remain the \nresponsibility of the government.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I, for one, would like to see that DOE \nuse the funds, which were collected from USEC customers and currently \nearmarked for cleaning up the uranium, continue to be dedicated to \ncleanups.\n  Would the Chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee assist me in \nfinding a solution to ensure that the money earmarked, for the purpose \nof cleaning up the uranium tails produced by USEC, will continue to be \ndedicated for these purposes and help to mitigate the job losses at \nthese plants?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I agree that we need to make cleanup a priority and \nseek to apply these funds toward cleanup--they were collected for that \npurpose and should be used for such. I will work with the Senator to \nachieve this end.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2726\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I send to the desk an amendment on behalf of Mr. Dorgan \nand Mr. Conrad and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] for Mr. Dorgan \n     and Mr. Conrad, proposes an amendment numbered 2726.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 18, line 2 insert the following after the period:\n       ``: Provided further, That the Secretary of the Interior \n     shall waive the scheduled annual payments for fiscal years \n     1998 and 1999 under section 208 of Public Law 100-202 (101 \n     Stat. 1329-118)''.\n       And on page 16, line 16 strike: ``$697,919,000'' and \n     insert: ``$697,669,000''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have no objection to the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2726) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2727\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Murray and Senator Gorton, the occupant of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] for Mrs. Murray \n     and Mr. Gorton, proposes amendment numbered 2727.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 21, line 19: strike ``$456,700,000, to remain \n     available until expended.'' and insert ``424,600,000, to \n     remain available until expended.''\n\n\n                             Energy Supply\n\n       On page 21, line 2 strike ``motor vehicles for replacement \n     only, $699,836,000, to re-'' and insert ``motor vehicles for \n     replacement only, 699,864,000, to re-''\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, essentially this amendment moves the \ndollar amount for the flux reactor in your State and Senator Murray's \nState from one account to another. In the process, because of the \noutlays of one portion versus the other, the budget authority had to be \nreduced by $4 million. It has been adjusted accordingly, and we have no \nobjection.\n  Mr. REID. There is no objection on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2727) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Murray for her attention.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there are no further amendments, the \nquestion is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Short Title. This title may be cited as the \n     ``Denali Commission Act of 1998''.\n       Sec. 602. Findings. The Congress finds that--\n       (1) vast regions of the State of Alaska, while abundant in \n     natural resources and rich in potential, trail the rest of \n     the Nation in economic growth;\n       (2) roughly two-thirds of the land and associated natural \n     resources within Alaska are owned by the Federal Government;\n       (3) many Alaska communities do not have access to potable \n     water which often results in disease, and in some cases \n     death;\n       (4) the primary means of sewage disposal in some Alaska \n     communities continues to open sewage lagoons, which can \n     result in outbreaks of hepatitis, meningitis, particularly \n     among young children;\n       (5) power costs are as much as ten times higher in some \n     areas of Alaska than in the lower 48 states, which thwarts \n     economic development;\n       (6) bulk fuel storage tanks built by the Federal Government \n     in many Alaska communities do not comply with the Oil \n     Pollution Act of 1990, could, therefore, be required to be \n     closed, are used to store heating oil critical to survival, \n     and that Alaska communities presently have no way to upgrade \n     or replace the tanks;\n       (7) the majority of Alaska communities have essential \n     infrastructure needs which presently cannot be met;\n       (8) the lack of infrastructure and economic opportunities \n     in Alaska communities has resulted in disproportionately high \n     Federal costs for welfare assistance, unemployment \n     assistance, food stamps, heating oil, and other Federal \n     programs in Alaska; and\n       (9) by addressing infrastructure needs and promoting \n     economic development, the reliance of Alaska communities on \n     Federal assistance and the cost to the Federal Government of \n     such assistance could be significantly reduced.\n       Sec. 603. Purpose. It is the purpose of this Act to assist \n     Alaska in addressing its special problems, to develop its \n     infrastructure and utilities, to promote its economic \n     development in rural communities by utilizing the markets, \n     technical support, and other resources of urban areas, and to \n     establish a framework for joint Federal and State efforts \n     toward providing basic facilities essential to its growth and \n     attacking its common problems.\n       Sec. 604. Denali Commission. (a) Establishment.--There is \n     hereby established the Denali Commission which shall be \n     composed of one Federal member appointed by the President \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate, one State member \n     appointed by the Governor after consultation with the Alaska \n     Federation of Natives, the President of the University of \n     Alaska or a designee, the President of the Alaska Chamber of \n     Commerce, and the Executive Director of the Alaska Municipal \n     League. The Federal member shall be compensated by the \n     Federal government at level III of the Executive Schedule of \n     subchapter II of chapter 53 of title V, United States Code.\n       (b) Chairman; Decisions.--The Federal member shall be the \n     Chairman of the Denali Commission. Decisions by the Denali \n     Commission shall require the affirmative vote of the Chairman \n     and at least two of the other members of the Commission. With \n     respect to matters that come before the Commission, the \n     Chairman may inform Federal departments and agencies having \n     an interest in the subject matter as appropriate.\n       (c) Functions.--The Denali Commission, in consultation with \n     the Governor of Alaska, shall develop a statewide, \n     comprehensive plan for economic and infrastructure \n     development, establish priorities, approve project and grant \n     proposals, and administer funds appropriated to the \n     Commission. It shall solicit project proposals to modernize \n     infrastructure from local governments and other \n     organizations. The Commission is authorized to adopt rules \n     and regulations governing its conduct, appoint and fix \n     compensation of staff to assist the Commission, accept and \n     use gifts or donations, and enter into and perform contracts, \n     leases, or cooperative agreements. Administrative expenses of \n     the Commission shall be paid by the Federal Government and \n     may not exceed 5 percent of any funds appropriated under this \n     Act. The Commission and its grantees shall maintain accurate \n     and complete records which shall be available for audit and \n     examination by the Comptroller General or his designee. The \n     Commission shall submit an annual report six months after the \n     conclusion of the fiscal year which shall be submitted to the \n     President, the Chairmen of the House and Senate\n\n[[Page S6548]]\n\n     Appropriations Committees, and the Governor of Alaska.\n       (d) Special Functions.--\n       (1) Rural utilities.--In carrying out its other functions, \n     the Denali Commission should provide assistance as \n     appropriate and seek to avoid duplication and to complement \n     the water and wastewater programs under section 306D of the \n     Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act (7 U.S.C. 1926d) \n     and under section 303 of the Safe Drinking Water Act \n     Amendments of 1996 (33 U.S.C. 1263a).\n       (2) Bulk fuel tanks.--The Denali Commission, in \n     consultation with the Commandant of the United States Coast \n     Guard, shall develop a program to provide for the repair or \n     replacement of bulk fuel storage tanks in Alaska which are \n     not in compliance with Federal law, including the Oil \n     Pollution Act of 1990, or State law.\n       Sec. 605. Inspector General. Section 8G of the Inspector \n     General Act of 1978, as amended (5 U.S.C. appendix 3 section \n     8G) is amended in subsection (a)(2) thereof by adding after \n     ``the Corporation for Public Broadcasting'', ``the Denali \n     Commission,''.\n       Sec. 606. Authorization of Appropriations. There are \n     authorized to be appropriated to the Denali Commission to \n     carry out this Act and for necessary expenses including \n     staff, $20,000,000 in fiscal year 1999 and such sums as may \n     be necessary for each of fiscal years 2000 through 2003.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Energy and Water Development \n     Appropriations Act, 1999''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                    AMENDMENT NO. 2727, AS MODIFIED\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 2727 previously agreed to be modified with the changes now at the \ndesk. We made an error in where we put a number and we are just \ncorrecting it to what it ought to be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2727), as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 21, line 19: strike ``$456,700,000, to remain \n     available until expended.'' and insert ``$424,600,000, to \n     remain available until expended.\n\n\n                             Energy Supply\n\n       On page 21, line 2 strike ``motor vehicles for replacement \n     only, $699,836,000, to re-'' and insert ``motor vehicles for \n     replacement only, $727,836,000, to re-''.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate receives from the House of Representatives the companion bill to \nS. 2138, the Senate immediately proceed to its consideration; that all \nafter the enacting clause be stricken; that the text of S. 2138 as \npassed be inserted in lieu thereof; that the House bill, as amended, be \nread for a third time and passed; that the Senate insist on its \namendments and request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses thereon, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nthe following conferees on the part of the Senate: Senators Domenici, \nCochran, Gorton, McConnell, Bennett, Burns, Craig, Stevens, Reid, Byrd, \nHollings, Murray, Kohl, Dorgan, and Inouye; and that the foregoing \noccur without any intervening action or debate.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the bill, S. 2138, not be \nengrossed and it remain at the desk pending receipt of the House-passed \ncompanion bill; that upon passage of the House companion bill by the \nSenate, the passage of S. 2138 be vitiated, and the bill be \nindefinitely postponed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to take just a minute to express my \nappreciation for the work of the chairman of the subcommittee. We have \nworked hard to get the bill passed. It is now passed.\n  I also have expressed on the record on a number of occasions what a \npleasant arrangement the senior Senator from New Mexico and I have on \nthis legislation. I reiterate that. I also want to express my \nappreciation for the hard work done by Senator Domenici's staff, Alex \nFlint, the majority clerk, David Gwaltney, who handled the water \nproject, which is very large and significant in this bill. They are \nvery professional and work very hard. The taxpayers get more than their \nmoney's worth from these gentlemen.\n  I also express publicly my appreciation for Greg Daines, minority \nclerk, who worked very hard on this legislation for months, getting it \nto the point where we now are. I have a very important congressional \nfellow who has worked with me on this legislation and others, Bob \nPerret, who has done an outstanding job.\n  Also, I want to express my appreciation to Lashawnda Leftwich, who is \nthe staff assistant to Mr. Flint, the majority clerk in this matter, \nand also Liz Blevins, the staff assistant to the minority clerk. We \nhave, I think, a good team, a good group of people here who have worked \nvery hard together. Again, I express my appreciation to the chairman of \nthe subcommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This is a good bill we passed. It has a lot of \ninteresting and needed policy decisions, projects and programs. We will \nhave a very difficult conference with the House because they have some \nnoticeably different priorities, especially when it comes to spending \nmore money on water projects than we were able to spend. There will be \nless on research on DOE's nondefense research projects. But, overall, I \nam most particularly pleased with the nuclear part of this bill, for \nnuclear research, which we have five or six more new nuclear research \nprojects, three that the President asked for, three that we asked for.\n  You know, the United States is very much behind the world on matters \nof nuclear power and nuclear science and nuclear engineering. Frankly, \nthe world is moving in that direction. We were the beginners. We were \nthe ones who started it. We were heralded as the world's most \nknowledgeable and efficient, and we are going to play some catchup, but \ncatch up we will do, in the next decade, because nuclear power and \nnuclear energy will come back in the world. Whether America makes \npolicy decisions sufficiently to give it a chance or not, only time \nwill tell. But some decisions of the past 20 years, with reference to \nnuclear activities, have been about as inconsistent with what is \nhappening in the world as anything anyone could imagine, based on wrong \npremises, expecting action in the world that never occurred.\n  Those things are going to have to be debated. A few of them start to \nmove here. But, over the long run, there will be very significant \ndebate about what happens to nuclear power and nuclear activities in \nthe United States.\n  Right alongside that, while all that is going on that I have \ndescribed, be it negative or however one would categorize it, clearly \nthe Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship, which we are using in lieu of \nany further underground testing to protect our nuclear arsenal and make \nsure it is safe and trustworthy, is generating some of the most \nexciting new physics and science of anything going on in the world. \nIndeed, our great scientists and engineers are producing \ninstrumentation, computerization, and new methods of looking inside of \nnuclear bombs to see what is really going on so we can replace the \nright parts, since we do not make any new ones. This is all very \nexciting and is adding a great dimension of science activity while a \nvery valuable thing is being done for our country. Expensive it may be, \nbut the right thing, without question, it is.\n  With that, more will be said during the year on those issues. I \nthank, in conclusion, my ranking member, Senator Reid. I believe \nbetween us we not only work well together but I think we have helped \neach other make this bill a better bill. For that, I am very grateful \nto the Senator from Nevada, and I thank him very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6539-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6548-S6557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow begin consideration of Calendar No. 409, S. 2159, the agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I don't \nintend to object, but I just wanted my colleagues to be put on notice \nabout my\n\n[[Page S6549]]\n\nconcerns with this bill. I appreciate the work of my two Senate \ncolleagues who developed this bill, and my concerns about this bill \nactually fall with what is not included in the bill, rather than what \nis in the bill.\n  Mr. President, we have a very serious problem at the USDA that no one \nseems to be very interested in solving. As some of you may know, there \nare a number of minority farmers who filed discrimination complaints \nwith the USDA back in the 1980's and were told that the USDA was on the \ncase. In fact, they weren't and didn't intend to be. After the statute \nof limitations passed for these farmers to file their discrimination \ncomplaints in a court of law, the USDA acknowledged that they never \ninvestigated or attempted to resolve these complaints. Since the \nstatute of limitations has now passed for a number of these farmers, \nthese farmers have been left with no remedy for the alleged acts of \ndiscrimination they suffered, all because of the inaction of the USDA. \nIt seems to me we ought to address that matter at the earliest possible \nopportunity.\n  Mr. President, many here may also be aware of several provisions \nwhich took effect with the enactment of the 1996 Farm bill which have \nresulted in the denial of credit to farmers, based on a write-down of a \nprevious loan. This has a particularly disproportionate effect on \nminority farmers, even though in a number of cases it was the USDA that \nencouraged the individuals to take a write-down. This body added \nlanguage to the Emergency Supplemental earlier this year which \naddressed this problem. However, that language was taken out in a \nconference with the House. It would seem to me that the least we could \ndo here is to add that language to this bill.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I do not object to proceeding with this bill, \nbut I want to work with the Senator from Mississippi and the Senator \nfrom Arkansas to see if we can address these issues in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the unanimous consent \nrequest is agreed to.\n  The clerk will report the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2159) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies programs for fiscal year ending September 30, 1999.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Appropriations Committee staff members and fellow and intern \nbe granted floor privileges during the consideration of this bill, S. \n2159, and during any votes that may occur in relation thereto: Rebecca \nDavies, Martha Scott Poindexter, Rachelle Graves, Cornelia Tietka and \nHaywood Hamilton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to present for the Senate's \nconsideration S. 2159, the Fiscal Year 1999 Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies \nappropriations bill. This bill provides fiscal year 1999 funding for \nall programs and activities of the United States Department of \nAgriculture--with the exception of the Forest Service--the Food and \nDrug Administration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and \nexpenses and payments of the farm credit system.\n  As reported, the bill recommends total new budget authority for \nfiscal year 1999 of $56.8 billion. This is $7.0 billion more than the \nfiscal year 1998 enacted level, and $740 million less than the \nPresident's fiscal year 1999 budget request.\n  Changes in mandatory funding requirements account for the overall \nincrease from the fiscal year 1998 enacted level, principally \nreflecting lower estimated Food Stamp and higher Child Nutrition \nprogram expenses, along with a $7.6 billion increase in the required \npayment to reimburse the Commodity Credit Corporation for net realized \nlosses.\n  Including Congressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior-\nyear spending actions, this bill recommends total discretionary \nspending of $13.715 billion in budget authority and $14.080 billion in \noutlays for fiscal year 1999. These amounts are consistent with the \nSubcommittee's discretionary spending allocations.\n  Let me take a few minutes first to summarize the bill's major funding \nrecommendations.\n  For the Food Safety and Inspection Service, appropriations of $605 \nmillion are recommended, $16 million more than the fiscal year 1998 \nlevel. These additional funds are necessary to maintain the current \ninspection system and to continue to implement the Hazardous Analysis \nand Critical Control Point meat and poultry inspection system.\n  For farm credit programs, the bill funds an estimated $2.4 billion \ntotal loan program level, including $489 million for farm ownership \nloans and $1.8 billion for farm operating loans.\n  Total funding of $922 million is recommended for the Farm Service \nAgency, $11 million more than the 1998 level. Increased funding is \nprovided to maintain non-Federal staff years at the level requested in \nthe budget, preventing reductions beyond those already planned.\n  For agriculture research, education, and extension activities, the \nbill provides total appropriations of $1.7 billion. Included in this \namount is a reduction from fiscal year 1998 of $35.2 million for \nAgricultural Research Service buildings and facilities, a $24 million \nincrease for research activities of the ARS, and a $12 million increase \nin funding for the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension \nService, which includes a 3-percent increase in base formula funds.\n  For USDA conservation programs, total funding of $792 million is \nprovided, $5 million more than the 1998 level. This includes $638 \nmillion for conservation operations, $101 million for watershed and \nflood prevention operations, and $34 million for the resource \nconservation and development program.\n  USDA's Foreign Agriculture Service is funded at a level of $136 \nmillion. In addition, a total program level of $1.1 billion is \nrecommended for the Public Law 480 program, including $221 million for \nTitle I, $837 million for Title II, and $30 million for Title III of \nthe program.\n  The bill also provides a total program level of $2.2 billion for \nrural economic and community development programs. Included in this \namount is $700 million for the Rural Community Advancement Program, an \nincrease of $48 million from the fiscal year 1998 level; and a total \n$1.5 billion program level for rural electric and telecommunications \nloans, $92 million more than the 1998 level.\n  The Committee has devoted adequate resources to those programs which \nprovide affordable, safe, and decent housing for low-income individuals \nand families living in rural America.\n  Estimated rural housing loan authorizations funded by this bill total \n$4.3 billion, a $65 million increase from the fiscal year 1998 \nappropriations level. Included in this amount is $1.0 billion in \nsection 502 low-income housing direct loans and $129 million in section \n515 rental housing loans.\n  In addition, $583 million is recommended for the rental assistance \nprogram. This is the same as the budget request level and $42 million \nmore than the 1998 appropriation.\n  Over 65 percent of the bill's total funding, $37 billion, is provided \nfor USDA's domestic food assistance programs. This includes $9.2 \nbillion for child nutrition programs; $3.9 billion for WIC, including \n$15 million for the farmers' market nutrition program; $141 million for \ncommodity assistance; and $23.8 billion for the food stamp program.\n  For those independent agencies funded by the bill, the Committee \nprovides total appropriations of $1.0 billion. Included in this amount \nis $61 million for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and $953 \nmillion for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Total \nappropriations recommended for the FDA are $27 million more than the \n1998 level, reflecting the full increase requested in the budget for \nFDA rental payments and an additional $4 million more than the request \nlevel for buildings and facilities. In addition, the bill makes \navailable $132 million in Prescription Drug User Fee Act collections, \n$15 million more than the fiscal year 1998 level.\n  I would like to point out to my colleagues that the discretionary \nspending\n\n[[Page S6550]]\n\nallocations for this bill are approximately $200 million in budget \nauthority and outlays below a freeze at the 1998 levels. To provide the \nselected increases I just cited and to maintain funding for essential \nfarm, housing, and rural development programs, several mandatory \nfunding restrictions are included in the bill. Modest limitations are \nimposed on Food Stamp program commodity purchases and on acreage \nenrollments in the Wetlands Reserve Program, and restrictions are \nimposed on fiscal year 1999 funding for the Conservation Farm Option \nProgram and the Fund for Rural America.\n  In the case of the Fund for Rural America, it was a choice between \nproviding adequate appropriations for research and rural development--\nthe increases in funding recommended for agriculture research and rural \ndevelopment, including $48 million for the Rural Community Advancement \nprogram and $24 million for ARS research--or allowing the \nAdministration to decide how to spend funds for selected rural \ndevelopment and agriculture research purposes.\n  I also want to remind my colleagues that the President's budget for \nprograms and activities under this Subcommittee's jurisdiction assumes \nnew user fees will be enacted and generate a net total of over $650 \nmillion in collections to offset the discretionary spending increases \nproposed by the President. While relying on savings from new user fees \nand other legislative proposals may allow the President to claim \ndiscretionary spending levels which conform with those set forth in the \nbipartisan budget agreement, appropriations cannot be reduced until \nthese legislative proposals are acted on by Congress and enacted into \nlaw.\n  However, that is not the case and this bill assumes none of the user \nfee savings proposed in the budget. Consequently, the savings assumed \nin the President's budget are not available to this Committee to offset \nthe discretionary spending increases and new initiatives proposed by \nthe Administration. Many of these proposals have merit and are ones I \nmight support. However, this Committee must comply with the \ndiscretionary spending levels in the Bipartisan Budget Agreement and we \nhave had to make some difficult decisions as a result. We have worked \nhard to maintain funding for the programs and activities funded by this \nbill as close to the 1998 program levels as possible, providing \nincreases necessary to maintain essential personnel levels and to meet \nincreased subsidy costs where necessary to sustain 1998 loan levels.\n  Also, despite recent reports, food safety continues to be a high \npriority of this Committee. The bill recommended to the Senate provides \nthe funds necessary to ensure that American consumers continue to have \nthe safest food in the world. This bill makes no reductions in \nappropriations for USDA and FDA food safety activities. In fact, the \nbill continues the enhanced levels provided last year for activities \ndefined to be part of the Administration's food safety initiatives. \nThis includes the additional $24 million for FDA food safety \ninitiatives and $9 million for USDA food safety initiatives provided \nfor fiscal year 1998. In addition, the bill includes $3.6 million of \nthe increase requested in the fiscal year 1999 budget for USDA food \nsafety initiatives. Not included in the President's food safety \ninitiatives but equally important to the continued safety of our \nnation's food supply is based funding for the Food Safety and \nInspection Service. This bill provides fiscal year 1999 appropriations \nof $605 million for the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), $455 \nmillion more than the Administration's requested level and $16 million \nmore than the 1998 level. With the appropriations for FSIS inspection \nactivities included, this bill recommends total appropriations of \n$806.3 million for FDA and USDA food safety activities for fiscal year \n1999, as compared to the President's $380.6 million appropriations \nrequest. This does not include enhanced funding of $50.7 million for \nFDA food safety initiatives which the President proposes be funded \nthrough new user fees.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I remind Senators that this will be the \nlast time that my good friend from Arkansas and the distinguished \nranking member of the Subcommittee, Senator Bumpers, will manage this \nappropriations bill. Senator Bumpers has been a valued member of the \nAppropriations Committee for the past 20 years and of this Subcommittee \nfor the past thirteen years. The work of the Subcommittee reflects his \nintimate knowledge of the programs and activities. Senator Bumpers has \nbeen an advocate of American agriculture and a proponent of programs to \nimprove the quality of life and help bring jobs to rural areas. His \nmany contributions to this process and this bill will continue on after \nhis retirement from the Senate, but his leadership and participation in \nthe work of the Committee in the future will be missed, particularly by \nthis Senator.\n  Included in this bill is a general provision to designate the United \nStates National Rice Germplasm Evaluation and Enhancement Center in \nStuttgart, Arkansas, the ``Dale Bumpers National Rice Research \nCenter.'' The Senator from Arkansas has been an effective advocate of \nagricultural research and is the father of this ARS research center. I \nbelieve it is most appropriate to name this facility in his honor.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Bumpers, as well as all other Members of the \nSubcommittee for their support and cooperation in putting this bill \ntogether.\n  Mr. President, I believe the bill represents a balanced and \nresponsible set of funding recommendations within the limited resources \navailable to the subcommittee. I ask my colleagues to give it their \nfavorable consideration.\n  Mr. President, I urge Senators to notice in our bill some important \nefforts to contrast the process that we followed to appropriate these \nfunds with the proposal the President made when he submitted his budget \nrequest for the Department of Agriculture and related agencies.\n  A great deal of attention has been called to the President's request \nfor additional funding of so-called new initiatives in certain areas \ncovered by this bill. To propose these new funding levels, these so-\ncalled new initiatives, the President has had to assume that funds \nwould be generated for those purposes by the enactment by the Congress \nof user fees. These cover Food Safety and Inspection Service \nactivities. They also cover Food and Drug Administration activities.\n  The Congress has not enacted these user fees, and there is no \nexpectation that Congress will through the legislative committees that \nhave jurisdiction of these subjects. Therefore, that has led to the \nappearance that the committee, in its action to bring this bill to the \nfloor, has not appropriated funds that the President has requested for \nthese so-called new initiatives and additional spending programs.\n  We have not been able to accommodate the President's request because \nthe allocation of funds to this subcommittee is insufficient to cover \nboth the funding of the programs that we have had to fund in the bill, \nthe continuing programs of research and extension and education which I \nhave described so far, many of which are above the President's \nrequested level, but the additional funds that he presumed would be \navailable to this committee from user fees are not available to the \ncommittee, and therefore, for some accounts, it may appear that the \ncommittee is not funding those activities at the levels the President \npromised to secure the funding.\n  I think that explanation will serve to alleviate some concerns that I \nhave heard expressed. One was expressed in the meeting of our full \ncommittee when this bill was under consideration, that we were going to \nput in jeopardy in some way, by having the funding levels that we had \nfor food safety, the safety of school lunch food that is consumed by \nstudents at school. We have actually increased the programs that help \nsafeguard the food supply well over and above what the President had \nrequested.\n  He has suggested that funds be allocated to some so-called new \ninitiatives, but he didn't request that we have inspectors in our \npoultry and meatpacking plants, as we have to have under current law, \nto inspect those processes and those plants to be sure that the food is \npackaged and processed in a way that is safe and will result in \nwholesome, nutritious food supplies for our country. We funded that. We \nhave actually increased the\n\n[[Page S6551]]\n\nfunding above last year's levels, so that we wouldn't have to close any \nof these plants or shut them down for any periods of time that would be \nrequired if we had not come up with this funding.\n  I assure Senators that we have taken great care to make sure that the \nfunds are there for this next fiscal year for these food safety \nprograms, including the so-called HACCP program, the new program that \nhas been under development for the last several years in which this \ncommittee has cooperated to fund, so that it can bring to the challenge \nof food safety the latest in technologies and understanding and \ninformation so that we don't have to worry that we are not doing enough \nto help protect the food that is consumed in the United States.\n  I must say, too, that I think our producers and those who work to \nbring us this food supply have to be given great credit for the success \nthey have had in producing a reasonably priced, wholesome, nutritious \nfood supply for our country and, beyond that, millions and billions of \ndollars in excess of what we need in our country for export in the \nworld marketplace.\n  Senators will also know that one of the areas of emphasis in this \nlegislation is the funding of programs to help make sure that our \nexporters and our farmers are treated fairly in the international \nmarketplace, that we continue to endeavor to break down barriers to \nfair trade for American agriculture products.\n  This morning, we had an opportunity to meet with representatives of a \nnumber of national farm organizations who were here in the Capitol to \ndiscuss the problems in certain sectors of agriculture in certain \nregions of this country. The meeting was actually convened by Senator \nConrad Burns of Montana and Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas. The majority \nleader was President--was present--he may be President, not yet; he may \nbe President later. Senator Dick Lugar, the chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, was present.\n  We had 12 or 14 Senators involved in this meeting to find out what \nthe suggestions were for helping to deal with some of these problems of \nlow prices on the farm in certain areas and in certain commodities, and \nproblems in trade, problems with tax laws that operate to the detriment \nof many who own and operate our Nation's farms. It was a good meeting.\n  I say to Senators that this bill addresses many of the problems that \nwere identified in that meeting this morning. So it is responsive to \nthe concerns that we hear.\n  We do need to do a more aggressive job to take up for our Nation's \nfarmers both at home, in terms of regulations and tax policies which \nmake it hard to operate or more expensive, and in terms of trade \npolicies and national initiatives, to be sure that we have an \nopportunity to sell what we produce in the international marketplace at \ncompetitive prices, so there can be profit in agriculture and we can \ncontinue to reap the benefit in our country and our economy, in all \naspects of our economy that are related and involved with agriculture, \nof a healthy, vibrant agriculture economy.\n  We have all heard how many jobs depend upon our farmers, how many \npeople are in the processing businesses, the value-added processing of \nfood products, the transportation, the inputs that go into the farming \noperations in every rural community and every State in this great \nNation. It is a huge business enterprise. And it deserves the sensitive \nsupport of the policymakers in Washington and a department of \nagriculture that cares when there is a problem on the farm and moves \nquickly to try to deal with it.\n  I think this legislation is consistent with those aims and those \ngoals and those interests that we all have here in the Senate. I am \nhopeful that Senators will review the bill and give it their full \nsupport. And I hope Senators who have suggestions for changes in the \nbill will come to the floor and present those suggestions, and we will \nconsider them in a very careful and sympathetic way.\n  We just as soon there not be any amendments. We think this is a good \nbill. We hope Senators will agree with us. We do have some committee \namendments, and we have recommendations that have been cleared on both \nsides of the aisle for changes in the bill after the bill was \nconsidered in our committee.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table \ncomparing the committee's recommendations for fiscal year 1999 to the \nfiscal year 1998 levels and the President's fiscal year 1999 budget \nestimates be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 COMPARATIVE STATEMENT OF NEW BUDGET (OBLIGATIONAL) AUTHORITY FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998 AND BUDGET ESTIMATES AND AMOUNTS RECOMMENDED IN THE BILL FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                                                                 Senate Committee recommendation compared with (+ or\n                                                                                                                                                                         ^)\n                             Item                               1998 appropriation  Budget estimate               deg.           recommendation                             Budget            House\n                                                                                                                                                1998 appropriation  estimate  allowance\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------------------\n \n                TITLE I--AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS\n \n             Production, Processing, and Marketing\n \nOffice of the Secretary.......................................         $2,836,000          $2,941,000          $2,836,000   ..................          ^$105,000\nExecutive Operations:\n    Chief Economist...........................................          5,048,000           5,823,000           5,048,000   ..................           ^775,000\n    Commission on 21st Century Production Agriculture.........  ..................            350,000   ..................  ..................           ^350,000\n    National Appeals Division.................................         11,718,000          13,297,000          11,718,000   ..................         ^1,579,000\n    Office of Budget and Program Analysis.....................          5,986,000           6,045,000           5,986,000   ..................            ^59,000\n    Office of Chief Information Officer.......................          4,773,000           7,222,000           5,551,000           +$778,000          ^1,671,000\n                                                               ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total, Executive Operations.............................         27,525,000          32,737,000          28,303,000            +778,000          ^4,434,000\nOffice of the Chief Financial Officer.........................          4,283,000           4,562,000           4,283,000   ..................           ^279,000\nOffice of the Assistant Secretary for Administration..........            613,000             636,000             613,000   ..................            ^23,000\nAgriculture buildings and facilities and rental payments......        131,085,000         147,689,000         137,184,000          +6,099,000         ^10,505,000\n    Payments to GSA...........................................

This is a revised comparative statement of new budget \nauthority which corrects two errors in the ``FY 1999 Estimates'' column \nin the same table printed in the committee report that accompanies the \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I must also observe, before yielding the floor, that \nmy good friend from Arkansas, who is the distinguished ranking Democrat \non the subcommittee on agriculture appropriations, is helping manage \nthis bill this year, and it will be his last opportunity to exercise \nthis important responsibility.\n  He has chosen not to seek reelection in the State of Arkansas for \nanother term in the Senate. And I must say that it pains me to \ncontemplate going through the process of developing and helping to \nwrite an agriculture appropriations bill without his intelligent and \nthoughtful assistance. He has been a good friend to me since I have \nbeen in the Senate. We have worked closely together on a number of \nissues, not only in agriculture, in rural development, but in other \nareas as well.\n  I pointed out earlier in my statement that in recognition of his \noutstanding\n\n[[Page S6556]]\n\nservice for the people of Arkansas in the U.S. Senate, and particularly \nfor his work on agriculture research issues, there is included in this \nbill a general provision to designate the U.S. National Rice Germplasm \nEvaluation and Enhancement Center in Stuttgart, AR, the ``Dale Bumpers \nNational Rice Research Center.''\n  The distinguished Senator from Arkansas has been a very effective \nadvocate of agriculture research funds for this ARS Research Center. I \nthink he is the father of that center. I believe it is most appropriate \nto name this facility in his honor.\n  Also, I want to express my appreciation to him and the members of his \nstaff, and the other members of the subcommittee on both sides of the \naisle, for their assistance and support and cooperation in developing \nthis legislation. I hope the Senate will approve it.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am most pleased to join my very good \nfriend, Senator Cochran, in bringing this bill to the floor. I think \nthat, considering the constraints that Senator Cochran--who is really \nthe crafter of this bill--considering the constraints that he was \noperating under, this is a remarkable bill.\n  We were allocated, and even in the President's budget request, $1 \nbillion less than we had last year. To try to craft a bill meeting the \nreally mostly legitimate demands--or at least even funding or increased \nfunding--under that kind of a burden was extremely difficult. I did not \ninterfere--tried not to interfere very much in Senator Cochran's work \nbecause he was already burdened heavily enough in trying to fit all the \npieces of this mosaic together. But he deserves the praise and the \naccolades of every Member of this Senate for what I think is a \nremarkable achievement.\n  Mr. President, Senator Cochran has outlined the levels of funding \nprovided in this bill for various functions and programs under the \njurisdiction of this subcommittee and I will not repeat them. Let me \nsimply say Senator Cochran and I have done the best we could with \nlimited resources to maintain the activities at USDA, FDA, and other \nagencies that are so important to the American people.\n  I wish I could be equally as pleased with the budgetary hand with \nwhich this subcommittee has been dealt, but the reality is that a \nbudget request filled with user fees, initiatives, and other issues \ncoupled with a 302(b) allocation that reduced our available resources \nwell below last year's levels has produced very hard choices for us. As \nthe Washington Post pointed out in an editorial earlier this week \nrelated to the fact that our bill freezes the WIC program at last \nyear's level, until the overall budgetary parameters affecting this \nsubcommittee are adjusted, there is little this subcommittee can do. We \ncan't provide more with less.\n  However, in my view, the bill before us, which Senator Cochran has \ncrafted, makes the best of a bad situation. Would I suggest increases \nin certain programs if the resources were available? Of course I would \nand I believe Senator Cochran would agree with those increases. But it \ndoesn't take a rocket scientist to conclude that when you have less to \nwork with, something has to give. Unfortunately, this year is one in \nwhich avoiding the budget ax may itself be a victory.\n  We hear a lot these days about budget surpluses. We also hear a lot \nabout how to spend those surpluses, such as providing tax cuts. We talk \na lot about saving Social Security, but we still count those revenues \ncoming into the Social Security Trust Fund as part of that glorious \n``surplus'' which many are eager to divide up and share with their \nfriends.\n  The other day, a group of people from a very poor part of the East \nArkansas Delta were in office asking for help to reduce flooding in \ntheir communities. The flooding causes their septic tanks to back up, \nresulting in sewage floating down the streets of small rural \ncommunities and into the ditches throughout the county. When this bill \nwas considered by the full committee, I explained this problem to \nSenator Stevens and other members of the Appropriations Committee. \nSenator Stevens and others pledged to help and I hope that we will be \nable to include an amendment to this bill that will provide necessary \nfunds so these people in East Arkansas will have a few of the basic \nservices that many of us take for granted. Still, this leaves Congress \nwith the remaining problem of caps on domestic spending that is \naffecting the lives of everyday people all across this country.\n  The immediate future holds little promise for improvement. The Budget \nAct requires that the coming years will witness continuing declines in \ndiscretionary spending, which means the subcommittee's allocation will \nlikely be less next year than this and Senator Cochran's headaches (not \nmine) will be even more severe than they have been these past few \nweeks. Having said all this, let me come back to the task at hand and \nsimply state that Senator Cochran has done all excellent job in making \nthe pieces fit into a very complex mosaic.\n  As I have suggested, the watchword for this year has been \n``maintain''. This bill restores many of the worthwhile programs that \nwere deleted in the President's budget request and even provides a \nsight increase in the formula base funds for research and extension \nactivities that have been held steady for many years. Conservation and \nrural development programs are protected as best we can in spite of \nchanges in loan subsidy rates that caused severe problems in \nmaintaining last year's program levels. We protected rural water and \nsewer programs which are among the best investments the federal \ngovernment makes. We were also able to maintain many of last year's \nprogram levels for rural housing programs.\n\n  The WIC program is expected to average more than 7 million \nparticipants in fiscal year 1998. This bill provides funds necessary to \nmaintain that caseload. I wish we were able to provide a higher level, \nbut limited resources have left few options. I am willing to work with \nSenator Cochran and other Senators to find ways to provide higher \nlevels for important programs such as WIC if reasonable offsets or \nadditional resources can be identified.\n  For years, so called ``budget hawks'' have been telling Congress to \n``cut the fat''. For this subcommittee, the ``fat'' was eliminated a \nlong, long time ago. Today, we are cutting into the ``lean.'' These \ncuts hurt farmers and they hurt our agricultural research base which is \nneeded to make possible the means for this planet to avoid global \nstarvation in years to come. These cuts hurt small rural communities \nand they hurt children. They deprive our nation of a cutting edge in \nmaintaining a place in global markets. They place our food and blood \nsupply at risk and, quite simply, they harm America. This is certainly \nnot the fault of Senator Cochran, but these problems have fallen in his \nlap, and mine, and on us all. I only hope that in years to come, those \nwho would cut the ``fat'' out of these programs first explain where the \n``fat'' is.\n  I also feel it is important to make a quick reference to an item in \nthe bill that has long been near and dear to my heart as I know it is \nto Senator Cochran. For longer than we have shared a place in the \nUnited States Senate, Senator Cochran and I have shared a common state \nboundary along the banks of the mightiest river on the continent. One \nhundred years ago, the highest form of travel in this country was to \ntake a ride on a Mississippi riverboat. Ten years ago, I sponsored \nlegislation to create the Lower Mississippi River Delta Regional \nCommission. Sadly, the focus of this Commission was not to highlight \nthe gilded days of luxurious steamboat travel, or the glorious setting \nin the lobby of Memphis' Peabody Hotel, where legend holds the Delta \nbegins, but to reverse the tragic decline in economic and social \nprosperity that has resulted in harsh impoverishment up and down this \nmighty river.\n  Today, the Chairman of this Commission which we formed in 1988 now \nsits at a desk in the Oval Office of the White House. President Clinton \nsubmitted a budget amendment to this subcommittee to create a Delta \nRegional Commission based largely on the findings of the Lower \nMississippi Delta Regional Commission and in the combined spirit of us \nall to provide a better life for the most hard pressed of our citizens. \nThe President's request called for $26 million to establish and provide \nassistance to this worthy cause.\n\n[[Page S6557]]\n\n  With the limited resources of this subcommittee, we were not able to \ncreate a new ``agency'' for the Delta, but we did provide the Secretary \nof Agriculture authority to work with local groups in the region to \nhelp them help themselves. USDA holds many programs important to the \nDelta such as rural housing, water and sewer programs, conservation, \nfood assistance, research and education, and many, many more. This \nsubcommittee, over the past several years, has provided funding for the \nDelta Teachers Academy which has been a highly successful program to \nimprove educational opportunities in the region. The Delta Teachers \nAcademy is an example of the progress in rural America that USDA can \nhelp foster. I am pleased that the President has added his voice to the \ncall for rejuvenation of this region that two hundred years ago was the \nwestern border of our nation, but now lies at its heart.\n  In closing, I would be remiss not to state publicly my admiration for \nSenator Cochran and the honor I have enjoyed serving with him on this \nsubcommittee. This is my last agriculture appropriations bill to be \nconsidered on the floor of the United States Senate, but I will always \ncherish the friendship and warm memories of my colleagues.\n  Let me conclude by saying that I do not know of anybody in the Senate \nfor whom I have a higher regard and more respect than I have for \nSenator Cochran. I was chairman of this subcommittee until the \nRepublicans took over in 1995. Senator Cochran has chaired it since \nthat time. He was my ranking member when I was chairman. And I daresay, \nwith no reflection on any other chairman and ranking member of any of \nthe subcommittees on appropriations, or I daresay any other committee \nof the Senate, I doubt that any of them have enjoyed better cooperation \nwith each other than Senator Cochran and I have enjoyed, and that is \nbased on the tremendous respect I have for his ability and his \nunderstanding of these programs. I concede he understands some of these \nagricultural programs a lot better than I do.\n  But having said all of that, Mr. President, I just say it has been a \ngenuine joy to work with Senator Cochran. Let me say, again, there is \nno Member of the Senate for whom I have a higher regard and greater \nrespect. It has been a great honor. I will miss times like this when we \ncome before the Senate to present this bill. I will miss working with \nSenator Cochran on issues that we both care deeply about, but it is \ntime for me to move on. I want to thank Senator Cochran for his always \ngenerous and laudable remarks that he made about me.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I hope that Senators who have amendments \nwill come to the floor so we can dispose of this bill as expeditiously \nas possible. We did very well on the water and energy bill. I would \nlike to think we could do as well on the ag bill. If Senators would \ncome to the floor and offer their amendments, we will.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate go \ninto a period of morning business for the purpose of my making a \nstatement on an unrelated issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized to speak as if in morning business.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6548-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6557-S6559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE SEARCH FOR MODERN CHINA: THE PRESIDENT'S CHINA TRIP\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, President Clinton, as he prepares to depart \nfor China, carries with him an obligation, which I am sure he will \nfulfill, to do his best to advance U.S. core interests with Beijing and \nto communicate the values of the American people directly to the \nChinese people.\n  But what is also at stake, I think, is that there is a concomitant \nresponsibility on the part of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Congress to \nadhere to a practice that has been in place for the 25 years that I \nhave been in the U.S. Senate; that is, when a President is abroad, for \nthe Congress to refrain, if only temporarily, from acting on matters \nthat would affect the country which the President is visiting.\n  There were a number of times when President Reagan was President, \nwhen President Nixon was President, when President Ford was President, \nand when President Bush was President that I had sharp disagreements \nwith their foreign policy initiatives. But never once did I, nor can I \nremember any of us in either the Republican or the Democratic Party, \nvote on legislation that would directly affect and impact upon the \nrelationship of the United States and the country which the President \nwas visiting.\n  So I ask my Republican friends, in the spirit of bipartisanship in \nthe conduct of American foreign policy, to refrain from offering \namendments to the DOD bill, if it comes up, that are designed to \nsanction and/or publicly criticize China at the very moment the \nPresident of the United States will be in China. I hope that we could \nreturn to that period in our relationship when both parties adhered to \nthat practice.\n  There is a list of at least 12--maybe as many as 20--China sanction \namendments, some of which may very well be justified, that would be \nattached to, or attempted to be attached to, the defense bill, which I \nam told is likely to come up on Tuesday of next week.\n  I make a personal plea to my colleagues to return to the practice \nthat has been honored here on the floor of the U.S. Senate of not \nengaging in legislative action that impacts upon, or can impact upon, \nthe relationship with the country where the President of the United \nStates, be he a Republican or Democrat, is presently in place. I will \nbe sending a letter to all of my colleagues asking that they do that.\n  But to continue, Mr. President, the President's mission is not going \nto be an easy one any more than the first time President Nixon went to \nChina, or President Bush, or any other President who has engaged China.\n  It comes amid a sometimes rancorous debate over China policy in this \ncountry, and the debate is totally appropriate, I might add. I am not \nsuggesting there should not be a very serious debate, and I have no \ndoubt, because of the consequences of the actions we will take as a \nNation, it will likely get rancorous at some point.\n  I have myself asked this Congress to move into special secret \nsession, a rare occurrence, not so many years ago to debate the \nextension of most-favored-nation status to China. I did so because of \nmy concerns about Chinese proliferation activities, proliferation of \nmissile and/or nuclear technology. And so I am not suggesting the \ndebate will not be heated, and I am not suggesting it should not be \nthorough. I am not suggesting that it will not have political \nramifications. That is all appropriate, normal and reasonable. But the \nPresident's mission is going to be made more difficult as a consequence \nof the debate that is underway.\n  There is no clear consensus in America, nor, in my view, no clear \nconsensus in the Senate, on how to best advance American interests in \nthe Far East. The Governments of China and the United States will not \nalways see eye to eye, and while the people of the United States and \nthe people of China have much in common--a love of family, a thirst for \nknowledge, and perhaps most importantly, a desire to see our children \nand grandchildren live in a world more peaceful and prosperous than our \nown--we also have profound differences that cannot be overlooked.\n  In his incisive history, entitled, ``The Search for Modern China,'' \nYale historian and prominent Chinese scholar Jonathan Spence writes \nthat China is not yet truly a modern nation.''\n  Spence defines a modern country as ``one that is both integrated and \nreceptive, fairly sure of its own identity, yet able to join others on \nequal terms in a quest for new markets, new technologies and new \nideas.'' He concludes that the ``search'' for modern China is an \nongoing act.\n  I think Spence is right, and the United States cannot afford to be a \nspectator in this drama. We need to be active on the world's stage, \nengaging China as it undergoes a period of extraordinary change.\n\n[[Page S6558]]\n\n  What do we want? What is in our national interest? Good China policy \nbegins with a clear articulation of U.S. interests, beamed directly to \nthe highest levels of the Chinese Government.\n  There is virtually no debate in this country over our long-term \nobjectives. Our interests are plain. We seek a more prosperous, open \nand democratic China, at peace with its neighbors, and respectful of \ninternational norms in the area of nonproliferation, human rights and \ntrade.\n  There is considerable debate, however, about how best to achieve \nthose objectives and whether they can all be achieved simultaneously or \nwhether we will put one ahead of the other during this transition \nperiod.\n  There are some who are convinced that the best way to persuade \nChina's leaders to bring their domestic and foreign policies in line \nwith U.S. expectations is to punish them for each and every misdeed--as \nperceived by us. This punitive approach, one which I think occasionally \nis appropriate, is well represented by a raft of Chinese bills passed \nby the House of Representatives last fall, many of which have been \nintroduced as amendments that I have referenced earlier to the Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  Let me say that I share many of the concerns of my colleagues about \nthe administration's handling of China policy. As I said on the Senate \nfloor at this time last year, engagement is not a policy. Engagement is \na means to an end. It is the substance of the engagement that matters.\n  But a ``big stick'' approach to China can hardly be called engagement \nany more than yielding to China on every issue can be called \nengagement.\n  This confrontational approach, or the ``big stick'' approach, flows \nfrom the absurd notion that China is unchanging and it will only behave \nresponsibly when it is forced to do so.\n\n  I respectfully suggest and favor a more balanced approach. Obviously, \nI am being subjective in characterizing my approach as more balanced. \nAnd it is not really my approach; many share the same view I am about \nto articulate--a balanced approach that relies upon spelling out the \nrules of the road to China, inviting them to abide by them, and then \nmonitoring their compliance with their pledges to us and the rest of \nthe international community.\n  China aspires to be a great power. I welcome that aspiration because \ngreat powers live up to the great power obligation in the areas of \nnonproliferation, human rights and trade.\n  China has undergone an extraordinary change over the past 25 years, \nopening to the outside world and dramatically transforming its economic \ninstitutions and the tenor of its political discourse. China has \nevidenced increasing accommodation to international norms.\n  They have done so, for the most part, because they recognize their \nown interests dictate greater integration with the global economic \nmarkets and security regimes. We should encourage this trend, but we \nshould not hesitate to communicate our concerns both publicly and \nprivately when we think they deviate.\n  For instance, we should not hesitate to criticize China for its human \nrights violations. We should publicly encourage China to sign the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and to \nincorporate its spirit directly into Chinese law.\n  I was very disappointed when the President decided not to condemn \nChina for human rights violations before the United Nations Human \nRights Commission in Geneva. If we are not going to criticize China's \nhuman rights violations in front of an international body specifically \ncreated to safeguard human rights standards, where are we willing to \nvoice our concerns?\n  I am also disappointed that China continues to jam Radio Free Asia. \nWith the support of my colleagues in the Senate and the House, I \nintroduced legislation several years ago which created Radio Free Asia. \nRFA broadcasts reliable news directly to the people of China and Tibet, \nempowering them to hold their government accountable for its actions. \nBut RFA is being jammed by the Chinese Government. I hope that \nPresident Clinton, when he travels to China, will tune in RFA, and if \nhe can't find it on the radio, he should explain to his Chinese hosts \nthat great powers do not restrict access of their people to \ninformation.\n  We can also do more to promote the rule of law in China, bringing the \nChinese to this country to see how a truly independent judiciary \nfunctions and sending Americans to China to teach them how to create \nsimilar institutions there. The administration has requested $5 million \nfor the Asia Foundation to launch a rule of law initiative in China. I \nsupport this initiative.\n  When all else fails, the United States should not hesitate to punish \nChina by using carefully targeted multilateral sanctions. But this \nshould be a last resort, not a reflex.\n  A wise man on the Foreign Relations Committee, the Senator from \nIndiana, has pointed out the dangers of an over reliance on ill-defined \nunilateral sanctions as an instrument of foreign policy.\n  We have an important role to play in the search for modern China. We \ncan help it to its destination of modernization, or we can throw \nobstacles in its path. The upcoming summit presents an opportunity for \nthe United States and China to try to bridge some of our differences, a \nchance to transform the issues from points of contention to examples of \ncooperation.\n  We should not expect the world from a single summit. But we can make \nsome progress.\n  Perhaps no issue at the summit will be more important than that of \nnonproliferation. I said at the outset that we know clearly what our \nobjectives should be for our policy, where we want a modern China to \ngo. We don't have any misunderstanding of what we would like to see: \nChina at peace with its neighbors, respecting international norms in \nthe areas of nonproliferation, open trade, and human rights.\n  But at some point, as my dad would say, if everything is equally a \nhigh priority, then nothing is a priority. I believe that there is no \nmore important issue at this moment in the history and our relationship \nwith China than nonproliferation. The spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction and the means to deliver them represents a clear and \npresent danger to the security of both the United States and China. We \nneed Chinese cooperation if we are to find ways to promote stability in \nsouth Asia, the Korean peninsula, and the Middle East.\n  China's historic track record in this area has been poor. Indeed, \nPakistan probably would not possess the nuclear capacity it \ndemonstrated late last month were it not for the Chinese assistance \nover the past decades. China cannot escape some responsibility for \nexacerbating south Asian tensions by engaging in policies that were \nseen as threatening to India's security.\n  But more recently, China appears to have undergone a sea change in \nits attitude. China has joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the \nBiological Weapons Convention. China has also agreed to be bound by \nsome, but not all, of the terms of the Missile Technology Control \nRegime prior to it joining that regime. And, while China's export laws \nstill fall short of international norms, particularly in the area of \nmissile technology, China has been responsive to the administration's \ninterests where we have clearly articulated them.\n  Last fall, President Clinton secured a commitment from China not to \nextend any new cooperation to Iran's nuclear program. China has also \npledged to halt all cruise missile exports to Iran in direct response \nto the urging of the U.S. Government. Moreover, China's initial \nresponse to nuclear tests on the subcontinent has been constructive \nthus far. China has avoided taking any steps which might exacerbate \ntensions or fuel a regional arms race.\n  There is more, however, that China as a great power should do. As a \npermanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China should join in an \ninternational diplomatic effort designed to identify the source of \ntensions in south Asia and foster dialog between India and Pakistan and \nbetween India and China. China should lead by example, by promoting \ngreater transparency in arms exports, defense expenditures, and \nmilitary exercises.\n  China, in my view, should join the Missile Technology Control Regime \nand agree to bring its export controls on dual-use items and missile-\nrelated\n\n[[Page S6559]]\n\ntechnologies up to international standards. In addition, it should join \nthe Nuclear Suppliers Group and develop comprehensive controls on all \nnuclear-related technologies. Taken together, these steps would not \nonly contribute significantly to peace and stability in south Asia, \nthey would also serve the interests of global nonproliferation.\n  The administration has accomplished much in the last 6 years: from \nthe Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty to the Chemical Weapons Convention, et cetera. I asked, today, \nAssistant Secretary Roth, who testified before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, why that occurred. Was it merely the persuasiveness of the \nU.S. President? Was it because of the sticks as well as carrots that we \nhave offered? Or, as this emerging modern power goes through a \ntransformation, is it because they are finally determining on their own \nthat it is in their own interest not to proliferate?\n  I cannot fathom how, as a political leader sitting in Beijing, I \ncould conclude that the ability of Pakistan to launch a nuclear weapon \non the back of a missile that I had provided to them could possibly \nenhance my security. I cannot understand how anyone in Beijing could \nconclude that an arms race between India and Pakistan, and the prospect \nof what we would call theater nuclear weapons being engaged, could \npossibly do anything other than damage my security as a Chinese leader. \nI cannot imagine how they could reach that conclusion. But they have, \nin the past, reached similar conclusions.\n\n  But I think what we are beginning to see, and it is presumptuous of \nme to say this about another country, but I think we are beginning to \nsee the political maturation of a country. It is in its nascent stages, \nbut they are coming to some of these conclusions, not merely because of \nwhat we do, not merely because of our urging, but because they begin to \nsee it in their own naked self-interest. The only thing I have observed \nthat causes China, in the recent past, to act against their own naked \nself-interest is if they are put in a position of being told they must \ndo this or that.\n  So, although sanctions are appropriate in some circumstances, and \nstating our view of what constitutes great power behavior is always \nappropriate, the idea that sanctions are always appropriate when we \ndisagree with China is very mistaken and counterproductive.\n  The stakes are high. Our success or failure in integrating China more \nfully into the community of nations, our success or failure at \nconvincing China to live up to the international norms of behavior in \nthe area of nonproliferation, our success or failure in helping to \nshape the emergence of modern China as a great power, will have \nprofound effect, not only on the future of east Asia and south Asia, \nnot only on the future of Europe, but on the entire world.\n  Mr. President, about 25 years ago Fox Butterfield, the New York Times \nbureau chief in Beijing, published a book entitled ``China: Alive in \nthe Bitter Sea.'' In it, Mr. Butterfield gave a moving account of the \nefforts of ordinary Chinese people to live under the often brutal \nauthoritarian regime that existed at the time.\n  Today there remains much injustice in China, and the struggle of \nordinary people to exercise their universally acknowledged human rights \nis fought with peril. The outcome of that struggle will be central to \nthe future of the ``middle kingdom.''\n  But the changes over the past 25 years have been so profound that \nthose returning to China today for the first time since Deng Xiaoping \nopened the doors--and I went with Senators Javits and Church and others \nback in those early years of engagement--those who have gone back \nbarely recognize China to be the same country.\n  Engagement, engagement with a purpose, can bring about changes we \nseek in China, including in areas of vital importance to our national \nsecurity, but only if we are both patient and principled.\n  If we are swayed from our course by those who believe conflict with \nChina is inevitable, or if we are lulled into a false sense of security \nby those who stand on this floor and confidently predict that China \nwill automatically transform itself into a Jeffersonian democracy as it \nmodernizes, then we will miss out on an opportunity to fulfill our \nrole, as small as it may be, in the search for a modern China.\n  Mr. President, to conclude, the stakes are high. This is no time for \nthe U.S. Senate--in this significant summer, at this moment when, if \nChina concludes it wishes to devalue its currency, the situation in \nAsia could become much, much worse, when at the very moment when China \nis acting responsibly vis-a-vis Korea, we cause it to change its course \nof action; if at this moment we insist upon all of our agenda being \nmet, we can do irreparable harm to our interests.\n\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, with a final plea to my colleagues: \nPlease, please, on this critical matter of the security interest of the \nUnited States of America, please revert to the tradition that has been \ntime honored in this body. While a President of the United States is \nmeeting with a head of state of another country, do not engage in \nactivities, justified or not, that will sanction the country with which \nthe President is at that moment negotiating. That is inappropriate \nbehavior, in my opinion. That is not only partisanship, but it is \nagainst the naked self-interest of the United States, and I think it is \nreprehensible conduct.\n  I am confident my colleagues will ultimately do the right thing. We \nhave plenty of time to act on, and I may even vote for, some of the \nproposals relating to the sanctioning of China that are contemplated in \nthe upcoming bill. But, please look at America's interest first, look \nat the longstanding tradition of bipartisanship on this issue, and \nallow the President to conduct this major foreign policy foray on his \nown terms until he returns.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT.

Mr. President, I, first of all, compliment my \ndistinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, for what I \nthought was a very compelling analysis of what our relationship with \nChina is and what it should be and what the President ought to be doing \nin China in the way of engagement to improve our relationship.\n  I agree totally with everything he said. Right now, China, obviously, \nis not a democracy, though about 40 percent of her economy is private \nenterprise in the true sense of the word we cherish here.\n  We have found in the past that when nations begin to permit economic \nfreedom, usually the economic benefits that come from that become \nhighly desirable to the people, and then they begin to seek more \nfreedom, more democracy. On the other hand, you can argue that \npolitical democracy and social freedom should come first and everything \nelse will follow. I would like to believe that, but I believe in the \ncase of China, where unbelievable changes have occurred in the last 20\n\n[[Page S6560]]\n\nyears, the ordinary citizen of this country cannot even begin to fathom \nthe dramatic changes in the culture, even in the political system, and \nthe economy of China.\n  So I happen to come from the school of thought that believes that \nwhen people have economic freedom, political freedom is more likely to \nensue than vice versa. I understand all the arguments on human rights. \nAnd nobody is going to stand up, who is in his right mind, and say that \nChina does not violate human rights. Of course they do. And I do not \ncare what anybody says, under the best case scenario, you are not going \nto get the kind of democracy in China overnight that we enjoy in this \ncountry.\n  But I can tell you this. Engagement of China on these issues is going \nto be 10 times more beneficial to both their citizens and the world \nthan our sitting back with a purist attitude saying that, ``If you \ndon't do all these things we tell you to do, then we're going to quit \ntrading with each other and we're going to quit our dialog with each \nother. You go ahead and start shipping missiles to Iran. You go ahead \nand violate the chemical weapons ban which you signed in 1992. And go \nahead and violate the test ban treaty which you signed in 1992.'' Who \nwants that? Who thinks that is a good idea?\n  I am not saying China would do it, but I am simply saying we are not \ngoing to bully a nation of 1.2 billion people. And I think our chances \nof bringing them into the mainstream are infinitely better if we engage \nthem.\n  So, No. 1, I applaud the President for going to China. I have a \nlittle difficulty with the Tiananmen Square event. But if you wanted to \nsour the trip from the opening gun, just have the President go there \nwith a precondition that, ``I will not have any dialog with you in \nTiananmen Square.'' He can turn right around and get on Air Force One \nand come home for all the good he is going to do.\n  Those are the realities, Mr. President. Whether we like them or not, \nthose are the facts. And everybody who knows anything about human \npsychology knows what would happen if the President took that kind of a \nstance, which a lot of people in this body have urged him to take.\n  He should go there resolute on talking about human rights with the \nChinese and engage them on it as strongly as he can. He should engage \nthem on any suspected arms shipments or transfers of chemicals that we \nare concerned about. He should talk to them about all the violations of \nhuman rights. And he should ask them about the slave and prison labor. \nAnd he should ask them about forced abortions.\n  There are a lot of forces at work in this country, Mr. President. We \nare having a very difficult time in this country since the Soviet Union \nfell. For the last 50 years, politicians in this country have had a \nfield day hating the Soviet Union. We all have. It was a bizarre \nsituation. And the Soviet Union, while they were our allies in World \nWar II, after World War II was over, we had a very--not tenuous--\ndisastrous relationship with them.\n  And the only reason I make that point is, now that the Soviet Union \nno longer exists, we have been looking around for an enemy. We do not \ncope very well without somebody to hate, and China has been elected. \nYou cannot justify $270 billion on defense expenditures unless you have \na genuine, certified enemy. So there is a lot of that at work here.\n  I believe Eisenhower was absolutely right when he described the \nmilitary-industrial complex as a real threat to the country. It is \nalive and well. I have always chastised President Eisenhower, whom I \nadmired and thought he was a pretty good President, for not having made \nthat military-industrial complex speech when he took office instead of \nwhen he left. We are all awfully courageous when we leave office.\n  But in any event, there are a lot of people who simply cannot accept \nChina because it is communistic. Even though, as I said, 40 percent of \ntheir economy is in the free market sector, politically it still is a \nCommunist Nation. And there is no such thing as real democracy in \nChina.\n  Mr. President, there are people in this body who are going to vote \nagainst the most-favored-nation status of China because of China's \ntreatment of Christian missionaries. I read an interesting story on \nthat this week which pointed out there are 67 million Christians in \nChina and the number is growing all the time. I do not really know how \nserious the discrimination allegation about religion is in China, but I \nwill tell you, I suspect that it is exaggerated to some extent.\n  But you have these people who resent China's, at least, reluctance to \nallow all of these various religious missionaries, especially Christian \nmissionaries, into their country. So they are not going to vote for \nmost-favored-nation status.\n  And then there is, of course, this anti-Clinton segment. Some people \nhave a very difficult time giving the President credit for anything. \nAnd so if they can make President Clinton look bad by going to China to \nconsort with the same people Richard Nixon consorted with, if they can \nget any mileage out of that, they are going to take advantage of that. \nSo you have that political faction working.\n  So, Mr. President, I think the President is doing the absolutely \nright thing. I think he is going to be extremely well prepared for his \ndialog with the Chinese leaders. I personally believe that the Chinese \ncan have some influence in tranquilizing the hostility between India \nand Pakistan. And when I say ``tranquilizing,'' I am talking about \ndampening their hostility toward each other ever so slightly.\n  Mr. President, I said the other day to the Arkansas Bar Association \nthat I believe religious extremism in any form is dangerous to our \nNation and to the world. And the dispute between Pakistan and India is \nessentially a religious dispute between the Hindus and the Moslems. And \nif you look around the world--you look in Bosnia, they are all \nethnically the same, but you have Catholics and you have Christians and \nyou have Moslems. The Serbs are Russian Orthodox and Christian; and \nCroatia is essentially Catholic; and Bosnia is essentially Moslem. That \nis a volatile mix. Something close to 100,000 or 200,000 people have \ndied as a result of the hostilities generated to a large extent to \nthose religious differences.\n\n  So if China can be a force in that part of the world to give the rest \nof us a little respite, a little better feeling about our ability to \nbring Pakistan and India together--I don't think it is unthinkable at \nall for a nuclear war to break out between those two nations; \nhostilities are intense--if China can do anything at all to \n``tranquilize'' the situation, we ought to be bringing them right along \nand telling them ``do everything you can.''\n  I thought India's excuse for exploding a bomb, because they were \nafraid of China, was as transparent as Saran Wrap. China and India have \nalways been enemies of a sort, but not nearly the intensity of the \nrelationship between India and Pakistan, for example. In my opinion, \nthey were looking for anything they could get ahold of to justify what \nthey did, which is unforgivable.\n  When I think about the population of China, I was there in 1978, and \nthe population was 800 million. The population of China since 1978 has \ngrown by 400 million people--140 million more than there are in the \nUnited States--which brings me to the second part of this sermon.\n  Last night, I went downtown to receive a plaque from the Natural \nResources Council which is an organization of 72 environmental groups. \nIn my response, on a more serious note, I said I don't want to be the \nskunk at the lawn party, and I would like to think that I am a great \nenvironmentalist, but we talk about ozone depletion, we talk about \nglobal warming, we talk about building electric automobiles, and all of \nthese things we are going to do to stop global warming from occurring. \nBut the truth of the matter is we do not talk about the No. 1 \nenvironmental problem of the planet, and that is a population out of \ncontrol.\n  When I was a young 18-year-old recruit in the Marine Corps in World \nWar II, this Nation had 130 million people. So in that period of time, \nfrom the time I was a raw recruit in the Marine Corps until today, we \nhave increased our population by 138 million--268 million, compared to \n130 million. At that same time, we had 30 million vehicles in the \nUnited States; today, we have 200 million vehicles. Estimates are that \nby the year 2050 we will have 400 million vehicles. My commute time \nfrom\n\n[[Page S6561]]\n\nmy home to the U.S. Senate in the 23\\1/2\\ years I have been here has \nincreased by 12 minutes.\n  Today, we are taking 2.5 million acres of arable land that was \npreviously used to grow food to feed ourselves and to export to a \nhungry world, out of cultivation every year and we are adding 2.5 \nmillion people to the population. You do not have to be a rocket \nscientist to understand that you have a train wreck coming. On top of \nthat, our agricultural yields are becoming static. Soybean yields were \nup slightly last year, corn yields were flat; wheat yields that we have \nseen increase over the years are becoming static. We could, perhaps, \nput a lot more money into research and reverse that trend so that we \nget greater and greater yields, but isn't it amazing our priorities, \nwhen we spend $1.8 billion a year on agricultural research, and we send \n$40 billion a year down at the Pentagon for them to make things explode \nlouder.\n  Now, it is really tragic when you think about the problem of the \npopulation increase of the planet, not to say anything of the United \nStates. By the year 2100, barring an epidemic or a pandemic, we are \ngoing to be standing shoulder to shoulder on this planet. Yes, people, \nby their very numbers, are polluters. We have to be fed. That means we \nuse up our land. We have to be housed. That means we use up our \nresources to build houses. We have to be transported so we have to go \nin an automobile that puts a lot of noxious fumes into the atmosphere \nand uses up our resources at an exponential rate. On and on it goes.\n  When you start talking about the problems of the population increase \nof the planet and what it means for our grandchildren--it makes me \nshudder to think about it. I must say I take strong exception to those \nwho hold up our foreign aid spending to all of the countries who have \nfamily planning programs, when every single country that has a family \nplanning program shows the abortion rate goes down. But I don't want to \nget into the abortion debate either. I am simply saying you can shove \nthis problem under the rug, which we have been doing a magnificent job \nof for the last many years, or you can face up to it as China has tried \nto do.\n  In 1978, when I was in China the last time, they had a family \nplanning program going there. Since that time, it has worked partially \nin the big urban areas. It is not working in the rural areas. They \nstill have a culture there that you have to have children to help you \ntill the crops. You have to have children to help you do everything, so \nthey keep having children.\n  Mrs. Bumpers, just came back from Africa. She was over there trying \nto help Africans immunize their children. She was in Zimbabwe and the \nIvory Coast. She said it was the most exhilarating experience she ever \nhad in her life, watching mothers bring their babies through the hot \nsands and dust, into these clinics, where they were having what they \ncalled national immunization days. She began to give polio doses \nherself. She said it was the most gratifying experience she had ever \nhad.\n\n  She was amazed with some of the progress they are making in Africa. \nOne of the things they have done on the Ivory Coast is cut the birth \nrate, with family planning, from six per woman to four.\n  Now, here is a relatively primitive country called the Ivory Coast in \nAfrica, which seems to have a better grip on what the real problems of \nthe world are than we have. There is more to that. I don't want to take \nany more time, Mr. President. I have said all I can say about what I \nconsider to be the real problems. One of the frustrating things is--and \nI don't say this with any degree of acrimony or bitterness at all, and \nit has been a great honor to be one of the less than 1,800 people who \never served in the U.S. Senate, and I will leave here with a heart full \nof gratitude, hopefully strengthened by great relationships with many \ncolleagues. But I am disenchanted, to some extent, about our inability \nand our unwillingness to deal with some of the real problems. We do a \ngreat job of dealing with the politics of problems, but we have a tough \ntime facing up to the fact that our children are not being well \neducated.\n  I am dismayed when I think about the $50 billion or $60 billion \nsurplus we are supposed to have at the end of this year and people are \ntalking about tax cuts. I would not have any objection to that, Mr. \nPresident, if that tax cut went to the lower-income groups in this \ncountry who are still being relegated to last place. This is a personal \nopinion. One of the reasons the stock market has gone crazy in the last \nseveral years is because there is so much money floating around in this \ncountry, people have no choice but to invest it. They are not going to \nput it into T-bills when they can put it in Microsoft, or something \nelse that will pay 20 to 30 percent, or even more, than a 6-percent \nbond will. But I can tell you that all of this money that exists in \nthis country that people largely have made out of the stock market has \nnot filtered down to the bottom 40 percent of the people in this \ncountry.\n  I would vote for another minimum wage increase because every \nstatistic I have seen has shown that, No. 1, you don't lose jobs--the \ntraditional argument made against it--and, No. 2, this country is not \ngoing to be what it ought to be unless we bring other people up. Every \nstatistic I have seen in the last year is that the rich are still \ngetting richer and the poor, by comparison, are getting poorer.\n  I would be hard-pressed to vote for a tax cut for the well-off when \nchildren are going to school all over Arkansas, being taught by \nteachers who go into teaching at an entry level of $20,000. Do you know \nwhat I think, Mr. President? I think teaching is the toughest job in \nAmerica. I would rather clean the streets of Washington, DC, and carry \ngarbage than teach school. One of the reasons I feel that way is \nbecause I married a schoolteacher and I know what they go through. It \nis the toughest job in the world. They go through 4 years of college \nand get a degree in education and go into the schools of my State at an \nentry level of $20,000. If they are lucky, the next year they will get \na cost-of-living increase.\n  My daughter, who is my pride and joy, is with a law firm downtown. \nShe is not going to teach for $25,000 or $30,000 a year, and she would \nbe a magnificent teacher. There are people all over the country--men \nand women--who would be great teachers, who are not going into the \nteaching profession because it simply doesn't pay enough. When you \ncompound the fact--if you agree with me that it is the toughest job on \nearth--it surely doesn't pay enough.\n  I was doing an interview this afternoon with a prominent author here \nin Washington who is writing a book. We were talking about the American \npeople and what is going on. There is something going on in this \ncountry that nobody really quite understands. I don't. I probably \nwasn't very helpful to him because I didn't have any brilliant analysis \nof what is going on in the country. But I said, ``I think the \ndisenchantment is more a result of the way people feel that the \neducational system is failing them than anything else.'' I also believe \nthat television, which ought to be this magnificent medium of \ncommunicating and making our children so much smarter, is failing us \nmiserably.\n  Mr. President, I have gone from China to population to schoolteaching \nin all my meanderings here. But I can tell you there isn't anything \nwrong with this country that setting our priorities straight would not \ncure. Until we have an educated electorate, and until we provide an \neducation for every child in this country, not just an education at the \nelementary and secondary level, but at the college level, until we make \nthe commitment that every kid in this country gets a college education, \nor at least is not denied a college education for lack of money, don't \ntalk to me about tax cuts.\n  What makes a country great? What makes a country great is how well \ntheir people are educated and, therefore, how civil their people are to \neach other, what their conduct is. When I see people engaged in certain \nkinds of conduct you want to ask them, ``Why are you doing that?'' They \ndo it because their parents or nobody else ever told them not to. I \ncould sit here and list all day long the things that are my favorite \npet peeves. I am always saying to Betty, ``I wonder why that kid did \nthat.'' She says, ``Because nobody ever told him better.''\n  So Mr. President, I certainly am not giving up on this Nation. The \npeople of\n\n[[Page S6562]]\n\nthis country are rhapsodic about one thing, and that is that we got our \nbudget house in order. The fact that we have a surplus this year is \nnothing short of a miracle, and the people know it. But if we start \nspending it and squandering it instead of dealing with the problems we \nstill have we will be back in trouble. The other day, Mr. President, \nyou were in the Appropriations Committee when I made a short speech \nabout what a tough time we had crafting this agriculture bill.\n  I said, ``You know we don't have any money to do much of anything.''\n  A couple of weeks ago, I had a delegation come to me from the \nMississippi River delta, the poorest part of my State. Four communities \ndescribed graphically for me how, every time they have a heavy rain, \nsewage runs down the street and runs down the ditches. The health \nconsequences of that are absolutely incalculable. I said, ``I have \nlooked high and low, looked everywhere in this budget, and every other \nbudget, trying to find $2.8 million to alleviate this problem.'' \nBecause I made that speech there in the committee, I think I about got \nit solved. But I can tell you, that is going to be the greatest thing \nthat has ever happened to those people in those communities. When I was \na kid, we didn't understand why people died of typhoid fever in the \nsummer because the outhouse was just 10 steps away from the water well. \nThat is sort of the situation these people are living in.\n  Mr. President, we have a lot of unmet needs in this country, and I am \nnot voting for any tax cuts until we address those.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                  Commodity Futures Trading Commission\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I do not have an amendment. I simply \nwant to discuss very briefly an issue that I may later offer an \namendment on to this legislation, and it is an issue that I understand \nyou are also interested in, Mr. President. It is concerning the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission. The Chairwoman of the Commission, \nBrooksley Born, is attempting to reverse the current policy at the CFTC \nthat Congress directed over 5 years ago.\n  Mr. President, the issue is this. We have a $28 trillion swaps market \nin the United States. The vast majority of these swaps are privately \nnegotiated contracts. They are not traded on any exchange; they are \nprivately negotiated contracts. The business has grown rapidly in the \nlast few years. It has become an important financial tool for \ninstitutions to hedge their risks. But, clearly, it is not a trading \nissue, this is a--it is redundant to say--privately traded issue. These \nare swaps between those companies.\n  Yet, the CFTC now has under review a ``concept release''--a good \nbureaucratic term--a ``concept release'' to regulate these privately \nnegotiated instruments. Essentially, the CFTC wants to vastly broaden \nits regulatory authority over a multitrillion-dollar market. The \nproblem is that these are negotiations, again, between private firms. \nFurthermore, if one of the parties in the contract is a bank, these \nproducts are regulated by the bank regulators. And we do not need a \ndual regulation.\n  The result of the CFTC action will be that a trillion-dollar industry \nwill, very simply, be driven out of this country. It will be driven \noverseas.\n  In case anyone thinks that this is just my opinion, in a move that I \nhave rarely seen in Washington--we certainly haven't been seeing \nlately--in an incredible move, Chairman Greenspan, Secretary Rubin, and \nSecretary Arthur Levitt issued a joint statement saying they have \n``grave concerns'' with what is being proposed to be done by Ms. Born.\n  How often do you see the three principal financial regulators of the \ncountry come together to express grave concern over an issue and rebuke \nanother financial regulator? You simply do not see it happen. They are \nconcerned, and the potential for great loss to this country is just \ntantamount to it happening.\n  The Treasury Department has even gone to such lengths as to formally \nsend legislation to the Congress to stop this potential regulation. It \nis the Treasury Department under Secretary Rubin, and they may even go \nto such lengths to stop it.\n  I want to, if I may, Mr. President, read a joint statement. This \nstatement was issued by Mr. Rubin, Mr. Greenspan, and Mr. Levitt.\n\n       On May 7, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \n     (``CFTC'') issued a concept release on over-the-counter \n     derivatives. We have grave concerns about this action and its \n     possible consequences. The OTC derivatives market is a large \n     and important global market. We seriously question the scope \n     of the CFTC's jurisdiction in this area, and we are very \n     concerned about reports that the CFTC's action may increase \n     the legal uncertainty concerning certain types of OTC \n     derivatives.\n       The concept release raises important public policy issues \n     that should be dealt with the entire regulatory community \n     working with Congress, and we are prepared to pursue, as \n     appropriate, legislation that would provide greater certainty \n     concerning the legal status of OTC derivatives.\n\n  Furthermore, Chairman Jim Leach of the House Banking Committee has \nintroduced similar legislation.\n  To me, the agreement of this number of people on one issue is \nunprecedented. We need to wake up and realize that we have a rogue \nregulator--I know of no nicer way to put it--at the CFTC that is \nthreatening to drive a trillion-dollar business out of the United \nStates.\n  My amendment, if I introduce it, would simply state that no final \nrule on this can be promulgated during fiscal year 1999. This is the \namendment that I have contemplated.\n  Mr. President, this is a very complex subject. We do not need to rush \nto judgment. It needs thorough and careful review. It is not the type \nof thing that attracts a lot of attention on the Senate or the House \nfloor. As we said, it is not a subject that is easily understood. But \neven for those who do not understand it, Secretary Rubin, Chairman \nGreenspan, and Secretary Levitt all agree with House Banking Committee \nChairman Jim Leach that it is a dangerous direction that Ms. Born is \nheading and one that we should not be going in.\n  It is simply time for us to stop and give us a year to review the \nimplications of what she is talking about. And, further, the CFTC is up \nfor reauthorization next year anyway. If it needs to be done, that \nwould be the time to do it, and we could address it at that time.\n  Mr. President, I thank you. I look forward to working with you on \nthis program.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2729\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ACLU; and\n       Whereas, The Internet is in a developing stage and software \n     developments and other market forces may eventually allow \n     Internet providers to provide clean Internet services\n\n[[Page S6564]]\n\n     or products that will protect children from the harms of the \n     Internet and permit users to block out offensive materials \n     and services without compromising the beneficial aspects of \n     the Internet; and\n       Whereas, The technology currently exists to more readily \n     control these problems by the use of designated top-level \n     domain site for web sites that contain pornographic and \n     adult-oriented materials and services which if employed will \n     expedite and facilitate the development of clean Internet \n     materials and services by the lawful classification of web \n     sites; and\n       Whereas, In October of this year, the United States \n     Department of Commerce plans to set up a private not-for-\n     profit corporation whose directors will create five new top-\n     level domains that will register web sites by subject type; \n     and\n       Whereas, A federal requirement that an adult-oriented \n     domain site be created and that all adult-oriented web sites \n     be registered to such domain would greatly aid Internet \n     users, parents and teachers in shielding America's youth from \n     the harms of pornography and adult-oriented materials and \n     services that are available and proliferating on the \n     Internet; and\n       Whereas, The states are somewhat limited in the regulation \n     they can provide in this area because of the federal Commerce \n     Clause; and\n       Whereas, Congress and the Executive Branch are the \n     appropriate governmental branches to provide leadership in \n     this area and may lawfully act to resolve quickly this issue \n     in a responsible manner that comports with the ideals of the \n     First Amendment; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the One-hundredth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the House of \n     Representatives Concurring, That this Body hereby urges the \n     United States Congress to establish and maintain a uniform \n     resource locator system that contains a top-level domain for \n     all Internet web sites providing pornographic or adult-\n     oriented materials or services so as to facilitate and assist \n     Internet users, services providers and software developers to \n     manage the problem of uncontrolled access to obscenity, child \n     pornography and other adult-oriented materials and services \n     via Internet. Be it\n       Further Resolved, That this Body respectfully urges the \n     President and Vice President of the United States and the \n     Secretary of the Department of Commerce to use their offices \n     and considerable influence to bring about the aims of this \n     resolution by the means of executive order or department \n     regulation, or the promotion of federal regulation, as they \n     deem appropriate. Be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Clerk of the Senate deliver \n     enrolled copies of this resolution to each member of the \n     Tennessee delegation, to the United States Senate and the \n     United States House of Representatives, to the Chairman of \n     the United States Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation \n     Committee and the United States House Commerce Committee, and \n     to the President and Vice President of the United States and \n     the Secretary of the United States Department of Commerce.\n                                  ____\n\n  POM-486. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of the State \nof Tennessee; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 525\n\n       Whereas, House Resolution No. 2912 of the 105th U.S. \n     Congress was introduced in 1997 to reinstate payments under \n     Medicare for home health services relating to venipuncture \n     for the express purpose of obtaining blood samples; and\n       Whereas, the legislation also requires the Secretary of the \n     Department of Health and Human Services to study potential \n     fraud and abuse under the Medicare program with respect to \n     such services; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Health and Human Services study \n     calls for an examination of critical aspects of the Medicare \n     program as it pertains to venipuncture services, along with \n     the cost to beneficiaries if payment under the Medicare \n     program is prohibited for such home health services; and\n       Whereas, the Department is also directed under the \n     legislation to determine the costs to states through the \n     potentially increased use of personal care services and \n     nursing home placements as a result of Medicare not covering \n     venipuncture procedures; and\n       Whereas, such services are vitally important in the \n     diagnosis and treatment of many catastrophic illnesses, which \n     if left undetected will result in increased future Medicare \n     expenditures; and\n       Whereas, as citizens of this country continue to be \n     unreasonably burdened by spiraling medical costs, the \n     availability of adequate medical care is critical to their \n     well-being; and it is incumbent upon the members of this \n     Legislative Body to express our unflagging support for this \n     significant legislation; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the One-\n     hundredth General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the \n     Senate Concurring, That this General Assembly hereby \n     memorializes the U.S. Congress to act expeditiously to enact \n     the Medicare Venipuncture Fairness Act. Be it\n       Further Resolved, That this General Assembly memorializes \n     each member of the U.S. Congress from Tennessee to utilize \n     the full measure of his or her influence to effect the \n     enactment of the Medicare Venipuncture Fairness Act. Be it\n       Further Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives is directed to transmit a certified copy of \n     this resolution to the Honorable Bill Clinton, President of \n     the United States; the President and the Secretary of the \n     U.S. Senate; the Speaker and the Clerk of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives; and to each member of the Tennessee \n     delegation to the U.S. Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6563-7", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. NICKLES:\n       S. 2187.

A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to ensure that no \nState may establish, maintain, or enforce on behalf of any electric \nutility an exclusive right to sell electric energy or otherwise unduly \ndiscriminate against any consumer who seeks to purchase electric energy \nin interstate commerce from any supplier; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    the electric consumer choice act\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Electric \nConsumer Choice Act. For the last two years hearings and workshops have \nbeen held in both the House and Senate examining the issue of \nrestructuring the electric industry. Many bills have been introduced on \nthis issue by both Congressmen and Senators, some comprehensive and \nsome dealing with more discreet issues such as repeal of the Public \nUtility Holding Company (PUHCA) or repeal of the Public Utility \nRegulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA). The bill that I am introducing \ntoday cuts to the heart of the issue: do we or don't we support \nallowing consumers to choose their electric supplier? Do we or don't we \nsupport a national competitive market in electricity? I believe the \nanswer to these questions is a resounding ``yes''! This Congress \nbelieves competition is good, that free markets work and that every \nAmerican will benefit from a competitive electric industry.\n\n[[Page S6565]]\n\n  The Electric Consumer Choice Act is intended to begin the process of \nachieving a national, competitive electricity market. It will establish \nconsumer choice of electric suppliers as a goal this Congress firmly \nsupports. It achieves this in a simple, straight-forward method. First, \nit eliminates electric monopolies by prohibiting the granting of \nexclusive rights to sell to electric utilities. Second, it prohibits \nundue discrimination against consumers purchasing electricity in \ninterstate commerce. Third, it provides for access to local \ndistribution facilities and finally, it allows a state to impose \nreciprocity requirements on out-of-state utilities. The bill also makes \nit clear that nothing in this act expands the authority of the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC) or limits the authority of a state \nto continue to regulate retail sales and distribution of electric \nenergy in a manner consistent with the Commerce Clause of the United \nStates Constitution.\n  The premise of this bill is that all attributes of today's electric \nenergy market--generation, transmission, distribution and both \nwholesale and retail sales--are either in or affect interstate \ncommerce. Therefore, any State regulation of these attributes that \nunduly discriminates against the interstate market for electric power \nviolates the Commerce Clause unless such State action is protected by \nan act of Congress.\n  The Supreme Court has interpreted Part II of the Federal Power Act \n(FPA) as protecting State regulation of generation, local distribution, \nintrastate transmission and retail sales that unduly discriminates \nagainst the interstate market for electric power. The Court has \nreasoned that Congress, in the FPA, determined that the federal \ngovernment needed only to regulate wholesale sales and interstate \ntransmission in order to adequately protect interstate commerce in \nelectric energy. Thus, all other aspects of the electric energy market \nwere reserved to the States and protected from challenges under the \nCommerce Clause. The Electric Consumer Choice Act amends the FPA to \neliminate the protection provided for State regulation that \nestablishes, maintains, or enforces an exclusive right to sell electric \nenergy or that unduly discriminates against any consumer who seeks to \npurchase electric energy in interstate commerce.\n  This bill provides consumers and electric energy suppliers with the \nmeans to achieve retail choice in all States by January 1, 2002. It \ndoes not impose a federal statutory mandate on the States. It does not \npreempt the States' traditional jurisdiction to regulate the aspects of \nthe electric power market in the reserved realm--generation, local \ndistribution, intrastate transmission, or retail sales--it merely \nlimits the scope of what the States can do in that realm. It does not \nexpand or extend FERC jurisdiction into the aspects of traditional \nState authority.\n  As I stated earlier, this bill is intended to provide every consumer \na choice when it comes to electricity suppliers. It is intended to \nestablish that this Congress supports national competition when it \ncomes to the generation of electricity. It is intended to be the \nbeginning, not the end of the process. There are many other issues that \nneed to be addressed at the federal level to facilitate a national \nmarket for electricity. Some of these issues include repeal of PURPA \nand PUHCA, taxation differences between various electric providers, \nclarification of jurisdiction over transmission, ensuring reliability, \nproviding for inclusion of Power Marketing Administrations and the \nTennessee Valley Authority in a national market, and other issues that \ncan only be addressed at the Federal level. These issues need to be \naddressed and should be addressed. But while these issues are being \ndebated we should ensure that progress towards customer choice \nproceeds.\n  I am proud to say that my state of Oklahoma has been in the forefront \nof opening up it's electricity markets to competition. Seventeen other \nstates have also moved to open their markets. It is my hope that the \nElectric Consumer Choice Act will facilitate this process nationally. \nTo that end, I am introducing this bill today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Electric Consumer \nChoice Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2187\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (a) the opportunity for all consumers to purchase electric \n     energy in interstate commerce from any supplier is essential \n     to a dynamic, fully integrated and competitive national \n     market for electric energy.\n       (b) the establishment, maintenance or enforcement of \n     exclusive rights to sell electric energy and other State \n     action which unduly discriminates against any consumer who \n     seeks to purchase electric energy in interstate commerce from \n     any supplier constitute an unwarranted and unacceptable \n     discrimination against and burden on interstate commerce;\n       (c) in today's technologically driven marketplace there is \n     no justification for the discrimination against and burden \n     imposed on interstate commerce by exclusive rights to sell \n     electric energy or other State action which unduly \n     discriminates against any consumer who seeks to purchase \n     electric energy in interstate commerce from any supplier; \n     and,\n       (d) the electric energy transmission and local distribution \n     facilities of the nation's federally-owned, investor-owned \n     and self-regulated utilities are essential facilities for the \n     conduct of a competitive interstate retail market in electric \n     energy in which all consumers have the opportunity to \n     purchase electric energy in interstate commerce from any \n     supplier.\n\n     SEC. 3. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to ensure that nothing in the \n     Federal Power Act or any other federal law exempts or \n     protects from Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the \n     Constitution of the United States exclusive rights to sell \n     electric energy or any other State actions which unduly \n     discriminate against any consumer who seeks to purchase \n     electric energy in interstate commerce from any supplier.\n\n     SEC. 4. SCOPE OF STATE AUTHORITY UNDER THE FEDERAL POWER ACT.\n\n       Section 201 of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. Sec. 824) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, \n     nothing in this Part or any other federal law shall be \n     construed to authorize a State to--\n       ``(1) establish, maintain, or enforce on behalf of any \n     electric utility an exclusive right to sell electric energy; \n     or,\n       ``(2) otherwise unduly discriminate against any consumer \n     who seeks to purchase electric energy in interstate commerce \n     from any supplier.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. ACCESS TO TRANSMISSION AND LOCAL DISTRIBUTION \n                   FACILITIES.\n\n       No supplier of electric energy, who would otherwise have a \n     right of access to a transmission or local distribution \n     facility because such facility is an essential facility for \n     the conduct of interstate commerce in electric energy, shall \n     be denied access to such facility or precluded from engaging \n     in the retail sale of electric energy on the grounds that \n     such denial or preclusion is authorized or required by State \n     action establishing, maintaining, or enforcing an exclusive \n     right to sell, transmit, or locally distribute electric \n     energy.\n\n     SEC. 6. STATE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE RECIPROCITY REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       Part II of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. Sec. 824) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 215. STATE AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE RECIPROCITY \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       ``A State or state commission may prohibit an electric \n     utility from selling electric energy to an ultimate consumer \n     in such State if such electric utility or any of its \n     affiliates owns or controls transmission or local \n     distribution facilities and is not itself providing unbundled \n     local distribution service in a State in which such electric \n     utility owns or operates a facility used for the generation \n     of electric energy.''.\n\n     SEC. 7. SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to--\n       (a) authorize the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \n     regulate retail sales or local distribution of electric \n     energy or otherwise expand the jurisdiction of the \n     Commission, or,\n       (b) limit the authority of a State to regulate retail sales \n     and local distribution of electric energy in a manner \n     consistent with Article I, Section 8, Clause 3 of the \n     Constitution of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATES.\n\n       Section 5 and the amendment made by section 4 of this Act \n     take effect on January 1, 2002. The amendment made by section \n     6 of this Act takes effect on the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. \n        Stevens):\n  S. 2188. A bill to amend section 203(b) of the National Housing Act \nrelating to the calculation of downpayments; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n[[Page S6566]]\n\n                 family home owners mortgage equity act\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I, and my fellow Senator from the \nState of Alaska, Senator Stevens, and my good friends and colleagues \nfrom the State of Hawaii, Senator Inouye and Senator Akaka, are \nintroducing a very important measure--one that would unlock and open \nthe door to many first-time home buyers.\n  As we are all aware, it is often the downpayment that is the largest \nimpediment to home ownership for first-time home buyers. The Federal \nHousing Administration (FHA) began a pilot program two years ago to \nhelp families overcome that impediment by lowering the downpayment \nnecessary for an FHA home mortgage.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to say that the pilot program, which is \nlocated in Alaska and Hawaii, has reported great success.\n  This pilot program is effective because it accomplishes two feats: \n(1) it lowers the FHA downpayment, making it more affordable; and (2) \nit makes the FHA downpayment calculation easier and more understandable \nfor all parties to the transaction. The pilot program, commonly called \nthe ``97 percent Loan-to-Value Program,'' requires--on average--only a \nminimum cash investment of three percent for home buyers.\n  Our bill amends section 203(b) of the National Housing Act by \nchanging the current multi-part formula to a single calculation \nformula. The simplified formula creates a lower, more affordable \ndownpayment while simultaneously simplifying the current, cumbersome \nloan calculation formula. Our bill would extend this lower and \nsimplified downpayment rate to perspective home buyers across the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, the pilot program is a win-win situation: affordable \nhomes are made available to responsible buyers without any increase in \nmortgage default rates. Here's what mortgage lenders have reported:\n\n       There is no indication of increase in risk. The loans we \n     have made to date have been to borrowers with excellent \n     credit records and stable employment, but not enough \n     disposable income to accumulate the cash necessary for a high \n     downpayment.--Richard E. Dolman, Manager, Seattle Mortgage, \n     Anchorage Branch.\n       Is the 97% program working? The answer is a resounding YES! \n     . . . In this current day, it takes two incomes to meet basic \n     needs. To come up with a large downpayment is increasingly \n     difficult, especially for those just starting out. The 3% \n     program is a good start . . . I do no believe that lowering \n     the downpayment increased our risk. . .-- Nancy A. \n     Karriowski, Alaska Home Mortgage, Inc., Anchorage, Alaska.\n       We have experienced nothing but positive benefits from the \n     FHA Pilot Program Loan Calculation in Alaska and Hawaii.--\n     Roger Aldrich, President, City Mortgage, Corporation, \n     Anchorage, Alaska.\n       We support the new loan calculation, as this has provided a \n     step toward the goal of homeownership for everyone . . . We \n     do not feel that there is a greater risk with the borrower \n     putting 3 percent down rather than using the calculation \n     under the standard program . . .--Lorna Gleason, Vice \n     President, National Bank of Alaska.\n\n  Home buyers under the pilot program agree. Vicki Case of Palmer, \nAlaska is a single parent and a mortgage lender who earned too much to \nqualify for any of the low-income mortgage programs. She would have \nbeen unable to purchase her home had it not been for an FHA loan with \nthe reduced down payment.\n  In fact, but for the pilot program, approximately 70 percent of the \nFHA loan applications processed in Vicki Case's office would be \nrejected. simply because the buyer could not afford the downpayment. \nMr. President, thanks to this pilot program, more and more deserving \nAlaskans are becoming home owners.\n  Mr. President, our legislation has the support of the Mortgage \nBankers Association of America, the National Association of Realtors, \nthe National Association of Home Builders and the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. They believe, as I do, that borrowers in \nall states should benefit from the simplification of the FHA \ndownpayment calculation.\n  I firmly believe that helping American families realize their dream \nof home ownership is vital to the Nation as a whole. Our bill, by \ncreating a lower FHA downpayment, does much to assist families in \nowning their first home--thereby making the American dream of home \nownership a reality.\n  Mr. President, for details on how the new calculation works in \ncomparison to the current calculation, I ask unanimous consent to \nsubmit into the Record a downpayment calculation comparison sheet. And \nI ask that my colleagues join Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, Senator \nAkaka, and me in supporting this important legislation.\n  There being no objection, the item was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  FHA Downpayment Comparison Sheet--the Current Mortgage Calculation \n                 Versus the Alaska/Hawaii Pilot Program\n\n       A. The current FHA mortgage calculation requires numerous \n     steps. They are as follows:\n       Step 1: Determine the acquisition cost by adding closing \n     costs to sales price [many times the closing costs must be \n     estimated; if they are and the estimate changes during \n     processing, then the calculations must be redone.]\n       Step 2: Apply the loan formulation to acquisition cost: (a) \n     97% of the $25,000, (b) 95% of the amount between $25,001 and \n     $125,000, and (c) 90% of the amount in excess of $125,000.\n       Step 3: Determine the maximum LTV by multiplying the \n     appraised value [minus closing costs] by 97.75%. If the \n     property is valued at $50,000 or less, then multiply by \n     98.75%.\n       Step 4: To determine the maximum FHA mortgage amount, take \n     the lower amount from steps 2 and 3. The difference between \n     the mortgage amount and the acquisition cost is the \n     downpayment.\n       The simplified calculation currently utilized for FHA \n     projects in Alaska and Hawaii is basic, common sense:\n       The downpayment is based on a percent of home's sale price. \n     If a home is valued at $50,000 or less, the downpayment will \n     equal 98.75 percent of the value of the home, subtracted from \n     the total costs of the sale of the home (the value of the \n     home plus closing costs). For homes that are valued at \n     $50,000 to $125,000 the downpayment will equal 97.65 percent \n     of the value of the home subtracted from the total cost of \n     the sale of home. And for homes that are valued over \n     $125,000, the downpayment will be 97.15 percent of the home \n     subtracted from the total cost of the sale of the home.\n       For example: If a home sells for $98,000 and its closing \n     costs are $2,000, the total acquisition cost of the home is \n     100,000. To calculate a downpayment, 97.65 percent of the \n     cost of the 98,000 home (which equals $85.697) is subtracted \n     from the total cost of the home--the sales price plus its \n     closing costs. Therefore, the downpayment would be $4,303 \n     ($100,000 - 95,697).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 2189. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nauthorize the use of State revolving loan funds for construction of \nwater conservation and quality improvements; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n             Water Conservation and Quality Incentives Act\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, twenty-five years after enactment of \nthe Clean Water Act, we still have not achieved the law's original goal \nthat all our nation's lakes, rivers and streams would be safe for \nfishing and swimming.\n  After 25 years, it's time for the next generation of strategies to \nsolve our remaining water quality problems. We need to give States new \ntools to overcome the new water quality challenges they are now facing.\n  The money that has been invested in controlling water pollution from \nfactories and upgrading sewage treatment plants has gone a long way to \ncontrolling these urban pollution sources. In most cases, the remaining \nwater quality problems are no longer caused by pollution spewing out of \nfactory pipes. Instead, they are caused by runoff from a myriad of \nsources ranging from farm fields to city streets and parking lots.\n  In my home State of Oregon, more than half of our streams don't fully \nmeet water quality standards. And the largest problems are \ncontamination from runoff and meeting the standards for water \ntemperature.\n  In many cases, conventional approaches will not solve these problems. \nBut we can achieve water temperature standards and obtain other water \nquality benefits by enhancing stream flows and improving runoff \ncontrols.\n  A major problem for many streams in Oregon and in many other areas of \nthe Western United States is that water supplies are fully appropriated \nor over-appropriated. There is currently no extra water to spare for \nincreased stream flows.\n  We can't create a new water to fill the gap. But we can make more \nwater available for this use through increased water conservation and \nmore efficient use of existing water supplies.\n  The key to achieving this would be to create incentives to reduce \nwasteful water use.\n\n[[Page S6567]]\n\n  In the Western United States, irrigated agriculture is the single \nlargest user of water. Studies indicate that substantial quantities of \nwater diverted for irrigation do not make it to the fields, with a \nsignificant portion lost to evaporation or leakage from irrigation \ncanals.\n  In Oregon and other States that recognize rights to conserved water \nfor those who conserve it, irrigators and other water users could gain \nrights to use conserved water while also increasing the amount of water \navailable for other uses by implementing conservation and efficiency \nmeasures to reduce water loss.\n  The Federal government can play a role in helping meet our nation's \nchanging water needs. In many Western States, water supply problems can \nbe addressed by providing financial incentives to help water users \nimplement cost effective water conservation and efficiency measures \nconsistent with State water law.\n  And, we can improve water quality throughout the nation by giving \ngreater flexibility to States to use Clean Water Act funds to control \npolluted runoff, if that's where the money is needed most.\n  Today, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, Senator Burns, in \nintroducing legislation to authorize the Clean Water State Revolving \nFund program to provide loans to water users to fund conservation \nmeasures or runoff controls. States would be authorized, but not \nrequired, to use their SRF funds for these purposes. Participation by \nwater users, farmers, ranchers and other eligible loan recipients would \nalso be entirely voluntary.\n  The conservation program would be structured to allow participating \nusers to receive a share of the water saved through conservation or \nmore efficient use, which they could use in accordance with State law. \nThis type of approach would create a win/win situation with more water \navailable for both the conservers and for instream flows. And, by using \nthe SRF program, the Federal seed money would be repaid over time and \ngradually become available to fund conservation or other measures to \nsolve water quality problems in other areas.\n  My proposal has the support of the Farm Bureau, Oregon water users, \nthe Environmental Defense Fund and the Oregon Water Trust.\n  I urge my colleagues to support giving States greater flexibility to \nuse their Clean Water funds for water conservation or runoff control \nwhen the State decides that is the best way to solve water quality \nproblems and the water users voluntarily agree to participate.\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my \ncolleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, to introduce the Water \nConservation and Quality Incentives Act, a bill to revise the state \nrevolving fund in the Clean Water Act. This is language that Senator \nWyden and I have collaborated on to bring some sense of additional \nconservation of water resources to the many irrigation districts in the \nnation.\n  In the west, irrigators are by far the largest water users. These are \nfolks who need the water because of the various crops that they have on \nthe ground in the states out west. Unfortunately a large portion of the \nwater that is used in irrigation is by nature displaced due to seepage \nwithin the canals and ditches in which the water flows. Although the \nwater is not lost, since it seeps into the soil and assists in the \noverall soil moisture, it is not immediately available to the \nirrigator. However, it is water which could be more effectively used to \nprovide additional water to the producer.\n  In most irrigation districts, irrigators pay for water that is \nreleased to them, and any displacement of this water does not help that \nproducer on the bottom line. At a time when prices are low and markets \nare questionable, it is important that we give tools to the producer to \nmake sure that they have every opportunity to stay in business.\n  A key underlying feature of the legislation, is that the water saved \nunder the proposal in this bill will not only assist the producer in \nwater and cost savings, but also will assist the future of water in the \nmany rivers and streams in the west. At a time when the federal \ngovernment seems to be taking steps to reduce state involvement in \nwater rights this is extremely important.\n  The proposal put forth in this bill, will authorize the Clean Water \nState Revolving Fund to provide loans to irrigation districts to \nconstruct pipelines and develop additional conservation measures. The \nstates would have an option in this measure, they would not have to \ninvolve their funds in this matter, but would allow them to do so if \nthey so elected. In addition, those districts who did so elect to \ninvolve themselves would be able to add to their supply of water the \ndifference between what they were using prior to the plan and what they \nwere able to save.\n  This bill creates a win/win situation both for water users and for \nthe multiple users of water in our states, particularly Oregon and \nMontana. We have an opportunity here to do something useful and \nworthwhile for the irrigators and the fishing, boating and those who \nuse instream water. I would like to thank Senator Wyden for his work on \nthis measure and I am pleased to work with him today on this issue of \ngreat importance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 2190. A bill to authorize qualified organizations to provide \ntechnical assistance and capacity building services to microenterprise \ndevelopment organizations and programs and to disadvantaged \nentrepreneurs using funds from the Community Development Financial \nInstitutions Fund, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n THE PROGRAM FOR INVESTMENT IN MICRO-ENTREPRENEURS (PRIME) ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator \nDomenici, Senator Kerry, and Senator Bingaman in introducing the ``The \nProgram for Investment in Micro-Entrepreneurs'' Act--the PRIME Act. \nThis legislation will encourage investment in micro-entrepreneurs by \nsupporting the kinds of education and training needed to help build new \nsmall businesses.\n  Today, the nation's entrepreneurial spirit is thriving, fueled by the \nextraordinary economic growth and prosperity we currently enjoy. But \nnew entrepreneurs still face challenges that limit their ability to \nturn innovative ideas into successful businesses and create new jobs. \nThey deserve assistance in learning the basics to take their ideas to \nthe next level--starting their own firms.\n  The ``PRIME'' Act is designed to help small entrepreneurs bridge the \ngap between worthwhile ideas and successful businesses. It will offer \n$105 million over the next five years to build business skills in key \nareas such as record-keeping, planning, management, marketing and \ncomputer technology.\n  The Clinton Administration strongly supports these initiatives. The \nTreasury Department's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund \nhas become a lead agency for micro-enterprise activities across the \ncountry, and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is one of their \nstrongest advocates.\n  The PRIME Act will enhance all of these efforts. It will provide \ngrants for micro-enterprise organizations across the country to assist \ndisadvantaged and low-income entrepreneurs and provide them with \nessential training and education.\n  It will encourage the development of new micro-enterprise \norganizations, and expand existing ones to reach more micro-\nentrepreneurs.\n  It will sponsor research on the most innovative and successful ways \nof encouraging these new businesses and enabling them to succeed.\n  Under the Act, grants will be available each year to organizations \nthat work with entrepreneurs. Local groups will leverage these funds \nwith private and local resources to increase the impact of the federal \nseed money.\n  Massachusetts and New Mexico are leaders in this effort. The business \ncommunity and local banks have made a significant investment in \ncreating loan capital for micro-entrepreneurs to start their \nbusinesses.\n  By investing in micro-entrepreneurs, we will be harnessing the spirit \nand ideas of large numbers of Americans and creating new opportunities \nfor self-sufficiency. We will be encouraging new small businesses that \nwill strengthen the local economy in communities across the country. \nAnd that\n\n[[Page S6568]]\n\nresult in turn will help to keep our national economy strong as well. I \nlook forward to working closely with our colleagues in the Senate and \nthe House to enact this important measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2190\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is a pleasure to join with Senator \nKennedy in support of the PRIME Act, ``Program for Investment in Micro-\nEntrepreneurs Act of 1998.''\n  Starting one's own business is a part of the American dream. There \nare thousands of creative and hardworking men and women who believe \nthey have a solid idea for building a new business. The realities of \nbeginning a business are that it takes more than luck, hard labor, and \ndedication to make it work. There are often overwhelming obstacles for \nwould-be small and micro entrepreneurs, due in part of the complexity \nof local, state and federal laws, the necessity of understanding the \nintricacies of marketing, feasibility studies, and bookkeeping \npractices, as well as finding a source for capital. Entrepreneurs \nusually need basic assistance to bring their idea to a viable business \nenterprise. They need training, technical assistance, and mentoring.\n  Under this bill grants will be available through the Community \nDevelopment Financial Institutions Fund, matched at least 50 percent in \nnon-federal funds, to help experienced non-profit organizations provide \nthe assistance these new businesses so urgently require. Fifty percent \nof these grants will be awarded to applicants serving low-income \nclients, and those serving equally both urban and rural areas. From so \nmany case studies and histories of successful businesses, we know that \nenthusiastic entrepreneurs can sustain and build their businesses when \nthese organizations are available to provide critical training and \nprofessional, technical assistance.\n  I have had the pleasure of visiting countless new micro-level \nbusinesses in my State of New Mexico, a great majority of whom received \nassistance from the very competent WEEST Corp organization, now located \nin five different sites throughout our State. This organization not \nonly provides key technical assistance and training and access to low \ninterest revolving loans, but it also provides mentoring and \ninformation about sound business practices to ensure their creative \nideas become viable business entities.\n  Micro and small businesses are an absolutely critical component of \nour national economic growth. The Small Business Administration, for \nexample, lends excellent support to entrepreneurs. At the small time, \nthe PRIME Act will establish a complimentary program by enabling \nintermediary organizations to serve a more micro-level entrepreneurs \nwho need specialized and hands-on assistance. This is a good investment \nfor the future, and will be returned many fold by the creation of \nbusinesses that can contribute to the growth of the family, local, and \nnational economies.\n  There are many success stories we can all point to about the business \nthat began with an idea and eventually grew into a major global \ncorporation. It all began with the basic tenacity of a businessman, \nwoman, or family. We have no way of knowing how many more such success \nstories will be told in the future. It is guaranteed, however, that \nthere are thousands of such extraordinary entrepreneurs willing to \nprovide the ideas and hard labor to make it happen, and with a little \nhelp, they will be successful.\n  Again, I am pleased to join Senator Kennedy in cosponsoring the PRIME \nAct. Whatever we can do to assist who want to be self-reliant, \nsuccessful entrepreneurs, with a piece of the American dream, is an \ninvestment well worth taking.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my very \nenthusiastic support for the micro-enterprise bill being introduced by \nSenator Kennedy. Programs of this type provide technical support and \nfunding to thousands of potentially productive Americans who are \nstruggling to make ends meet and are looking for a way out of their \ncurrent precarious economic situation.\n  I have visited microenterprise businesses in my state and know they \nwork. These individuals possess energy, ingenuity, desire, and vision \nbut currently lack access to three important ingredients that will \nallow them to be successful in their entrepreneurial efforts: business \nmanagement training, knowledge of the market, and affordable capital. \nThis bill will provide all three ingredients, and will do so in areas \nof the country that need economic assistance.\n  Microenterprise is not charity and it does not foster dependence. \nInstead, it encourages individuals to use their specific strengths and \ncreativity to support themselves and their community. It is a market-\nbased approach to economic empowerment and self-reliance that has \nproven to be successful both here and overseas, and it deserves to be \nexpanded. It offers an alternative to poverty and provides the means \nby which individuals and communities can be saved from cycles of \nisolation, violence, and despair.\n\n  In New Mexico, I have seen the tangible results of microenterprise \nprograms. One organization we have interacted with, ACCION, provided \nfunds for Michael and Jamie Ford to begin a very successful business \nselling flies for fly-fishing in their community and over the Internet. \nThey were recently named the Small Business Administration's Welfare-\nto-Work Entrepreneur of the Year in New Mexico. Another organization, \nthe New Mexico Business Resource Center, recommended that funds be \nprovided through New Mexico Community Development Loan Fund to Kevin \nBellinger, who created a unique art and dance program for disadvantaged \nyouths called Harambe. Here, low-income individuals are taught to \ninteract in non-violent and constructive ways and give back to the \ncommunity in which they live. Mr. Bellinger was recently selected by \nNew Mexico Newspaper as one of the top ten people in Santa Fe making a \nreal difference in their community.\n  In Taos, the Taos County Economic Development Corporation providing \nfunding for the Taos Food Center, a commercial kitchen that acts as an \nincubator for small-scale food producers and farmers in the region.\n  Previously, these individuals could not afford to rent space, buy \ncommercial and office equipment, or market their products. With the \nassistance of microenterprise funds, the Taos Food Center provides the \nspace and the equipment and provides on-site technical and business \nassistance. This allows individuals to rent the facility by the hour, \nand convert their crops into marketable products.\n  Other microenterprise organizations in New Mexico--the Rio Grande \nCommunity Development Corporation, La Jicarita Enterprise Community, \nWESST Corp., and so on--have had similarly stellar results. They play \nessential roles in their communities, and they should be commended for \ntheir efforts.\n  In April, I organized a roundtable discussion of all the \nmicroenterprise organizations operating in New Mexico. This was the \nfirst time representatives from these organizations met in the same \nlocation to discuss their respective philosophies, objectives, and \nstrategies concerning microenterprise, and it was very beneficial to \nall of us. The dialogue with the organizations that began that day has \ncontinued to the present, and has only reinforced by commitment to \nthese programs. The simple fact is: the work, and they work well.\n  The bill we are introducing today would accomplish several important \ntasks:\n  First, it will provide training, technical assistance, and start-up \nfunds to potential entrepreneurs who are currently disadvantaged but \neager to change their economic condition;\n  Second, it will provide training and capacity building services to \nmicroenterprise development organizations, an activity that will lead \ndirectly to the expansion of microenterprise funding and an increased \nnumber of clients being served;\n  Third, it will identify best practices in microenterprise technical \nand lending services, an activity that will further enhance efforts to \nprovide funds to individuals in an efficient and effective manner;\n  Finally, it will ensure that microenterprise lending occurs in all \nareas that require assistance--meaning both rural and urban \ncommunities.\n  Let me conclude by thanking my colleague from Massachusetts and his \nstaff for their work on this bill. I have been pleased to work with \nSenator Kennedy on the development of the\n\n[[Page S6570]]\n\ncomponents contained within the bill, in particular those related to \nrural communities and Indian reservations. I believe that this bill \nwill have a profound effect on the ability of low-income individuals to \nestablish businesses, develop new products and services, and create new \njobs. All of these activities can only help individuals and communities \nin the United States in a positive way.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 2191. A bill to amend the Trademark Act of 1946 to provide for the \nregistration and protection of trademarks used in commerce, in order to \ncarry out provisions of certain international conventions, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                   madrid protocol implementation act\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation that \nwill implement the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning \nthe International Registration of Marks (Protocol). This bill is part \nof my ongoing effort to refine American intellectual property law to \nensure that it serves to advance and protect American interests and \ndoes not serve to encumber small companies seeking to expand into \ninternational markets. Specifically, this legislation will conform \nAmerican trademark application procedures to the terms of the Protocol \nin anticipation of the U.S.'s eventual ratification of the treaty, \nthereby helping American businesses to create a ``one stop'' \ninternational trademark registration process. This bill is one of many \nmeasures I have introduced and supported over the past few years to \nensure that American trademark holders receive strong protection in \ntoday's world of changing technology and complex international markets.\n\n  In addition to this legislation, I have introduced the Trademark Law \nTreaty Implementing and Registration Simplification Act, which will \nbring U.S. trademark law into conformance with the Trademark Law \nTreaty. The Trademark Law Treaty will simplify trademark registration \nrequirements around the world by establishing a list of maximum \nrequirements which Treaty member countries can impose on trademark \napplicants. All American businesses, and particularly small American \nbusinesses, will benefit as a result.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced legislation authorizing the National \nResearch Council of the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a \ncomprehensive study of the effects of adding new generic Top Level \nDomains on trademark and other intellectual property rights.\n  Moreover, I supported the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995, \nwhich was passed last Congress, to provide intellectual property rights \nholders with the power to enjoin another person's commercial use of \nfamous marks that would cause dilution of the mark's distinctive \nquality.\n  Together, these measures represent major steps in our efforts to \nrefine American trademark law to ensure that it serves to promote \nAmerican interests.\n  Currently, in order for American companies to protect their \ntrademarks abroad, they must register their trademarks in each and \nevery country in which protection is sought. Registering in multiple \ncountries is a time-consuming, complicated and expensive process--a \nprocess which places a disproportionate burden on smaller American \ncompanies seeking international trademark protection. This legislation \nwill ease the registration burden by enabling American businesses to \nobtain trademark protection in all signatory countries with a single \ntrademark application filed with the Patent and Trademark Office.\n  Since 1891, the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International \nRegistration of Marks (Agreement) has provided an international \ntrademark registration system. However, prior to adoption of the \nProtocol, the U.S. declined to join the Agreement because it contained \nterms deemed inimical to American intellectual property interests. In \n1989, the terms of the Agreement were modified by the Protocol, which \ncorrected the objectionable terms of the Agreement and made American \nparticipation a possibility. For example, under the Protocol, \napplications for international trademark extension can be completed in \nEnglish; formerly, applications were required to be completed in \nFrench. It should be noted that the Protocol will not require \nsubstantive changes to American trademark law, hence the implementing \nlegislation I introduce today is identical to the legislation that \npassed the House on May 5, 1998 and only would make those technical \nchanges to American law necessary to bring the U.S. into conformity \nwith the Protocol.\n  To date, the Administration has resisted accession to the treaty \nbecause of voting rights disputes with the European Union, which has \nsought to retain an additional vote for itself as an intergovernmental \nentity, in addition to the votes of its member states. I support the \nAdministration's efforts to negotiate a treaty based upon the equitable \nand democratic principle of one-state, one-vote. However, in \nanticipation of the eventual resolution of this dispute, the Senate has \nthe opportunity to act now to make the technical changes to American \ntrademark law so that once this voting dispute is satisfactorily \nresolved and the U.S. accedes to the Protocol, ``one-stop'' \ninternational trademark registration can become an immediate reality \nfor all American trademark applicants.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2191\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO TRADEMARK ACT OF 1946.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Act entitled ``An Act to provide for \n     the registration and protection of trademarks used in \n     commerce, to carry out the provisions of certain \n     international conventions, and for other purposes'', approved \n     July 5, 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.)

This amendment \n     simply adds language to clarify that a trademark or service \n     mark may be used on or in connection with goods or services \n     rather than just directly on the goods. This language is \n     fully consistent with case law and Patent and Trademark \n     Office (``Office'') practice and is not a substantive change.\n       Subparagraph 1(a)(1)(B)(i) amends subsection 1(d)(1) of the \n     Trademark Act by inserting ``and'' after the words \n     ``specifying the date of the applicant's first use of the \n     mark in commerce,''.\n       Subparagraph 1(a)(1)(B)(ii) amends subsection 1(d)(1) of \n     the Trademark Act by deleting ``and the mode or manner in \n     which the mark is used on or in connection with such goods or \n     services''. Section 1(d)(1) sets out the requirements for a \n     complete ``statement of use'', the document that must be \n     filed to complete any published trademark application that \n     was originally filed based on intent-to-use the mark. The \n     statement of use is meant to bring the intent-to-use based \n     application into conformity with the requirements for a \n     trademark application based on use in commerce. The deletion \n     of this language makes this section parallel to section \n     1(a)(1)(A), as amended by the Trademark Law Treaty \n     Implementation Act. Section 1(a)(1)(A), as amended, sets out \n     the requirements for filing a complete trademark application \n     based on use in commerce. Thus the amendment conforms the \n     requirements of these two sections, requirements that should \n     logically be identical. In addition, the experience of the \n     Office has been that requiring the applicant to state the \n     mode or manner of using the mark adds no additional useful \n     information to the application inasmuch as an applicant is \n     already required to submit specimens, e.g., tags, labels, \n     advertising etc., to demonstrate how it is using the mark. \n     Therefore, an additional statement concerning the mode or \n     manner of use of the mark is unnecessary.\n       Subparagraph 1(a)(2)(A) amends paragraph 2(e) of the \n     Trademark Act by adding a new subparagraph 5, ``any matter \n     that, as a whole, is functional'', to the list of statutory \n     refusals set out in that paragraph. The language clarifies \n     that matter which is wholly functional must be refused \n     registration, a position that is completely consistent with \n     the intent of the Trademark Act. This change codifies both \n     the case law in this matter and the long-standing practice of \n     the Office to refuse registration to matter that is wholly \n     functional based on a combined reading of sections 1, 2 and \n     45 of the Trademark Act. This new section will provide \n     examining attorneys with a simple reference for the \n     functionality refusal.\n       Subparagraph 1(a)(2)(B) amends paragraph 2(f) of the \n     Trademark Act to add a reference to the new statutory refusal \n     set out in subparagraph 2(e)(5). This amendment to paragraph \n     2(f) of the Trademark Act provides that matter which is \n     wholly functional may not be registered upon a showing that \n     the matter has become distinctive. This change codifies \n     existing case law and the current practice of the Office and \n     is not a change in the substantive law.\n       Paragraph 1(a)(3) amends section 7(a) of the Trademark Act \n     by deleting an extraneous period.\n       Paragraph 1(a)(4) amends section 10 of the Trademark Act by \n     deleting extraneous punctuation.\n       Paragraph 1(a)(5) amends paragraph 14(3) of the Trademark \n     Act by inserting the phrase ``or is functional,'' before ``or \n     has been abandoned''. This amendment adds an additional \n     ground for canceling a registration more than five years \n     after the date of registration. This amendment changes \n     existing case law in this matter but is fully consistent with \n     the purpose of the Trademark Act. To exempt the registration \n     of a wholly functional design from being subject to \n     cancellation five years after the registration has issued \n     permits the trademark owner with such a registration to \n     obtain patent-like protection for its wholly functional \n     design without the limited term that the patent law imposes. \n     This change is therefore wholly consistent with both the \n     purpose of the Trademark Act and the codifications of current \n     practice regarding functionality made in this Act.\n       Paragraph 1(a)(6) amends section 23(c) of the Trademark Act \n     by adding ``any matter that as a whole is not functional'' to \n     the listing of the types of marks which can be registered on \n     the Supplemental register. This change codifies existing case \n     law and the current practice of the Office.\n       Paragraph 1(a)(7) amends section 26 of the Trademark Act by \n     deleting an extraneous comma.\n       Paragraph 1(a)(8) amends section 31 of the Trademark Act by \n     deleting ``Sec. 31 Fees'' from the title of the section and \n     inserting ``Sec. 31. (a)''.\n       Paragraph 1(a)(9) amends section 32(1) of the Trademark Act \n     to clarify that the definition of ``any person'' as set out \n     in paragraph 1 of section 32 is limited to the matter within \n     the paragraph.\n       Paragraph 1(a)(10) amends section 33(b) of the Trademark \n     Act by inserting as a new paragraph 8, ``That the mark is \n     functional; or''. This language adds a new defense against a \n     claim of infringement made by the owner of a mark which has \n     become ``incontestable'' under the provisions of section 32 \n     of the Trademark Act. This language is fully consistent with \n     the amendment made to paragraph 14(3) of the Trademark Act by \n     paragraph 1(a)(5) of this Act.\n       Paragraph 1(a)(11) amends section 39(a) of the Trademark \n     Act to strike a reference, that is no longer relevant, to \n     ``circuit courts'' and insert the word ``courts''.\n       Paragraph 1(a)(12) amends Section 42 of the Trademark Act \n     by sdeleting an extraneous ``the''.\n       Paragraph 1(a)(13) amends the Act to strike ``trade-mark'' \n     in each place it occurs and replace it with ``trademark''. \n     This is the more modern spelling.\n       Section 1(b) establishes an effective date that is \n     prospective with respect to both civil actions and \n     proceedings at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2193. A bill to implement the provisions of the Trademark Law \nTreaty; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                Trademark Law Treaty Implementation Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Trademark Law \nTreaty Implementation Act of 1998. This legislation makes necessary \nchanges in our domestic trademark law and procedures to ensure that we \nare in compliance when we ratify the treaty, which appears more likely \nthis year than previously. The Trademark Law Treaty was done and signed \nat Geneva in October of 1994, and entered into force in 1996.\n  The obligations under the Trademark Law Treaty legislation will \nrequire some relatively minor changes to U.S. trademark practice, but \nwill bring significant improvements in the trademark practices of a \nnumber of important countries around the world in which U.S. trademark \nowners seek protection. The required changes will eliminate \ncomplexities and simplify the process of obtaining, renewing, and \nmanaging trademark assets for American firms marketing their products \nand services around the world.\n  Countries around the world have a number of varying requirements for \nfiling trademark applications, effecting changes of ownership of \ntrademark registrations, and other procedures associated with managing \ntrademark assets. These differences cause considerable\n\n[[Page S6574]]\n\naggravation and expense to trademark owners seeking to protect their \nmarks around the world. Many of these procedures and requirements \nimposed by foreign countries are non-substantive and highly technical. \nIn addition, many of these requirements in the various procedures of \nforeign trademark offices impose very significant cost burdens, both in \nofficial fees to be paid to local trademark offices, as well as agent's \nfees for fulfilling the various requirements. For example, many \ncountries require that signatures on applications for powers of \nattorney be notarized, authenticated, and legalized. This very \nexpensive and time consuming procedure is prohibited under the Treaty \nin all cases except where the registrant is surrendering a \nregistration.\n  The Treaty eliminates these conflicting and expensive practices by \nsetting forth a list of maximum requirements which a member State can \nimpose for various actions. Specifically, the Treaty sets forth maximum \nrequirements for: the contents of a trademark application; the content \nof a power of attorney; the elements necessary for an application to \nreceive a filing date; a request to record a change in the name or \naddress of a trademark owner; and, a request to renew a trademark \nregistration. These requirements are implemented through the adoption \nof model forms for trademark applicants and owners to use which must be \naccepted by every member State. While a member need not impose all of \nthe requirements or elements listed, it cannot demand the inclusion of \nany additional requirements or elements in respect of a particular \naction.\n  There are several other guarantees mandated by the Treaty that will \nbenefit trademark applicants and owners. Under the Treaty, countries \nwill have to register and protect service marks, as well as goods \nmarks, an important consideration to the U.S. service economy, which \nhas many valuable service marks, such as Marriott and American \nAirlines. Applicants will be able to file for protection under multiple \nclassifications for goods and services, which will mature into multiple \nclass registrations. No longer will trademark owners be forced to make \na separate filing for each power of attorney; one general power will \nsuffice. Member countries are precluded from considering goods or \nservices as being similar to each other simply on the ground that they \nappear in the same class of the NICE classification. Moreover, a \nrequest to change the name or address of a trademark owner or a request \nto correct a mistake in a trademark registration may not be refused \nwithout giving the trademark owner an opportunity to comment.\n  As I indicated, the Trademark Law Treaty Implementation Act of 1998 \nmakes only minor changes in our domestic trademark law. These changes \ninclude: the elimination of the requirement for a statement of the \nmanner in which a mark is used or intended to be used in connection \nwith the goods or services identified in the application; the \nelimination of the requirement that the applicant verify an \napplication; the adoption of a grace period of at least six months for \nthe filing of a renewal application; the elimination of a declaration \nor evidence concerning the use of a mark in connection with the filing \nof a renewal application; and, the elimination of a requirement to file \na copy of the actual assignment document as a condition for recording \nthe assignment of a trademark registration.\n  This bill will also harmonize and simplify the procedural \nrequirements under the Trademark Act of 1946. Sections 8 and 9 will be \namended to establish a similar period of one year prior to the end of \nthe applicable time period, along with a grace period of six months \nafter that period, for filing both affidavits of use and renewal \napplications. While it separates the ten-year affidavit of use from the \nrenewal application, as required by the Treaty, the bill permits them \nboth to be filed during the same time period which will benefit \ntrademark applicants.\n  The Trademark Law Treaty Implementation Act of 1998 will help \nAmerican companies protect their trademark assets in markets around the \nworld thereby facilitating their ability to compete. At the same time, \nthe changes it makes in U.S. trademark law are made in a manner that \nwill assist American trademark owners protect their marks in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support this legislation \nwhich is so important to American trademark owners.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and an explanatory \nsection by section analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2193\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE\n\n       This section provides a short title: ``Trademark Law Treaty \n     Implementation Act.''\n\n\n           Section 2. REFERENCE TO THE TRADEMARK ACT OF 1946\n\n       This section provides that the Act entitle ``An Act to \n     provide for the registration and protection of trademarks \n     used in commerce, to carry out the provision of certain \n     international conventions, and for other purposes'', approved \n     July 5, 1946, as amended (15 U.S.C 1051 et. seq.) shall be \n     referred to as the ``Trademark Act of 1946''.\n\n\n         Section 3. APPLICATION FOR REGISTRATION; VERIFICATION\n\n     Summary of Section 3\n       This section amends subsections 1(a) (Application for Use) \n     and 1(b) (Application for Intent to Use) of the Trademark Act \n     of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051(a) and 1051(b)) to create a clear \n     distinction between the written application, the form of \n     which may be prescribed by the Commissioner, and the \n     declaration pertaining to applicant's use or intention to use \n     the mark, the substance of which is detailed in the \n     respective subsections; to require that the declaration \n     pertaining to use or intention to use be verified by the \n     applicant; to authorize the Commissioner to promulgate rules \n     prescribing both the elements of the application, in addition \n     to those specified in the proposed provision, and those \n     elements necessary for a filing date; to omit the requirement \n     in the written application for a statement of the ``mode or \n     manner'' in which the mark is used or intended to be used in \n     connection with the specified goods or services; and to \n     clarify and modernize the language of the subsections, as \n     appropriate. In addition, an amendment is made to subsection \n     1(d) (15 U.S.C. 1051(d)) to clarify that an application may \n     be revived after a notice of allowance is issued.\n     Applications under the Trademark Law Treaty and Existing U.S. \n         Law\n       With the goal of simplifying and harmonizing the \n     registration process worldwide, Article 3(1) of the Trademark \n     Law Treaty (``Treaty'' or ``TLT'') establishes a \n     comprehensive list of indications or elements that may be \n     required in an application to register a trademark or service \n     mark (``mark''). This list permits a Contracting Party to the \n     Treaty (``Party'') to require, inter alia, a signature and \n     declarations of use and intention to use a mark. The list \n     does not permit a Party to require, inter alia, a statement \n     of the mode or manner in which the mark is used, or intended \n     to be used, in connection with the goods or services \n     specified in the application. Article 3(4) of the Treaty \n     obligates a Party that requires a signature to permit either \n     the applicant or his representative to sign the application, \n     except that a Party may require declarations of use and \n     intention to use a mark to be signed by the applicant.\n       The existing subsections 1(a) and 1(b) of the Trademark Act \n     of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051(a)) and 1051(b)) require, \n     respectively, declarations pertaining to use and intention to \n     use a mark and require verification by the applicant of the \n     written application, which includes the aforementioned \n     declarations. Under the terms of the Treaty, the United \n     States may continue to require the aforementioned \n     declarations and may require verification by the applicant of \n     such declarations, but may not require verification by the \n     applicant of the written application. Thus, it becomes \n     necessary to distinguish the declarations of use and \n     intention to use from the other elements of the application.\n       Additionally, the existing subsections 1(a) and 1(b) of the \n     Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051(a)) and 1051(b)) \n     require, respectively, a statement of the mode or manner in \n     which the mark is used or intended to be used, in connection \n     with the goods specified in the application. Thus, it becomes \n     necessary to delete the requirement for this statement from \n     the list of required elements in the written application.\n     Distinction Between Written Application and Verified \n         Declarations\n       Consistent with the Treaty obligations, the proposed \n     revision will distinguish between the written application and \n     the declarations of use and intention to use for purposes of \n     the signature requirement. The proposed revision will \n     continue to require a written application, in such form as \n     may be prescribed by the Commissioner, and a declaration \n     verified by the applicant, as set forth in the two \n     subsections.\n       By separating the written application from the verified \n     declarations, there will no longer be a requirement in the \n     law for verification by the applicant of the written \n     application. In the proposed revision, as in the existing \n     subsections, the Commissioner will retain authority to \n     prescribe the form of the application. Thus, the Commissioner \n     will have discretion to permit the written application to be \n     filed with no signature or with the signature of applicant's \n     representative. Also, the Commissioner may permit the filing \n     of a single document, which combines the elements of the \n     written application and the declaration, and which is signed \n     by the applicant, as under the existing subsections.\n     Elements of the Written Application\n       The proposed revision specifies a non-exclusive list of \n     elements and grants authority to the Commissioner to \n     prescribe, by regulation and consistent with law and \n     international obligations, additional elements which the \n     Commissioner considers to be necessary for an application and \n     those elements necessary for receipt of a filing date. This \n     proposal improves the ability of the law pertaining to \n     application requirements to accommodate advancing technology \n     and further international procedural harmonization. The \n     proposed revision specifically requires the application to \n     include applicant's domicile and citizenship, the dates of \n     applicant's first use of the mark and first use of the mark \n     in commerce in an application under subsection 1(a), the \n     goods in connection with which the mark is used or intended \n     to be used, and a drawing of the mark. Consistent with the \n     Treaty, the proposed revision omits a requirement for \n     specification of the mode or manner in which the mark is \n     used, or intended to be used, in connection with the goods \n     specified in the application.\n       Additionally, the proposed revision reorganizes subsections \n     1(a) and (b) 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051(a)) and 1051(b)) to clarify \n     the provisions and to modernize the language. To parallel the \n     language of the Treaty, the phrase ``may apply to \n     register'' is replaced by ``may request registration''. \n     Reference to ``firm, corporation or association'' is \n     replaced by a reference to ``juristic person'' or \n     ``person.'' Section 45 defines ``person'' as including \n     ``juristic persons.'' These terms are considered \n     preferable in view of the numerous types of juristic \n     persons in existence today.\n     The Verified Statement\n       Rather than requiring in the verified statement a \n     repetition of statements in the written application \n     identifying goods and, in a section 1(a) application, dates \n     of use, the proposed revision requires a statement that, to \n     the best of the applicant's knowledge and belief, the facts \n     recited in the application are accurate. In addition, the \n     proposed revision specifies the averments that the applicant \n     must make in the verified statement concerning applicant's \n     use, or bona fide intention to use, the mark in commerce, \n     ownership of the mark and lack of knowledge of conflicting \n     third party rights. These averments do not differ from those \n     in the existing provisions.\n       The proposed revision requires verification of the \n     statement by the applicant and omits the specification of the \n     appropriate person to verify the declaration for a juristic \n     applicant, i.e., the proposed revision omits the phrase \n     requiring verification by ``a member of the firm or an \n     officer of the corporation or association applying.'' While \n     this revision is not required by the Treaty, it will greatly \n     simplify the filing of an application without compromising \n     the integrity of the information contained therein. This \n     proposed revision will give the Patent and Trademark Office \n     (``PTO'') the discretion to determine the appropriate person \n     with authority to sign the declaration for a juristic \n     applicant.\n       Under the existing provision, the PTO has been limited to \n     accepting, for example, only the signature of an officer of a \n     corporation on an application when another corporate \n     manager's signature would be appropriate because the \n     corporate manager has authority to bind the corporation \n     legally or because the corporate manager has specific \n     knowledge of the facts asserted in the application. The \n     unnecessary rigidity of the existing provision has worked a \n     hardship on applicants who have been denied filing dates \n     because the person verifying their application has not met \n     the strict requirement of being an officer of the corporate \n     applicant. Additionally, the Patent and Trademark Office has \n     had difficulty applying the officer requirement to foreign \n     juristic entities whose managers are not clearly officers \n     under the United States' corporate standards.\n     Revival of Applications After the Notice of Allowance Has \n         Issued\n       Existing subsection 1(d) (15 U.S.C. 1051(d)) is amended to \n     clarify that applications which are awaiting the filing of a \n     statement of use or a request for extension of time to file a \n     statement of use may be revived if it can be shown to the \n     satisfaction of the Commissioner that the failure to file was \n     unintentional. Although this change is not necessary for the \n     implementation of the TLT, the change clarifies that the \n     Commissioner has the authority to revive such an application \n     so long as reviving the application does not extend the \n     statutory period for filing the statement of use. The \n     standard for revival is that the applicant's failure to file \n     was unintentional. This is the same standard that is being \n     proposed in subsection 12(b) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 \n     U.S.C. 1062(b)) for reviving applications during the \n     examination process.\n\n\n             SECTION 4. REVIVAL OF AN ABANDONED APPLICATION\n\n     Summary of Section 4\n       This section amends subsection 12(b) of the Trademark Act \n     of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1062(b)) by changing the present standard \n     for reviving an abandoned application upon a showing of \n     ``unavoidable'' delay to the standard of ``unintentional'' \n     delay.\n\n[[Page S6577]]\n\n     Revival of Applications Under the Historical ``Unavoidable \n         Delay'' Standard\n       Section 12(b) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. \n     1062(b)) provides that an application is abandoned if the \n     applicant does not timely respond to an Office Action, \n     ``unless it can be shown to the satisfaction of the \n     Commissioner that the delay in responding was unavoidable, \n     whereupon such time may be extended.''\n       Prior to the implementation of the Trademark Act of 1946, \n     there was no statutory provision for abandonment and revival \n     of abandoned trademark applications. There was a regulatory \n     provision that an abandoned application could be revived if \n     it were ``shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that \n     the delay in the prosecution of the same was unavoidable,'' \n     However, the legislative history of the Lanham Act is silent \n     as to the meaning or intention behind the ``unavoidable \n     delay'' standard for revival of abandoned applications.\n       The language of section 12(b) of the Trademark Act of 1946 \n     is virtually identical to the analogous provision of the \n     patent law, 35 U.S.C. 133, which provides for abandonment of \n     patent applications and revival upon a showing of unavoidable \n     delay. The requirements for reviving an ``unavoidably'' \n     abandoned patent applications, set forth in 37 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 1.137(a), are identical to the requirements for reviving \n     an abandoned trademark application under 37 C.F.R. Sec. 2.66.\n       Courts have held that the Commissioner has broad discretion \n     in determining whether a delay is unavoidable. Under current \n     law, the Commissioner's decision is subject to judicial \n     review, but will be reversed only if it is arbitrary, \n     capricious, or an abuse of discretion. Morganroth v. Quigg, \n     885 F.2d 843, 21 USPQ2d 1125 (Fed. Cir. 1989); Smith v. \n     Mossinghoff, 671 F.2d 533, 213 USPQ 977 (D.C. Cir. 1982); \n     Douglas v. Manbeck, 21 USPQ2d 1697 (E.D. Pa. 1991).\n     Revival of Applications Under the New ``Unintentional Delay'' \n         Standard\n       Prior to 1982, patent applications, like trademark \n     applications, could be revived only upon a showing of \n     unavoidable delay. Under Public Law 97-247, Sec. 3, 96 Stat. \n     317 (1982) codified at 35 U.S.C. 41(a)(7), it became possible \n     to revive an unintentionally abandoned patent application. \n     Section 41(a)(7) establishes two different fees for filing \n     petitions with two different standards to revive abandoned \n     applications. There is one for a petition to revive an \n     unavoidably abandoned application and another fee for a \n     petition to revive an unintentionally abandoned application. \n     The procedure for petitioning to revive an unintentionally \n     abandoned application is set forth in 37 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 1.137(b), effective October 1, 1982. 58 Fed. Reg. 44277 \n     (Aug. 20, 1993); 48 Fed. Reg. 2696 (Jan. 20, 1983). The \n     rule requires, among other things, that the applicant \n     submit a verified statement that the delay was \n     unintentional, and provides that the ``Commissioner may \n     require additional information where there is a question \n     that the delay was unintentional.''\n       The legislative history of Public Law 97-247 states: \n     Section 41(a)7 establishes two different fees for filing \n     petitions with different standards to revive abandoned \n     applications. . . Since the section provides for two \n     alternative fees with different standards, the section would \n     permit the applicant seeking revival . . . to choose one or \n     the other of the fees and standards under such regulations as \n     the Commissioner may establish. . . This section would permit \n     the Commissioner to have more discretion than present law to \n     revive abandoned applications . . . in appropriate \n     circumstances (emphasis added). H.R. Rep. No. 542, 97th Cong. \n     2d Sess. 6-7 (1982), quoted in In re Rutan, 231 USPQ 864, 865 \n     (Comm'r Pats. 1986).\n       The legislative history of Public Law 97-247 pertains \n     primarily to fees. However, the intent of Congress appears to \n     be to give the Commissioner the power to revive abandoned \n     applications using a much less strict standard than had been \n     previously applied. In re Rutan, supra. Neither the \n     legislative history of the Lanham Act nor the relevant case \n     law limit the Commissioner's authority to establish \n     procedures for revival of unintentionally abandoned trademark \n     applications.\n       With the goal of the Trademark Law Treaty to simplify the \n     registration process worldwide, this proposed amendment \n     parallels the unintentional standard for revival available to \n     patent applicants and relaxes the standard for reviving \n     trademark applications. This will enable the majority of \n     applicants, who file a timely petition to revive an \n     application that was abandoned due to an unintentional delay, \n     to proceed to registration from the point that the \n     application became abandoned, rather than requiring these \n     applicants to refile their applications.\n\n\n    section 5. duration of registration; cancellation; affidavit of \n             continued use; notice of commissioner's action\n\n     Note on Sections 5 and 6: Registration Maintenance under the \n         Trademark Law Treaty and Existing U.S. Law\n       Sections 5 and 6 of this legislation amend existing \n     sections 8 and 9 of the Trademark Act of 1946, which are the \n     two provisions of the Act containing requirements for \n     registration maintenance. These two sections are analogous in \n     their requirements for the filing of a verified document \n     attesting to the use of the mark in commerce and specimens or \n     facsimiles, or a showing of excusable non-use. Section 8 of \n     the Trademark Act of 1946 requires the aforementioned filing \n     during the year preceding the sixth year following \n     registration to avoid cancellation of the registration. \n     Section 9 of the Trademark Act of 1946 requires the \n     aforementioned filing as part of the registration renewal \n     application.\n       With the goal of simplifying and harmonizing the process \n     for renewal of a trademark or service mark registration \n     worldwide, Article 13(1) of the Treaty establishes a \n     comprehensive list of indications that may be required in a \n     request to renewal a trademark or service mark registration. \n     This list does not include a declaration and/or evidence \n     concerning use of the mark. Article 13(4)(iii) expressly \n     prohibits a requirement for the furnishing of a \n     declaration and/or evidence concerning use of the mark as \n     part of a request for renewal. However, the Treaty \n     contains no prohibition against a requirement for the \n     periodic filing of a declaration and/or evidence of use in \n     connection with a registration, as long as such \n     requirement is not part of the requirements for renewal. \n     In fact, Article 13(1)(b) of the Treaty, concerning \n     renewal fees, recognizes that fees may be required in \n     connection with the filing of a declaration and/or \n     evidence of use of a registered mark.\n       Under the terms of the Treaty, the United States may \n     continue to require the periodic filing of a verified \n     document attesting to the use of the mark in commerce and \n     specimens or facsimiles, or a showing of excusable non-use. \n     However, the United States may not make such a requirement in \n     connection with registration renewal.\n     Harmonization of Trademark Act Sections 8 and 9 Requirements\n       The proposed revision harmonizes certain procedural \n     requirements for the affidavits required under this section \n     with the requirements for a registration renewal application \n     contained in section 9 of the Trademark Act of 1946. While \n     both sections contain requirements for registration \n     maintenance, the specific requirements pertaining to the \n     filing required by each existing section differ \n     unnecessarily. These differing requirements have caused \n     confusion to some registrants, particularly those proceeding \n     pro se, resulting in the cancellation of registrations of \n     marks still in use in commerce due to non-compliance with the \n     technical requirements of one or the other of these \n     maintenance sections. Furthermore, since the proposed \n     revision to section 8 adds an affidavit requirement at ten-\n     year internals, harmonizing the filing procedures with those \n     for renewal enables the registrant to make both filings at \n     the same time, thus, simplifying registration maintenance.\n     Summary of Section 5\n       This section amends section 8 of the Trademark Act of 1946 \n     (15 U.S.C. 1058). The main purpose of the revision of this \n     section is to set out, in one section, all of the \n     requirements for filing any of the affidavits of use needed \n     to maintain a registration and to ensure that the \n     requirements of each use affidavit are identical. This \n     section includes the affidavit of use filed between the fifth \n     and the sixth year after registration, between the fifth and \n     the sixth year after publication under subsection 12(c), and \n     in the year preceding every ten year anniversary of the \n     registration.\n       This purpose is accomplished by adding an obligation to \n     file an affidavit of use or non-use, consistent with the \n     requirements set forth in the subsections, in the year \n     preceding every tenth anniversary of the registration, to \n     provide for correction of deficiencies in submissions under \n     these subsections; to provide for a grace period for making \n     submissions required by these subsections; to modernize the \n     language and to simplify and clarify the existing procedural \n     requirements for filing affidavits under these subsections; \n     and to harmonize certain procedural requirements for such \n     affidavits with the requirements for a registration renewal \n     application contained in section 9 of the Trademark Act of \n     1946.\n       Subsection 8(a) states the duration of each registration \n     and provides that the registration shall be canceled by the \n     Commissioner if timely affidavits of use are not \n     filed. Paragraph (1) of subsection 8(a) states that an \n     affidavit of use must be filed by the end of six years \n     following registration. Paragraph (2) of subsection 8(a) \n     states that an affidavit of use must be filed by the end \n     of six years following the date of publication under \n     subsection 12(c) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. \n     1062(c)). Paragraph (3) of subsection 8(a) states that an \n     affidavit of use must be filed by the end of each \n     successive ten-year period following the date of \n     registration.\n       Subsection 8(b) sets out the length of the time period \n     during which the statutory filing can be made and the \n     contents needed in each filing. In every case, there is a one \n     year statutory period for filing the affidavit.\n       Subsection 8(c) permits the filing of the use affidavit, \n     after the statutory period for filing has ended upon payment \n     of an additional ``grace period'' surcharge. The section also \n     provides that a correction of a deficiency, after the \n     statutory period, may be made upon payment of an additional \n     ``deficiency'' surcharge.\n       Subsection 8(c)(1) sets out the time period for filing the \n     use affidavit where the statutory period has expired, the so-\n     called ``grace'' period, and gives the Commissioner authority \n     to prescribe a surcharge for affidavits filed during the \n     grace period.\n       Subsection 8(c)(2) allows for correction of deficiencies in \n     the filings submitted under this section upon payment of the \n     deficiency surcharge.\n\n[[Page S6578]]\n\n       Subsection 8(d) sets out the requirement that the \n     Commissioner attach to each certificate of registration, and \n     notice of publication under section 12(c), a special notice \n     of the requirement for the affidavits required by this \n     section. This section preserves an obligation of the \n     Commissioner that is set out in the last sentence of existing \n     section 8(a) and in section 12(c).\n       Subsection 8(e) preserves the obligation of the \n     Commissioner, in existing subsection 8(c), to notify any \n     owner who files an affidavit under section 8 of his \n     acceptance or refusal of the affidavit. The subsection has \n     been revised to reflect the revisions in subsections 8 (a) \n     and (b) by stating that it applies to any of the above \n     prescribed affidavits.\n       Subsection 8(f) has been added to require the appointment \n     by owners, not domiciled in the United States, of a domestic \n     representative for service of notices or process in \n     proceedings affecting the mark.\n     Periodic Filing of the Affidavit\n       The PTO continues to believe in the value of requiring a \n     periodic filing verifying the continued use of the mark as a \n     way to maintain the integrity of the trademark register by \n     periodically removing from the register marks no longer in \n     use in commerce. Therefore, consistent with the Treaty \n     obligations, the proposed revision adds to section 8 of the \n     Trademark Act of 1946 an obligation to file an affidavit of \n     use or excusable non-use, consistent with the requirements \n     set forth in the subsection, in the year preceding the tenth \n     anniversary of the registration and every ten years \n     thereafter. This revision is proposed in view of the proposed \n     deletion of the requirement in connection with registration \n     renewal, in section 9 of the Trademark Act of 1946, for a \n     verified statement attesting to the use of the mark in \n     commerce, accompanied by specimens or facsimiles, or a \n     showing of excusable non-use.\n     Grace Period and Correction of Deficiencies\n       Rules 8 of the Regulations under the Trademark Law Treaty \n     provides that renewal request must be accepted for at least a \n     six-month period, upon payment of a surcharge, after the date \n     the renewal is due. The existing provisions of section 9 of \n     the Trademark Act of 1946 permit the renewal application to \n     be filed within a three-month period, upon payment of a \n     surcharge, after the date the renewal is due. The existing \n     provisions of section 8 of the Trademark Act of 1946 contain \n     no grace period for the filing of the required affidavit \n     after its due date. As described below, the proposed revision \n     incorporates the six-month grace period required by the \n     treaty for filing renewal requests and harmonizes the \n     requirements for filings under sections 8 and 9 of the \n     Trademark Act of 1946. Harmonization of the filing \n     requirements of sections 8 and 9 will require the amendment \n     of both sections to provide this six-month grace period for \n     making the required filing. This amendment is a \n     liberalization of sections 8 and 9 of the Trademark Act of \n     1946, which is desirable to avoid, to the extent possible, \n     the removal from the register for mere technical reasons of \n     marks that are still in use in commerce.\n       The proposed revision to section 8 of the Trademark Act of \n     1946 will amend the existing law by providing a six-month \n     grace period for filing the required affidavit, conditioned \n     upon payment of a ``grace period'' surcharge. Additionally, \n     the proposed revision permits the correction of a deficiency \n     after the sixth anniversary of registration. Such correction \n     must be accompanied by a ``deficiency surcharge'' and be \n     filed no later than the end of a prescribed period after \n     notification of the deficiency. This proposed revision is \n     consistent with the practice proposed in the revision to \n     section 9(a) of the Trademark Act of 1946, concerning \n     renewal.\n       Only an owner who did not make any filing prior to the end \n     of the statutory period may make the required filing under \n     the grace period provisions. The owner filing an affidavit \n     prior to the end of the statutory period, but correcting a \n     deficiency either during or after the grace period, will be \n     subject to the ``deficiency surcharge'' only. On the other \n     hand, the owner filing an affidavit during the six-month \n     grace period, will be subject to the ``grace period \n     surcharge'' (for the ability to file the affidavit during the \n     grace period) and, if notified of deficiencies, the \n     ``deficiency surcharge'' (for the ability to correct a \n     deficiency after the end of the statutory period.) The \n     proposed revision does not define deficiency or place any \n     limits on the type of deficiency or omission that can be \n     cured after expiration of the statutory filing period. The \n     Commissioner has broad discretion to provide procedures and \n     fees for curing deficiencies or omissions.\n     Simplification and Clarification of Section 8 of the \n         Trademark Act\n       The proposed revision conforms the requirements of \n     subsections 8(a) and (b) of the Trademark Act of 1946 to \n     current practice. First, the language in the existing \n     subsections ``attaching to the affidavit a specimen or \n     facsimile showing current use of the mark'' is revised to \n     clarify that the specimens or fascimiles are to be filed \n     along with the affidavit but are not considered part of the \n     affidavit for purposes of complying with the requirement to \n     set forth in the affidavit the goods or services on or in \n     connection with which the mark is in use in commerce. The \n     sentence comprising subsection 8(a) of the Trademark Act of \n     1946 has been revised to clarify and distinguish the \n     requirements for the fee, the affidavit, the specimens and  a \n     showing of non-use. The proposed revision further permits \n     the Commissioner to specify the number of specimens or \n     facsimiles required so that he may require a specimen or \n     facsimile for each class of goods or services identified \n     in the registration. The language ``setting forth those \n     goods or services recited in the registration on or in \n     connection with which the mark is not in use in commerce'' \n     is proposed to be added to parallel the affidavit \n     requirements pertaining to use of the mark and to clarify \n     that the owner must specify the goods or services to which \n     a showing of non-use pertains.\n     Existing Subsection 8(b)\n       The requirements set out in former subsection 8(b) of the \n     Trademark Act of 1946, pertaining to marks published pursuant \n     to section 12(c) of the Trademark Act of 1946, have been set \n     out in subsections 8(a)(2), 8(b) and (8)(c) and conform to \n     the proposed revisions as to the time of filing the \n     affidavit, the grace period and the correction of \n     deficiencies.\n     Existing Subsection 8(c)\n       Subsection 8(c) of the Trademark Act of 1946 is now set out \n     in subsection 8(e) and has been amended to reflect the \n     revisions in subsections 8 (a) and (b) to add requirements \n     for the periodic filing of additional affidavits by changing \n     reference from ``. . . any owner who files either of the \n     above-prescribed affidavits . . .'' to ``. . . any owner who \n     files one of the above-prescribed affidavits . . .''.\n     Subsection 8(f)--Appointment of Domestic Representative\n       Section 5 of this Act proposes to add a section 8(f) to the \n     Trademark Act of 1946 to provide for the appointment of a \n     domestic representative for service of notices or process in \n     proceedings affecting the mark by owners not domiciled in the \n     United States. This new subsection is consistent with similar \n     requirements imposed on applicants by subsection 1(e) of the \n     Trademark Act of 1946. This is necessary because the \n     appointment required in subsection 1(e) of the Trademark Act \n     of 1946 pertains only during the pendency of the application.\n     Registrant or Owner: Who must file?\n       Throughout the revised section 8, the term ``registrant'' \n     has been replaced by the term ``owner.'' The practice at the \n     Patent and Trademark Office has been to require that the \n     current owner of the registration file all the post-\n     registration affidavits needed to maintain a registration. \n     The current owner of the registration must aver to actual \n     knowledge of the use of the mark in the subject registration. \n     However, the definition of ``registrant'' in section 45 of \n     the Act states that the ``terms `applicant' and `registrant' \n     embrace the legal representatives, predecessors, successors \n     and assigns of each applicant and registrant.'' Therefore, \n     use of the term ``registrant'' in section 8 of the Act would \n     imply that any legal representative, predecessor, successor \n     or assign of the registrant could successfully file the \n     affidavits required by sections 8 and 9. To correct this \n     situation, and to keep with the general principle, as set out \n     in section 1, that the owner is the proper person to \n     prosecute an application, section 8 has been amended to state \n     that the owner must file the affidavits required by the \n     section.\n\n\n                   section 6. renewal of registration\n\n     Summary of Section 6\n       This section amends subsection 9(a) of the Trademark Act of \n     1946 to cross-reference the obligatory registration \n     maintenance requirements of section 8 of the Trademark Act of \n     1946; to delete the obligation to submit as part of a renewal \n     application verified statements regarding the use of the mark \n     in commerce and attaching to the application a specimen or \n     facsimile showing current use of the mark; to extend the time \n     for filing a renewal application to up to one year before the \n     expiration of the period for which the registration was \n     issued or renewed and, for an additional fee, up to six \n     months after the end of the expiring period of the \n     registration; to grant authority to the Commissioner to \n     prescribe the form of the written application for renewal of \n     the registration; and, to permit the correction of \n     deficiencies after the statutory filing period.\n       This section amends subsection 9(c) to specify the \n     requirements for the appointment by registrants not domiciled \n     in the United States of a domestic representative for service \n     of notices or process in proceedings affecting the mark.\n     Use Requirement for Registration Renewal\n       Separate from the obligation to renew a trademark \n     registration at ten-year intervals, the U.S. Patent and \n     Trademark Office continues to believe in the value of \n     requiring a periodic filing verifying the continued use of \n     the mark as a way to maintain the integrity of the trademark \n     register by periodically removing from the register marks no \n     longer in use in commerce. Therefore, consistent with the \n     Treaty obligations, the proposed revision deletes from \n     subsection 9(a) of the Trademark Act of 1946 the requirement \n     that the renewal application include a verified statement \n     attesting to the use of the mark in commerce, accompanied by \n     a specimen or facsimile evidencing current use of the mark, \n     or a showing of excusable non-use. These requirements are \n     proposed to be added to subsection 8(a) of the Trademark Act \n     of 1946 in the form of an obligation to file an affidavit of \n     use or excusable non-use, consistent with the requirements \n     set forth in the subsection, on the tenth anniversary of the \n     registration and every ten years thereafter.\n\n[[Page S6579]]\n\n       Also, consistent with the treaty obligations, the \n     requirement that the renewal application be verified is \n     proposed to be deleted and the Commissioner is granted \n     authority to prescribe the form of the written renewal \n     application, consistent with law and international treaties \n     or agreements to which the United States is a party.\n     Grace Period and Harmonization\n       Rule 8 of the Regulations under the Trademark Law Treaty \n     provides that a renewal request must be accepted for at least \n     a six-month period, upon payment of a surcharge, after the \n     date the renewal is due. The existing provisions of section 9 \n     of the Trademark Act of 1946 permit the renewal application \n     to be filed within a three-month period, upon payment of a \n     surcharge, after the date the renewal is due. The revision \n     proposes to change the three-month grace period for \n     requesting registration renewal to the six-month grace period \n     required by the treaty and harmonizes the requirements for \n     filings under sections 8 and 9 of the Trademark Act of 1946. \n     Harmonization of the filing requirements of sections 8 and 9 \n     will require the amendment of both sections to provide this \n     six-month grace period for making the required filing. \n     This amendment is a liberalization of sections 8 and 9 of \n     the Trademark Act of 1946, which is desirable to avoid, to \n     the extent possible, the removal from the register for \n     mere technical reasons of marks that are still in use in \n     commerce. In particular, consistent with the filing \n     requirements in section 8 of the Trademark Act of 1946, \n     the period for filing a renewal request is expressly \n     defined as the period one year prior to expiration of the \n     period for which the registration was issued or renewed, \n     or within a grace period of six months after the end of \n     the expiring period.\n     Subsection 9(c)--Appointment of Domestic Representatives\n       Subsection 6(b) of this Act amends subsection 9(c) to the \n     Trademark Act of 1946 to provide for the appointment of a \n     domestic representative for service of notices or process in \n     proceedings affecting the mark by owners not domiciled in the \n     United States, rather than referencing the requirements in \n     subsection 1(e) of the Trademark Act of 1946. This is \n     preferable because the appointment required in subsection \n     1(e) of the Trademark Act of 1946 pertains only during the \n     pendency of the application.\n\n\n                section 7. recording assignment of mark\n\n       This section amends section 10 of the Trademark Act of 1946 \n     (15 U.S.C. 1060) to clarify that the PTO will record a change \n     in ownership without requiring a copy of the underlying \n     document; and to remove the proscription against the \n     assignment of a mark in an application filed under section \n     1(b) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051(b)) \n     (intent-to-use) upon the filing of an amendment to allege use \n     pursuant to section 1(c) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 \n     U.S.C. 1051(c)).\n       The PTO has interpreted the present reference to a ``record \n     of assignments'' in section 10 to require the PTO to record a \n     copy of the actual assignment document. Article 11(4) of \n     Trademark Law Treaty prohibits the requirement of a statement \n     or proof of such transfer in order to record an assignment of \n     a trademark registration. The proposed amendment clarifies \n     that, rather than maintaining a ``record of assignments,'' \n     the PTO ``shall maintain a record of the prescribed \n     information on assignments, in such form as may be prescribed \n     by the Commissioner.'' The proposed amendment authorizes the \n     PTO to determine what information regarding assignments it \n     will record and maintain. The proposed amendment will ensure \n     that a transfer of goodwill remains a necessary element of a \n     valid assignment of a trademark; however, the PTO will not \n     require a statement or proof of the transfer of goodwill in \n     order to record an assignment of a trademark registration.\n       Additionally, pertaining to the proscription against the \n     assignment of a mark in an application filed under section \n     1(b) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (intent-to-use), the \n     proposed amendment adds reference to section 1(c) of the \n     Trademark Act of 1946 so that the filing of an amendment to \n     allege use pursuant to section 1(c) removes the restriction \n     against assigning the mark except to the successor to the \n     business of the applicant, or portion thereof, to which the \n     mark pertains, if that business is ongoing and existing. \n     Presently, prior to registration of an application filed \n     pursuant to section 1(b) of the Trademark Act of 1946 \n     (15 U.S.C. 1051(b)) based upon a bona fide intention to \n     use a mark in commerce on the identified goods or \n     services, an applicant must file either a verified \n     statement of use under section 1(d) of the Trademark Act \n     of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051(d)) or an amendment to allege use \n     under section 1(c) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. \n     1051(c)). The substance of the two filings is essentially \n     the same. The difference between the two filings is the \n     point at which the filing is made. Presently, section 10 \n     of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1060) limits the \n     assignability of an application to register a mark under \n     section 1(b) of the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. \n     1051(b)) until such time as applicant files a verified \n     statement of use under section 1(d) of the Trademark Act \n     of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051(d)). Since the effect of the \n     filing of an amendment to allege use under section 1(c) of \n     the Trademark Act of 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051(c)) is \n     analogous, there is no reason in law or policy for \n     omitting to include reference to section 1(c) in section \n     10.\n\n\n   section 8. international conventions; copy of foreign registration\n\n       This section amends section 44(e) of the Trademark Act of \n     1946 (15 U.S.C. 1126(e)) to change the requirement that an \n     application ``be accompanied by a certificate or certified \n     copy'' of the foreign registration, which has been \n     interpreted to be a filing date requirement, so that such \n     copy may be submitted to the PTO prior to registration, \n     within such time limits as may be prescribed by the \n     Commissioner. Such a requirement as a prerequisite to \n     receiving a filing date is prohibited pursuant to Article 5 \n     of the Trademark Law Treaty.\n\n\n                    section 9. transition provisions\n\n       This section clarifies when and how the new provisions set \n     out for the maintenance of registrations will apply to \n     existing and future applications and registrations.\n       Section 9(a) provides that registrations issued or renewed \n     with a 20 year term, i.e. those registrations issued or \n     renewed prior to the effective date of the Trademark Law \n     Revision Act of 1988, will be subject to the post-\n     registration provisions of this Act on or after a date that \n     is 1 year before the date on which the twenty year term \n     expires. This provision will allow those registrations to \n     have the benefit of the one year statutory filing period and \n     the six-month grace period provided by the Act.\n       Section 9(b) provides that the Act shall apply to any \n     application for the registration of a trademark pending on, \n     or filed after, the effective date of the Act.\n       Section 9(c) provides that the filing of an affidavit under \n     Section 5 of the Act, which amends Section 8(b) of the \n     Trademark Act of 1946, shall be required for any registration \n     if the sixth or tenth anniversary of the registration, or the \n     sixth anniversary of publication under section 12(c) of the \n     Trademark Act of 1946, occurs on or after the effective date \n     of this Act.\n       Section 9(d) provides that the amendment made by section 6 \n     of this Act shall apply to the filing of an application for \n     the renewal of a registration if the expiration date of the \n     registration for which the renewal application is filed is on \n     or after the effective date of this Act.\n\n\n                       section 10. effective date\n\n       This section provides that this Act shall take effect one \n     year after enactment of the Act or upon entry into force of \n     the Treaty in respect to the United States, whichever occurs \n     first. Since the provisions of the Act will modernize and \n     simplify procedures pertaining to trademark application \n     filing and registration maintenance, this section provides \n     that, if the U.S. has not acceded to the treaty and become \n     subject to the obligations thereunder within a year after \n     enactment, the Act will become effective so that its benefits \n     can be realized by trademark owners.\n       Since the United States is not one of the first five States \n     to deposit its instrument of ratification or accession, \n     Article 20 of the Treaty provides that the Treaty shall enter \n     into force three months after the date on which the \n     instrument of ratification or accession is deposited.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nTrademark Law Treaty Implementation and Registration Simplification Act \n(TLT Act). The TLT Act, which will implement the Trademark Law Treaty \nof 1994, is an important step in our continuing endeavor to harmonize \ntrademark law around the world so that American businesses--\nparticularly small American businesses--seeking to expand \ninternationally will face simplified and straightforward trademark \nregistration procedures in foreign countries.\n  This bill is one of a series I have supported which protect American \ntrademark holders in a world of rapidly changing technology and \ninternational competition. Earlier this year I introduced S. 1727, \nlegislation authorizing the National Research Council of the National \nAcademy of Sciences to conduct a comprehensive study of the effects of \nadding new generic Top Level Domains on trademark and other \nintellectual property rights owners. Moreover, I supported the Federal \nTrademark Dilution Act of 1995, which was enacted into law last \nCongress. This legislation provides intellectual property rights \nholders with the power to enjoin another person's commercial use of \nfamous marks that would cause dilution of the mark's distinctive \nquality. Together, these measures represent efforts to refine American \ntrademark law to ensure that it promotes American interests.\n  Today more than ever before, trademarks are among the most valuable \nassets of business. One of the major obstacles in securing \ninternational trademark protection is the difficulty and cost involved \nin obtaining and maintaining a registration in each and every country. \nCountries around the world have a number of varying requirements for \nfiling trademark applications, many of which are non-substantive and \nvery confusing. Because of these difficulties, many U.S. businesses, \nespecially smaller businesses,\n\n[[Page S6580]]\n\nare forced to concentrate their efforts on registering their trademarks \nonly in certain major countries while pirates freely register their \nmarks in other countries.\n  The Trademark Law Treaty will eliminate many of the arduous \nregistration requirements of foreign countries by enacting a list of \nmaximum requirements for trademark procedures. Eliminating needless \nformalities will be an enormous step in the direction of a rational \ntrademark system which will benefit American business, especially \nsmaller businesses, to expand into the international market more \nfreely. Fortunately, the Trademark Law Treaty has already been signed \nby thirty-five countries, has already been ratified by ten countries \nincluding Japan and the United Kingdom, and has already been reported \nfavorably to the full Senate by the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  As the United States is already in accordance with most of the \nTrademark Law Treaty requirements, the TLT Act would impose only minor \nchanges to U.S. trademark law. The Patent and Trademark Office, the \nInternational Trademark Association and the American Intellectual \nProperty Law Association have indicated their support for the TLT Act.\n  I hope the Senate will consider and pass this bill expeditiously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6564-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 389\n\n  At the request of Mr. Abraham, the name of the Senator from Oregon \n(Mr. Smith) was added as a cosponsor of S. 389, a bill to improve \ncongressional deliberation on proposed Federal private sector mandates, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 472\n\n  At the request of Mr. Craig, the name of the Senator from Utah (Mr. \nHatch) was added as a cosponsor of S. 472, a bill to provide for \nreferenda in which the residents of Puerto Rico may express \ndemocratically their preferences regarding the political status of the \nterritory, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 617\n\n  At the request of Mr. Johnson, the name of the Senator from Wisconsin \n(Mr. Feingold) was added as a cosponsor of S. 617, a bill to amend the \nFederal Meat Inspection Act to require that imported meat, and meat \nfood products containing imported meat, bear a label identifying the \ncountry of origin.\n\n\n                                 S. 778\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lugar, the name of the Senator from New York \n(Mr. Moynihan) was added as a cosponsor of S. 778, a bill to authorize \na new trade and investment policy for sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\n                                 S. 981\n\n  At the request of Mr. Levin, the name of the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Hagel) was added as a cosponsor of S. 981, a bill to provide for \nanalysis of major rules.\n\n\n                                S. 1825\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Murray, the name of the Senator from Wisconsin \n(Mr. Feingold) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1825, a bill to amend \ntitle 10, United States Code, to provide sufficient funding to assure a \nminimum size for honor guard details at funerals of veterans of the \nArmed Forces, to establish the minimum size of such details, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1868\n\n  At the request of Mr. Nickles, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n(Mr. Thomas) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1868, a bill to express \nUnited States foreign policy with respect to, and to strengthen United \nStates advocacy on behalf of, individuals persecuted for their faith \nworldwide;

which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 251\n\n       Whereas on June 16, 1998, the Detroit Red Wings defeated \n     the Washington Capitals, 4-1, in Game 4 of the championship \n     series;\n       Whereas this victory marks the second year in a row that \n     the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup in a four game sweep;\n       Whereas the Stanley Cup took its first trip around the rink \n     in the lap of Vladimir Konstantinov, the Red Wing defenseman \n     who was seriously injured in an accident less than a week \n     after Detroit won the Cup last year;\n       Whereas Vladi and his wife Irina, whose strength and \n     courage are a source of pride and inspiration to our entire \n     community are an exemplary Red Wings family and Vladi's \n     battle is an inspiration to all Americans;\n       Whereas Marian and Mike Ilitch, the owners of the Red Wings \n     and community leaders in Detroit and Michigan, have brought \n     the Stanley Cup back to Detroit yet again;\n       Whereas the Red Wings, as one of the original six NHL \n     teams, have always held a special place in the hearts of all \n     Michiganders;\n       Whereas it was a profound source of pride for Detroit when \n     the Wings brought the Cup back to Detroit in 1954 and 1955, \n     the last time the Wings won consecutive NHL championships;\n       Whereas today, Detroit continues to provide Red Wings fans \n     with hockey greatness and Detroit, otherwise known as \n     ``Hockeytown, U.S.A.'' is home to the most loyal fans in the \n     world;\n       Whereas the Red Wings are indebted to Head Coach Scotty \n     Bowman, who has brought the Red Wings to the playoffs 3 times \n     in the last 4 years, and with this year's victory, has earned \n     his eighth Stanley Cup victory, tying him with his mentor Toe \n     Blake for the most championships in league history;\n       Whereas the Wings are also lucky to have the phenomenal \n     leadership of Team Captain Steve Yzerman, who in his \n     fifteenth season in the NHL, received the Conn Smythe Trophy, \n     given to the most valuable player in the NHL playoffs;\n       Whereas each one of the Red Wings will be remembered on the \n     premier sports trophy, the Stanley Cup, including Slava \n     Fetisov, Bob Rouse, Nick Lidstrom, Igor Larionov, Mathieu \n     Dandenault, Slava Kozlov, Brendan Shanahan, Dmitri Mironov, \n     Doug Brown, Kirk Maltby, Steve Yzerman, Martin\n\n[[Page S6581]]\n\n     Lapointe, Mike Knuble, Darren McCarty, Joe Kocur, Aaron Ward, \n     Chris Osgood, Kevin Hodson, Kris Draper, Jamie Macoun, Brent \n     Gilchrist, Anders Eriksson, Larry Murphy, Sergei Federov, and \n     Tomas Holmstrom: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the U.S. Senate congratulates the Detroit \n     Red Wings on winning the 1998 National Hockey League Stanley \n     Cup Championship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6580-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6581-S6631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         ENERGY AND WATER DEVELOPMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       INOUYE AMENDMENT NO. 2713\n\n  Mr. GORTON (for Mr. Inouye) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. \n2138) making appropriations for energy and water development for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes; as \nfollows:\n\n       On page 18, add the following before the period:\n       ``:Provided further, The Secretary of the Interior is \n     directed to use not to exceed $200,000 of funds appropriated \n     herein to provide technical assistance in a study of measures \n     to increase the efficiency of existing water systems \n     developed to serve sugar cane plantations and surrounding \n     communities in the State of Hawaii''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       DASCHLE AMENDMENT NO. 2714\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 2138, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Definitions.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is \n     a pediatric disease of epic and worsening proportions that \n     results in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and \n     adults.\n       (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical \n     communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous \n     and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse \n     health effects.\n       (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.\n       (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under \n     the minimum legal age to purchase such products.\n       (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute \n     significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco \n     products by adolescents.\n       (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and \n     marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb \n     tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the \n     sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are \n     needed.\n       (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and \n     regulatory authority and resources they need to address \n     comprehensively the public health and societal problems \n     caused by the use of tobacco products.\n       (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public \n     health community, and the public at large recognize that the \n     tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.\n       (9) Under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, the \n     Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating \n     interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.\n       (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially \n     affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, \n     marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce \n     on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the \n     Nation's economy.\n       (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce \n     through the health care and other costs attributable to the \n     use of tobacco products.\n       (12) The citizens of the several States are exposed to, and \n     adversely affected by, environmental smoke in public \n     buildings and other facilities which imposes a burden on \n     interstate commerce.\n       (13) Civil actions against tobacco product manufacturers \n     and others are pending in Federal and State courts arising \n     from the use, marketing, and sale of tobacco products. Among \n     these actions are cases brought by the attorneys general of \n     more than 40 States, certain cities and counties, and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other parties, including \n     Indian tribes, and class actions brought by private claimants \n     (such as in the Castano Civil Actions), seeking to recover \n     monies expended to treat tobacco-related diseases and for the \n     protection of minors and consumers, as well as penalties and \n     other relief for violations of antitrust, health, consumer \n     protection, and other laws.\n       (14) Civil actions have been filed throughout the United \n     States against tobacco product manufacturers and their \n     distributors, trade associations, law firms, and consultants \n     on behalf of individuals or classes of individuals claiming \n     to be dependent upon and injured by tobacco products.\n       (15) These civil actions are complex, time-consuming, \n     expensive, and burdensome for both the litigants and Federal \n     and State courts. To date, these civil actions have not \n     resulted in sufficient redress for smokers or non-\n     governmental third-party payers. To the extent that \n     governmental entities have been or may in the future be \n     compensated for tobacco-related claims they have brought, it \n     is not now possible to identify what portions of such past or \n     future recoveries can be attributed to their various \n     antitrust, health, consumer protection, or other causes of \n     action.\n       (16) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     comprehensive public health legislation because of tobacco's \n     unique position in the Nation's history and economy; the need \n     to prevent the sale, distribution, marketing and advertising \n     of tobacco products to persons under the minimum legal age to \n     purchase such products; and the need to educate the public, \n     especially young people, regarding the health effects of \n     using tobacco products.\n       (17) The public interest requires a timely, fair, \n     equitable, and consistent result that will serve the public \n     interest by (A) providing that a portion of the costs of \n     treatment for diseases and adverse health effects associated \n     with the use of tobacco products is borne by the \n     manufacturers of these products, and (B) restricting \n     throughout the Nation the sale, distribution, marketing, and \n     advertising of tobacco products only to persons of legal age \n     to purchase such products.\n       (18) Public health authorities estimate that the benefits \n     to the Nation of enacting Federal legislation to accomplish \n     these goals would be significant in human and economic terms.\n       (19) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent \n     would prevent well over 60,000 early deaths each year and \n     save up to $43 billion each year in reduced medical costs, \n     improved productivity, and the avoidance of premature deaths.\n       (20) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco \n     products have been especially directed to attract young \n     persons to use tobacco products and these efforts have \n     resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past \n     efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful \n     in adequately preventing such increased use.\n       (21) In 1995, the tobacco industry spent close to \n     $4,900,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, \n     increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-\n     term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.\n       (22) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly \n     portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and \n     healthful to minors.\n       (23) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by \n     persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 \n     are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.\n       (24) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of \n     sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with \n     sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports \n     and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting \n     activity.\n       (25) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable \n     tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about \n     tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to \n     overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the \n     number of young people who begin to use tobacco.\n       (26) Tobacco advertising increases the size of the tobacco \n     market by increasing consumption of tobacco products \n     including increasing tobacco use by young people.\n       (27) Children are more influenced by tobacco advertising \n     than adults, they smoke the most advertised brands, and \n     children as young as 3 to 6 years old can recognize a \n     character associated with smoking at the same rate as they \n     recognize cartoons and fast food characters.\n       (28) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people \n     are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco \n     market.\n       (29) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a \n     positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.\n       (30) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent \n     unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation \n     prohibiting access to young people and providing for \n     education about tobacco use.\n       (31) International experience shows that advertising \n     regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a \n     greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use \n     than weaker or less comprehensive ones. Text-only \n     requirements, while not as stringent as a ban, will help \n     reduce underage use of tobacco products while preserving the \n     informational function of advertising.\n       (32) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     legislation to address the public health crisis created by \n     actions of the tobacco industry.\n       (33) If, as a direct or indirect result of this Act, the \n     consumption of tobacco products in the United States is \n     reduced significantly, then tobacco farmers, their families, \n     and their communities may suffer economic hardship and \n     displacement, notwithstanding their lack of involvement in \n     the manufacturing and marketing of tobacco products.\n       (34) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and \n     other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and \n     encourages them to use tobacco products.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to clarify the authority of the Food and Drug \n     Administration to regulate tobacco products under the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), by \n     recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory authority \n     with respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution \n     of tobacco products;\n       (2) to require the tobacco industry to fund both Federal \n     and State oversight of the tobacco industry from on-going \n     payments by tobacco product manufacturers;\n       (3) to require tobacco product manufacturers to provide \n     ongoing funding to be used for an aggressive Federal, State, \n     and local enforcement program and for a nationwide licensing \n     system to prevent minors from obtaining tobacco products and \n     to prevent the unlawful distribution of tobacco products, \n     while expressly permitting the States to\n\n[[Page S6583]]\n\n     adopt additional measures that further restrict or eliminate \n     the products' use;\n       (4) to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration and the \n     States may continue to address issues of particular concern \n     to public health officials, especially the use of tobacco by \n     young people and dependence on tobacco;\n       (5) to impose financial surcharges on tobacco product \n     manufacturers if tobacco use by young people does not \n     substantially decline;\n       (6) to authorize appropriate agencies of the Federal \n     government to set national standards controlling the \n     manufacture of tobacco products and the identity, public \n     disclosure, and amount of ingredients used in such products;\n       (7) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to \n     ensure that the tobacco industry makes efforts to develop and \n     introduce less harmful tobacco products;\n       (8) to confirm the Food and Drug Administration's authority \n     to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other harmful \n     components of tobacco products;\n       (9) in order to ensure that adults are better informed, to \n     require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose research \n     which has not previously been made available, as well as \n     research generated in the future, relating to the health and \n     dependency effects or safety of tobacco products;\n       (10) to impose on tobacco product manufacturers the \n     obligation to provide funding for a variety of public health \n     initiatives;\n       (11) to establish a minimum Federal standard for stringent \n     restrictions on smoking in public places, while also to \n     permit State, Tribal, and local governments to enact \n     additional and more stringent standards or elect not to be \n     covered by the Federal standard if that State's standard is \n     as protective, or more protective, of the public health;\n       (12) to authorize and fund from payments by tobacco product \n     manufacturers a continuing national counter-advertising and \n     tobacco control campaign which seeks to educate consumers and \n     discourage children and adolescents from beginning to use \n     tobacco products, and which encourages current users of \n     tobacco products to discontinue using such products;\n       (13) to establish a mechanism to compensate the States in \n     settlement of their various claims against tobacco product \n     manufacturers;\n       (14) to authorize and to fund from payments by tobacco \n     product manufacturers a nationwide program of smoking \n     cessation administered through State and Tribal governments \n     and the private sector;\n       (15) to establish and fund from payments by tobacco product \n     manufacturers a National Tobacco Fund;\n       (16) to affirm the rights of individuals to access to the \n     courts, to civil trial by jury, and to damages to compensate \n     them for harm caused by tobacco products;\n       (17) to continue to permit the sale of tobacco products to \n     adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are \n     not sold or accessible to underage purchasers;\n       (18) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the \n     tobacco industry; and\n       (19) to protect tobacco farmers and their communities from \n     the economic impact of this Act by providing full funding for \n     and the continuation of the Federal tobacco program and by \n     providing funds for farmers and communities to develop new \n     opportunities in tobacco-dependent communities.\n\n     SEC. 4. SCOPE AND EFFECT.\n\n       (a) Intended Effect.--This Act is not intended to--\n       (1) establish a precedent with regard to any other \n     industry, situation, circumstance, or legal action; or\n       (2) except as provided in this Act, affect any action \n     pending in State, Tribal, or Federal court, or any agreement, \n     consent decree, or contract of any kind.\n       (b) Taxation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     this Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not affect \n     any authority of the Secretary of the Treasury (including any \n     authority assigned to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \n     Firearms) or of State or local governments with regard to \n     taxation for tobacco or tobacco products.\n       (c) Agricultural Activities.--The provisions of this Act \n     which authorize the Secretary to take certain actions with \n     regard to tobacco and tobacco products shall not be construed \n     to affect any authority of the Secretary of Agriculture under \n     existing law regarding the growing, cultivation, or curing of \n     raw tobacco.\n\n     SEC. 5.

CONSTRUCTION OF CURRENT REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The final regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary in the August 28, 1996, issue of the Federal \n     Register (62 Fed. Reg. 44615-44618) and codified at part 897 \n     of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are hereby deemed \n     to be lawful and to have been lawfully promulgated by the \n     Secretary under chapter IX and section 701 of the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by this Act, and not \n     under chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \n     The provisions of part 897 that are not in effect on the date \n     of enactment of this Act shall take effect as in such part or \n     upon such later date as determined by the Secretary by\n\n[[Page S6592]]\n\n     order. The Secretary shall amend the designation of authority \n     in such regulations in accordance with this subsection.\n       (b) Limitation on Advisory Opinions.--As of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the following documents issued by the \n     Food and Drug Administration shall not constitute advisory \n     opinions under section 10.85(d)(1) of title 21, Code of \n     Federal Regulations, except as they apply to tobacco \n     products, and shall not be cited by the Secretary or the Food \n     and Drug Administration as binding precedent.\n       (1) The preamble to the proposed rule in the document \n     entitled ``Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution \n     of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco Products to Protect \n     Children and Adolescents'' (60 Fed. Reg. 41314-41372 (August \n     11, 1995)).\n       (2) The document entitled ``Nicotine in Cigarettes and \n     Smokeless Tobacco Products is a Drug and These Products Are \n     Nicotine Delivery Devices Under the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act;; (60 Fed. Reg. 41453-41787 (August 11, 1995)).\n       (3) The preamble to the final rule in the document entitled \n     ``Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of \n     Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect Children and \n     Adolescents'' (61 Fed. Reg. 44396-44615 (August 28, 1996)).\n       (4) The document entitled ``Nicotine in Cigarettes and \n     Smokeless Tobacco is a Drug and These Products are Nicotine \n     Delivery Devices Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \n     Act; Jurisdictional Determination; (61 Fed. Reg. 44619-45318 \n     (August 28, 1996)).\n\n              TITLE II--REDUCTIONS IN UNDERAGE TOBACCO USE\n\n                        Subtitle A--Underage Use\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Reductions in the underage use of tobacco products are \n     critically important to the public health.\n       (2) Achieving this critical public health goal can be \n     substantially furthered by increasing the price of tobacco \n     products to discourage underage use if reduction targets are \n     not achieved and by creating financial incentives for \n     manufacturers to discourage youth from using their tobacco \n     products.\n       (3) When reduction targets in underage use are not achieved \n     on an industry-wide basis, the price increases that will \n     result from an industry-wide assessment will provide an \n     additional deterrence to youth tobacco use.\n       (4) Manufacturer-specific incentives that will be imposed \n     if reduction targets are not met by a manufacturer provide a \n     strong incentive for each manufacturer to make all efforts to \n     discourage youth use of its brands and ensure the \n     effectiveness of the industry-wide assessments.\n\n     SEC. 202. PURPOSE.\n\n       This title is intended to ensure that, in the event that \n     other measures contained in this Act prove to be inadequate \n     to produce substantial reductions in tobacco use by minors, \n     tobacco companies will pay additional assessments. These \n     additional assessments are designed to lower youth tobacco \n     consumption in a variety of ways: by triggering further \n     increases in the price of tobacco products, by encouraging \n     tobacco companies to work to meet statutory targets for \n     reductions in youth tobacco consumption, and providing \n     support for further reduction efforts.\n\n     SEC. 203. GOALS FOR REDUCING UNDERAGE TOBACCO USE.\n\n       (a) Goals.--As part of a comprehensive national tobacco \n     control policy, the Secretary, working in cooperation with \n     State, Tribal, and local governments and the private sector, \n     shall take all actions under this Act necessary to ensure \n     that the required percentage reductions in underage use of \n     tobacco products set forth in this title are achieved.\n       (b) Required Reductions for Cigarettes.--With respect to \n     cigarettes, the required percentage reduction in underage \n     use, as set forth in section 204, means--\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   Required Percentage Reduction as a Percentage\n               Calendar Year After Date of Enactment                  of Base Incidence Percentage in Underage\n                                                                                   Cigarette Use\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYears 3 and 4                                                                                         15 percent\nYears 5 and 6                                                                                         30 percent\nYears 7, 8, and 9                                                                                     50 percent\nYear 10 and thereafter                                                                                60 percent\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       (c) Required Reductions for Smokeless Tobacco.--With \n     respect to smokeless tobacco products, the required \n     percentage reduction in underage use, as set forth in section \n     204, means--\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   Required Percentage Reduction as a Percentage\n               Calendar Year After Date of Enactment                  of Base Incidence Percentage in Underage\n                                                                               Smokeless Tobacco Use\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYears 3 and 4                                                                                       12.5 percent\nYears 5 and 6                                                                                         25 percent\nYears 7, 8, and 9                                                                                     35 percent\nYear 10 and thereafter                                                                                45 percent\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     SEC. 204.

The \n     determination shall be based on the annual percent prevalence \n     of the use of tobacco products, for the industry as a whole \n     and of particular manufacturers, by young individuals (as \n     determined by the surveys conducted by the Secretary) for the \n     year involved as compared to the base incidence percentages.\n       (c) Confidentiality of Data.--The Secretary may conduct a \n     survey relating to tobacco use involving minors. If the \n     information collected in the course of conducting the annual \n     performance survey results in the individual supplying the \n     information or described in it to be identifiable, the \n     information may not be used for any purpose other than the \n     purpose for which it was supplied unless that individual (or \n     that individual's guardian) consents to its use for such \n     other purpose. The information may not be published or \n     released in any other form if the individual supplying the \n     information or described in it is identifiable unless that \n     individual (or that individual's guardian) consents to its \n     publication or release in other form.\n       (d) Methodolgy.--\n       (1) In general.--The survey required by subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (A)

permit the calculation of the actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of tobacco product of a manufacturer) based on the \n     point estimates of the percentage of young individuals \n     reporting use of a type of tobacco product (or, in the case \n     of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use of a type of \n     tobacco product of a manufacturer) from the annual \n     performance survey.\n       (2) Criteria for deeming point estimates correct.--Point \n     estimates under paragraph (1)(E) are deemed conclusively to \n     be correct and accurate for calculating actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of tobacco product of a particular manufacturer) \n     for the purpose of measuring compliance with percent \n     reduction targets and calculating surcharges provided that \n     the precision of estimates (based on sampling error) of the \n     percentage of young individuals reporting use of a type of \n     tobacco product (or, in the case of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge, the use of a type of tobacco product of a \n     manufacturer) is such that the 95-percent confidence interval \n     around such point estimates is no more than plus or minus 1 \n     percent.\n       (3) Survey deemed correct, proper, and accurate.--A survey \n     using the methodology required by this subsection is deemed \n     conclusively to be proper, correct, and accurate for purposes \n     of this Act.\n       (4) Secretary may adopt different methodology.--The \n     Secretary by notice and comment rulemaking may adopt a survey \n     methodology that is different than the methodology described \n     in paragraph (1) if the different methodology is at least as \n     statistically precise as that methodology.\n       (e) Industry-wide Non-attainment Surcharges.--\n       (1) Secretary to determine industry-wide non-attainment \n     percentage.--The Secretary

(5) Surcharge liability among manufacturers.--A tobacco \n     product manufacturer shall be liable under this subsection to \n     one or more other manufacturers if the plaintiff tobacco \n     product manufacturer establishes by a preponderance of the \n     evidence that the defendant tobacco product manufacturer, \n     through its acts or omissions, was responsible for a \n     disproportionate share of the non-attainment surcharge as \n     compared to the responsibility of the plaintiff manufacturer.\n       (6) Exemptions for small manufacturers.--\n       (A) Allocation by market share.--The Secretary shall make \n     such allocations according to each manufacturer's share of \n     the domestic cigarette or domestic smokeless tobacco market, \n     as appropriate, in the year for which the surcharge is being \n     assessed, based on actual Federal excise tax payments.\n       (B) Exemption.--In any year in which a surcharge is being \n     assessed, the Secretary shall exempt from payment any tobacco \n     product manufacturer with less than 1 percent of the domestic \n     market share for a specific category of tobacco product \n     unless the Secretary finds that the manufacturer's products \n     are used by underage individuals at a rate equal to or \n     greater than the manufacturer's total market share for the \n     type of tobacco product.\n       (f) Manufacturer-specific Surcharges.--\n       (1) Required percentage reductions.--Each manufacturer \n     which manufactured a brand or brands of tobacco product on or \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act shall reduce the \n     percentage of young individuals who use such manufacturer's \n     brand or brands as their usual brand in accordance with the \n     required percentage reductions described under subsections \n     (b) (with respect to cigarettes) and (c ) (with respect to \n     smokeless tobacco).\n       (2) Application to less popular brands.--Each manufacturer \n     which manufactured a brand or brands of tobacco product on or \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act for which the \n     base incidence percentage is equal to or less than the de \n     minimis level shall ensure that the percent prevalence of \n     young individuals who use the manufacturer's tobacco products \n     as their usual brand remains equal to or less than the de \n     minimis level described in paragraph (4).\n       (3) New entrants.--Each manufacturer of a tobacco product \n     which begins to manufacture a tobacco product after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act shall ensure that the percent \n     prevalence of young individuals who use the manufacturer's \n     tobacco products as their usual brand is equal to or less \n     than the de minimis level.\n       (4) De minimis level defined.--The de minimis level is \n     equal to 1 percent prevalence of the use of each \n     manufacturer's brands of tobacco product by young individuals \n     (as determined on the basis of the annual performance survey \n     conducted by the Secretary) for a year.\n       (5) Target reduction levels.--\n       (A) Existing manufacturers.-- For purposes of this section, \n     the target reduction level for each type of tobacco product \n     for a year for a manufacturer is the product of the required \n     percentage reduction for a type of tobacco product for a year \n     and the manufacturers base incidence percentage for such \n     tobacco product.\n       (B) New manufacturers; manufacturers with low base \n     incidence percentages.--With respect to a manufacturer which \n     begins to manufacture a tobacco product after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act or a manufacturer for which the \n     baseline level as measured by the annual performance survey \n     is equal to or less than the de minimis level described in \n     paragraph (4), the base incidence percentage is the de \n     minimis level, and the required percentage reduction in \n     underage use for a type of tobacco product with respect to a \n     manufacturer for a year shall be deemed to be the number of \n     percentage points necessary to reduce the actual percent \n     prevalence of young individuals identifying a brand of such \n     tobacco product of such manufacturer as the usual brand \n     smoked or used for such year to the de minimis level.\n       (6) Surcharge amount.--\n       (A) In general.--If the Secretary determines that the \n     required percentage reduction in use of a type of tobacco \n     product has not been achieved by such manufacturer for a \n     year, the Secretary shall impose a surcharge on such \n     manufacturer under this paragraph.\n       (B) Amount.--The amount of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge for a type of tobacco product for a year under this \n     paragraph is $1,000, multiplied by the number of young \n     individuals for which such firm is in noncompliance with \n     respect to its target reduction level.\n       (C) Determination of number of young individuals.--For \n     purposes of subparagraph (B) the number of young individuals \n     for which a manufacturer is in noncompliance for a year shall \n     be determined by the Secretary from the annual performance \n     survey and shall be calculated based on the estimated total \n     number of young individuals in such year and the actual \n     percentage prevalence of young individuals identifying a \n     brand of such tobacco product of such manufacturer as the \n     usual brand smoked or used in such year as compared to such \n     manufacturer's target reduction level for the year.\n       (7) De minimis rule.--The Secretary may not impose a \n     surcharge on a manufacturer for a type of tobacco product for \n     a year if the Secretary determines that actual percent \n     prevalence of young individuals identifying that \n     manufacturer's brands of such tobacco product as the usual \n     products smoked or used for such year is less than 1 percent.\n       (g) Surcharges To Be Adjusted for Inflation.--\n       (1) In general.--Beginning with the fourth calendar year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, each dollar amount \n     in the tables in subsections (e)(2), (e)(3), and (f)(6)(B) \n     shall be increased by the inflation adjustment.\n       (2) Inflation adjustment.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     the inflation adjustment for any calendar year is the \n     percentage (if any) by which--\n       (A) the CPI for the preceding calendar year, exceeds\n       (B) the CPI for the calendar year 1998.\n       (3) CPI.--For purposes of paragraph (2), the CPI for any \n     calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for \n     all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.\n       (4) Rounding.--If any increase determined under paragraph \n     (1) is not a multiple of $1,000, the increase shall be \n     rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.\n       (h) Method of Surcharge Assessment.--The Secretary shall \n     assess a surcharge for a specific calendar year on or before \n     May 1 of the subsequent calendar year. Surcharge payments \n     shall be paid on or before July 1 of the year in which they \n     are assessed. The Secretary may establish, by regulation, \n     interest at a rate up to 3 times the prevailing prime rate at \n     the time the surcharge is assessed, and additional charges in \n     an amount up to 3 times the surcharge, for late payment of \n     the surcharge.\n       (i) Business Expense Deduction.--Any surcharge paid by a \n     tobacco product manufacturer under this section shall not be \n     deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense or \n     otherwise under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (j) Appeal Rights.--The amount of any surcharge is \n     committed to the sound discretion of the Secretary and shall \n     be subject to judicial review by the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, based on the \n     arbitrary and capricious standard of section 706(2)(A) of \n     title 5, United States Code. Notwithstanding any other \n     provisions of law, no court shall have authority to stay any \n     surcharge payments due the Secretary under this Act pending \n     judicial review.\n       (k) Responsibility for Agents.--In any action brought under \n     this subsection, a tobacco product manufacturer shall be held \n     responsible for any act or omission of its attorneys, \n     advertising agencies, or other agents that contributed to \n     that manufacturer's responsibility for the surcharge assessed \n     under this section.\n\n     SEC. 205.

A tobacco product manufacturer's share of \n     adjusted units shall be determined as follows:\n       (A) Units.--A tobacco product manufacturer's number of \n     units shall be determined by counting each--\n       (i) pack of 20 cigarettes as 1 adjusted unit;\n       (ii) 1.2 ounces of moist snuff as 0.75 adjusted unit; and\n       (iii) 3 ounces of other smokeless tobacco product as 0.35 \n     adjusted units.\n       (B) Determination of adjusted units.--Except as provided in \n     subparagraph (C), a smokeless tobacco product manufacturer's \n     number of adjusted units shall be determined under the \n     following table:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                             For units:                                    Each unit shall be treated as:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNot exceeding 150 million                                                                          70% of a unit\nExceeding 150 million                                                                             100% of a unit\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       (C) Adjusted units determined on total domestic \n     production.--For purposes of determining a manufacturer's \n     number of adjusted units under subparagraph (B), a \n     manufacturer's total production of units, whether intended \n     for domestic consumption or export, shall be taken into \n     account.\n       (D) Special rule for large manufacturers.--If a tobacco \n     product manufacturer has more than 200 million units under \n     subparagraph (A), then that manufacturer's number of adjusted \n     units shall be equal to the total number of units, and not \n     determined under subparagraph (B).\n       (E) Smokeless equivalency study.--Not later than January 1, \n     2003, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report \n     detailing the extent to which youths are substituting \n     smokeless tobacco products for cigarettes. If the Secretary \n     determines that significant substitution is occurring, the \n     Secretary shall include in the report recommendations to \n     address substitution, including consideration of modification \n     of the provisions of subparagraph (A).\n       (e) Computations.--The determinations required by \n     subsection (d) shall be made and certified by the Secretary \n     of Treasury.

For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``base \n     volume'' means 80 percent of the number of units of taxable \n     domestic removals and taxed imports of cigarettes in calendar \n     year 1997, as reported to the Secretary of the Treasury. For \n     purposes of this subsection, the term ``actual volume'' means \n     the number of adjusted unites as defined in section \n     402(d)(3)(A).\n\n     SEC. 404.

TAX TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS.\n\n       All payments made under section 402 are ordinary and \n     necessary business expenses for purposes of chapter 1 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for the year in which such \n     payments are made, and no part thereof is either in \n     settlement of an actual or potential liability for a fine or \n     penalty (civil or criminal) or the cost of a tangible or \n     intangible asset or other future benefit.\n\n     SEC. 406.

Any matter that is not governed by this title, \n     including any standard of liability applicable to a \n     manufacturer, shall be governed by any applicable State, \n     Tribal, or Federal law.\n       (c) Criminal Liability Untouched.--Nothing in this title \n     shall be construed to limit the criminal liability of tobacco \n     product manufacturers, retailers, or distributors, or their \n     officers, directors, employees, successors, or assigns.\n\n     SEC. 703. RULES GOVERNING TOBACCO CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) General Causation Presumption.--In any civil action to \n     which this title applies brought involving a tobacco claim, \n     there shall be an evidentiary presumption that nicotine is \n     addictive and that the diseases\n\n[[Page S6606]]\n\n     identified as being caused by use of tobacco products in the \n     Center for Disease Control and Prevention Reducing the Health \n     Consequences of Smoking: 25 Years of Progress: A Report of \n     the Surgeon General (United States Public Health Service \n     1989), The Health Consequences of Smoking: Involuntary \n     Smoking, (USPHS 1986); and The Health Consequences of Using \n     Smokeless Tobacco, (USPHS 1986), are caused in whole or in \n     part by the use of tobacco products, (hereinafter referred to \n     as the ``general causation presumption''), and a jury \n     empaneled to hear a tobacco claim shall be so instructed. In \n     all other respects, the burden of proof as to the issue of \n     whether a plaintiff's specific disease or injury was caused \n     by smoking shall be governed by the law of the State or Tribe \n     in which the tobacco claim was brought. This general \n     causation presumption shall in no way affect the ability of \n     the defendant to introduce evidence or argument which the \n     defendant would otherwise be entitled to present under the \n     law of the State or Tribe in which the tobacco claim was \n     brought to rebut the general causation presumption, or with \n     respect to general causation, specific causation, or \n     alternative causation, or to introduce any other evidence or \n     argument which the defendant would otherwise be entitled to \n     make.\n       (b) Actions Against Participating Tobacco Product \n     Manufacturers.--In any civil action brought involving a \n     tobacco claim against participating tobacco product \n     manufacturers, as that term is defined in title XIV, the \n     provisions of title XIV apply in conjunction with the \n     provisions of this title.\n\n TITLE VIII--TOBACCO INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS AND EMPLOYEE \n                       PROTECTION FROM REPRISALS\n\n     SEC. 801.

TOBACCO PRODUCT MANUFACTURER EMPLOYEE PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Prohibited Acts.--No tobacco product manufacturer may \n     discharge, demote, or otherwise discriminate against any \n     employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, \n     benefits, or privileges of employment because the employee \n     (or any person acting under a request of the employee)--\n       (1) notified the manufacturer, the Commissioner of Food and \n     Drugs, the Attorney General, or any Federal, State, or local \n     public health or law enforcement authority of an alleged \n     violation of this or any other Act;\n       (2) refused to engage in any practice made unlawful by such \n     Acts, if the employee has identified the alleged illegality \n     to the manufacturer;\n       (3) testified before Congress or at any Federal or State \n     proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed provision) of \n     such Acts;\n       (4) commenced, caused to be commenced, or is about to \n     commence or cause to be commenced a proceeding under such \n     Acts, or a proceeding for the administration or enforcement \n     of any requirement imposed under such Acts;\n       (5) testified or is about to testify in any such \n     proceeding; or\n       (6) assisted or participated, or is about to assist or \n     participate, in any manner in such a proceeding or in any \n     other manner in such a proceeding or in any other action to \n     carry out the purposes of such Acts.\n       (b) Employee Complaint.--\n       (1) Any employee of a tobacco product manufacturer who \n     believes that he or she has been discharged, demoted, or \n     otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of \n     subsection (a) of this section may, within 180 days after \n     such violation occurs, file (or have any person file on his \n     or her behalf) a complaint with the Secretary alleging such \n     discharge, demotion, or discrimination. Upon receipt of such \n     a complaint, the Secretary shall notify the person named in \n     the complaint of its filing.\n       (2)(A) Upon receipt of a complaint under paragraph (1) of \n     this subsection, the Secretary shall conduct an investigation \n     of the violation alleged in the complaint. Within 30 days \n     after the receipt of such complaint, the Secretary shall \n     complete such investigation and shall notify in writing the \n     complainant (and any such person acting in his or her behalf) \n     and the person alleged to have committed such violation of \n     the results of the investigation conducted under this \n     paragraph. Within 90 days after the receipt of such \n     complaint, the Secretary shall (unless the proceeding on the \n     complaint is terminated by the Secretary on the basis of a \n     settlement entered into by the Secretary and the person \n     alleged to have committed such violation) issue an order \n     either providing the relief prescribed in subparagraph (B) of \n     this paragraph or denying the complaint. An order of the \n     Secretary shall be made on the record after notice and the \n     opportunity for a hearing in accordance with sections 554 and \n     556 of title 5, United States Code. Upon the conclusion of \n     such a hearing and the issuance of a recommended decision \n     that the complaint has merit, the Secretary shall issue a \n     preliminary order providing the relief prescribed in \n     subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, but may not order \n     compensatory damages pending a final order. The Secretary may \n     not enter into a settlement terminating a proceeding on a \n     complaint without the participation and consent of the \n     complainant.\n       (B) If, in response to a complaint under paragraph (1) of \n     this subsection, the Secretary determines that a violation of \n     this paragraph has occurred, the Secretary shall order the \n     person who committed such violation to (i) take affirmative \n     action to abate the violation, and (ii) reinstate the \n     complainant to his or her former position together with \n     compensation (including back pay), terms, conditions, and \n     privileges of his or her employment. The Secretary may order \n     such person to provide compensatory damages to the \n     complainant. If an order is issued under this subparagraph, \n     the Secretary, at the request of the complainant, shall \n     assess the person against whom the order is issued a sum \n     equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses \n     (including attorneys' and expert witness fees) reasonably \n     incurred (as determined by the Secretary), by the complainant \n     for, or in connection with, the bringing of the complaint \n     upon which the order is issued.\n       (3)(A) The Secretary shall dismiss a complaint filed under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, and shall not conduct the \n     investigation required under paragraph (2) of this \n     subsection, unless the complainant has made a prima facie \n     showing that any behavior described in subsection (a) of this \n     section was a contributing factor in the unfavorable \n     personnel action alleged in the complaint.\n       (B) Notwithstanding a finding by the Secretary that the \n     complainant has made the showing required by subparagraph (A) \n     of this paragraph, no investigation required under paragraph \n     (2) of this subsection shall be conducted if the manufacturer \n     demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would \n     have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the \n     absence of such behavior. Relief may not be ordered under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection if the manufacturer \n     demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would \n     have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the \n     absence of such behavior.\n       (C) The Secretary may determine that a violation of \n     subsection (a) of this section has occurred only if the \n     complainant has demonstrated that any behavior described in \n     subsection (a) of this section was a contributing factor in \n     unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.\n       (c) Judicial Review.--\n       (1) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order \n     issued under subsection (a) of this section may obtain review \n     of the order in the United States court of appeals for the \n     circuit in which the violation, with respect to which the \n     order was issued, allegedly occurred. The petition for review \n     must be filed within 60 days after the issuance of the \n     Secretary's order. Judicial review shall be available as \n     provided in chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. The \n     commencement of proceedings under this subsection shall not, \n     unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the \n     Secretary's order.\n       (2) An order of the Secretary with respect to which review \n     could have been obtained under paragraph (1) of this \n     subsection shall not be subject to judicial review in any \n     criminal or civil proceeding.\n       (d) Noncompliance.--Whenever a person has failed to comply \n     with an order issued under subsection (b)(2) of this section, \n     the Secretary may file a civil action in the United States \n     district court for the district in which the violation \n     occurred to enforce such order. In actions brought under this \n     subsection, the district courts shall have jurisdiction to \n     grant all appropriate relief, including injunctive relief and \n     compensatory and exemplary damages.\n       (e) Action To Ensure Compliance.--\n       (1) Any person on whose behalf an order was issued under \n     subsection (b)(2) of this section may commence a civil action \n     to require compliance with such order against the person to \n     whom such order was issued. The appropriate United States \n     district court shall have jurisdiction to enforce such order, \n     without regard to the amount in controversy or the \n     citizenship of the parties.\n\n[[Page S6607]]\n\n       (2) The court, in issuing any final order under this \n     subsection, may award costs of litigation (including \n     reasonable attorneys' and expert witness fees) to any party \n     whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.\n       (f) Enforcement.--Any non-discretionary duty imposed by \n     this section shall be enforceable in a mandamus proceeding \n     brought under section 1361 of title 28, United States \n     Code.\n       (g) Applicability to Certain Employees.--Subsection (a) of \n     this section shall not apply with respect to any employee \n     who, acting without direction from the manufacturer (or the \n     agent of the manufacturer) deliberately causes a violation of \n     any requirement of this Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq), or any other law or \n     regulation relating to tobacco products.\n       (h) Effect on Other Laws.--This section shall not be \n     construed to expand, diminish, or otherwise affect any right \n     otherwise available to an employee under Federal or State law \n     to redress the employee's discharge or other discriminatory \n     action taken by a tobacco product manufacturer against the \n     employee.\n       (i) Posting.--The provisions of this section shall be \n     prominently posted in any place of employment to which this \n     section applies.\n\n        TITLE IX--PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF TOBACCO INDUSTRY DOCUMENTS\n\n     SEC. 901.

With respect to documents for \n     which the manufacturer previously has asserted one or more of \n     the aforementioned privileges or trade secret protection, the \n     manufacturer shall conduct a good faith de novo review of \n     such documents to determine whether such privilege or trade \n     secret protection is appropriate.\n       (B) Organization of log.--The log shall be organized in \n     numerical order based upon the document identifier assigned \n     to each document. For each document, the log shall contain--\n       (i) a description of the document, including type of \n     document, title of document, name and position or title of \n     each author, addressee, and other recipient who was intended \n     to receive a copy, document date, document purpose, and \n     general subject matter;\n       (ii) an explanation why the document or a portion of the \n     document is privileged or subject to trade secret protection; \n     and\n       (iii) a statement whether any previous claim of privilege \n     or trade secret was denied and, if so, in what proceeding.\n       (C) Public inspection.--Within 5 days of receipt of such a \n     log, the Depository shall make it available for public \n     inspection and review.\n       (3) Declaration of compliance.--Each tobacco product \n     manufacturer shall submit to the Depository a declaration, in \n     accordance with the requirements of section 1746 of title 28, \n     United States Code, by an individual with responsibility for \n     the de novo review of documents, preparation of the privilege \n     log, and knowledge of its contents.

Any person may petition \n     the panel to resolve a claim that a document submitted may \n     not be disclosed to the public. Such a determination shall be \n     made by a majority of the panel, in writing, and shall be \n     subject to judicial review as specified in this title. All \n     such determinations shall be made solely on consideration of \n     the subject document and written submissions from the person \n     claiming that the document is privileged or protected by \n     trade secrecy and from any person seeking disclosure of the \n     document. The panel shall cause notice of the petition and \n     the panel's decision to be published in the Federal Register.\n       (b) Final Decision.--The panel may uphold a claim of \n     privilege or protection in its entirety or, in its sole \n     discretion, it may redact that portion of a document that it \n     determines is protected from public disclosure under \n     subsection (a).

In the \n     event that judicial review is so sought, the panel's decision \n     shall be stayed pending a final judicial decision.\n\n     SEC. 906. APPEAL OF PANEL DECISION.\n\n       (a) Petition; Right of Appeal.--Any person may obtain \n     judicial review of a final decision of the panel by filing a \n     petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals \n     for the Federal Circuit within 60 days after the publication \n     of such decision in the Federal Register. A copy of the \n     petition shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the Court to \n     the panel. The panel shall file in the court the record of \n     the proceedings on which the panel based its decision \n     (including any documents reviewed by the panel in camera) as \n     provided in section 2112 of title 28, United States Code. \n     Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall have \n     exclusive jurisdiction to affirm or set aside the panel's \n     decision, except that until the filing of the record the \n     panel may modify or set aside its decision.\n       (b) Additional Evidence and Arguments.--If the any party \n     applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence \n     respecting the decision being reviewed and shows to the \n     satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence or \n     arguments are material and that there were reasonable grounds \n     for the failure to adduce such evidence or arguments in the \n     proceedings before the panel, the court may order the panel \n     to provide additional opportunity for the presentation of \n     evidence or arguments in such manner and upon such terms as \n     the court deems proper. The panel may modify its findings or \n     make new findings by reason of the additional evidence or \n     arguments and shall file with the court such modified or new \n     findings, and its recommendation, if any, for the \n     modification or setting aside of the decision being reviewed.\n       (c) Standard of Review; Finality of Judgments.--The panel's \n     findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the \n     record taken as a whole, shall be conclusive. The court shall \n     review the panel's legal conclusions de novo. The judgment of \n     the court affirming or setting aside the panel's decision \n     shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the \n     United States upon certiorari or certification, as provided \n     in section 1254 of title 28, United States Code.\n       (d) Public Disclosure After Final Decision.--Within 30 days \n     after a final decision that a document, as redacted by the \n     panel or in its entirety, is not protected from disclosure by \n     a claim of attorney-client privilege, attorney work product, \n     or trade secret protection, the panel shall direct that the \n     document be made available to the Commissioner of Food and \n     Drugs under section 903(a). No Federal, Tribal, or State \n     court shall have jurisdiction to review a claim of attorney-\n     client privilege, attorney work product, or trade secret \n     protection for a document that has lawfully been made \n     available to the public under this subsection.\n       (e) Effect of Non-disclosure Decision on Judicial \n     Proceedings.--The panel's decision that a document is \n     protected by attorney-client privilege, attorney work \n     product, or trade secret protection is binding only for the \n     purpose of protecting the document from disclosure by the \n     Depository. The decision by the panel shall not be construed \n     to prevent a document from being disclosed in a judicial \n     proceeding or interfere with the authority of a court to \n     determine whether a document is admissible or whether its \n     production may be compelled.\n\n     SEC. 907. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n       The disclosure process in this title is not intended to \n     affect the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure or \n     any Federal law which requires the disclosure of documents or \n     which deals with attorney-client privilege, attorney work \n     product, or trade secret protection.\n\n     SEC. 908. PENALTIES.\n\n       (a) Good Faith Requirement.--Each tobacco product \n     manufacturer shall act in good faith in asserting claims of \n     privilege or trade secret protection based on fact and law. \n     If the panel determines that a tobacco product manufacturer \n     has not acted in good faith with full knowledge of the truth \n     of the facts asserted and with a reasonable basis under \n     existing law, the manufacturer shall be assessed costs, which \n     shall include the full administrative costs of handling the \n     claim of privilege, and all attorneys' fees incurred by the \n     panel and any party contesting the privilege. The panel may \n     also impose civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation if \n     it determines that the manufacturer acted in bad faith in \n     asserting a privilege, or knowingly acted with the intent to \n     delay, frustrate, defraud, or obstruct the panel's \n     determination of privilege, attorney work product, or trade \n     secret protection claims.\n       (b) Failure To Produce Document.--A failure by a tobacco \n     product manufacturer to produce indexes and documents in \n     compliance with the schedule set forth in this title, or with \n     such extension as may be granted by the panel, shall be \n     punished by a civil penalty of up to $50,000 per violation. A \n     separate violation occurs for each document the manufacturer \n     has failed to produce in a timely manner. The maximum penalty \n     under this subsection for a related series of violations is \n     $5,000,000. In determining the amount of any civil penalty, \n     the panel shall consider the number of documents, length of \n     delay, any history of prior violations, the ability to pay, \n     and such other matters as justice requires. Nothing in this \n     title shall replace or supersede any criminal sanction under \n     title 18, United States Code, or any other provision of law.\n\n     SEC. 909.

A State that does not make such an election shall \n     not be eligible to receive payments from the trust fund in \n     title IV.\n       (d) 30-Day Delay.--No settlement or consent decree entered \n     into under subsection (b) may take effect until 30 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (f) Preservation of Insurance Claims.--\n       (1) In general.--If all participating tobacco product \n     manufacturers fail to make the payments required by title IV \n     for any calendar year, then--\n       (A) beginning on the first day of the next calendar year, \n     subsection (a) does not apply to any insurance claim \n     (including a direct action claim) that is a tobacco claim, \n     regardless of when that claim arose;\n       (B) any statute of limitations or doctrine of laches under \n     applicable law shall be tolled for the period--\n       (i) beginning on the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (ii) ending on the last day of that calendar year; and\n       (C) an insurance claim (including a direct action claim) \n     that is a tobacco claim and that is pending on the date of \n     enactment of this Act shall be preserved.\n       (2) Application of title 11, united states code.--For \n     purposes of this subsection, nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to modify, suspend, or otherwise affect the \n     application of title 11, United States Code, to participating \n     tobacco manufacturers that fail to make such payments.\n       (3) State law not affected.--Nothing in this subsection \n     shall be construed to expand or abridge State law.\n\n     SEC. 1408.

The Castano Civil Actions shall be dismissed with \n     full reservation of the rights of individual class members to \n     pursue claims not based on addiction or dependency in civil \n     actions, as defined in section 1417(2), in accordance with \n     this Act. For purposes of determining application of statutes \n     of limitation or repose, individual actions filed within one \n     year after the effective date of this Act by those who were \n     included within a Castano Civil Action shall be considered to \n     have been filed as of the date of the Castano Civil Action \n     applicable to said individual.\n       (2) For purposes of awarding attorneys fees and expenses \n     for those actions subject to this subsection, the matter at \n     issue shall be submitted to arbitration before one panel of \n     arbitrators.

SUBSTANTIAL NON-ATTAINMENT OF REQUIRED REDUCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Action by Secretary.--If the Secretary determines under \n     title II that the non-attainment percentage for any year is \n     greater than 20 percentage points for cigarettes or smokeless \n     tobacco, then the Secretary shall determine, on a brand-by-\n     brand basis, using data that reflects a 1999 baseline, which \n     tobacco product manufacturers are responsible within the 2 \n     categories of tobacco products for the excess. The Secretary \n     may commence an action under this section against the tobacco \n     product manufacturer or manufacturers of the brand or brands \n     of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products for which the \n     non-attainment percentage exceeded 20 percentage points.\n       (b) Procedures.--Any action under this section shall be \n     commenced by the Secretary in the United States District \n     Court for the District of Columbia within 90 days after \n     publication in the Federal Register of the determination that \n     the non-attainment percentage for the tobacco product in \n     question is greater than 20 percentage points. Any such \n     action shall be heard and determined by a 3-judge court under \n     section 2284 of title 28, United States Code.\n       (c) Determination by Court.--In any action under this \n     section, the court shall determine whether a tobacco product \n     manufacturer has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence \n     that it--\n       (1) has complied substantially with the provisions of this \n     Act regarding underage tobacco use, of any rules or \n     regulations promulgated thereunder, or of any Federal or \n     State laws regarding underage tobacco use;\n       (2) has not taken any material action to undermine the \n     achievement of the required percentage reduction for the \n     tobacco product in question; and\n       (3) has used its best efforts to reduce underage tobacco \n     use to a degree at least equal to the required percentage \n     reductions.\n       (d) Removal of Annual Aggregate Payment Limitation.--Except \n     as provided in subsections (e) and (g), if the court \n     determines that a tobacco product manufacturer has failed to \n     make the showing described in subsection (c) then sections \n     1411 and 1412 of this Act do not apply to the enforcement \n     against, or the payment by, such tobacco product manufacturer \n     of any judgment or settlement that becomes final after that \n     determination is made.\n       (e) Defense.--An action under this section shall be \n     dismissed, and subsection (d) shall not apply, if the court \n     finds that the Secretary's determination under subsection (a) \n     was unlawful under subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of \n     section 706(2) of title 5, United States Code. Any judgments \n     paid under section 1412 of this Act prior to a final judgment \n     determining that the Secretary's determination was erroneous \n     shall be fully credited, with interest, under section 1412 of \n     this Act.\n       (f) Review.--Decisions of the court under this section are \n     reviewable only by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari \n     granted upon the petition of any party. The applicability of \n     subsection (d) shall be stayed during the pendency of any \n     such petition or review.\n       (g) Continuing Effect.--Subsection (d) shall cease to apply \n     to a tobacco product manufacturer found to have engaged in \n     conduct described in subsection (c) upon the later of--\n       (1) a determination by the Secretary under section 201 \n     after the commencement of action under subsection (a) that \n     the non-attainment percentage for the tobacco product in \n     question is 20 or fewer percentage points; or\n       (2) a finding by the court in an action filed against the \n     Secretary by the manufacturer, not earlier than 2 years after \n     the determination described in subsection (c) becomes final, \n     that the manufacturer has shown by a preponderance of the \n     evidence that, in the period since that determination, the \n     manufacturer--\n       (A) has complied with the provisions of this Act regarding \n     underage tobacco use, of any rules or regulations promulgated \n     thereunder, and of any other applicable Federal, State, or \n     local laws, rules, or regulations;\n       (B) has not taken any action to undermine the achievement \n     of the required percentage reduction for the tobacco product \n     in question; and\n       (C) has used its best efforts to attain the required \n     percentage reduction for the tobacco product in question.\n\n     A judgment or settlement against the tobacco product \n     manufacturer that becomes final after a determination or \n     finding described in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection \n     is not subject to subsection (d). An action under paragraph \n     (2) of this subsection shall be commenced in the United \n     States District Court for the District of Columbia, and shall \n     be heard and determined by a 3-judge court under section 2284 \n     of title 28, United States Code. A decision by the court \n     under paragraph (2) of this subsection is reviewable only by \n     the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari granted upon the \n     petition of any party, and the decision shall be stayed \n     during the pendency of the petition or review. A \n     determination or finding described in paragraph (1) or (2) of \n     this subsection does not limit the Secretary's authority to \n     bring a subsequent action under this section against any \n     tobacco product manufacturer or the applicability of \n     subsection (d) with respect to any such subsequent action.\n\n     SEC. 1410. PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.\n\n       If the Secretary, in consultation with the Commissioner of \n     Food and Drugs, the Surgeon General, the Director of the \n     Center for Disease Control or the Director's delegate, and \n     the Director of the Health and Human Services Office of \n     Minority Health determines at any time that a tobacco product \n     manufacturer's actions or inactions with respect to its \n     compliance with the Act are of such a nature as to create a \n     clear and present danger that the manufacturer will not \n     attain the targets for underage smoking reduction, the \n     Secretary may bring an action under section 1409 seeking the \n     immediate suspension of the tobacco product manufacturer's \n     annual limitation cap on civil judgments. If the court \n     determines that the Secretary has proved by clear and \n     convincing evidence that the subject manufacturer's actions \n     or inactions are of such a nature that they present a clear \n     and present danger that the manufacturer will not attain the \n     targets for underage smoking reduction, the court may suspend \n     the subject manufacturer's annual limitation cap on civil \n     judgments.\n\n     SEC. 1411.

This section shall not apply to the \n     portion, if any, of a judgment that imposes punitive damages \n     based on any conduct that--\n       (1) occurs after the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) is other than the manufacture, development, \n     advertising, marketing, or sale of tobacco products in \n     compliance with this Act and any agreement incident thereto.\n       (b) Registration With the Secretary of the Treasury.--\n       (1) The Secretary shall maintain a record of settlements, \n     judgments, and payments in civil actions to which this title \n     applies.\n       (2) Any party claiming entitlement to a monetary payment \n     under a final judgment or final settlement on a tobacco claim \n     shall register such claim with the Secretary by filing a true \n     and correct copy of the final judgment or final settlement \n     agreement with the Secretary and providing a copy of such \n     filing to all other parties to the judgment or settlement.\n       (3) Any participating tobacco product manufacturer making a \n     payment on any final judgment or final settlement to which \n     this section applies shall certify such payment to the \n     Secretary by filing a true and correct copy of the proof of \n     payment and a statement of the remaining unpaid portion, if \n     any, of such final judgment or final settlement with the \n     Secretary and shall provide a copy of such filing to all \n     other parties to the judgment or settlement.\n\n[[Page S6627]]\n\n       (c) Liability Cap.--\n       (1) In general.--The aggregate payments made by all \n     participating tobacco product manufacturers in any calendar \n     year may not exceed $8,000,000,000.\n       (2) Implementation.--The Secretary shall initiate a \n     rulemaking within 30 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act to establish a mechanism for implementing this subsection \n     in such a way to ensure the fair and equitable payment of \n     final judgments or final settlements on tobacco claims under \n     this title. Amounts not payable because of the application of \n     this subsection, shall be carried forward and paid in the \n     next year, subject to the provisions of this subsection.\n       (3) Inflation adjustment.--\n       (A) In general.--The amount in paragraph (1) shall be \n     increased annually, beginning with the second calendar year \n     beginning after the date of enactment of this Act, by the \n     greater of 3 percent or the annual increase in the CPI.\n       (B) CPI.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the CPI for any \n     calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for \n     all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.\n       (C) Rounding.--If any increase determined under \n     subparagraph (A) is not a multiple of $1,000, the increase \n     shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.\n       (d) Injunctive Relief.--A participating tobacco product \n     manufacturer may commence an action to enjoin any State court \n     proceeding to enforce or execute any judgment or settlement \n     where payment has not been authorized under this section. \n     Such an action shall arise under the laws of the United \n     States and may be commenced in the district court of the \n     United States for the district in which the State court \n     proceeding is pending.\n       (e) Joint and Several Liability.--All participating tobacco \n     product manufacturers shall be jointly and severally liable \n     for, and shall enter into an agreement to apportion among \n     them, any amounts payable under judgments and settlements \n     governed by this section arising in whole or in part from \n     conduct occurring prior to the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (f) Bankruptcy of Participating Manufacturer.--No \n     participating tobacco product manufacturer shall cease \n     operations without establishing a surviving entity against \n     which a tobacco claim may be brought. Any obligation , \n     interest, or debt of a participating, tobacco product \n     manufacturer arising under such liability apportionment \n     agreement shall be given priority and shall not be rejected, \n     avoided, discharged, or otherwise modified or diminished in a \n     proceeding, under title 11, United States Code, or in any \n     liquidation, reorganization, receivership, or other \n     insolvency proceeding under State law. A trustee or receiver \n     in any proceeding under title 11, United States Code, or in \n     liquidation, reorganization, receivership, or other \n     insolvency proceeding under State law, may avoid any transfer \n     of an interest of the participating tobacco product \n     manufacturer, or any obligation incurred by \n     such manufacturer, that was made or incurred on or within \n     2 years before the date of the filing of a bankruptcy \n     petition, if such manufacturer made such transfer or \n     incurred such obligation to hinder or defeat in any \n     fashion the payment of any obligation, interest, or debt \n     of the manufacturer arising under the liability \n     apportionment agreement. Any property vesting in the \n     participating tobacco product manufacturer following such \n     a proceeding shall be subject to all claims and interest \n     of creditors arising under the liability apportionment \n     agreement.\n       (f) Limitation on State Courts.--No court of any State, \n     Tribe, or political subdivision of a State may take any \n     action to inhibit the effective operation of subsection (c).\n\n     SEC. 1413.

Mr. President, later this year, \nunder the so-called Brady Law, the National Instant Criminal Background \nCheck System (NICS) will go into effect. The purpose of NICS is to \nprevent the purchase of guns by persons who are prohibited from owning \nfirearms.\n  Pursuant to the Privacy Act of 1974, on June 4, 1998, the United \nStates Department of Justice published in the Federal Register a notice \nof its intention to establish a new system of records with respect to \nNICS to be maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n  I am particularly concerned about the statement in the Justice \nDepartment's June 4 notice that states that ``[i]n cases where the NICS \nbackground check does not locate a disqualifying record, information \nabout the individual will only be retained temporarily for audit \npurposes and will be destroyed after eighteen months.''\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that there is no reason whatever why \nthe\n\n[[Page S6633]]\n\nFBI would need to retain private information on a law-abiding citizen \nfor any time at all, let alone for eighteen months, after that person \nhas been determined not to be someone who is prohibited by law from \nowning a firearm. Any legitimate ``audit purposes'' could certainly be \naddressed without retaining such private information on file at the \nFBI.\n  Mr. President, later this year the Senate will be considering the \nFiscal Year 1998 appropriations bill for the Commerce, Justice, and \nState Departments, the Judiciary, and related agencies. It is my \nintention to introduce an amendment to that bill as soon as it is \nreported to the Senate by the Committee on Appropriations. The text of \nmy amendment will be as follows:\n  ``None of the funds appropriated pursuant to this Act or any other \nprovision of law may be used for (1) any system to implement 18 U.S.C. \n922(t) that does not require and result in the immediate destruction of \nall information, in any form whatsoever, submitted by or on behalf of \nany person who has been determined not to be prohibited from owning a \nfirearm; (2) the implementation of any tax or fee in connection with \nthe implementation of 18 U.S.C. 922(t); provided, that any person \naggrieved by a violation of this provision may bring an action in the \nfederal district court for the district in which the person resides; \nprovided, further, that any person who is successful with respect to \nany such action shall receive damages, punitive damages, and such other \nremedies as the court may determine to be appropriate, including a \nreasonable attorney's fee.''\n  I am taking the unusual step of notifying the Senate of my intention \nto offer this amendment in the hope that the Committee on \nAppropriations will consider including my proposed language in the \nCommerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary appropriations bill when it \nis reported to the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6632-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HONORING CROSS STREET A.M.E. ZION CHURCH ON ITS 175TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Cross \nStreet African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church on the occasion of its \n175th anniversary. This church, located in Middletown, Connecticut, has \nbeen a beacon of spiritual guidance in the community for many \ngenerations. In fact, Cross Street is the second oldest A.M.E. Zion \nChurch in Connecticut and the seventh oldest in the world.\n  The church's tradition of moral leadership and service to its \ncommunity dates back to its earliest years. The Reverend Jehiel Beamon, \nthe son of a former slave from Colchester, Connecticut, was the first \npastor at the church. Not only was he a leader within the church, but \nhe was also an active abolitionist who helped found the Middletown \nAnti-Slavery Society. He was also president of the Connecticut State \nConvention of Colored Men, which worked to secure voting rights for \nAfrican-Americans. Due to his involvement and activities in the \ncommunity, this church was called ``The Freedom Church'' by many \npeople.\n  Since that time, the church has been rebuilt and it has also moved. \nBut while it has undergone physical changes, there has never been any \nwavering in the importance that this church holds for its congregation \nand surrounding community.\n  In the church's written history, it is said that ``the sole purpose \nfor the church's formation was to secure a place for people of color to \nworship freely.'' But Cross Street A.M.E. Zion Church has become far \nmore than simply a place of worship.\n  The members of Cross Street A.M.E. Zion have carried their message of \nhope beyond the church's walls and into the neighboring community. They \nare helping people in and around Middletown to deal with the difficult \nsocial problems of the modern day. They have initiated various projects \nto deal with issues ranging from homelessness to HIV. The people of \nCross Street A.M.E. Zion Church are acting on their faith and they are \nreaching out to those in need to make their community a better place to \nlive.\n  This past April, I had the opportunity to attend Cross Street A.M.E. \nZion Church for its Palm Sunday services.

Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Committee \non Labor and Human Resources, I have closely monitored Americans' \naccess to health insurance coverage in order to have a better \nunderstanding of the trends and underlying causes of declining \ncoverage. Today, I am releasing a new U.S. General Accounting Office \n(GAO) report, entitled Private Health Insurance: Declining Employer \nCoverage May Affect Access for 55- to 64-Year-Olds (GAO/HEHS-98-133). \nThis report examines access of the ``near elderly'' population to \nemployer-based and individually purchased private insurance. \nSpecifically, the report discusses the employment, income, health, and \nhealth insurance status of the near elderly, their ability to obtain \nemployer-based health insurance if they retire before becoming eligible \nfor Medicare, and their health insurance coverage through the \nindividual market or employer-based continuation insurance. The \nfindings of this report will be the focus of a Labor Committee hearing \nscheduled for June 25, 1998.\n  This report and the related hearing have been prompted by a growing \nconcern that several factors may converge to create the situation where \na large number of 55- to 64-year-old Americans could lose, or have to \npay considerably more for, health insurance coverage. Access to \naffordable health insurance is especially critical for this population, \nsince their health status is worse than that of any other age group \nexcept the elderly who have the guarantee of Medicare.\n  The near elderly population can be characterized as a group in \ntransition. Their employment status, income, and health are all \nchanging. The GAO reports that currently about 14 percent of the near \nelderly have no health insurance. Although this rate is lower than that \nof the nonelderly population in general, the GAO found several \ndisturbing trends that could lead to a substantial increase in the \nnumbers of near elderly without health insurance coverage. This would \nbe especially problematic, since the near elderly have 25 percent lower \nmedian family incomes, but 45 percent higher health care expenses than \nyounger age groups. The economic impact would be even greater when \n``baby boomers'' join the near elderly, swelling their ranks from 21 \nmillion now, to 35 million by 2010.\n  Most of the near elderly acquire health insurance coverage from one \nof the same three sources as individuals in other age groups: their \nemployers, the individual private insurance market, or the Government. \nThe main difference between coverage for the near elderly and the \nelderly is that all elderly qualify for Medicare, but only those near \nelderly who are ill or disabled qualify for public benefits. The main \ndifference between coverage for the near elderly and younger \npopulations is that a larger proportion of the near elderly are covered \nby public programs or have individual coverage through the private \nmarket. The near elderly are more likely to be willing to purchase \nindividual coverage than younger age groups, because they are more \naverse to the risk of high health care costs.\n  The two main factors contributing to the trend for more near elderly \nto become uninsured are the loss of employer-based coverage and the \nrising costs of individual insurance. The GAO reports that in 1996, 65 \npercent of the near elderly had employer-based insurance; but, despite \nthe strong economy, this coverage is being eroded, particularly as the \nnear elderly retire. Already the rate of health coverage offered by \nlarge employers to retirees has fallen faster than that of coverage for \nactive employees, from an estimated 60 to 70 percent in the 1980s to \nless than 40 percent now. In addition, retirees are\n\n[[Page S6634]]\n\nbeing asked to cover a larger share of the premiums. For example, in \n1995, retirees contributed an average of $655 more for family coverage \nthan did active workers. The higher costs have prompted some near \nelderly to drop coverage. The GAO reports that 27 percent of the 5.3 \nmillion retirees who discontinued employer-based benefits in 1994 cited \nexpense as a factor.\n  Retirees also are finding that more employers are linking retirement \nhealth benefits to length of service. The GAO report cites the example \nof one company's requiring 35 years of service to qualify for the \nmaximum employer contribution of 75 percent. This trend does not bode \nwell for retirees who have changed jobs frequently.\n  The source of health insurance for the near elderly generally \ncorrelates with employment, health, and income status. The GAO reported \nthat near elderly who had individual health insurance were more likely \nto be employed, be in good health, and have higher incomes than those \non Medicare and Medicaid. The correlation is not absolute, however, \nbecause 20 percent of the uninsured had family incomes of more than \n$50,000 per year, and one-third of near elderly with individual \ninsurance had incomes of less than $20,000. It should be noted that the \nlatter figure may be misleading because this group may have less-\nexpensive coverage, less-comprehensive benefits, or the income measured \nmay not have included all of their resources.\n  In general, the near elderly are more likely than younger age groups \nto purchase insurance through the individual market if they lose \nemployer-based coverage. Often, however, they find that they do not \nqualify because of preexisting conditions, or that the cost of \nindividual coverage is prohibitive because premiums take into account \nthe fact that this age group uses more medical services than younger \nage groups. The GAO found that premiums for individual coverage \nconstituted 10 percent of the median family income for the married near \nelderly in Colorado, which is almost twice as much as the retiree share \nof employer-subsidized family coverage.\n  Some States have provisions guaranteeing access to some form of \nindividual coverage, but in most States individual insurance for the \nnear elderly is limited by exclusion of certain conditions or body \nparts, or denial of coverage. Chronic conditions that are common in \nthis age group such as diabetes and heart disease, and even such non-\nlife-threatening conditions as chronic back pain, may limit eligibility \nfor coverage. Reform measures that have been considered or implemented \nto remedy these problems include initiatives to limit variation in \npremium rates; guarantees of certain products to all applicants; and \nState pools for those who have been rejected by at least one carrier. \nThese measures have met with variable success. Overall, the GAO found \nthat about 15 percent of all applicants were denied individual \ncoverage, while many others were denied coverage for specific \nconditions.\n  Since 1986, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1985 (COBRA) has provided temporary access to health insurance for \nindividuals of all ages who leave the work force. COBRA may be \nparticularly important to the near elderly before they become eligible \nfor Medicare. It is attractive for continuation coverage, because its \npremiums reflect lower group coverage rates, and it does not exclude \npreexisting conditions. However, several factors limit the near \nelderly's ability to use COBRA benefits: It is available only to \nretirees whose employers have at least 20 employees and who offer \nhealth insurance benefits; it lasts for only 18 months; and it may not \nbe affordable since employers do not provide contributions. It also is \nimportant to note that many people who could benefit from this program \ndo not know about it.\n  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 \n(HIPAA) also guarantees that some people who leave group coverage have \naccess to individual coverage and cannot be excluded for preexisting \nconditions. However, HIPAA has stringent eligibility requirements, \ndepends on exhausting COBRA or other continuation benefits, and places \nno limits on the cost of premiums.\n  Before HIPAA was enacted, individuals usually relinquished COBRA \nbefore they had used up all of their benefits. The impact of HIPAA on \nthe use of COBRA remains to be determined, but cost may prevent many \nnear elderly from being able to afford to take advantage of either. The \nGAO reports that whereas one company paid almost the entire cost of \nhealth benefits for active employees, the COBRA cost ranged from about \n$5,600 to almost $8,000 per year for family coverage. This is a great \ndeal of money, particularly for people who are taking advantage of the \nprogram because they are leaving the work force.\n  I believe the GAO report, Private Health Insurance: Declining \nEmployer Coverage May Affect Access for 55- to 64-Year-Olds (GAO/HEHS-\n98-133), will be an important resource as Congress considers proposals \nto expand health insurance coverage.\n  Mr. President, I ask that excerpts of the executive summary of the \nreport be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\nPrivate Health Insurance Declining Employer Coverage May Affect Access \n                        for 55- to 64-Year-Olds\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\n                                Purpose\n\n       A series of age-related transitions heighten the importance \n     of health insurance to 55- to 64-year-old (near elderly) \n     Americans and could place them at greater risk of losing, or \n     paying considerably more for, coverage. Too young to qualify \n     for Medicare, many near elderly are considering retirement or \n     gradually moving out of the workforce. These events may be \n     related to worsening health, job displacement, or simply the \n     desire for more leisure time. Since health insurance for most \n     Americans is an employment-related benefit, retirement may \n     necessitate looking for another source of affordable \n     coverage. However, insurance purchased directly in the \n     individual market or temporary continuation coverage \n     purchased through an employer are typically expensive \n     alternatives and may not always be available. Their \n     affordability, moreover, may be exacerbated both by declining \n     health and the reduction in income associated with \n     retirement. For some near elderly, an alternative to retiring \n     without insurance is simply to continue working.\n       The Chairman, Senate Committee on Labor and Human \n     Resources, requested GAO to assess the ability of Americans \n     aged 55 to 64 to obtain health benefits through the private \n     market--either employer-based or individually purchased. In \n     particular, he requested an examination of the available \n     evidence on the near elderly's health, employment, income, \n     and health insurance status; ability to obtain employer-based \n     health insurance if they retire before becoming eligible for \n     Medicare; and use of and costs associated with purchasing \n     coverage through the individual market or employer-based \n     continuation insurance.\n       To provide the Congress with information about the near \n     elderly and their ability to obtain health insurance, GAO \n     analyzed the March 1997 Current Population Survey (CPS), a \n     source widely used by researchers; reviewed the literature on \n     employer-based health benefits for early retirees; \n     interviewed employers, benefit consultants, insurers, and \n     other experts knowledgeable about retiree health issues and \n     the individual insurance market; and updated information \n     provided in previous GAO reports.\n     Background\n       Like most Americans, over 80 percent of the near elderly \n     have access to some type of health insurance--either \n     comprehensive or partial. Nevertheless, continued access to \n     health insurance is a primary concern for some 55- to 64-\n     year-olds who retire early or who lose access to employer-\n     based coverage. First, Medicare is not generally available \n     until one reaches age 65. Second, most Americans under age 65 \n     rely on coverage provided by an employer--a link that may be \n     severed by retirement, a voluntary reduction in hours, or job \n     displacement. The existing alternatives to employer-based \n     coverage for the near elderly are (1) individually purchased \n     insurance, (2) temporary continuation coverage from a former \n     employer, (3) public programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, \n     and (4) becoming uninsured. Among those aged 55 to 64, \n     Medicare or Medicaid are available only to the very poor or \n     the disabled.\n       Some near elderly may encounter difficulty in obtaining \n     comprehensive, affordable coverage through the individual \n     market or in obtaining any health coverage at all. The high \n     cost of individual insurance often mirrors the near elderly's \n     greater use of medical services compared with younger age \n     groups. Moreover, some individuals may be denied individual \n     insurance because of preexisting health conditions. Retirees \n     whose jobs provided health benefits that ended at retirement, \n     however, may continue temporary coverage for up to 18 months \n     under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n     1985 (COBRA). Only firms with 20 or more employees who offer \n     health insurance to active workers are required to provide \n     COBRA continuation coverage. When available, COBRA coverage \n     may entail substantial out-of-pocket costs, because the \n     employer is not required to pay any portion of the premium. \n     For eligible individuals leaving group coverage who exhaust \n     any available COBRA or other conversion coverage,\n\n[[Page S6635]]\n\n     the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of \n     1996 (HIPAA) guarantees access to the individual market, \n     regardless of health status and without coverage exclusions. \n     The premiums faced by some individuals eligible for a HIPAA \n     guaranteed access product, however, may be substantially \n     higher than the prices charged to those in the individual \n     market who are healthy.\n       Persons seeking an alternative to employer-based coverage \n     may go through a common mental calculus in which health \n     status and cost play a prominent role. For someone healthy, \n     there are no access barriers to the individual market and the \n     cost may be lower than COBRA, especially if he or she buys a \n     policy with a higher deductible. For someone with a health \n     condition who wants comprehensive coverage, the individual \n     market may not be an option because of health screening by \n     insurers--a process that can result in the denial of coverage \n     or the exclusion of preexisiting conditions. However, COBRA, \n     if available, has no such screening and should be more \n     affordable than individually purchased insurance because of \n     economies of scale and reduced administrative costs that \n     result in lower premiums for group coverage. HIPAA's group-\n     to-individual portability now provides a link between COBRA \n     and the individual market for those who are eligible, but it \n     is too early to judge the extent to which unhealthy consumers \n     will utilize this option.\n     Results in Brief\n       Though the near elderly access health insurance differently \n     than other segments of the under-65 population, their overall \n     insurance picture is no worse and is better than that of some \n     younger age groups. These differences, however, may not \n     portend well for the future. Since fewer employers are \n     offering health coverage as a benefit to future retirees, the \n     proportion of near elderly with access to affordable health \n     insurance could decline. The resulting increase in uninsured \n     near elderly would be exacerbated by demographic trends, \n     since 55- to 64-year-olds represent one of the fastest \n     growing segments of the U.S. population.\n       The current insurance status of the near elderly is largely \n     due to (1) the fact that many current retirees still have \n     access to employer-based health benefits, (2) the willingness \n     of near-elderly Americans to devote a significant portion of \n     their income to health insurance purchased through the \n     individual market, and (3) the availability of public \n     programs to disabled 55- to 64-year-olds. Today, the \n     individual market and Medicare and Medicaid for the disabled \n     often mitigate declining access to employer-based coverage \n     for near-elderly Americans and may prevent a larger portion \n     of this age group from becoming uninsured. The steady decline \n     in the proportion of large employers who offer health \n     benefits to early retirees, however, clouds the outlook for \n     future retirees. In the absence of countervailing trends, it \n     is even less likely that future 55- to 64-year-olds will be \n     offered health insurance as a retirement benefit, and those \n     who are will bear an increased share of the cost. Although \n     trends in employers' required retiree cost sharing are more \n     difficult to decipher than the decisions of firms not to \n     offer retiree health benefits, the effects may be just as \n     troublesome for future retirees. Thus, some additional \n     employers have tied cost sharing to years of service; \n     consequently, retirees who changed jobs frequently may be \n     responsible for most of the premium.\n       Moreover, access and affordability problems may prevent \n     future early retirees who lose employer-based health benefits \n     from obtaining comprehensive private insurance. The two \n     principal private insurance alternatives are the individual \n     market and COBRA continuation coverage. With respect to \n     individual insurance, the cost may put it out of reach of \n     some 55- to 64-year-olds--an age group whose health and \n     income is in decline. For example, the premiums for popular \n     health insurance products available in the individual markets \n     of Colorado and Vermont are at least 10 percent and 8.4 \n     percent, respectively, of the 1996 median family income for \n     the married near elderly. In contrast, the average retiree \n     contribution for employer subsidized family coverage is about \n     one-half of these percentages. The near elderly who are in \n     poorer health run the risk of paying even higher premiums, \n     having less comprehensive coverage offered, or being denied \n     coverage altogether. Thirteen states require insurers to sell \n     some individual market products to all who apply, and about \n     20 states limit the variation among premiums that insurers \n     may offer to individuals. GAO found that conditions such as \n     chronic back pain and glaucoma are commonly excluded from \n     coverage or result in higher premiums. Furthermore, \n     significant variation exists among the states that limit \n     premiums: A few require insurers to community-rate the \n     coverage they sell--that is, all those covered pay the same \n     premium--while other states allow insurers to vary premiums \n     up to 300 percent or more.\n       COBRA is only available to retirees whose employers offer \n     health benefits to active workers, and coverage is only \n     temporary, ranging from 18 to 36 months. Information on the \n     use of COBRA by Americans is spotty. Although 55- to 64-year-\n     olds who become eligible for COBRA are more likely than \n     younger age groups to enroll, the use of continuation \n     coverage by early retirees appears to be relatively low. \n     Since new federal protections under HIPAA--ensuring access to \n     individual insurance for qualifying individuals who leave \n     group coverage--hinge on exhausting COBRA, the incentives for \n     enrolling and the length of time enrolled could change. \n     Because employers generally do not contribute toward the \n     premium, the cost of COBRA may be a factor in the low \n     enrollment, even though similar coverage in the individual \n     market may be more expensive. In 1997, the average insurance \n     premium for employer-based coverage was about $3,800. \n     However, there is significant variation in premiums due to \n     firm size, benefit structure, locale, demographics, or \n     aggressiveness in negotiating rates. For one company, total \n     health plan premiums in 1996 for early retirees ranged from \n     about $5,600 to almost $8,000 for family coverage. Since this \n     firm paid the total cost of practically all of the health \n     plans it offered to current workers, the COBRA cost would \n     have come as a rude awakening to retirees . . .\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6633-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6635-S6636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PROGRESS IN NIGERIA?\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise for the second time in \nless than two weeks to comment on the extraordinary events taking place \nin Nigeria.\n  Earlier this week, Nigeria's new leader, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, \nreleased nine of the country's best known political prisoners. I \nwelcome this step, with the hope that the release of these individuals \ndemonstrates a commitment to enact true democratic reform in this \ntroubled West African country.\n  These individuals include some of Nigeria's top political, labor and \nhuman rights leaders. For the record, I will list their names here.\n  General Olusegun Obassanjo (rt.), a former head of state and the only \nmilitary leader to turn over power to a democratically elected civilian \ngovernment and who has played a prominent role on the international \nstage as an advocate of peace and reconciliation. He had been sentenced \nfollowing a secret trial that failed to meet international standard of \ndue process over an alleged coup plot that has never been proven to \nexist.\n  Frank Kokori, Secretary General of the National Union of Petroleum \nand Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG). He was arrested in August 1994, \nalthough charges have never been filed.\n  Chris Anyanwu, Editor-in-Chief and publisher of The Sunday Magazine.\n  Human rights activist Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti.\n  Milton Dabibi, Secretary General of the Petroleum and Natural Gas \nSenior Staff Association (PENGASSAN), who was arrested in January 1996 \nfor leading demonstrations against the canceled 1993 elections and \nagainst government efforts to control the labor unions.\n  Politician Olabiyi Durojaye.\n  Former Sultan of Sokoto, Ibrahim Dasuki.\n  Former state governor Bola Ige.\n  Uwen Udoh, democracy campaigner.\n  Mr. President, these individuals have all played an important role in \nNigeria, and were all arrested under circumstances that confirm our \nworst fears of the overarching power of the military in Nigeria. Their \nrelease is significant.\n  That said, I do not want to become overly enthusiastic about the \nsituation in Nigeria. For despite this great gesture, hundreds of other \npolitical prisoners remain in detention--often without charge. \nProminent among these remaining prisoners, is, of course Chief Moshood \nAbiola, presumed winner of the 1993 presidential election, who was \nthrown in jail on charges of treason. Whatever his role might be in any \nupcoming transition process, his release and some meaningful \nacknowledgment of his annulled mandate is key to that process.\n  On top of that, numerous repressive decrees remain in force, \nincluding the infamous State Security [Detention of Persons] Decree #2, \nwhich gives the military sweeping powers of arrest and detention. The \nexistence of such decrees would allow the military to rearrest any of \nthe prisoners released this week at any time.\n  Mr. President, I recently introduced S. 2102, The Nigerian Democracy \nand Civil Society Empowerment Act of 1998, which calls on the United \nStates to encourage the political, economic and legal reforms necessary \nto ensure the rule of law and respect for human rights in Nigeria and \nto aggressively support a timely and effective transition to \ndemocratic, civilian government for the people of Nigeria.\n  Among other policy initiatives, this bill establishes a set of \nbenchmarks regarding the transition to democracy. These benchmarks \ninclude a call for\n\n[[Page S6636]]\n\nthe release of ``individuals who have been imprisoned without due \nprocess or for political reasons.''\n  The release this week of nine prisoners is a start. Let's hope \nNigeria's new leader continues to implement policies that move the \ncountry in the right direction.\n  Nigeria's people deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record a New York Times \npiece from June 17, 1998, that presents an excellent overview of the \nreaction inside Nigeria over Abubakar's actions.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 17, 1998]\n\n           For Nigeria's Leader, Offense is the Best Defense\n\n                         (By Howard W. French)\n\n       From the moment Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar was selected last \n     week to succeed the late ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, Nigerians \n     began speculating whether a reformist era might be at hand \n     after years of ruinous dictatorship. After all, General \n     Abubakar was long reputed to be a prim professional among \n     Nigeria's politicized and immensely rich generals.\n       With his order on Monday to release a core group of the \n     country's best-known political prisoners, including an \n     internationally respected former head of state, General \n     Abubakar sent the first clear signal of his intention to \n     bring about an overhaul in the way his country is run, and \n     more than that, conveyed a sense of urgency in the matter.\n       Though the general's position is precarious, Western \n     diplomats and Nigerian analysts say he has decided to move \n     decisively and not wait to consolidate his power. To delay, \n     the say, would risk falling victim to powerful enemies at \n     opposite extremes of his country's no-holds-barred politics.\n       ``General Abubakar had no choice but to move forward if he \n     wanted to salvage his country and protect himself,'' said one \n     Western diplomat. ``To have postponed making difficult \n     decisions about democracy and prisoners, or to defer the \n     issue of a transition to civilian rule, would have been to \n     play the game of his enemies. The army would have devoured \n     him itself, and failing that there would have been a major \n     risk of a civilian uprising.''\n       On one side, General Abubakar faces his own army, an \n     institution whose top officers have grown fat on years of \n     power, and many of whose younger leaders have climbed the \n     rungs of power awaiting their turn at the trough.\n       As army chief of staff, General Abubakar had no direct \n     command over the mechanized units that typically determine \n     who holds or takes power in the country. Moreover, the new \n     head of state had none of the huge personal wealth of his \n     predecessors, having avoided the kinds of army jobs that \n     allow top brass to dole out lucrative contracts to other \n     officers, siphoning off kickbacks and purchasing staff \n     loyalty.\n       On the other side, Nigeria's large and well-developed \n     opposition was emboldened by the death of General Abachar, \n     who had a reputation as the most iron-fisted leader his \n     country of 105 million people had ever known.\n       And because General Abacha and his military predecessors \n     had so regularly flouted their pledges to restore democracy \n     or arrange a transition to civilian rule, General Abubakar \n     could promise little that would make a dent in the distrust \n     of a hardened political class.\n       For many veterans of Nigeria's democracy movement, the only \n     acceptable tactic is to take on the army head on, and with \n     the army divided, they feel the future is now.\n       People both inside the army and out say that General \n     Abubakar's best hope--and decisive test--of engineering a \n     transition to civilian rule is to work with the man believed \n     to have won the country's only democratic election, in 1993, \n     Moshood K. O. Abiola. The last military Government annulled \n     the vote and threw Mr. Abiola in jail, where he remains.\n       In this scenario, General Abubakar would involve Mr. Abiola \n     in negotiations aimed at easing the military out of power, in \n     much the same way Nelson Mandela helped work out a soft \n     landing for South Africa's apartheid rulers before his \n     release from prison in 1990.\n       It is too early to say whether this hope will come about in \n     Nigeria, and many hurdles remain.\n       General Abubakar's first gesture upon taking power, in an \n     unusual post-midnight swearing in ceremony less than 24 hours \n     after General Abacha's death, was to commit himself to his \n     predecessor's previously declared but widely discounted \n     deadline for an Oct. 1 handover to an elected civilian \n     government.\n       Experts on the Nigerian military say that this pledge was \n     intended more as a bid to outflank the army, whose powerful \n     factions are known to oppose any democratic change, than as \n     an effort to placate a deeply skeptical civilian opposition.\n       The new leader's second hurdle, these experts say, was to \n     prevent a showdown with pro-democracy groups sworn to carry \n     out a series of protests linked to the fifth anniversary last \n     Friday of the elections apparently won by Mr. Abiola, a \n     millionaire businessman from the south.\n       The opposition ignored calls to cancel Friday's \n     demonstrations, but security forces were relatively \n     restrained in putting the protests down, marking a sharp turn \n     from the wanton brutality of the Abacha years.\n       With the threat of strife defused, General Abubakar then \n     freed the former head of state--a retired general, Olusegun \n     Obasanjo--and seven other prominent prisoners, buying \n     international praise and a more forgiving attitude from the \n     opposition.\n       ``A clash between an overzealous army and the June 12 \n     protesters would have badly undercut Abubakar,'' said Walter \n     Carrington, a former American ambassador to Nigeria. ``The \n     restraint that the army showed and the subsequent release of \n     the prisoners suggests strongly that the new leadership has \n     gained control over hard-liners in the army. What we will \n     likely see now is a progressive release of more and more \n     political prisoners.''\n       By far the country's most important political prisoner is \n     Mr. Abiola, the jailed presidential candidate. And \n     ultimately, both the opposition and much of the outside \n     world's judgment of General Abubakar will depend on his \n     handling of Mr. Abiola, whose claim to the presidency is \n     considered by most to be legitimate.\n       Whatever the opposition demands now, almost no one in \n     Nigeria expects the military to simply surrender power. For \n     one thing, Nigeria's military high command is dominated by \n     northerners, including the new head of state himself, who \n     after years of control are wary of an outright takeover by \n     southerners.\n       Still, for many in the south, and beyond, no credible \n     election in Nigeria can be organized until the nation comes \n     to terms with the cancellation of Mr. Abiola's mandate.\n       Regional and ethnic antagonisms like these could scuttle \n     any negotiated arrangements with Mr. Abiola. But many \n     Nigerians suspect that discussions may already be under way \n     to secure his release in a negotiated framework, providing \n     him some recognition and perhaps a large role in transitional \n     arrangements while keeping the field open for other \n     candidates in a fresh election.\n       ``There is no point in pretending that Abiola didn't win an \n     election any longer,'' said one senior Nigerian military \n     adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``What will have \n     to be worked out is an arrangement with Abiola that allows \n     the country to move forward.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6635-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6636-S6637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF ROGER WOOD, WOKQ NEWSCASTER\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Roger Wood, an institution in the broadcast community of New \nHampshire. After 18 years as a radio reporter in New Hampshire, and 30 \nyears in broadcasting, Roger will sign off at the end of this month to \npursue other endeavors.\n  Roger, 50, is the news and public affairs director at WOKQ radio in \nDover, New Hampshire. WOKQ is one of the largest stations in New \nHampshire and, with its country music format, is my unequaled favorite. \nI am a WOKQ listener not only for the playlist, but because of the \noutstanding commitment, dignity and character that Roger Wood has \nbrought to the airwaves in my years as an avid listener.\n  Roger's distinguished voice has broadcast the news to WOKQ's audience \nsince 1979. Before that, Roger was a one-man news shop at WHEB AM/FM in \nnearby Portsmouth, and worked at a variety of Seacoast stations \nincluding WWNH in Rochester, WBBX in Portsmouth and New Hampshire \nPublic Television. He also worked at a number of stations in his native \nPennsylvania before he graced the Granite State with his presence in \n1970.\n  Roger was never one to ``rip and read.'' He always researched stories \nthoroughly, went the extra mile to get an interview, and provided in-\ndepth coverage from both a human interest and hard news perspective. \nAnd he has the awards lining his walls that prove it.\n  Roger Wood is committed to his profession. He has won recognition \nfrom UPI, AP, the New Hampshire Association of Broadcasters, and other \norganizations in the categories of outstanding reporting, best \nnewscasts and individual achievement. He has said that one of the \nachievements that most touched him was his coverage in 1986 on the \nfatal launch of the Space Shuttle Challenger, with New Hampshire \nteacher Christa McAuliffe on board. Roger was at Cape Canaveral in \nperson, and has said the implications of the explosion left him \n``deeply moved.''\n  Although Roger Wood is a veteran newscaster, he is a trend setter for \nthe new generation of broadcasters. He led WOKQ to an innovative \npartnership with Channel 7 in Boston, establishing the largest news \nexchange network in the region. He has also implemented the first \ncellular car phone reporting system in the region, for listeners to \nreport accidents and news ``they see happening.''\n\n[[Page S6637]]\n\n  Roger is committed to his community, as exemplified by involvement in \nthe Seacoast Housing Partnership, a nonprofit organization dedicated to \naffordable housing issues; the Mayor's Blue Ribbon Committee to improve \nthe environment of Pierce Island; the Greater Seacoast Economic Summit; \nand his volunteer work to help many local citizens in poverty.\n  Most importantly, Roger is committed to his family. He and his wife, \nElaine, have been married for 27 years. They have three grown children, \nRoger, Jr., Emily, and Melissa. His family can be very proud of his \nachievements, and glad that they will finally have him around for \nbreakfast!\n  My interviews with Roger always left us sharing a laugh and, though \nhe rarely took any of my suggestions for use in the ``Joke Du Jour,'' \nhis resulting stories were always fair, thorough, and forthright as is \nalways Roger's style. As he embraces future endeavors in the field of \ncommunications and public relations, I wish Roger Wood all the best. I \nam proud to represent him in the United States Senate, and proud to \ncall him my friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6636-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            EDWARD LeLECHEUR\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I want to call the Senate's \nattention to Representative Edward LeLecheur and his long history of \nservice to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The citizens of \nMassachusetts have benefitted from his many years of service and \nlegislative leadership. Representative LeLecheur has distinguished \nhimself as a community leader, an elected official and a family man.\n  Edward LeLecheur started out as the proprietor of Stolphine's Market \nin Lowell, MA. This small grocery store is located in the part of \nLowell know as the Sacred Heart, named for the nearby Catholic church. \nEd expanded his role in the community by running for and winning \nelected office in 1975. Since then, he has served the eighteenth \nMiddlesex District for twenty-three years in the same way he served \nStolphine's customers: one at a time, with integrity, dedication, and \ncompassion.\n  Representative LeLecheur's giving spirit has manifested itself in a \nvariety of ways. He drives physically challenged people to the Registry \nof Motor Vehicles, and purchases turkeys at Thanksgiving and Christmas \ntime which he then delivers door-to-door. Those same people, and \ncountless others, enjoy the baseball stadium which Representative \nLeLecheur helped bring to Lowell. Due to Ed LeLecheur, our national \npastime is now part of the on-going revitalization of Merrimac Valley, \nbringing prosperity and entertainment to families from all the \nsurrounding communities.\n  As a member of the Ways and Means Committee for the past twelve years \nand as the current chair of the Committee on Personnel and \nAdministration, Representative LeLecheur has also extended his spirit \nand service beyond his district. The state has been well served as a \nresult of his leadership.\n  Representative LeLecheur has been successful not only as a state \nrepresentative, but also as a family man. He and his wife Eileen were \nmarried on June 4, 1947, more than fifty years ago. Together they \nraised six children and are today the proud grandparents of ten \ngrandsons and granddaughters.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank him for his tireless devotion to \nhis constituents and neighbors. Representative LeLecheur is an \ninspiration to all of us who work for positive change in our \ncommunities. I wish him and Eileen the very best as they embark on this \nnew chapter in life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6637-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          U.N. WORLD DAY TO COMBAT DESERTIFICATION AND DROUGHT\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to mark the United \nNations World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought, which took \nplace on June 17, 1998. This date is important because it is the fourth \nanniversary of the United Nations General Assembly's adoption of the \nConvention to Combat Desertification in Countries Experiencing Serious \nDrought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa. The United \nStates has signed this treaty, but the Senate has yet to exercise its \nadvice and consent responsibilities on this important convention.\n  The World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought should serve as a \nreminder to this body that we should honor our constitutional \nresponsibilities and act on this convention in a timely manner. As the \nranking member of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, I have had the \nopportunity to see first-hand how valuable the provisions of this \nconvention will be to the people of Africa. It is a mechanism by which \nthe people of Africa will be assisted in preserving and protecting \ntheir land, which is a vital link in Africa's fight to become self-\nsufficient.\n  This convention is particularly important for Africa because more \nthan two-thirds of the land comprising that continent is desert or dry \nland, and almost three-quarters of the dry land used for farming is in \ndanger of becoming unusable. The Sahelian droughts of 1971-73 and 1984-\n85 contributed to the deaths of thousands and spurred migration that \nput further stress on already taxed land around Africa.\n  This Convention to Combat Desertification, which has already been \nratified by 120 countries, establishes a framework to promote land and \nsoil health in developing countries, in order to halt the kind of \nneglect that eventually leads to land that is unusable for farming. \nThis convention is innovative because it requires participation from \nall segments of the population, from the farmers and herders who work \nthe land, to local governments and environmental organizations, to \nthose who affect environmental and agricultural policy at the national \nand regional levels.\n  I hope that the Senate will act on this convention in a timely \nmanner, and that next year's anniversary of the Convention to Combat \nDesertification will be marked by progress in the world's efforts to \nprotect the land and soil that sustains life in developing \ncountries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/18/senate-section/article/S6637-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.
