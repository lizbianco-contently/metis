Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of S. 2260, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2260) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and related \n     programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Bumpers modified amendment No. 3243, to amend the Federal \n     Rules of Criminal Procedure, relating to counsel for \n     witnesses in grand jury proceedings.\n       Graham/DeWine amendment No. 3244, to modify the definition \n     of the term ``public aircraft''.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3243, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate prior to the vote in relation to the Bumpers \namendment numbered 3243.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, for the edification of people who \ndidn't hear any of the debate last night, is to make a very minor \nchange in the grand jury system. Now, bear in mind, the grand jury \nsystem is about as outdated, as big an anachronism as there is in this \ncountry.\n  For openers, all this amendment does is to say that an innocent \nperson who is called before the grand jury--not as a target, not as a \ndefendant, but an absolutely innocent witness, an absolutely innocent \nwitness who is terrified because he or she is appearing before the \ngrand jury for the first time in his or her life, and they know that if \nthey misspeak, if their memory doesn't satisfy the prosecutor, they \nface the possibility of being charged with perjury.\n  Right now when that innocent person goes to testify before the grand \njury, let's make it easy, let's assume, as I did last evening, that it \nis a Senator's wife; that might be understandable around here. The \nSenator's wife goes in after having paid some lawyer $5,000 or $10,000 \njust as a retainer to make sure she doesn't get charged with something \nfor which she is innocent. She goes in and sits in the chair and they \nstart asking her all kinds of personal questions that are totally \nirrelevant to why she is there: Have you been faithful to your spouse? \nDo you have a child charged with smoking pot? I understand your \ndaughter is gay.\n  Those things are not stretches of my imagination. But her lawyer is \nseated outside the door, because under the Federal rules he cannot come \ninto the same room in which his client, the witness, is testifying. \nThink of that. Think about how we bash China and their criminal justice \nsystem and their violation of human rights. That Senator's wife might \nbe called back again tomorrow and the next day and the next day and the \nnext day. You have seen it happen.\n  All we are saying is, don't make her crawl down off of the witness \nstand to\n\n[[Page S8690]]\n\ngo outside and talk to her lawyer about how she should answer these \nquestions. If she does that three times, do you know what the grand \njury does? They start nudging each other. ``She must be hiding \nsomething; she is sure going out to talk to her lawyer a lot.''\n  That is a woefully inadequate system for a great nation like this. \nAll I am saying, let the lawyer come into the room.\n  The Justice Department opposes this amendment. Now, doesn't that \nshock you? Of course they oppose it. They are in the business of \nputting notches on their belt. They want to be able to say this grand \njury has never refused to return an indictment that I asked for. A New \nYork judge said, ``Of course, they return those indictments. A grand \njury will indict a ham sandwich if the prosecutor asks them to.''\n  All I am saying, let's follow what 27 States have already done. They \nhave abolished the grand jury system.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask that the time run equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am sorry, I didn't understand the distinguished floor \nmanager's request.\n  Mr. GREGG. I asked that the time that is now running be allocated \nequally against both sides.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I object to that. I reserved the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will happen whether or not there is a \nunanimous consent. If neither side yields time, the clock will run and \nwill be charged equally against both sides.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I am glad the opponents to this amendment \ndon't have anything to say this morning, and I am happy to use up the \nrest of my time. Perhaps we can get a unanimous consent agreement that \nthey will yield back the balance of their time and we will vote.\n  All I want to say is we are talking about a criminal justice system \nof the greatest nation on Earth, which is terrible. We are not talking \nabout the mob, we are not talking about the mafioso, we are talking \nwitnesses.\n  Here is a classic case of a fulfillment of what everybody in this \nSenate has said at one time or another, and that is criminals have a \nbetter deal than do ordinary citizens. A criminal gets an attorney \nhired for him if he doesn't have one. A criminal is advised to remain \nsilent. The Senator's wife can't remain silent. She has been subpoenaed \nto come down and testify.\n  All I am saying, don't make her go outside the room. The attorney in \nthe courtroom, he is not going to file motions. He is not going to make \nobjections. But I tell you what it will do. It will have a salutary \neffect on the conduct of the attorney prosecuting the case.\n  He won't be asking redundant, personal questions that have nothing to \ndo with the case. This is not a game of ``gotcha,'' a game of seeing \nhow many scalps you can put on your belt, how many notches you can put \non your gun barrel. This is American justice we are talking about. We \nhaven't addressed the grand jury system in 10 years. It is 500 years \nold, and it is 10 times worse now than it was 500 years ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the Senator's side has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe that under the unanimous consent \nrequest we are functioning under, we were to vote at 9:40. I yield back \nour time and suggest that we move to a vote.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, they have been.\n  All time has been yielded back. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 41, nays 59, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 218 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--41\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mack\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--59\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 3243) as modified, was rejected.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3244\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this is an amendment which has been \nrequested by the National Sheriffs' Association.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend while we get order \nin the Chamber.\n  There is a short debate before the vote.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment has been requested by the \nNational Sheriffs' Association, the Western States Sheriffs' \nAssociation, sheriffs' associations from the largest States. It relates \nto a very narrow issue of the use of surplus aircraft, primarily \nhelicopters, which have been made available to a local law enforcement \nagency. Today, there are serious restraints on the ability of a local \njurisdiction which has an aircraft to make it available to an adjacent \njurisdiction for things like search and rescue, overflights for drug \ncontrol purposes, and a variety of other issues. This has been a major \nissue, an irritant to local law enforcement.\n  It serves, in my opinion, no legitimate national purpose to impose \nthese restraints on the use of donated surplus property aircraft to \nlocal law enforcement. I urge adoption of this amendment which will \ncomply with the requests of American law enforcement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute in opposition. Who seeks \nrecognition?\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  The Senator will suspend while we get order in the Chamber.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment poses significant safety \nconcerns as to what the legitimate role of the FAA should be. I might \npoint out, I don't know of any hearing that has been held on this \nissue. There is legitimate concerns from the FAA as well as other \norganizations such as the Helicopter Association International and \nothers.\n  I oppose this amendment on the grounds there has not been sufficient \nscrutiny of the safety implications of this kind of action.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to Amendment No. \n3244 of the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.

I will be glad to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n\n\n                Explanation of Vote--Amendment No. 3243\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, on the Bumpers amendment, I voted against \nthe position of Senator Bumpers, not because I disagree with the \nsubstance of it. For the last 25 years and for the years I was chairman \nand ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, I have adhered to the \nnotion that the Judicial Conference, a system that we set up in the \nCongress years ago, is the appropriate vehicle to make recommendations \nfor changes in the Federal rules. The reason I voted against the \nBumpers amendment is not because I don't think prosecutors are out of \nhand, not because I don't think there is abuse of the grand jury \nsystem, which, by the way, for hundreds of years has relied upon the \nproposition that good judgment, sound judgment would be exercised by \nprosecutors and not be abused. Obviously, it is being abused.\n  My hope is, regardless of what the outcome of this is legislatively, \nI am going to propose at a future time that the Senate ask the Judicial \nConference to consider changes in the Federal rules relative to the \nconduct of grand juries and make recommendations to the Senate. That is \nthe way we have done it since the Judicial Conference has been set up. \nThat is the more appropriate way to deal with the Federal rules.\n  I conclude by complimenting Senator Bumpers for pointing out an abuse \nof the system and the need for change. I think the appropriate way to \ndo it is through the Federal rules.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator from Alabama has control of the time, I say to \nmy friend from Vermont. I yield the floor and thank the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nAlabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nUtah, the prime sponsor of the Juvenile Justice Act and chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, is here. I will be glad to yield to him any time \nhe wants on the amendment, and then I will talk on the amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3245\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for Juvenile Accountability Incentive \n                             Block Grants)\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the amendment is \ngoing to be offered on our behalf by the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama, Senator Sessions.\n  I rise in support of the amendment of the Senator from Alabama to \nbalance the approach between prevention and law enforcement. At the \noutset, let me commend the Senator from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, \nfor his outstanding commitment to reducing juvenile crime. His work, I \nthink, has made an outstanding contribution to our efforts.\n  All of us have been shocked over the past several months as our \nNation has witnessed a series of atrocious crimes committed by \njuveniles. These incidents bring home to all of us the reality of \njuvenile crime. The reality is that we can no longer sit silently by as \nchildren kill children, as teenagers commit truly heinous offenses, as \nour juvenile drug abuse rate continues to climb.\n  FBI data confirms the national problem of rampant juvenile violent \ncrime. In 1996, juveniles accounted for nearly one-fifth--19 percent--\nof all criminal arrests in the United States. Persons under 18 \ncommitted 15 percent of all murders, 17 percent of all rapes, and 32.1 \npercent of all robberies. These disturbing figures show the need to fix \na broken juvenile justice system that is failing too many of our young \npeople and ultimately failing to protect the public.\n  Last year, Congress began the process of addressing this serious \nnational problem. The fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill provided \n$250 million for a block grant that promotes a commonsense approach to \nintervene at the earliest signs of trouble.\n  A juvenile's first brush with the law is the most important, because \nit sends a strong signal of what he or she can get away with. \nGovernments cannot afford to wait until a youngster is 16 or 17 years \nold, and has committed a half a dozen or more violent crimes, before \ngetting serious.\n  The block grant funded last year has also promoted making a \njuvenile's criminal record accessible to police, courts, prosecutors, \nand schools so that we can know and ascertain who are the serious \nrepeat offenders. Right now, these records simply are not available in \nNCIC, the national system that tracks adult criminal records.\n  We all recognize the value of programs that intervene in the lives of \njuveniles to prevent crime before it starts. The Federal Government \nalready spends about $4.1 billion a year on programs aimed at \ndelinquent and at-risk youth. We are doing some great things through \npublic-private partnerships, through youth groups like the Boys and \nGirls Clubs, and we are going to continue to do this.\n  I commend Senator Gregg for doubling our effort for this program to \n$40 million in the bill before us.\n  I do not believe, however, that these programs alone can address the \nsickness that led to some of these recent tragedies. What we need is to \nensure that the prevention programs that we have are backed up by a \njuvenile justice system that takes crime seriously, and imposes real \nsanctions for juvenile crime.\n  Congress has given extensive support to delinquency prevention \nprograms, especially since the Republicans took control of Congress. \nCongress spent over $200 million on the Office of Juvenile and \nDelinquency Prevention, OJDP, programs in fiscal year 1998. Compared \nwith fiscal year 1991 funding of $75 million, Congress has increased \nprevention funding by over two and a half times. The Senate can be \nproud of its support of prevention programs. We increased prevention \nfunding from $107 million in 1994, up to $144 million in fiscal year \n1995. Since then we have steadily increased funding up to its FY 1998 \nlevel of over $201 million.\n  In fact, there is no shortage in prevention funding. According to a \nNovember 1997, General Accounting Office, GAO, report entitled ``At-\nRisk and Delinquent Youth: Multiple Programs Lack Coordinated \nApproach,'' the Federal Government currently spends over $4 billion \nannually in prevention money for juveniles in 127 different Federal \nprograms. In contrast, the Federal Government spends little money on \nlaw enforcement and detention for juvenile offenders.\n\n[[Page S8692]]\n\n  The bill before us provides an appropriation for the Juvenile \nAccountability Incentive Block Grants of $100 million for fiscal year \n1999. This funding level is far too low to meet the needs of our State \nand local law enforcement. For fiscal year 1998, the grant was set for \n$250 million. The Senator from Alabama's amendment will help restore \nfunding to critical areas of the juvenile justice system, by \nreallocating $50 million from what I believe to be an excessive \nincrease in appropriations for the incentive grants for prevention \nprograms under Title V of the JJDPA. This program, funded at $20 \nmillion in FY 1998, has been increased over fourfold, to $95 million in \nthe bill before us.\n  Senator Sessions' amendment will shift a part of that increase back \nto the block grant, so that the Senate will be funding this important \nprogram at the same level as it proposed in FY 1998. I must say that, \nin my view, even this amount will still be inadequate, because the need \nis so great. First, these incentive block grants fund the construction \nof permanent juvenile corrections facilities. Such facilities are \nneeded to protect law abiding citizens from violent and repeat \noffenders. Space in secure detention facilities for serious and violent \njuvenile offenders is in critically short supply in many of our States.\n\n  Second, this amendment will provide to aid State and local \ngovernments for the integration of serious juvenile criminal records \ninto the national criminal history database, making these delinquency \nadjudication records available to law enforcement and courts as adult \ncriminal records are now. Right now, these records simply are not \navailable in NCIC, the national system that tracks adult criminal \nrecords. As any judge, police officer, or prosecutor will tell you, \ninformation is the lifeblood of the criminal justice system. With \nrespect to juvenile criminal records, the system is anemic. Let me \nprovide my colleagues with an example from just one State of what \nintegrating these records into the adult records system can accomplish. \nIntegrating juvenile offender's fingerprints into the records system in \nVirginia resulted in a significant improvement in identifying crime \nsuspects. In fact, prints of juveniles make up only one percent of \nVirginia's automated fingerprint identification system, but this one \npercent accounts for 18 percent of latent crime scene fingerprint \nidentifications.\n  Third, this amendment helps States provide drug testing for \nappropriate categories of juvenile offenders. This testing will help \nauthorities to know what crimes are drug driven, to better target \ntreatment, services, and punishment as appropriate.\n  For too long, the Federal Government has neglected to give adequate \nsupport to juvenile law enforcement programs. This amendment will help \nplace much needed resources to the law enforcement side of the juvenile \njustice system. Our current juvenile justice system intervenes too late \nin the lives of juvenile offenders. All too often, juveniles break the \nlaw several times before they are held accountable. Unfortunately, this \ndelay in justice fails to teach youthful offenders the seriousness of \ntheir crimes. This chain of events often lead to the tragic juvenile \ncrime newspaper headlines we read in the newspapers nearly every day. \nWe can do better, and the restoration of funds to the juvenile \naccountability incentive block grant is an important first step. For \nthese reasons, I strongly urge the support of my colleagues for this \namendment.\n  I believe the Senator from Alabama has a good amendment here that \nwould go a long way toward solving some of these problems we have in \njuvenile crime. I do believe that we will bring up the juvenile justice \nbill shortly after we return in September. At that time, we can debate \nall of these issues in full specific form.\n  I thank the majority leader for, I think, being willing to do that. I \nthank my colleague for being willing to bring this amendment up, which \nI think pushes us down that road toward better juvenile justice than we \nhave had in the past. He has done a terrific job in this area. He has \nbeen singular in his dedication and drive and forthrightness in this \narea. I think we ought to all listen to him and do our best to back him \nin the things that he is trying to do, as a former prosecutor, as a \nformer U.S. attorney, as somebody who really knows this area very well.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I call up amendment No. 3245 and ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHatch be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself and \n     Mr. Hatch, proposes an amendment numbered 3245.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 30, line 7, strike ``$100,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$150,000,000''.\n       On page 36, line 20, strike ``$95,000,0000'' and insert \n     ``$45,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to say how much I have \nappreciated the opportunity to work with Chairman Hatch. He is an \noutstanding leader, a terrific lawyer, an outstanding constitutional \nscholar, and a champion for bringing order and discipline to ending \ncrime in America. There is no one here who has contributed more over \nthe years to that effort than Senator Hatch. And his advice and \nfriendship, as we have gone forward, has been very, very helpful to me.\n  Mr. President, let me just say this. I am going to go right to the \nheart of this matter. I came here to work on juvenile crime after \nserving as a Federal prosecutor for 15 years and attorney general of \nAlabama for 2 years. I care about juvenile crime. I have studied it. I \nhave talked to juvenile crime experts--prosecutors, probation officers, \njudges--who have worked with it on a regular basis.\n  I have concluded that we have a juvenile justice system that is \noverwhelmed by the flood of more and more cases, more and more serious \ncases. According to a New York Times article, in Chicago they spend 5 \nminutes per case. That shows you what is happening in America, around \nthe country.\n  You talk to police officers in every town and they are frustrated by \nwhat is happening in juvenile justice. They tell me, ``Jeff, we can't \ndo anything to them, and they know it. They are laughing at us.'' I \nhave heard that all over. It is not the fault of the judges. But it is \nreally the fault of all of us who have allowed the adult criminal \njustice system--and rightly so--to be strengthened significantly.\n  We have gone to three times as many adult people in jail, for \nexample, as we had just 18 years ago. And now we have had very little \nincrease in the number of youngsters who have been detained under any \nkind of detention program than we had before. And we have had the most \nserious increase in the most violent type criminal activity by that \nyounger group.\n  So what do we do about it? They say we need a balance between \nprevention and law enforcement. And I agree with that. What we want to \ndo--and my amendment does--is seek to have balance.\n  Look at this chart. We have $4.3 billion dedicated to prevention \nprograms in this budget already. That is what this Government is \nspending. This is from a study done by the General Accounting Office \nthat was just completed in May of this year. We found that there is no \nmoney dedicated solely for juvenile law enforcement--unless perhaps we \ncount the money that was funded in the block grant that I am supporting \ntoday from last year. Otherwise, there is none. I think we need to \nthink seriously about what we are doing.\n  Under this bill, this appropriations bill, the amount of money that \nwas to be expended for the block grant program to increase and support \njuvenile justice in our local communities to help our States do that--\nwe have gone from $250 million in last year's budgetary authority, cut \nto $100 million this year.\n  In addition to that, in the program that the President has supported, \nwe have gone from $20 million to $95 million. I want to share with you \nwhat that program spends the money on. This is the prevention program \nthat\n\n[[Page S8693]]\n\nhas gone from $20 million to $95 million in this year's budget.\n  It says it is to provide juvenile justice system programs for \nchildren, youth, and families, these things: Recreational services. \nNow, that is No. 1 listed on the plan--recreational services. I am for \nrecreation, but I am not sure in a juvenile crime bill, in an effort to \nfight crime, we ought to be promoting recreation.\n  Tutoring and remedial education. I am going to show you here in a \nminute a list of 129 programs that are filled with those kinds of \nactivities. What we do not have is any help for our juvenile judges and \nprobation officers and drug treatment personnel in the court systems.\n  Here is the third one: Assistance. This is what it says: ``Assistance \nin the development of work awareness skills.'' That is on what we are \nspending $50 million. I don't know what that means.\n\n  Child and adolescent health and mental health services. We have a \nhost of those already funded by this Government.\n  Alcohol and prevention programs. We have that pending legislation \nright now to a tremendous degree, and we already have programs spending \nmoneys on that.\n  Leadership and development activities. Now, I don't know what that \nmeans.\n  Finally, teaching that people are and should be held accountable for \ntheir actions. I agree with that. But how do you teach people to be \naccountable for their actions if you arrest a youngster in a household \nburglary and he is taken to the police station and released that very \nnight and sent home and nothing happens to him? Is that the way you \nteach it? I say that is what they are hearing. That is what people are \nhearing and that is what you will find if you talk to your law \nenforcement officer.\n  What are we already funding in this governmental program? We are \nspending $4 billion in 129 programs for at-risk delinquent youth, \naccording to the General Accounting Office. Here, under Department of \nTreasury, gang resistance education and training projects, $8 million; \njuvenile justice delinquency prevention and mentoring, $4 million; \njuvenile justice prevention allocation of the States, $70 million.\n  Under Department of Labor, employment and training research and \ndevelopment projects; job training for the homeless demonstration \nprogram; and so on and so on, program after program after program, \ndesigned with good intentions to deal with kids who are at risk.\n  Now, let's go back to square one. Let me tell you what I think ought \nto be done. Who are the most at-risk children? Those are the ones who \nare going to court now. According to a Newsweek article, 70 percent of \nthe young people who murder someone have taken a gun to school \npreviously. That is a stunning number. What that says does not surprise \nme in the sense that most of the young people in America who are \ncommitting serious crimes--the armed robberies, the assault with intent \nto murder, the murders, the rapes--have been in trouble with the judge \nand the courts before. They have been there before. If the courts are \nspending only 5 minutes to deal with them, no wonder they are coming \nback time and time and time again.\n  As Senator Hatch said, our goal must be to make that first brush with \nthe law the last. How can we do that? That is what we are saying. What \nshould this Senate do? I am telling you, based on my experience and the \nhearings we have had for the last 2 years, what we need to do is \nstrengthen the juvenile justice system. That is what we need to do.\n  Now, that does not mean you put people in jail every time they get \ncaught. It means when you arrest them, the first thing you should do is \ndrug test them. Is this criminality being driven by drugs? If it is, \nthen we ought to have them in a treatment program. They ought to be \ndrug tested and monitored to make sure they get off drugs. That is the \nfirst thing you do. If this is the third, fourth, or fifth offense and \nthey have committed a serious crime, they ought to be detained. We \ncannot continue to allow repeat offenders to run at large, even though \nthey are 16 or 17 years of age.\n  There was a murder in Montgomery, AL. Three youngsters killed a night \nwatchman. I called the police department to ask about the prior record \nof those offenders. This is what they told me: 7, 7, and 15 prior \narrests. That is what they had, each one of them. One 7, one 7, and \nanother 15 prior arrests. They were still on the street. The revolving \ndoor was still operating and they murdered somebody. We would have done \nthem a favor had they been detained, sent to an alternative school, \nsent to a boot camp. Perhaps we could have intervened in that lifestyle \nand stopped that murder from occurring. As it is, they were certified \nas an adult, will now be convicted as an adult, and sent off to an \nadult jail for a very long sentence. Who benefited from that?\n  The reason is that juvenile court system in Alabama, and all over \nAmerica, is overwhelmed. Our bill provides an incentive grant to the \nStates for the purposes of strengthening that. It will give those \njuvenile judges the authority they need to crack down on juvenile crime \nand to change that life direction that is heading in the wrong \ndirection, to the right direction.\n  Let me tell you what this money can be used for. It will be used for \nprograms to enhance prosecution and confinement of juvenile criminals \nas part of the graduated sanctions proposal. Everyone, on both sides of \nthe aisle, agrees that we need graduated sanctions. When you are caught \nfor one offense and you do another one, you go up a punishment level. \nThe sanction is a punishment increase. That sends an important message \nthat crime does not pay.\n  It would fund programs that require juvenile delinquents to pay \nrestitution to victims of juvenile crime. It would fund programs that \nrequire juvenile offenders to complete school or vocational training. \nThat is what our proposal would do. It would require juvenile criminals \nto pay child support. If they have a child, they ought to be supporting \nthat child. There would be programs to curb truancy. We need to get \nthese kids back in school promptly. As soon as we can identify truants, \nthey need to be apprehended and sent back to school before they get so \nfar behind that they are hopelessly behind their contemporaries.\n\n  Programs need to be designed to collect, record, and disseminate \ninformation on their criminal history. It would provide drug testing, \nprograms for antidrug youth programs and the like. It would have a \nserious habitual offender program. It would have programs targeted \ntoward youth gangs, and the construction and remodeling of short-term \nfacilities for juvenile offenders. You have to have someplace to put \nthem or you are just releasing them the very day they are caught. That \nis what is happening. They are being released the day they are caught. \nWe need more juvenile facilities so there can be some detention. This \nwould allow the States to apply for a grant, for matching money, to \nhave detention facilities, alternative schools and boot camps and \nwhatever they think is necessary to strengthen their court system.\n  As a policymaker, recognize we have a limited amount of money. How do \nwe apply that money most effectively? Who do we use it on? We use it \non, I suggest, those people who are already coming into contact with \nthe criminal justice system. Routinely, they are being arrested in \nAmerica today for the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, tenth time, \nand nothing serious has happened. The reason is we have not given \nenough attention and support to those juvenile judges, those \nprosecutors, those probation officers, who are out every day trying to \nchange lives. If we can strengthen that group, that is what we should \ndo.\n  Now, I am not opposed to general programs, after-school programs. I \nam not opposed to alternative schools. In fact, I would support those. \nOur proposal and our need today, the most critical need, is to identify \nthose young offenders who are heading to a life of serious criminality, \nwho have the potential to kill somebody, maybe your son or daughter, \nmaybe my son or daughter. We see in the headlines every day young \npeople committing those kinds of crimes.\n  The answer to it is to find out who is capable of that at the \nearliest possible stage and do something about it. Most of those are \ngoing to be coming through the juvenile court system. In that juvenile \ncourt system, most good\n\n[[Page S8694]]\n\nones--and I have visited them around the country; they have mental \nhealth treatment, drug treatment, counseling, incarceration, \nalternative schools, evaluations to determine whether or not they have \nlearning disabilities and those kinds of problems--try to get those \nchildren on the right road.\n  That is where we need to spend our money if we want to reduce serious \njuvenile crime. Spending it on every child in America in after-school \nprograms may be a good decision for America to pursue but we have not \nhad hearings on it and analyzed it. But it is an education function, \nprimarily. This bill--our effort, our block grant--is designed to \nassist the juvenile justice system in performing their function of \nidentifying and confronting those young offenders when they first brush \nup against the law, and to make sure that first brush is their last \nbrush.\n\n  If we do that, we will be investing our money wisely. I submit that \nthe program that is in this bill that I just shared with you is vague, \nunspecific, and does not deal primarily with the kids that we need to \ndeter from crime; and taking the money from that program and shifting \nit to this block grant and increasing it will focus our resources on \nthe kids that need it the most.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I admire and applaud the interest of my \nfriend from Alabama in the criminal justice system. He is a former \nprosecutor and is dedicated to law enforcement. I stand not to disagree \nwith his concern; I disagree with his solution. There is on old \nexpression where I come from--I think the Senator is ``in the right \nchurch, but he is in the wrong pew.''\n  I will explain what I mean by that. My friend has not misrepresented \nany facts, but it is a matter of presentation here. I want to make sure \nthat I deal with 3 major issues. I want to lay out to my colleagues \nwhat I am going to do. First of all, I want to applaud the chairman and \nranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee here. I think they \ndid one heck of a job on this legislation. I start off by rising to \ndefend--not that they need any defense--what the appropriations bill \ndoes in this area. So I am going to first make sure we all understand, \nand our colleagues' staffs who are listening understand, what the \namendment of my friend from Alabama actually does, in specific terms. \nThen I want to speak to the issue he has raised, which is that there \nare already a sufficient number of programs dealing with prevention. He \ncites the GAO study. I want to go into some detail, quite frankly, for \nthe first time. These figures keep being offered and this assertion \nkeeps being stated. I think, although it accurately says what the GAO \nreport says, it does not accurately reflect what is actually being done \nrelative to prevention. Lastly, I am going to conclude by laying out \nwhat I believe to be the larger prescription to putting into context \nwhat I think we should be doing to deal with the problem the Senator \nfrom Alabama and I--and I suspect every Senator--agrees that we have to \nattend to now.\n  I respectfully suggest that, at the outset, about 5 years ago when \nthe crime bill passed--the comprehensive crime bill--it was called the \nBiden crime bill. That is when it didn't look like it was going to \nwork, so the President liked it that way. Well, it started to work, and \nthen it was the Clinton crime bill. So it started out as the Biden \ncrime bill. The point is that it's working, so it is the Clinton crime \nbill. And it is now the bipartisan crime bill, which everybody \nsupported.\n  That was the first time in the 25 years I have been here that, on a \nlarge scale, we learned to walk and chew gum at the same time when we \ndealt with crime. We had a very heavy dose of enforcement, a very heavy \ndose of prevention, and a very heavy dose of medicine relating to \nincarceration after the conviction. And I think that is the way we have \nto approach the issue of juvenile justice. It is the last unattended-to \ncriminal justice issue of consequence that we have not come up with a \ncomprehensive plan on.\n  The Senator from Alabama and I have been cooperating, debating, \ndisagreeing, and working with one another in the Judiciary Committee \nfor the last year and a half, with differing points of view on how to \ndeal with a comprehensive juvenile justice approach. He indicates this \nis not that comprehensive approach. He is doing what is within his \nrights and what he is limited to be able to do on this appropriations \nbill, and that is deal specifically with what is in the bill.\n  So the committee reported a bill that now includes $95 million for \ntitle V grants under the juvenile justice office. The way the committee \nbroke it down, wisely, was $20 million for prevention efforts, aimed at \ntribal youth--that is in the Indian nations; $25 million for the \nenforcement of under-age drinking laws and efforts, championed \nparticularly by Senator Byrd of West Virginia; $50 million for the \nremainder, which supports a variety of community-based locally \ndeveloped crime prevention programs, targeted to school violence, drug \nabuse, and truancy, which I think is the first thing the Senator from \nAlabama and the Senator from Delaware agree on. If you look at all the \ndata, the single most significant, predictable precursor of youth \nviolence is truancy. If you give me a list of all the truants and a \nlist of all the other attributes relating to activities and conduct of \nstudents in American schools, I will bet you I will be able to pick any \nschool district, any school, and identify for you 85 to 95 percent of \nthe troubled youth, violent youth, just by being able to identify \ntruancy. So we all know that, like the Senator from South Carolina who \nhas spent a great deal of time dealing in this area, as has the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. We all know that. They made a very wise allocation.\n\n  What would my friend from Alabama do with his amendment? He would cut \nthe $95 million for prevention by $50 million. Then he would take that \n$50 million for so-called youth block grants. I am not opposed to youth \nblock grants. In the Biden juvenile justice bill, which is the \nalternative on our side of the aisle to S. 10 by my friend from Alabama \nand others, what we do--we believe we have to have enforcement as well. \nThe Senator from Alabama takes $50 million out, which is basically the \n$50 million dealing with after-school, community-based programs and \nputs it into enforcement efforts. Last year, $45 million was \nappropriated for this, and the Senator from Alabama, Senator Sessions, \nis cutting the program back to last year's level--that is, $45 \nmillion--for all of the nonenforcement provisions relating to \nprevention.\n  Now, I note parenthetically that the Democratic youth violence bill \nhas $100 million for after-school prevention, $400 million for youth \nviolence block grants, which is enforcement, and $250 million relating \nto existing programs, about one-half enforcement and one-half \nprevention, and $150 million for juvenile prosecutors in courts. So I \nwant to put this into context. I don't speak for either of the managers \nof the bill, but my guess is that this is not a case where they \nattempted to write an entire juvenile justice bill. They were dealing \nwith provisions within that. So I don't disagree with the proposition \nof my friend from Alabama that we have to do more on the enforcement \nside as well.\n  The bill I have written, in concert with my Democratic colleagues--\nand many Republicans as well support it--relates to both prevention and \nenforcement. When I say enforcement, I mean prosecution and the courts, \nand we have already taken care of provisions and have more provisions \nrelating to juvenile justice detention and the facilities relating to \nthat.\n  So let's get this straight as this debate is underway here. I am not \nsuggesting, in taking on what I am about to do regarding the specifics \nof the present specific amendment of my friend from Alabama, that we \ndon't need more for enforcement. Again, I go back to my opening \nstatement. I said it is nice when we have learned--and it works--to \nwalk and chew gum at the same time. That is what we did on the master \ncrime bill, the major crime bill. I don't know of anybody saying that \ncrime bill is a bad bill now. What we did there is we committed, over a \n5-year period, billions of dollars--$30 billion. It did not break down \na third, a third, and a third, but it was not far off that. I am \noverstating it in the interest of time. Roughly 30 percent was for \nprisons, 30 percent was for cops, and 30\n\n[[Page S8695]]\n\npercent for related programs that keep people from going into prison. \nThat makes sense.\n  Now, we should do that on a wholesale basis for juvenile justice with \na different focus. Let me specifically respond and again make the \npoint--and I realize I am being somewhat pedantic here. But this is not \nabout whether you are for enforcement or for prevention. We should do \nboth, and we do both. It is about whether or not the skewed alteration \nof the allocation of prevention and enforcement proposed by the Senator \nfrom Alabama is the right way to go. Obviously, I think it is the wrong \nway to go. Let me explain why. First, in explaining why, let me respond \nto the specific underlying, and on its face compelling rationale my \nfriend from Alabama offers with his blue charts.\n  Let me explain what I mean by that.\n  The Senator makes the statement that has been made many, many times--\nnot just by him but by others--that we don't need to go anymore into \nthe prevention side. In large part, the basic premise rests upon the \nnotion that we don't need to provide them with safe havens, et cetera, \nbecause we already have out there 131 programs for at-risk youth with \nan annual appropriations of $4 billion.\n  The Senator from Illinois actually knows about this subject. But if I \nam the Senator from Illinois and I come on the floor and listen to the \ndebate, and I say, ``Look, the Senator from Illinois is one of these \nguys who is always talking about cutting wastes from programs that we \ndon't need''--overlapping programs--I stand up, and I say, ``By the \nway, we don't need to spend more money, we just need to spend the money \nbetter.''\n  The GAO report says there are 131 Federal programs and $4 billion. So \nI ask the Senator from Illinois why he would agree with Senator Biden--\nor, in this case, with the committee--in putting $50 million of the $95 \nmillion they have in the prevention program. That is kind of \ncompelling. Then I say the GAO said that, not me--the GAO. But the GAO \ndoes say that.\n  I am going to take a few moments to bore you with some of the data \nunderlying the GAO report. Maybe we can get an agreement here as to \nwhat the facts are underscoring the basis upon which the GAO report was \nfiled. My colleagues on the other side--some, and a few on this side--\nhave been saying we don't need to do more to steer our children away \nfrom gangs and drugs; we don't need to provide more safe havens from \nthe streets; we are already doing enough. I am supportive of the \nargument. GAO identifies 131 programs for at-risk youth with annual \nappropriations of $4 billion. And the claim is that after-school \nprevention programs that have been proposed by me and others included \nin the youth violence bill but included in this case in the \nappropriations bill are just more of the same.\n  Let's take a closer look at the 131 programs being criticized over \nand over again and see what we are really talking about.\n  I apologize to my colleagues. The ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee has been kind enough to allow me to continue to be the \nranking member of the Crime Subcommittee, and I feel like I let him \ndown a little bit, because he has been doing about 500 other things out \nthere in that committee, and I should have been calling what I am about \nto say to the attention of our colleagues 6 months ago, to be honest \nwith you. And I didn't. I didn't. Let's take a look at it.\n  The GAO report says that based on fiscal year 1995--to start with, \nmany of the 131 programs have already been eliminated since then. In \nfact, 15 of the programs listed didn't even receive any funds in 1995. \nThe report doesn't indicate whether any funds were expended on 22 \nothers. What you had to start with is that a total of 37 of the 131 \nprograms either didn't receive funds or weren't listed. The number of \n131 is already inflated, No. 1. You are talking about maybe around \n100--less than 100 programs.\n  According to the GAO report, the Federal Government was spending \nabout $4 billion per year on programs for delinquent and at-risk youth, \na target that all of us on the floor are concerned about, from the \nSenator from Alabama to the Senator from New York to the Senators from \nNew Hampshire and South Carolina. But when you take a close look at the \nactual programs, only a portion of these funds and programs are \ntargeted specifically at preventing violence and drug abuse for young \npeople.\n\n  Let me give you two examples: $1.2 billion of the $4 billion--let's \nget this straight.\n  You can tell I have been here 25 years because I am not a chart guy. \nI was kidding one of my Democratic colleagues saying that he does this \nso well when he debates. But guys like Bumpers, I, and Hollings are not \nso big on charts. We haven't learned the chart deal yet. I guess I \nshould learn it to get into the mainstream, because if I had a chart, \nit would be clear. What I do is just talk longer and probably confuse \nthings. But I am going to give it a shot without charts.\n  Let's start off with 131 programs being offered saying we have $34 \nbillion spent on at-risk youth. The truth is, it is 97 programs, and \nthat is 1995. The truth is, in 1995 you really only had, at most, about \n97 programs that got funded at all. OK?\n  Then you have a second piece. Of those 97 programs that allegedly are \ntargeted at at-risk youth--roughly 97--what you have is, $1.2 billion \nout of the $4 billion that is spent on those programs goes to the Job \nTraining and Partnership Act. That was a program championed by a lead \ncontender for the Presidential nomination of the Republican side, Dan \nQuayle, and the leading Democrat on the Senate side, Ted Kennedy. That \nis their program. When they introduced the program--and most of us were \nhere--I don't remember any Member standing up saying this is for at-\nrisk youth, designed to prevent crime. Hopefully, it has the spinoff \nbenefit of providing jobs for kids and they don't go into crime. But \nthis is not to deal with 36 million latchkey children who walk home \nafter school without a mother or father there because both have to work \nand have from 2 in the afternoon or 3 in the afternoon until dinnertime \nwith no supervision. That is not what the Job Training and Partnership \nAct was. But GAO counts $1.2 billion of that against the $4 billion \nthey say we are spending on at-risk youth, violent youth.\n  I am sure I don't have to remind anybody that the so-called JTPA is a \nprogram, as I said, championed by Dan Quayle and Ted Kennedy, that \nwhile job training is important, it is not what most of us think of as \ntargeting at-risk, violent juveniles.\n  Now we are down from $4 billion to $3.8 billion on 97 programs. There \nis another quarter of a billion dollars--not quite. To be precise, $245 \nmillion goes for vocational education programs. Most of the kids my \nfriend from Alabama and I are concerned about are not signing up for \nvocational education, an important program. I strongly support it, as I \ndo the job training program. But, again, no 13-year old with a key \nhanging around his neck after the school bell rings, walking through a \nbad neighborhood and by 12 junkies to get home, says, ``My way out of \nthis is job training; my way out of this is vocational education.'' It \nis an important program, but it is not what we are talking about.\n  Now we are down to about $2.75 billion and 97 programs. Actually, if \nyou take vocational education, job training, and the related programs, \nit is about $1.5 billion the Federal Government spends. We are really \ndown to about $2.35 billion and 97.\n  Let's talk about some of the other programs. They go to very worthy \nactivities. I am not in any way criticizing them. I voted for them, and \nI would vote for them again. I think they make sense. But they are not \ntargeted programs for violent youth or at-risk youth.\n  Let me go on.\n  If we are going to talk about focus--that is what I am talking about \nhere--7 of the programs listed are assistance for homeless youth, 9 of \nthe programs--now we are down to about 90--9 others are very important, \nbut they are for a variety of activities directed at Indian youth, for \nmental health and physical health programs. Now we are down to about 80 \nprograms.\n  Three other programs are dedicated specifically to mental health \nservices for the general population. Now we are heading down into the \nmid seventies. Four programs deal with child abuse. Still we are in the \nseventies--below 70. And one of the programs is for migrant health \nservices. So now you are down to around 70 programs from the 131.\n\n[[Page S8696]]\n\n  I will give you one example. The GAO list includes the HHS Child \nWelfare Grant Program which provides one-third of a billion dollars, \n$292 million, for foster care and services for abused and neglected \nchildren--very important services but not what we are talking about.\n  So now we are getting down to the $2 billion area with about 70 \nprograms. Other programs have little or nothing to do with crime and \ndrug prevention. While any line drawing that I am making here--and I am \ndoing that--is somewhat arbitrary, at least I hope this puts it in \ncontext for my colleagues.\n  Let me give a couple other examples of programs that I don't think \nany of us--if we had a list of all the programs that I want, all the \nprograms any of us want here to deal with youth prevention, if we \nlisted them all on a board and I said, ``Pick the top 50 that deal with \nviolent youth and preventing crime,'' I doubt whether you would add the \nFoster Parent Grant Program, the Food Stamp Employment Program, the \nYouth Impaired Driving Project, four programs for promoting art with \nyouth--all important programs, all important, none of which I disagree \nwith, but they do not have a darned thing to do with the center of the \ndebate the Senator from Alabama and I have.\n  I want programs. I want the States to be able to say, ``We will keep \nthe school open until 5 o'clock. We are going to have baseball teams \nfor ninth graders and football teams and basketball teams for the \ngirls.'' None of the school districts you all live in do that, unless \nyou send your kid to a private school. These kids have nothing to do. \nKids need an excuse to tell that junkie they have to walk by on the \ncorner to get to their home; they need an excuse to stay out of \ntrouble.\n  Let's go back home to your own school districts, many of which are \nstrapped, and ask yourself, ``Why is it there is Little League in the \nsummer but no baseball teams after school for boys and girls in sixth, \nseventh, eighth, and ninth grades?'' Well, the school districts don't \nwant to spend the money.\n  I am the guy who came to this floor 8 years ago and said, ``The \nmajority of the violent crime committed by young people is not when you \nall think it is.'' Everybody thought it was done in the heat of the \nnight. It is done in broad daylight, in the sunlight between the hours \nof 2:30 and 6.\n  I remember when I brought that report from the Judiciary Committee--\nactually, the credit goes to the joint staff then of the Judiciary \nCommittee--when I brought it to the floor. ``Oh, there goes those \nliberal guys again, talking about this coddling stuff.'' Now there is \nnot a cop in America, there is not a criminal justice person in America \nwho doesn't say that is the problem.\n  My mom has an expression, as she would say, God love her--my mother \nis an Irish Catholic woman with 6,000 expressions. I went to Catholic \ngrade school with the nuns. I think my mother, when she wasn't having \nchildren, was a nun. She remembers all the expressions. And one of her \nfavorite expressions is, ``An idle mind is the devil's workshop.''\n  An idle mind is the devil's workshop. You get a ninth grade kid \nliving in a tough neighborhood without supervision of any adult in a \nschool, in a family, for 4 hours every day after school, and good kids, \ngood kids do bad things; it is called maturation. What the heck do we \nexpect these kids to do? They lack good judgment. Even when they know \nand care about right and wrong, they have bad judgment because they are \n14 years old; they are not 24 or 54.\n  I ask all of you--you may be, and probably all are, a better person \nthan I am, but I wonder how I would have been if every day after school \nfor 4 hours a day I was on my own, on my own. I was a pretty good \nathlete, and I was a pretty good student, and I never got myself in \ntrouble with the law. But I want to tell you something. I will bet you, \nif I was on my own, with all of the values my family instilled in me, I \nam not so sure I would have had the courage to say no to the guy who \nwas 17 who says, ``Hey, jump in the car and take a ride with me. It's \nonly Charlie's car. We borrowed it.'' I would like to think I would \nhave said, ``No problem. That's wrong. You guys are doing the wrong \nthing. I am not going to participate.''\n  Let me tell you something, Jack. You are a better person than I am if \nyou are certain how you would have done it. And that is how this \nincrementally starts. It doesn't start with a 13-year-old kid waking up \nsaying, ``You know, I am going out and get a MAC-9, walk into the 7-\nEleven, blow away the guy behind the counter, and get $17 in cash so I \ncan go buy myself some dope.'' That is not how it works.\n  And so what are we doing here? Well, once you winnow out the programs \nfor problems like child abuse and mental illness, once you exclude the \nprograms directed at narrow populations, I believe that only 41 of the \n131 programs in the GAO list, spending out at about $1.1 billion in \nappropriations a year, are targeted specifically at juvenile crime and \ndrug prevention. And of that total of $1.1 billion, $639 million, over \nhalf, went to just two programs, one of which I am responsible for \ncoauthoring, so I obviously support it, and the other which I support \nas well--over half went to just two programs; $467 million went to the \nSafe and Drug-Free Schools Act and community programs.\n  Now, the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act is the act we passed here, \ngot funded. Then 1 day I guess the Speaker woke up and said, ``We think \nthat's a bad idea,'' and they cut it. The public went bananas, and they \nput it back in; it is OK. Of the $1.1 billion for at-risk youth, $467 \nmillion goes to the Safe and Drug-Free Schools Act, and my Republican \ncolleagues boosted that appropriation last year to $556 million, a move \nI fully support and compliment the Republican leadership for doing, \nparticularly since the House wanted to eliminate it.\n  So now you are talking, of the $1.1 billion, $639 million of it, over \nhalf of it, is going for programs that, again, are not about after \nschool. Then $172 million of the remaining roughly $400 million went to \nthe Upward Bound Program--important. It provides mentoring, tutoring, \nand life skill training. If my friend does not understand what work \nawareness is, work awareness is a lot of these kids grow up in a family \nwith no sense, no notion, no responsibility, no image, no example of \nwhat work means. Unless something has happened, birds learn to fly by \nwatching their parents, ducks learn to paddle in my pond watching their \nparents, snakes learn to slither, turtles learn to swim. Where the heck \ndo you think we learn? Where do you think our kids learn? It is a good \nprogram, but it is directed at disadvantaged high school students, this \n$172 million in the Upward Bound Program, to encourage children--\ntargeted at economically disadvantaged children--to continue their \neducation. That is very important. It indirectly has an impact on \ncrime. But, again, it certainly is not a targeted crime prevention \nprogram.\n\n  Then, of course, the GAO attributes about $146 million to 11 programs \nin the juvenile justice office, only a few of which are proposed to be \nconsolidated in the Republican crime bill.\n  That is roughly $400 million for about 27 crime and drug prevention \nprograms, some of which are tiny demonstration or pilot projects that \ncover no more than a handful of sites across the country and are \ndesigned to study what works and what does not. For example, in the \nlist of that $400 million, $200,000 is for a demonstration grant \nprogram for residential drug treatment for women with young children--\nimportant, but, again, not what we are talking about.\n  So the impression given here that there are more than 130 Federal \nprevention programs designed to target at-risk youth is simply not an \naccurate reflection. In all of the cities and towns across America, and \nserving every child we can help, there are fewer than 40 programs for \nabout $400 million. And what my friend from Alabama is saying, relying \non the GAO report, is: You know, that is about as much as we can do. \nGovernment is already doing all it can and should do to stop kids from \nturning to gangs, crime, and drugs. But we have just seen many of the \nprograms that are listed as targeted that, in fact, do not do that at \nall.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I do want to finish this at some point, but I will be \nhappy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator not agree with me that one thing we have\n\n[[Page S8697]]\n\nheard, talking with law enforcement people--not somebody who just looks \nat this from a theoretical point of view, but law enforcement people--\nis that the issue of prevention comes up over and over again? The \nSenator from Delaware, of course, addressed this in his original \nlegislation. It was, as the Senator from Delaware will recall, a matter \nof some debate, both in the committee and on the floor. As I recall, in \nsome of the conference committees we went to 4 o'clock and 5 o'clock in \nthe morning several times, discussing the issue of prevention.\n  I believe the Senator from Delaware will recall, as I do, the number \nof police officers and police officials who came to us and said stay \nwith prevention programs.\n  In many ways, it just makes such great sense. As a former prosecutor, \nI remember that it was always the prevention programs that worked the \nbest. So I ask the Senator from Delaware, does he not agree with what \nthe President of the National Sheriffs Association says, in an open \nletter?\n  After he speaks of the problems of juvenile crime, the President of \nthe National Sheriffs Association says:\n\n       So what is the answer? We must adopt a three-pronged \n     approach to juvenile violence--prevention, intervention and \n     enforcement. These recent statistics indicate the need for a \n     comprehensive prevention strategy that includes education and \n     community involvement, and addresses the root causes of \n     delinquency. We can no longer afford to focus only on \n     treating the symptoms while ignoring the disease. Sheriffs \n     offices, through prevention programs . . . [the letter lists \n     a number of them] can make a difference in the lives of \n     children who still have a choice ahead of them as to whether \n     or not to try drugs, join a gang, steal a car, or otherwise \n     start on the slippery slope of a life of crime.\n\n  Wouldn't the Senator from Delaware agree with the head of the \nNational Sheriffs Association and me and so many others who say keep \nthese prevention programs going, do not take money away from the \nprevention programs, but accept the fact that they are now beginning to \nwork and work very well? This is not the time to cut them off. This is \nnot the time to change these prevention programs into some kind of a \nblock grant program that would not be aimed at prevention. Would not my \nfriend from Delaware agree with that?\n  Mr. BIDEN. The answer is, I absolutely do. I thank my friend for \ncalling that to my attention.\n  Let me not just mention the sheriffs. I am going to quote, now, from \na few of the leading police officers of America.\n  By the way, let's put this in context again. When the overall crime \nbill was drafted by me years ago, the way it got drafted was, I did not \nsit down with any sociologists or academics or welfare workers or, you \nknow, liberal think tanks. I literally called in the presidents of the \nseven leading police organizations in America, from NAPO to NOBLE, FOP, \net cetera. They sat around my conference table for the better part of 4 \nmonths.\n  I said: You tell me what you need. What do you think you need to \nfight crime?\n  In the overall crime bill, they said they needed about a third of it \ngoing to prevention.\n  When I sat down to draft the juvenile justice bill for our side of \nthe aisle, with my colleagues, as a follow-on, I called the same people \nback in. Some of the presidents were changed. They were not all the \nsame officers, the same people. To a person, they reinforced what the \nSenator from Vermont just said.\n  Let me give an example. Mr. President, 170 police chiefs, sheriffs, \nprosecutors, the president of the Fraternal Order of Police, the \nInternational Union of Police Associations, and the leaders of the \nCrime Victims Organization, came out with a call for action. They title \nit ``A Call For Action From America's Front Line Against Crime,'' made \nup of those organizations I just named. On February 5, 1998, here is \nwhat they said:\n\n       As police, prosecutors, crime survivors, we struggle every \n     day against crime and its devastating impact. We are \n     determined to see that dangerous criminals are arrested and \n     put behind bars. But anyone who thinks that jailing the \n     criminal is enough to undo the agony that crime leaves in its \n     wake hasn't seen crime up close. That is why no one knows \n     better than we that the most important weapons against crime \n     are investments that keep kids from becoming criminals, \n     investments which enable all children to get the right start \n     they need to become contributing citizens, and would show \n     them that as adults they would be able to meet their \n     families' basic needs through hard work.\n\n  (Mr. SMITH of Oregon assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I enjoyed listening to the Senator. I think he \nsuggested something that, maybe indirectly, he didn't mean to.\n  First, I want to say I am aware of and respect and appreciate what \nthe Senator has done over the years on crime prevention and law \nenforcement. But the Senator is not suggesting, I don't think, that any \none of these programs is targeted for reduction in any fashion by this \namendment, is he? This amendment would simply take a new program and \nnot increase it as much as my colleague and others may prefer to, but \nnone of these programs is threatened. It is not a block grant of any \nexisting programs?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator for his question. He is absolutely \naccurate. I am not suggesting in any way that any of the 131 programs \nlisted by GAO would fall to his amendment in any way.\n  What I am suggesting is, the very compelling argument he makes, when \nexamined, is not as compelling as it appears. And that is, I believe he \noffered those charts as evidence that we were already doing a great \ndeal on the prevention side.\n  He is not against prevention. I am not suggesting that either. But he \nis basically suggesting, as many others have, that we are already doing \nthis massive effort, totaling about $4 billion and 131 programs, to \ndeal with prevention. He believes that what my friends from South \nCarolina and New Hampshire did by adding $50 million for more \nprevention is misplaced and it should be placed on the enforcement side \nof the equation.\n  The reason I went through in great detail why it is really only about \n40 programs and really only about $400 million is to make the point \nthat we are not doing nearly enough on prevention, and to take this \npaltry sum of $50 million out of prevention, as proposed by my friends \non the Appropriations Committee, and put it into enforcement would be a \nmisallocation of a limited number of resources. That is the overall \npoint.\n  Secondly, I should point out, which I didn't, to put together this \nlittle syllogism, that my friend from South Carolina and the chairman \nof the committee, in fact, allocate $3.5 billion to enforcement just in \nthe Justice Department. Our friends who are the managers of this bill \nare not--if one listened only to this debate, one would think this \ndebate were about $400 million in youth prevention Federal Government-\nwide, all the programs I just said. It is not.\n  My friends are putting $50 million into prevention and $3.5 billion \nin this bill, in their appropriations bill, into enforcement. It breaks \ndown: On Byrne grants, \\1/2\\ billion dollars; local law enforcement \ngrants, $460 million; prison grants, $711 million; reimbursement of \nprison costs for aliens, $350 million; juvenile block grants--that is \nall enforcement money--$100 million; and $1.4 billion for cops who \ndon't make a distinction between enforcing the law against juveniles \nand adults.\n  Again, what the Senator from Alabama and I are really debating about, \nwhen you put it all aside, is not whether we should spend money on \nprevention and not whether we should spend money on enforcement, but \nthe allocation: Are the limited dollars we have being appropriately \nallocated?\n  My argument is, my friends from the Appropriations Committee have \nappropriately allocated the limited number of dollars and that the \namendment my friend from Alabama is proposing would misallocate that \nmoney by taking $50 million out of prevention and putting it into \nenforcement, which already has, as it should, the lion's share of the \nmoney.\n  Let me get back to this prevention issue. The vast majority of the \npolice in America not only do not disagree with the notion that we \nshould be spending money on prevention, not only do not want us to cut \nexisting prevention programs, but want us to spend\n\n[[Page S8698]]\n\nmore money on prevention. They are not in here asking that prevention \nmoney be taken and spent on enforcement.\n  Let me give you one anecdotal piece of evidence before I go to the \nmajor organizations. In Seaford, DE, a relatively small community, I \nasked a question that was--and in Dover, DE, 20,000 people, my State \ncapital, I went to the police officers. I am going to be very blunt \nabout this. I have a great relationship with the law enforcement \ncommunity. They have always supported me. They have supported me \noverwhelmingly as long as I have been in the Senate. I pay attention to \ntheir concerns. I suppose that is why they support me so strongly.\n  I went down and met with a very conservative former chief of police \nin Delaware. He raises steers on the side, and he is a cowboy. I think \nhe thinks my view on a lot of things may be too liberal. We had a \ndebate on how we should treat gays in America, and I think we should \ntreat them no differently than others. I am not so sure he and others \nwould think my view is so good and makes sense, et cetera. This is not \na guy who is a liberal law enforcement officer.\n  I said to him, ``If I can do anything for you--get you more cops, get \nyou more equipment--what would you have me do?'' Do you know what he \nsaid to me? No malarkey. He said to me, ``Build me another Boys & Girls \nClub.'' This is a hardnosed cop in the southern part of my State. My \nfriend from South Carolina knows the southern part of my State well, \nand I think he would tell you, it is not a lot different from Virginia \nor North Carolina or South Carolina. They view themselves as southern, \nthey view themselves as conservative, and they are.\n  Do you know what he asked me for? He asked me for no more cops, no \nmore money for squad cars, equipment, radios. He said, ``Build me a \nBoys & Girls Club.'' That is what he said, I say to my friend from \nSouth Carolina.\n  Seaford, DE, had a serious problem with drugs. I said, ``What do you \nwant me to do? What do you need?'' They said, ``We need a Boys & Girls \nClub. Build us one.''\n  Well, we did. I didn't. We didn't. The local community, with some \nFederal help, did.\n  Let me give you a few statistics. This is a letter from the executive \ndirector of the Boys & Girls Club in Delaware. He said:\n\n       I would like to share with you some recent statistics --\n\n  This dated April 30, 1998. It is not about this debate.\n\n       I would like to share with you some recent statistics \n     compiled by the Seaford Police Department on juvenile \n     complaints from the period February through March of the last \n     three years.\n       The statistics revealed:\n       In 1996, seventy-eight (78) juvenile complaints were \n     logged.\n       In 1997, eighty-eight (88). . ..\n       In 1998, only thirty-five (35) juvenile complaints were \n     logged.\n       The statistics show a 151 percent drop in complaints in \n     1998 as compared to . . . 1997.\n\n  It is no coincidence that the drop in complaints directly corresponds \nto the opening of the western Sussex Club for Boys and Girls on \nFebruary 1, 1998.\n  I say to my colleagues, this ``ain't'' rocket science. This is not \nrocket science. There was a study done in the mid-eighties involving \nthree cities, I believe it was New York, Pittsburgh, and Denver. Which \ntook some Boys & Girls Clubs. First of all, there were housing projects \nin the same demographic areas, same number of people. They put a Boys & \nGirls Club in the basement of these mostly high-rise public housing \nprojects.\n  Guess what? Over a period of 2 years, all the indices of crime--\nrearrests, initial arrest rate, drug use, et cetera--dropped about 30 \npercent.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter, \nMr. President.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               Boys & Girls Clubs of Delaware,\n\n                                   Wilmington, DE, April 30, 1998.\n     Senator Joseph Biden,\n     Federal Building,\n     Wilmington, DE.\n       Dear Senator Biden: I would like to share with you some \n     recent statistics compiled by the Seaford Police Department \n     on juvenile complaints for the period February through March \n     of the last three years.\n       The statistics revealed:\n       In 1996, seventy-eight (78) juvenile complaints were \n     logged.\n       In 1997, eighty-eight (88) juvenile complaints were logged.\n       In 1998, only thirty-five (35) juvenile complaints were \n     logged.\n       The statistics show a 151% drop in complaints in 1998 as \n     compared to the same period in 1997.\n       I believe it is no coincidence that the drop in complaints \n     directly corresponds to the opening of the Western Sussex \n     Club on February 1, 1998.\n       I am sharing these statistics with you because your support \n     was critical in the development of the Western Sussex Club. \n     Your support of $300,000 through the Bureau of Juvenile \n     Assistance was instrumental in the construction of the new \n     Western Sussex Boys & Girls Club facility in Seaford.\n       The following are a few additional statistics concerning \n     the Western Sussex Club operations:\n       The Club's membership has grown from 600 to more than 2,000 \n     in three months.\n       More than 400 boys & girls are using the facility on a \n     daily basis.\n       The Senior program which is also housed in the facility has \n     dramatically increased both its membership and program \n     service units.\n       Senator Biden, we sincerely appreciate your strong support \n     of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Delaware and our Clubs \n     throughout the country. We both know that the Clubs work.\n       Again, I want to thank you for your support and thank you \n     for joining with us in our efforts to do more for even more \n     kids.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 George Krupanski,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, prevention works. Giving kids an option \nworks. It works in my State of Delaware, and it works nationwide. The \npeople who recognize it most are the law enforcement community.\n  Let me give you a quote from William Bratton, former New York and now \nBoston Police Commissioner. Boston has had a phenomenal--phenomenal--\nsuccess in controlling murder rates, handguns with youth, and violent \ncrime. Here is what he said:\n\n       Those of us who have been on the front lines know that, in \n     the long run, winning the war on crime also will require \n     cutting the enemy's key supply line: its ability to turn kids \n     into criminals. Each day gangs and drug dealers assiduously \n     recruit our children for their army. To fight back, we have \n     to utilize other powerful crimefighting weapons--the proven \n     ``right-start'' programs and strategies that give kids the \n     armor of values, skills, and positive experiences to ward off \n     crime and violence.\n\n  This is one of the toughest cops in the Nation. He is saying the way \nwe keep this from happening is to go out there and engage in prevention \nactivities.\n  The Buffalo Police Commissioner--I will not go through it --eight \njuvenile justice directors, the National Association of Counties, say:\n\n       Be it resolved that not less than 25 percent of block grant \n     funds be set aside for prevention programs.\n\n  Prevention programs.\n  Police Executive Research Forum; the Catholic Charities of the United \nStates of America; Mark Klaas of the Klaas Foundation for Kids; Patrick \nMurphy, former police commissioner of New York, Detroit, Washington DC, \nand Syracuse; the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, \nwho is a tough crime-fighting guy --he says:\n\n       It's time to invest in the programs proven to cut the \n     enemy's most important supply line--its ability to turn kids \n     into criminals.\n\n  Prevention.\n  The U.S. Conference of Mayors; Los Angeles County District Attorney--\nthe list goes on. I will not take my colleagues' time, but I ask \nunanimous consent that their statements be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n What Police, Prosecutors, Crime Victims and Other Experts are Saying \n                   About How To Fight Youth Violence\n\n     170 Police Chiefs, Sheriffs & Prosecutors, the Presidents of \n         the Fraternal Order of Police and International Union of \n         Police Associations, and Leaders of Crime Victim \n         Organizations\n       As police, prosecutors, and crime survivors, we struggle \n     every day against crime and its devastating impact.

Whether it emanates from the juvenile justice system \n     or from the community, from government agencies or from civil \n     institutions, from faith-based programs or secular ones, from \n     non-profits or for-profits or public/private partnerships, \n     from structural theorists or cultural theorists, from veteran \n     probation officers or applied econometricians, no policy, \n     program or intervention that fails to build meaningful \n     connections between responsible adults and at-risk young \n     people has worked or can.\n       [I]f we really care about getting a handle on our present \n     and impending youth crime and substance abuse problems, then \n     the time has come to proceed inductively building meaningful \n     connections between at-risk youth and responsible adults via \n     existing community-based programs; focusing on the highly \n     particular and often banal barriers to helping at-risk youth \n     in particular places with particular people at particular \n     times; having the money to fix a broken pipe that flooded the \n     inner-city church basement where a ``latch-key'' ministry \n     operates; finding a way to transport a young job-seeker from \n     a public housing site to a private job site; getting police \n     and probation officers in a particular neighborhood to work \n     together on a daily basis; funding an incremental expansion \n     of a well-established national or local mentoring program; \n     and so on.--Source: Address to the National District \n     Attorneys Association, July 14, 1997.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I realize I have kept us here a long time, \nbut I can think of nothing from my perspective that is more important.\n  By the way, parenthetically, with this surplus we are all arguing \nabout--whether or not we save Social Security, give tax cuts, spend it \non things--I still think we should take a significant portion of that \nsurplus over the years that is projected and invest it in the crime \ntrust fund, moving from 100,000 cops to 125,000 cops, writing a \njuvenile justice bill, doing the violence against women II legislation, \nand making sure--making sure--that we give local communities more \nflexibility in maintaining their Federal ability to keep the national \n125,000--I hope it will be--cops program alive. That is what we should \nbe spending our money on, in my view. I will get to that at another \ntime.\n  Let me conclude with the last important overall point. Many of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle have been saying, as I said, \nthat we do not really need to do more. In a report that I offered in \nDecember of 1995, I detailed the demographic time bomb which lies \nahead. And that demographic time bomb is this: 39 million children now \nyounger than the age of 10, all of these 39 million children are the \nchildren of the baby boomers.\n  Each of them stands on the edge of their teen years, exactly those \nyears that are most at risk of turning children to drugs and crime. \nThere are 39 million children about to enter the crime-committing, \ndrug-consuming years. And the implication of this baby ``boomerang'' as \nthe demographers call it, even if we do everything right, and at the \nrate which kids commit crimes--assuming we do everything right and the \nrate at which kids now commit crimes does not go up one one-hundredth \nof 1 percent--even if those things occurred, that there is absolutely \nno change in the rate of crime, we will have a 20-percent increase in \njuvenile murders by the year 2005, which will mean an increase of the \noverall murder toll by 5 percent, even if we do every single thing \nright and there is not one one-hundredth of 1 percent increase in the \nrate in which juveniles commit crime.\n  Why? Thirty-nine million children, the largest cadre of youth since \nmy parents were busy in World War II, about to enter their crime-\ncommitting years.\n  I see my friend standing. I have another 10 minutes or so. I will \nyield to him, but not yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No. Go ahead and finish, I say to my friend.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me speed this up.\n  Mr. LEAHY. We do have a number of people who want to speak on the \nsame subject.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be happy to yield the floor in a moment.\n  Clearly, most of the 39 million children in this baby boomerang will \nnever turn to crime and never turn to drugs. But equally clear, we will \nhave a rising number of at-risk children, at-risk children who are at \nrisk to turning to drugs, at risk of being the victims of violence, and \nat risk of turning to crime.\n  Let me offer two more figures to indicate the size of the problem we \nface in the next 10 years. Seventy-seven percent of women with high-\nschool-age children are working moms--77 percent. And all told, about \n14 million school-age children have working moms. In all likelihood, \nthis means that these 14 million children will be leaving school after \nschool, unless they come from affluent families, with no supervision \nafter school until mom gets home.\n  That is not a criticism of moms working, it is a criticism of our \nfailure to recognize the demographic change as well as the social \nchange that has taken place in America.\n  For the rising number of at-risk children, I believe we have to \ndiscuss what has become a dirty word among Washington politicians, even \nthough it is a word I hear over and over again from prosecutors and \npolice chiefs and people in the juvenile justice system and what their \nsolution to the violent problem is. It is prevention--prevention.\n  We must keep as many of these at-risk children as possible away from \ndrugs and crime in the first place. In the most practical terms, that \nmeans keeping kids busy and supervised from 3 o'clock in the afternoon \nuntil the dinner hour. Those 3 hours represent about 12 percent of the \nday, about 20 percent of the hours that our kids are awake; and 40 \npercent of all juvenile crime that is committed in America is in those \n3 hours.\n  That is why I strongly oppose--strongly oppose--the effort by my \nfriend from Alabama to undo the good work that our friends on the \nAppropriations Committee have done. And I just want to warn my \ncolleagues, as I was kidding one of the staff here, I do not speak \noften on the floor, but when I do, I guess I speak long.\n  But the truth of the matter is, there is nothing--nothing, nothing, \nnothing, nothing--more important to the economy, to the security, to \nthe safety of this country than what we are going to do to prevent \nthose at-risk youth who find themselves among those 39 million young \npeople under the age of 10; that nothing--nothing--will affect our \nstandard of living, our quality of life, more than how we deal with \nthat issue.\n  I will be back on this floor at a later date and, over the next \ncouple years, arguing that portions of that surplus that we are \npredicting will occur as a consequence of the policies of this \nadministration and Congress--balancing our budget and moving to \nsurplus--should be spent--should be spent--on crime prevention, crime \nenforcement, and on the prison system.\n  I thank my friend from Vermont for being so patient. And I thank my \ncolleagues. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I have had an interesting time listening to the Senator from Delaware \nwith his remarks about the purpose and intent of our amendment. I think \nin that regard he is in error. And I think we should talk about that.\n  First of all, the Fraternal Order of Police, whom he quoted, and the \nBoys & Girls Clubs, have supported the incentive block grants. I \ncertainly agree that prevention, intervention, and enforcement are the \nkeys to the effort to reduce juvenile crime.\n  And what is intervention? The experts are telling me--mental health \nworkers, drug abuse people, judges, probation officers whom I have \ntalked with at great length--tell me the most effective point of \nintervention is when a child has been arrested for some sort of \noffense, taken to the juvenile court, and answers to the judge and the \nprobation officer. His parents are involved. And if that child is found \nto be involved with drugs or other psychological or emotional problems \nthat\n\n[[Page S8701]]\n\nmay be involved, that is the single best time to intervene and to \nprevent them from future criminal conduct that not only makes victims \nout of innocent young children, who are most often the victims of other \njuvenile offenders, but also prevents that child perhaps from heading \ndown a life of crime that would leave them serving long periods of time \nin prison.\n  And the Senator says these programs that I have cited are not \nprevention programs. I find that really stunning, to say a homeless \nyouth program, a program designed to deal with homeless youth, isn't a \ncrime prevention program. It surprises me to hear him say that.\n\n  Mental health programs, he suggested, are not prevention programs. Or \nchildren who are victims of abuse as a child, programs that deal with \nthat certainly are prevention programs. By the way, our amendment does \nnot affect any of these programs. They all continue.\n  The Foster Grandparent Program, I suggest, is a way to prevent \nchildren from being involved in crime. Art for Youth--that is what the \nart people tell me, ``We need more programs to help these young people \nexpress themselves,'' and that would help prevent them from a life of \ncrime. At-Risk Youth Program, certainly those are prevention programs. \nI just say we have many prevention programs.\n  In fact, we have none dedicated to law enforcement. The fact that the \nDepartment of Justice spends several billions of dollars on law \nenforcement should not be in any way considered to have an impact on \nyouth crime, because the truth is the Federal Government does not deal \nwith juvenile criminals. They probably prosecute less than 100 a year \nin all the Federal courts in America, certainly less than a couple \nhundred. It is just not done. Juvenile crime is dealt with in the State \nsystems. That is where we have the crisis. That is where we need to do \nsomething about it.\n  The Senator from Delaware is most eloquent in advocating after-school \nprograms. For who? Under what circumstances? How much will we spend on \nthem? Which agency should administer that? I suggest without any \nhesitation that the Department of Justice doesn't need to be the agency \nhandling an after-school program. That ought to be done through the \neducational establishment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I think local authorities should make that \njudgment. They should decide. I don't think you should discriminate, \nwhether it is at risk or not at risk. It should be after-school \nprograms in which everyone is entitled to participate. Let the States \nmake those decisions, not us; but let's spend the money.\n  My point is, spend money on after-school programs. All of the other \nprograms the Senator listed do impact indirectly on youth violence. The \nproblem is, 14 million kids with nothing to do for 3 hours, where 40 \npercent of the crime is committed. None of those programs are directed \nat that. We don't deal with that. We don't deal with the problem, in my \nopinion.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand the Senator's concern, \npassion, and emotional commitment to that problem of 14 million kids, \nafter school, many of whom are unsupervised. I understand that.\n  But I believe if we are going to have an after-school program that \ndoesn't distinguish between at-risk kids and others, we are talking \nabout billions of dollars, tens of billions of dollars, an amount of \nmoney of which our program doesn't even scratch the surface; we are \ntalking $50 million, is what we are talking about. How can we best use \nthat $50 million in some sort of vague, generalized program?\n  Let me read to you again what this statute would dispense under the \ngrant for prevention programs: for recreational services, tutoring \nprograms, assessment in work awareness skills. JJTPA, the job program \nfor youth, isn't that a prevention program, $1 billion spent on that? \nCertainly tries to help young people who are out of work and who have \nnever worked before get a job. That is a prevention program. We are \nspending $1.1 billion on that.\n  What we need to do is deal with the youngsters who are coming into \ncontact with the juvenile justice system. If something isn't done about \nit, they are going to murder somebody or they are going to end up \ncommitting an armed robbery and having to serve 20 years, because they \nare certified as an adult because they committed a serious crime at age \n17 and they have to go off for 20 years. Had we had a juvenile justice \nsystem capable of intervening early--at 12, 13, 14 or 15, when they are \nbeing arrested again and again--they wouldn't be down there.\n  I have been there. I have talked to juvenile probation officers and \njudges who have dealt with this on a daily basis. I am telling you, the \nJuvenile Judges Association in this country endorses this block grant \nprogram wholeheartedly. They know that is what we need to do. We need \nto be dealing with the kids who are most at risk, the ones already \ncoming into contact with juvenile justice.\n  This plan to spend $50 million more on this program is political. \nThat is what it is. It is a political game. We are going to create a \nconfrontation on the floor and we are going to say we care about \nchildren, we want to prevent them from crime, and we are going to spend \nmore on all of these programs; this wide open deal--it has no goals, no \nstandards, no real teeth to it--spend the money on anything in the \nworld. That is on what we want to spend our money. Everybody who has \nany support for the law enforcement community doesn't like kids, \ndoesn't want to see them change, doesn't care about prevention. All you \nguys want to lock them up.\n\n  Some children need to be locked up. I just told the Members of this \nbody about the three kids who murdered a night watchman--7, 7, and 15 \nprior arrests for those kids. They would have been better, that night \nwatchman and his family, would have been better if the court system had \nenough resources to intervene effectively at that point in time.\n  That is not mean. That is not unkind. That is not a kind of response \nthat is insensitive. You simply cannot allow repeat, dangerous young \noffenders to be released time after time after time with nothing more \nthan vague programs like this to deal with it.\n  Do you think that juvenile judge who has given his life to dealing \nwith kids, do you think that juvenile probation officer who has been \nworking with them all of his life, doesn't care about them? Do you \nthink they are not going to try to craft a program that would help \nthose children? I am telling you, that is what is happening in America \nwhere there is sufficient resources for it. Some of them have to be \nincarcerated.\n  One of the greatest success stories is in Boston, MA. You have heard \nabout the Boston Miracle. They did two things. They targeted their \nresources. A professor from the University of Maryland advised the \nDepartment of Justice, ``If you want to reduce crime, target your \nresources on the groups and the people who need it the most, primarily \nthose who have been arrested.'' But in Boston they took the high crime \ncommunities, the areas where there were gangs, they confronted the gang \nmembers and told them if they did not change their lifestyle, they \nwould be prosecuted. The judges backed them up. They locked up those \nwho were the leaders and the others quit being so active. The murder \nrate plummeted. It was dramatic what they had done.\n  My staff member went there and visited with them in Boston. She said, \n``Do you have a place to put them when they violate probation and \ncurfew,'' and they said, ``Yes, that was a commitment on behalf of the \ncommunity.''\n  So we are giving resources to the juvenile justice system to set \naside the kind of detention facilities, alternative schools, safe \nhouses, whatever they feel is necessary to be able to remove that kid, \ndiscipline them for repeat offenses, and change their lifestyle.\n  But it is important they not be left on the street, leading a bunch \nof other kids down the wrong path. If you get rid of the main leaders, \na lot of the other kids will cease to be involved in a life of crime.\n  What kind of a message does it send if the police arrest a youngster \nfor the fourth time for an armed robbery or a car theft and nothing \nhappens to him? What kind of moral message is that? This prevention \ngrant program they want to spend $50 million on says one\n\n[[Page S8702]]\n\nof the goals is to teach that people are and should be held accountable \nto their actions. Well, I agree with that. We are not saying that the \nfirst time a youngster gets in trouble they need to be certified as an \nadult or sent off for a long period of time, but they need to be \nconfronted seriously. They have to have a serious confrontation with \ntheir own immoral, illegal act. Their parents need to be involved in \nthat. They need to have counseling programs, drug testing, drug \ntreatment, and other activities and programs designed to insist that \nthey get on the right track.\n  Judges and drug treatment people tell me that it is extraordinarily \nhelpful when a person who has violated the law is under the gun of the \njudge. In other words, he can say you will go to that treatment \nprogram. We are going to drug test you. I expect you to stay drug free. \nI expect you to be back in school. I expect you to be home at night. In \nBoston, I expect you to follow the curfew I am going to give you.\n  Boston has a curfew. They call it Operation Night Light. And street \npolice officers go out and knock on the door at 8 or 9 o'clock, or \nwhenever the curfew is, to see if that youngster is there. If he is not \nthere, something happens to him or her. They don't just forget it. That \nis not happening all over America. What is happening all over America--\nand I was there for 15 years as a prosecutor--is they come in and meet \ntheir probation officer. Some of them have family meetings for 2 or 3 \nweeks; they meet with parents and try to turn them around. But because \nof lack of resources, they say ``your curfew is 9 o'clock,'' but they \ndon't check. Nobody is checking on these children. They do what they \nwant to, basically, unless they get caught on another offense.\n\n  If we want to prevent crime, if we want to intervene--and \nintervention is one of the legs of this way to defeat crime, according \nto the Fraternal Order of Police--if we do that effectively, we can \nbegin to change people. For those who want change, they simply cannot \nbe allowed to travel in the community and threaten the lives and health \nof other people with impunity. We have to have spaces to put them. Our \nbill provides matching money that States can use, if they choose, to \nexpand their detention capacity. And it doesn't have to be bars; it can \nbe any kind of facility that would allow the judge to detain them and \nnot allow them to just walk free--although some of them need to be \nlocked up behind bars.\n  Let me share this number with you. Since 1980, adult prison space in \nAmerica has more than tripled. Adult crime has been dropping now for \nsome time now to a significant degree. I am convinced that one of the \nreasons for that is because we are doing a better job of identifying \nthe repeat dangerous offenders, and they are serving longer periods of \ntime. They are not corrupting others around them, and they are not out \non the street committing crimes. Many repeat offenders--we know, \naccording to a Rand study--commit as many as 200 crimes per year. You \nmay say that is ridiculous, they don't commit 200 crimes per year. \nWell, that is four burglaries a week. Many commit four in one night. \nThese repeat offenders commit a substantial amount of the crime in \nAmerica. And the same is true with juveniles. We simply have to \nidentify those, and some of them are going to have to be incarcerated.\n  But while we were tripling the adult prison space in America, let me \nshare this with you. In 1978, there were 56,000 beds in juvenile \ndetention facilities in America. In 1994, during a period when violent \njuvenile crime has more than doubled--I am talking about armed robbery, \nassault with intent to murder, murder; those kinds of things were \ndoubling and more than doubling during that period, and we had gone on \nfrom 56,000 to 61,000 bed spaces by 1994.\n  Do you see what happened? We poured our resources into adult \ncriminality and we made a big impact. But we didn't respond \nappropriately to juvenile crime. We did not expand our commitment \nthere. We did not give the judges and probation officers the resources \nneeded to intervene effectively, to monitor these youngsters who need \nclose monitoring, because they are on the edge and they can go either \nway. They didn't give them those resources, and as a result, juvenile \ncrime continued to go up, while adult crime was declining.\n  (Mr. BURNS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased that we are beginning to \nsee a modest reduction in juvenile crime--although many experts are \ntelling us that, with the demographics of more teenagers being in the \ncrime-prone years, in the next few years we can expect those numbers to \nedge back up. I think one reason is that since 1994 States have begun \nto focus on juvenile crime and commit more resources to it. It is \nbeginning to have an affect.\n  It is a myth and not true that we have no ability to affect crime. \nThat is not true. Somebody said that we are going to end up putting \neverybody in jail. Well, everybody doesn't rob; everybody doesn't \nburglarize. We ought to do something serious to everybody who commits a \nserious crime. If we do so promptly and effectively, with wisdom, in a \nsmart way, we can affect the crime rate, and we can make the lives of \nAmericans safer. We ought to do that.\n  To me, there is no higher function of a government than to make its \ncitizens safe in their communities, on their streets, in their homes, \nand where they go to work. What higher function could a government have \nthan that? We have failed in that regard. I have seen it, and I have \ntalked with the judges. That is why the Fraternal Order of Police, the \nJudges' Association, and the Boys and Girls Club support this project.\n  Our proposal--unlike the one set forth in the statute already, in \nwhich they are adding $50 million--is targeted to deal with \ncriminality. Their proposal, again, is for leadership development \nactivities, recreational services, teaching that people are and should \nbe accountable for their actions. Well, there is nothing wrong with \nthose goals, but that is not a very good crime proposal, in my opinion. \nI have been there. I have prosecuted crimes, I have dealt with every \naspect of it. That is not the way to deal with crime. That is not \ntargeted at all. That says you can spend the money on any doggone thing \nyou want to spend it on.\n  Our proposal--the block grant proposal--was developed along with the \nsupport of Senator Biden from Delaware and others. And we had input and \ndiscussions with the ranking member from Vermont on the Judiciary \nCommittee. Everybody had some input. They may not agree with everything \nin it, but it is focused on crime prevention, intervention and \nenforcement. By the way, the Senator from Delaware mentions $1 billion \nin prevention programs. He admits that. We only have $100 million in \nthis enforcement program.\n  By the way, also in this bill the chairman has brought out is a new \n$220 million for a safe schools initiative. It is designed to build \npartnerships in the communities between police and schools and to try \nto make schools safer. That is $220 million in new money in another \nprogram designed that way. What we have left out, I am telling you--I \ncan't tell you how strongly I believe this; I know it in my heart--what \nwe are leaving out is the greatest engine for reducing juvenile crime, \nand that is the juvenile court system. They are the ones that are \ninnovating at the most basic level, when kids are out of control. They \nhave the capacity to effectively order them to do things they don't \nwant to do, and to monitor those orders if we give them the support \nnecessary.\n  So if we put the money into the block grant program, it would enhance \nprosecution and define opportunities to effectuate the bipartisan \nagreement that we have to support graduated sanctions or increase \nlevels of punishment for repeat offenders. It would provide for short-\nterm confinement for those who need it. Some do. It will also provide \nfor the incarceration of violent repeat offenders for more extended \nperiods. Not all the money would be for that; only 40 percent would be \nfor that.\n  It would provide moneys for programs that require juvenile \ndelinquents to pay restitution. It would provide programs to require \njuvenile offenders to complete schooling in vocational training. Is \nthat a prevention program, or not? Is that a program that doesn't care \nabout kids, or not? Does anybody deny that we need to have some \nchildren go into custody of some fashion? I doubt that. It has programs \nto require young juveniles to pay their child support. They ought to \nsupport their children. They bring them into this world.\n\n[[Page S8703]]\n\n  Programs to curb truancy. The Senator from Delaware says we need to \ndo something about truancy. I agree, absolutely. Truancy is a key \nsignal that a child is out of control. School systems, police \ndepartments, and others ought to have an intensive effort to identify \ntruancy at the earliest level.\n  His bill, if they want to put $50 million more in, doesn't have \nanything about truancy in it. The program I support does. It provides \nprograms that seek to curb truancy by name. Then it has programs to \ncollect records, drug testing of youngsters, juvenile crime prevention \nprograms, and night curfews. Antidrug programs could be funded under \nthis.\n  We have programs to deal with habitual offenders; programs targeted \nat youth gang members, trying to break them up; and programs to train \nlaw enforcement officers, juvenile judges, prosecutors, probation \nofficers, and other court personnel in how to better deal with \nchildren.\n  We have $50 million on the table. That is what we have--$50 million \nsitting there. Do you want to put it in this bogus program that has no \nstandards, can be spent for anything, or a program carefully crafted, \ncarefully crafted to identify those youngsters who need help, and get \nit to them in a way that will reduce crime?\n  I am sorry if I feel strongly about it. But I have been involved in \nit for a long time. And I have worked hard on this committee. I am \nabsolutely convinced that this is a valid program. We have many \nprevention programs. This has much of a prevention aspect to it. But \nwhat we don't have any money for is to strengthen our enforcement \naspect.\n  Mr. President, this is a critical issue to me. It is the overlook \naspect of crime in America: How can we most effectively intervene and \nchange the lifestyle of these youngsters? Too often they are coming in \nfor vandalism, petty theft, maybe for burglary, maybe for a household \nburglary, a car theft. And they come in and get involved in some other \nserious crime, are treated as an adult, and sent off for 15 years in \nthe slammer. If we could have intervened for the first offense or two \neffectively, sometimes they might have been well served if they had \nbeen sent to jail or detained a few days. If we had intervened \neffectively there, we would have fewer crime victims and less need for \nhousing for a youngster who became a career criminal and ended up \nserving a long time in jail.\n  Mr. President, that is the purpose of our amendment. I believe it \nmeets all the standards for prevention, and for enforcement, and for \nintervention. I think it is the right way to go.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. It would \nsignificantly cut the proposed funding for an effective prevention \nprogram, known as Title V. And it would undermine this bill's balanced \napproach between prevention and enforcement.\n  Let me explain why we should support this program.\n  First, it is truly bipartisan. It was originally drafted in 1992 by \nSenator Brown and myself. Last year, the full Senate supported \nincreasing its funding level from $20 million to $75 million. And this \nyear, with the support of Senators Campbell, Specter and Reid, its \nfunding level is $70 million. Although on its face it gets $95 million, \n$25 million is set aside for a separate anti-drinking program. So if we \ncut $50 million, Title V gets the same $20 million it gets every year--\nand there will be no increase.\n  Second, it relies on local communities--who know their needs better \nthan the federal government--to identify solutions tailored to local \nneeds. Let me tell you about some of these programs which get funding \nin Wisconsin.\n  In Madison, Title V funds an after-school program for junior and high \nschool age at-risk youth living in targeted low income neighborhoods. \nIn Racine, it funds home visits by social workers and prenatal and \npostnatal education to mothers in low-income neighborhoods. In \nJefferson County, it supports a program that works with school \nbullies--and their victims--to reduce school violence.\n  And these kinds of innovative programs are supported by Title V all \nover the nation. For example, in Senator Sessions' home state of \nAlabama, a Title V program in Tuscaloosa, has--according to its \norganizers--``made a significant impact in the incidence of juvenile \nviolence and crime.''\n  Under Title V, communities qualify for funds only if they establish \nlocal boards to design long-term strategies for combating juvenile \ncrime, and if they match federal funds with a 50 percent local \ncontribution. Local communities know what works, and they don't throw \ngood money after bad.\n  Finally, Title V works. Nearly 400 participating communities--from 49 \nstates--believe in this program so much that, according to the GAO, \nthey've matched federal money almost dollar-for-dollar--far more than \nthe 50 percent match this program requires. And studies confirm that \nmany of these programs have reduced crime in cities across the nation, \nincluding cities like Cincinnati, Ohio and Woodbury, Iowa.\n  Mr. President, it's a good idea to get rid of prevention programs \nthat don't work. In fact, I authored legislation that resulted in a \nvery controversial study by the Justice Department, which said that \nmany prevention programs don't work. And with Senator Cohen I \nintroduced legislation to junk bad prevention programs and consolidate \nmany others. But we should keep and expand the programs that do work--\nespecially ones like Title V that use federal dollars to inspire local \naction and local contributions.\n  Mr. President, I oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I could respond at some length to the \ncomments made by the Senator from Alabama. His intensity of concern and \nhis legitimate efforts, which have been extraordinary in the area of \njuvenile justice, are something that I admire. He obviously has strong \nfeelings expressed by the Senator from Delaware.\n  I know that there are a number of other Senators who wish to speak on \nthis issue to express their thoughts. But I have had the courtesy of a \nnumber of Senators who have come up to me and said they would withhold \ntheir statements because there is a group of Members who wish to get \ndown to the White House for the bill signing on the IRS, which is a \nfairly significant bill. I would like to get this vote completed before \nthat occurs.\n  Let me simply say that I believe this is an extraordinarily balanced \napproach. We have eventually divided the money between prevention and \nincarceration, for the lack of a better term. It is an attempt to \naddress both sides of the issue of juvenile justice within this bill. \nYes, there are other programs outside of this bill that address both \nsides. In fact, there is a lot more incarceration money in this bill \nthat wasn't talked about. But the fact is that this is a very balanced \napproach, both sets of programs are extremely credible, and we will \nmove forward on the issue that we are concerned about, which is trying \nto reduce juvenile crime, which is clearly one of the major issues \nfacing this country today.\n  Mr. President, at this time I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire to lay on the table the amendment of the \nSenator from Alabama. On this question, the yeas and nays have been \nordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 64, nays 36, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 220 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--64\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n\n[[Page S8704]]\n\n\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--36\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3245) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the managers of the legislation are trying \ntheir best to move this bill along. Senator Daschle and I have been \nworking trying to keep extraneous amendments off of this bill, \namendments that are not really related to it, strictly legislating on \nthis appropriations bill. We have had some success over here, and, \nobviously, there has been an effort and success on the Democratic side. \nAs usual, the longer we go, the longer the list of amendments. We need \nto get some finite list of amendments and work on this bill to get it \ncompleted.\n  It is my intent, after discussion with Senator Daschle and the \nmanagers, Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings, that we complete this \nbill tonight and that we have votes tonight, as late as is necessary.\n  Everybody needs to know that this is not going to be a night where we \nall leave at 7 o'clock and the managers try to make things happen and \nnothing happens. We are going to be voting into the night. If it takes \ngoing to 11, 12 or 1 o'clock, I think it is time we have to do that in \norder to complete this work.\n  In that vein, I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments \nbe the only remaining list of first-degree----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished leader yield? I have to check \ntwo other things. We are not prepared to agree to that.\n  Mr. LOTT. I had the impression we had cleared this on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Not on this side, not yet.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator Daschle is aware we are going to try to lock in the \nlist. I must say, the list is 70 amendments, not exactly a great \nachievement.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. We can clear it after a while, but I am not ready to \nagree right now.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if it helps, if the distinguished leader \nwishes to check that, I have a brief comment I want to make about this \nlast vote. I will be willing to do that and you can check that.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, why don't we do that. We will withhold while \nwe can run our checks then. The Senator from Vermont can comment and, \nhopefully, we can get it worked out.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I ask the majority leader a question? May I inquire \nof the majority leader if there has been any further progress in \nestablishing a time when we are going to consider the Patients' Bill of \nRights legislation? I know there have been communications between----\n  Mr. LOTT. We are ready to go. We have our bill. I think we have a \ngood bill. Senator Kennedy has his bill. I would like for us to just \nhave a vote on his bill and a vote on our proposal. I understand that \nyou feel you have solutions we need in this area. We feel very good \nabout our bill.\n  The problem has been last week, for instance, it was suggested, \n``Well, we will need 40 amendments.'' If we have these bills that have \njust been sent down on both sides, why don't we vote on what we have \ninstead of going on for days and weeks trying to reach a conclusion?\n  Having said that, Senator Daschle and I have continued to talk to try \nto narrow down exactly when would be the best time to do it. We are \ntalking about how we can get an agreement with which both sides can be \nsatisfied. Obviously, the Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, \nwants to be involved in what the final unanimous-consent request will \nbe, and a lot of Senators on this side, including Senator Gramm, will \nhave an interest in it.\n  I think we can come up with a reasonable proposal. I have been \nsending proposals since June 18, for a month. I continue to say, ``OK, \nhow about this?'' And Senator Daschle has responded. I know he is \nnegotiating in good faith. Both of us have a difficult time trying to \nsatisfy Senators on both sides of this issue on both sides of the \naisle, but we are narrowing them.\n  If we can get an agreement to a time certain that it will come up, \nwith a couple of days for debate and for discussion of amendments or a \nlimited number of amendments on both sides, that will be perfectly \nreasonable. But I know of no bill in the history of mankind that needs \n40 or 50 or 70 amendments. Why do we want to go through that process? A \nreasonable number can be agreed to.\n  All I have to say is, just say yes. We are ready to do what the \nSenator from Massachusetts asked for a month ago. You get a vote, we \nget a vote and we move on. Yes; just say yes, we will do that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am just wondering if it is the intention of the \nmajority leader to schedule this. We are into Wednesday of this week. \nIs it his intention to afford us an adequate opportunity to debate \nthese issues prior to the time of the break?\n  Mr. LOTT. It is certainly my hope. We are working to try to get that \nagreed to. In fact, it has been my plan to do that, and I am going to \nbe disappointed if we can't get it agreed to. I know there is good \nfaith on Senator Daschle's part; there is on mine. We will just keep \nworking until we get it done.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3245\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his courtesy \nearlier. I will be very brief. Any time we speak of juvenile justice, \nthere are, obviously, emotional issues that come up, as there was on \nthis. But I believe the Senate has voted the proper way on the motion \nof the distinguished senior Senator from New Hampshire to table the \namendment.\n  We can all tell horror stories of juvenile justice. One that came to \nmy mind while listening to the lengthy debate this morning is a case \nwhen I was State's attorney. A man I knew well died as he was telling \nme who killed him. It was a juvenile. As he described it, we were in \nthe emergency room and doctors were trying to save his life. I was \nthere as the chief law enforcement officer of the county. And heard him \ntell me who the juvenile was who killed him. So we can all tell \nterrible stories.\n\n  What I also know, though, from my experience in law enforcement, and \nfrom law enforcement experts I have talked with today all over the \ncountry, is that prevention is still the best way to stop juvenile \ncrimes. It is almost axiomatic. And we have a good funding method that \nthe distinguished senior Senator from New Hampshire and the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina have put together in this \nbill, and we should keep with that formula.\n  Had this amendment not been tabled, we would have had these juvenile \nprevention moneys--we would have had 35 percent going to building \nfacilities and information-sharing programs, 45 percent into more \njudges and probation officers and prosecutors and technology and \ncourts, and so forth.\n  The fact is, we are getting a handle on juvenile crime in this \ncountry, but we are doing it through prevention programs. All the \npolice officers I have talked with in my State, and all the police \nofficers I have talked with elsewhere, tell me the same thing: Better \nand more prevention programs to stop juvenile crime.\n  Among my duties as a prosecutor was to represent the State in the \nmost active juvenile court in our State. Nearly a third of the juvenile \ncases in our State went through there. Over and over and over again, I \nsaw the tragedy of juvenile crimes occurring because there had not been \nprevention programs. We did the right thing in this vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n[[Page S8705]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 3252\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for mental health screening and treatment for \n                        incarcerated offenders)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3252.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n         On page 51, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 121. MENTAL HEALTH SCREENING AND TREATMENT FOR \n                   PRISONERS.\n\n       (a) Additional Requirements for the Use of Funds Under the \n     Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Grants \n     Program.--Section 20105(b) of the Violent Crime Control and \n     Law Enforcement Act of 1994 is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(b) Additional Requirements.--\n       ``(1) Eligibility for grant.--To be eligible to receive a \n     grant under section 20103 or 20104, a State shall, not later \n     than January 1, 1999, have a program of mental health \n     screening and treatment for appropriate categories of \n     convicted juvenile and other offenders during periods of \n     incarceration and juvenile and criminal justice supervision, \n     that is consistent with guidelines issued by the Attorney \n     General.\n       ``(2) Use of funds.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this subtitle, amounts made available to a State under \n     section 20103 or 20104 may be applied to the costs of \n     programs described in paragraph (1), consistent with \n     guidelines issued by the Attorney General.\n       ``(B) Additional use.--In addition to being used as \n     specified in subparagraph (A), the funds referred to in that \n     subparagraph may be used by a State to pay the costs of \n     providing to the Attorney General a baseline study on the \n     mental health problems of juvenile offenders and prisoners in \n     the State, which study shall be consistent with guidelines \n     issued by the Attorney General.''.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Chris \nSchoenbauer, an intern, and Ellen Gerrity, a fellow, be allowed to be \non the floor during the debate on this piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment--and I \nthank both Senator Hollings and Senator Gregg for their support--that \nwould allow States to use Federal prison construction moneys for mental \nhealth treatment in our Nation's adult and juvenile corrections \nfacilities--allow States; States make that decision.\n  I am a Senator from the State of Minnesota. Hubert Humphrey, a great \nSenator from Minnesota, once said:\n\n       The moral test of government is how the government treats \n     those who are in the dawn of life, children; those who are in \n     the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the \n     shadows of life --the sick, the needy, and the handicapped.\n\n  Today, throughout America, we are failing the moral test of how we \ntreat adults and children. I want to focus on children in mental \nhealth, in the criminal and juvenile justice system, too many of whom \nlive in the shadow of mental illness.\n  According to a recent article in the New York Times by Fox \nButterfield--this was a front page piece. The title of it is ``Profits \nat a Juvenile Prison Come With a Chilling Cost.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this very fine piece of journalism be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York times, July 15, 1998]\n\n         Profits at a Juvenile Prison Come With a Chilling Cost\n\n                          (By Fox Butterfield)\n\n       Tallulah, LA.--Here in the middle of the impoverished \n     Mississippi Delta is a juvenile prison so rife with \n     brutality, cronyism and neglect that many legal experts say \n     it is the worst in the nation.\n       The prison, the Tallulah Correctional Center for Youth, \n     opened just four years ago where a sawmill and cotton fields \n     once stood. Behind rows of razor wire it houses 620 boys and \n     young men age 11 to 20, in stifling corrugated-iron barracks \n     jammed with bunks.\n       From the run-down homes and bars on the road that runs by \n     it, Tallulah appears unexceptional, one new cookie-cutter \n     prison among scores built in the United States this decade. \n     But inside, inmates of the privately run prison regularly \n     appear at the infirmary with black eyes, broken noses or jaws \n     or perforated eardrums from beatings by the poorly paid, \n     poorly trained guards or from fights with other boys.\n       Meals are so meager that many boys lose weight. Clothing is \n     so scarce that boys fight over shirts and shoes. Almost all \n     the teachers are uncertified, instruction amounts to as \n     little as an hour a day, and until recently there were no \n     books.\n       Up to a fourth of the inmates are mentally ill or retarded, \n     but a psychiatrist visits only one day a week. There is no \n     therapy. Emotionally disturbed boys who cannot follow guards' \n     orders are locked in isolation cells for weeks at a time or \n     have their sentences arbitrarily extended.\n       These conditions, which are described in public documents \n     and were recounted by inmates and prison officials during a \n     reporter's visit to Tallulah, are extreme, a testament to \n     Louisiana's well-documented violent history and notoriously \n     brutal prison system.\n       But what has happened at Tallulah is more than just the \n     story of one bad prison. Corrections officials say the forces \n     that converged to create Tallulah--the incarceration of more \n     and more mentally ill adolescents, a rush by politicians to \n     build new prisons while neglecting education and \n     psychiatric services, and states' handing responsibility \n     for juvenile offenders to private companies--have caused \n     the deterioration of juvenile prisons across the country.\n       Earl Dunlap, president of the National Juvenile Detention \n     Association, which represents the heads of the nation's \n     juvenile jails, said, ``The issues of violence against \n     offenders, lack of adequate education and mental health, of \n     crowding and of poorly paid and poorly trained staff are the \n     norm rather than the exception.''\n       Recognizing the problem, the United States Justice \n     Department has begun a series of investigations into state \n     juvenile systems, including not only Louisiana's but also \n     those of Kentucky, Puerto Rico and Georgia. At the same time, \n     private juvenile prisons in Colorado, Texas and South \n     Carolina have been successfully sued by individuals and \n     groups or forced to give up their licenses.\n       On Thursday, the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana, an \n     offshoot of the Southern Poverty Law Center, filed a Federal \n     lawsuit against Tallulah to stop the brutality and neglect.\n       In the investigations by the Justice Department, some of \n     the harshest criticism has been leveled at Georgia. The \n     department threatened to take over the state's juvenile \n     system, charging a ``pattern of egregious conditions \n     violating the Federal rights of youth,'' including the use of \n     pepper spray to restrain mentally ill youth, a lack of \n     textbooks, and guards who routinely stripped young inmates \n     and locked them in their cells for days.\n       A surge in the inmate population forced Georgia's juvenile \n     prison budget up to $220 million from $80 million in just \n     four years, but the money went to building new prisons, with \n     little left for education and psychiatric care. ``As we went \n     through a period of rapid increase in juvenile crime and \n     record numbers of juvenile offenders,'' said Sherman Day, \n     chairman of the Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice, it \n     was ``much easier to get new facilities from the Legislature \n     than to get more programs.''\n       After reacting defensively at first, Gov. Zell Miller moved \n     quickly to avert a takeover by agreeing to spend $10 million \n     more this year to hire teachers and medical workers and to \n     increase guard salaries.\n       Louisiana, whose juvenile system is made up of Tallulah and \n     three prisons operated by the state, is the Justice \n     Department's latest target. In hundreds of pages of reports \n     to a Federal judge who oversees the state's entire prison \n     system under a 1971 consent decree, Justice Department \n     experts have depicted guards who routinely resort to beatings \n     or pepper spray as their only way to discipline inmates, and \n     who pit inmates against one another for sport.\n       In June, two years after the Justice Department began its \n     investigation and a year after it warned in its first public \n     findings that Tallulah was ``an institution out of control,'' \n     consultants for the department filed new reports with the \n     Federal judge, Frank J. Polozola of Federal District Court in \n     Baton Rouge, warning that despite some improvements, \n     conditions had deteriorated to ``a particularly dangerous \n     level.''\n       Even a former warden at Louisiana's maximum-security \n     prison, acting as a consultant to Judge Polozola, found \n     conditions at Tallulah so serious that he urged the judge to \n     reject its request to add inmates.\n       ``I do not make these recommendations because of any \n     sympathy for these offenders,'' wrote the former warden, John \n     Whitley. ``It shocks me to think'' that ``these offenders and \n     their problems are simply getting worse, and these problems \n     will be unleashed on the public when they are discharged from \n     the system.''\n       Some of the worst conditions in juvenile prisons can be \n     found among the growing number of privately operated prisons, \n     whether those built specifically for one state, like \n     Tallulah, or ones that take juveniles from across the \n     country, like boot camps that have come under criticism in \n     Colorado and Arizona.\n       Only 5 percent of the nation's juvenile prisons are \n     operated by private, for-profit companies, Mr. Dunlap of the \n     National Juvenile Detention Association estimates. But as\n\n[[Page S8706]]\n\n     their numbers grow along with privately operated prisons for \n     adults, their regulation is becoming one of the most \n     significant issues in corrections. State corrections \n     departments find themselves having to police contractors who \n     perform functions once the province of government, from \n     psychiatric care to discipline.\n       In April, Colorado officials shut down a juvenile prison \n     operated by the Rebound Corporation after a mentally ill 13-\n     year-old's suicide led to an investigation that uncovered \n     repeated instances of physical and sexual abuse. The for-\n     profit prison housed offenders from six states.\n       Both Arizona and California authorities are investigating a \n     privately operated boot camp in Arizona that California paid \n     to take hundreds of offenders. A 16-year-old boy died there, \n     and authorities suspect the cause was abuse by guards and \n     poor medical care. California announced last Wednesday that \n     it was removing its juveniles from the camp.\n       And recently Arkansas canceled the contract of Associated \n     Marine Institutes, a company based in Florida, to run one \n     juvenile institution, following questions of financial \n     control and accusations of abuse.\n       A series of United States Supreme Court decisions and state \n     laws have long mandated a higher standard for juvenile \n     prisons than for adult prisons. There is supposed to be more \n     schooling, medical care and security because the young \n     inmates have been adjudged delinquent, rather than convicted \n     of crimes as adults are, and so are held for rehabilitation \n     instead of punishment.\n       But what has made problems worse here is that Tallulah, to \n     earn a profit, has scrimped on money for education and mental \n     health treatment in a state that already spends very little \n     in those areas.\n       ``It's incredibly perverse,'' said David Utter, director of \n     the Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana. ``They have this \n     place that creates all these injuries and they have all these \n     kids with mental disorders, and then they save money by not \n     treating them.''\n       Bill Roberts, the lawyer for Tallulah's owner, Tans-\n     American Development Associates, said that some of the \n     Justice Department's demands like hiring more psychiatrists, \n     are ``unrealistic.'' The state is to blame for the problems, \n     he said, because ``our place was not designed to take that \n     kind of inmate.''\n       Still, Mr. Roberts said, ``There has been a drastic \n     improvement'' in reducing brutality by guards. As for fights \n     between the inmates, he said, ``Juveniles are a little bit \n     different from adults. You are never going to stop all fights \n     between boys.''\n       In papers filed with Judge Polozola on July 7 responding to \n     the Justice experts and Mr. Whitley, the State Attorney \n     General's office disputed accusations of brutality and of \n     high numbers of retarded and mentally ill inmates at \n     Tallulah.\n       In a recent interview, Cheney Joseph, executive counsel to \n     Gov. Mike Foster, warned there were limits to what Louisiana \n     was willing to do. ``There are certain situations the \n     Department of Justice would like us to take care of,'' he \n     said, ``that may not be financially feasible and may not be \n     required by Federal law.''\n       The idea for a prison here was put forward in 1992 by James \n     R. Brown, a Tallulah businessman whose father was an \n     influential state senator.\n       One of the poorest areas in a poor state, Tallulah wanted \n     jobs, and like other struggling cities across the country it \n     saw the nation's prison-building spree as its best hope.\n       Louisiana needed a new juvenile prison because the number \n     of youths being incarcerated was rising steeply; within a few \n     years it more than doubled. Adding to that, mental health \n     experts say, were hundreds of juveniles who had no place else \n     to go because of cuts in psychiatric services outside of \n     jail. Mental health authorities estimate that 20 percent of \n     juveniles incarcerated nationally have serious mental \n     illnesses.\n       To help win a no-bid contract to operate a prison, the \n     company Mr. Brown formed included two close friends of Gov. \n     Edwin W. Edwards--George Fischer and Verdi Adam--said a \n     businessman involved in the venture's early stages, who spoke \n     on the condition of anonymity.\n       None of the men had any particular qualification to run a \n     prison. Mr. Verdi was a former chief engineer of the state \n     highway department. Mr. Fischer had been the Governor's \n     campaign manager, Cabinet officer and occasional business \n     partner.\n       Tallulah opened in 1994, and the town of 10,000 got what it \n     hoped for. The prison became its largest employer and \n     taxpayer.\n       From the beginning, the company formed by Mr. Brown, Trans-\n     American, pursued a strategy of maximizing its profit from \n     the fixed amount it received from the state for each inmate \n     (in 1997, $24,448). The plan was to keep wages and services \n     at a minimum while taking in as many inmates as possible, \n     said the businessman involved in the early stages.\n       For-profit prisons often try to economize. But the best-run \n     companies have come to recognize that operating with too \n     small or poorly trained staff can spell trouble, and experts \n     say state officials must pay close attention to the level of \n     services being provided.\n       ``Ultimately, the responsibility belongs to the state,'' \n     said Charles Thomas, director of the Private Corrections \n     Project at the University of Florida.\n       Louisiana officials say they monitored conditions at \n     Tallulah and first reported many of the problems there. But \n     in fiscal year 1996-97, according to the State Department of \n     Public Safety and Corrections, Tallulah still listed no money \n     for recreation, treatment or planning inmates' return to \n     society. Twenty-nine percent of the budget went to \n     construction loans.\n       By comparison, 45 percent of the $32,200 a year that \n     California spends on each juvenile goes to programs and \n     caseworkers, and none to construction. Nationally, \n     construction costs average 7 percent of juvenile prison \n     budgets, Mr. Dunlap said.\n       ``That means either that Tallulah's construction costs are \n     terribly inflated, or the services they are providing are \n     extraordinarily low,'' he said.\n       Part of Tallulah is a boot camp, with boys crammed so \n     tightly in barracks that there is room only for double bunks, \n     a television set and a few steel tables. Showers and urinals \n     are open to the room, allowing boys who have been \n     incarcerated for sexual assault to attack other inmates, \n     according to a report in June by a Justice Department \n     consultant, Dr. Bernard Hudson.\n       The only space for the few books that have recently been \n     imported to try to improve education is a makeshift shelf on \n     top of the urinals. Among the aging volumes that a reporter \n     saw were ``Inside the Third Reich,'' ``The Short Stories of \n     Henry James'' and ``Heidi.''\n       From their wakeup call at 5:30 A.M., the inmates, in white \n     T-shorts and loose green pants, spend almost all their time \n     confined to the barracks. They leave the barracks only for \n     marching drills, one to three hours a day of class and an \n     occasional game of basketball. There is little ventilation, \n     and temperatures in Louisiana's long summers hover \n     permanently in the 90's.\n       The result, several boys told a visitor, is that some of \n     them deliberately start trouble in order to be disciplined \n     and sent to the other section of Tallulah, maximum-security \n     cells that are air-conditioned.\n       Guards put inmates in solitary confinement so commonly that \n     in one week in May more than a quarter of all the boys spent \n     at least a day in ``Lockdown,'' said Nancy Ray, another \n     Justice Department expert. The average stay in solitary is \n     five to six weeks; some boys are kept indefinitely. While in \n     the tiny cells, the boys are stripped of all possessions and \n     lie on worn, thin mattresses resting on concrete blocks.\n       The crowding, heat and isolation are hardest on the 25 \n     percent of the boys who are mentally ill or retarded, said \n     Dr. Hudson, a psychiatrist, tending to increase their \n     depression or psychosis.\n       Although Tallulah has made some improvements in its \n     treatment of the emotionally disturbed over the last year, \n     Dr. Hudson said, it remains ``grossly inadequate.''\n       The prison still does not properly screen new arrivals for \n     mental illness or retardation, he reported. The part-time \n     doctor and psychiatrist are there so infrequently that they \n     have never met, Dr. Hudson said. Powerful anti-psychotic \n     medications are not monitored. Medical charts often cannot be \n     found.\n       And the infirmary is often closed because of a shortage of \n     guards, whose pay is so low--$5.77 an hour--that there has \n     been 100 percent turnover in the staff in the last year, the \n     Justice Department experts said.\n       Other juvenile prisons that have come under investigation \n     have also been criticized for poor psychiatric treatment. But \n     at Tallulah this neglect has been compounded by everyday \n     violence.\n       All these troubles are illustrated in the case of one \n     former inmate, Travis M., a slight 16-year-old who is \n     mentally retarded and has been treated with drugs for \n     hallucinations.\n       Sometimes, Travis said in an interview after his release, \n     guards hit him because his medication made him sleepy and he \n     did not stand to attention when ordered. Sometimes they \n     ``snuck'' him at night as he slept in his bunk, knocking him \n     to the cement floor. Sometimes they kicked him while he was \n     naked in the shower, telling him simply, ``You owe me some \n     licks,''\n       Travis was originally sentenced by a judge to 90 days for \n     shoplifting and stealing a bicycle. But every time he failed \n     to stand for a guard or even called his grandmother to \n     complain, officials at Tallulah put him in solitary and added \n     to his sentence.\n       After 15 months, a judge finally ordered him released so he \n     could get medical treatment. His eardrum had been perforated \n     in a beating by a guard, he had large scars on his arms, legs \n     and face, and his nose had been so badly broken that he \n     speaks in a wheeze. A lawyer is scheduled to file suit \n     against Tallulah on behalf of Travis this week.\n       One reason these abuses have continued, Mr. Utter said, is \n     that juveniles in Louisiana, as in a number of states, often \n     get poor legal representation. One mentally ill boy from \n     Eunice was sentenced without a lawyer, or even a trial. \n     Poorly paid public defenders seldom visit their clients after \n     sentencing, Mr. Utter said, and so are unaware of conditions \n     at places like Tallulah.\n       Another reason is that almost all Tallulah's inmates are \n     from poor families and 82 percent are black, Mr. Utter noted, \n     an imbalance that afflicts prisons nationwide to one degree \n     or another. ``They are disenfranchised and no one cares about \n     them,'' he said.\n       In September, Tallulah hired as its new warden David \n     Bonnette, a 25-year veteran of Angola State Penitentiary who \n     started there as a guard and rose to assistant \n     superintendent. A muscular, tobacco-chewing man with\n\n[[Page S8707]]\n\n     his initials tattooed on a forearm, Mr. Bonnette brought \n     several Angola colleagues with him to impose better \n     discipline.\n       ``When I got here, there were a lot of perforated \n     eardrums,'' he said. ``Actually, it seemed like everybody had \n     a perforated eardrum, or a broken nose.'' When boys wrote \n     complaints, he said, guards put the forms in a box and pulled \n     out ones to investigate at random. Some were labeled, ``Never \n     to be investigated.''\n       But allegations of abuse by guards dropped to 52 a month \n     this spring, from more than 100 a month last summer, Mr. \n     Bonnette said, as he has tried to carry out a new state \n     policy of zero tolerance for brutality. Fights between boys \n     have declined to 33 a month, from 129, he said.\n       In June, however, Ms. Ray, the Justice Department \n     consultant, reported that there had been a recent increase in \n     ``youth defiance and disobedience,'' with the boys angry \n     about Tallulah's ``exceptionally high'' use of isolation \n     cells.\n       Many guards have also become restive, the Justice \n     Department experts found, a result of poor pay and new \n     restrictions on the use of force.\n       One guard who said he had quit for those reasons said in an \n     interview: ``The inmates are running the asylum now. You're \n     not supposed to touch the kids, but how are we supposed to \n     control them without force?'' He has relatives working at \n     Tallulah and so insisted on not being identified.\n       The frustration boiled over on July 1, during a tour by \n     Senator Paul Wellstone, the Minnesota Democrat who is \n     drafting legislation that would require psychiatric care for \n     all incarcerated juveniles who need it. Despite intense \n     security, a group of inmates climbed on a roof and shouted \n     their complaints at Senator Wellstone, who was accompanied by \n     Richard Stalder, the secretary of Louisiana's Department of \n     Public Safety and Corrections.\n       Mr. Stalder said he planned to create a special unit for \n     mentally ill juvenile offenders. One likely candidate to run \n     it, he said, is Trans-American, the company that operates \n     Tallulah.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Almost 200,000 people behind bars in the United States \nof America, according to Mr. Butterfield, are known to suffer from \nschizophrenia, manic-depression, or major depression--the three most \nsevere mental illnesses. This rate is four times greater than for the \ngeneral population. And there is strong evidence, particularly among \njuveniles, that their numbers in the jails are growing.\n  The vast majority of these people, colleagues, have not committed \nserious violent crimes. Some are homeless people charged with minor \ncrimes that are a byproduct of their mental illness. They just get \nswept up and incarcerated. Others are picked up with no charges at all, \nin what police call ``mercy arrests,'' simply for acting strange.\n  Jails and prisons often find themselves unprepared to deal with the \nmentally ill. For instance, medication may not be properly monitored or \nguards do not know how to respond to disturbed inmates who are simply \nnot capable of standing in an orderly line for meals. A common result \nis that these inmates find themselves in solitary confinement.\n  Colleagues, 200 years ago the most common treatment for the seriously \nmentally ill was jail. Thousands of people with severe disorders were \nbrutally locked away and forgotten. This did not change until Dorothy \nDix, and other reformers in the middle of the last century, \nsuccessfully fought to have these people transferred form jails to \nhospitals.\n  I fear that our jails are once again becoming dumping grounds for ill \npeople who need treatment and care and that as a result we are \nrecriminalizing the mentally ill in America today.\n  On July 1, Mr. President, I went with the National Mental Health \nAssociation to the Tallulah Correctional Center for Youth. Mr. \nPresident, I want to just briefly summarize this trip and then focus on \nmental health and children.\n  First of all--and I have talked with my colleagues from Louisiana who \ncare a great deal about this. Let me say that, in particular, the \nwarden, David Bonnette, is very committed to trying to make the \nchanges.\n  I went there because I had seen some preliminary Justice Department \nreports that essentially said there were kids who really had not \ncommitted any crimes--by the way, the vast majority of children, over \n90 percent in the juvenile corrections system, have not committed \nviolent crime. But I heard that there were kids who had been dumped in \nthis facility--but the same can be said for other facilities in our \ncountry--who had not committed any violent crimes. Some had not \ncommitted any crime. And then, to make matters worse, there is no \nmedication, no counseling, and there they are. It is unconscionable.\n  I went to visit this facility. When I got there, I first met with \npeople in the administrative building. A lot of officials from \nLouisiana were there, quite a bit of media was there--journalists, TV, \nradio. But forget all that.\n  We had some initial negotiations because I wanted to visit where the \nsolitary confinement cells were. I wanted to find out why kids were put \nin these cells for up to 6 or 7 weeks at a time, up to maybe 23 hours a \nday--if my colleagues are listening. I wanted to find out why.\n  Before visiting there, we first went to a building where these kids--\nand they are kids from age 11 to age 18--were eating. I say to my \ncolleague from South Carolina, he might be interested in this. Again, I \nam not trying to point the finger of blame, but I saw these kids \neating, and probably 85 percent of them were black, African American, \nages 11 to 18. There are 500-plus kids in this facility.\n  I went over to where some of these kids were eating, and I said, \n``How are you doing?'' And this one kid said, ``Not so good.'' I said, \n``What do you mean?'' He said, ``This food, they never serve this food. \nThey just did this for today. We don't ever get this kind of food. \nThese clothes, we never had these clothes. Every day it's the same \nclothes. Every day it's the same underwear. It's hot. There's no air \nconditioning. And we don't have any clothes like this, clean clothes. \nThese shoes, we never had any shoes like this. Smell the paint on the \ntable. These tables have all been freshly painted. This is just a show \nfor you, Senator.''\n  Then I turned to officials from Louisiana, and I never heard them \ncontradict that. Again, I am going to end up very much in the positive \nabout what I think is going to happen now.\n  And then we walked across the compound--that is what I will call it--\nbecause I wanted to get to where these solitary confinement cells were. \nAnd this one young man climbs up on a roof, leaps up on a roof, and \nruns toward me and a whole lot of people who are with me. And I said to \nhim, ``You're going to get in a lot of trouble. Why are you doing \nthis?'' He said, ``I want to make a statement.'' I said, ``What is your \nstatement?'' He said, ``This is a show. And we're all going to get \nbeaten up when you leave. We get beaten up all the time.''\n\n  Then I met with four young guys. One had stolen a moped. That is why \nhe was there. One was there for breaking and entering, and another was \nbreaking and entering. The point is, they talked about being beaten up \nall the time.\n  Now, the Justice Department has also chronicled some of these \nconditions. The truth of the matter is, I believe the warden there and \nthe State of Louisiana knows that things have to change. That is the \ngood news, I hope. There has now been a civil rights lawsuit filed. \nThere is a tremendous amount of interest.\n  What I want to say to colleagues, and I believe this Fox Butterfield \narticle was terribly important as well, but I want to just simply talk \nabout some of what I observed, regarding the mental health in children. \nOne hallucinating child was in isolation for observation, yet his \ntransfer to an appropriate mental health facility was uncertain. \nAnother child I met was taking three different types of powerful \npsychiatric medications but had only seen a psychiatrist twice in the \nlast 8 months. The Justice Department chronicled instances where boys \nwere being repeatedly sexually and physically abused, and children with \nmental illness were being housed with youths who had committed violent \ncrimes--mentally ill children who had received no therapy, and when \nthey are having the symptoms they are often isolated or punished for \ntheir illness.\n  Mr. President, I just say that what is happening to these troubled \nchildren who were dumped in these facilities and get no care, many of \nwhom shouldn't be there in the first place, is a national tragedy. All \nacross our country we are dumping emotionally disturbed kids into \njuvenile prisons. Each year more than 1 million youth come in contact \nwith the juvenile justice system, and more than 100,000 of these youth \nare detained in some type\n\n[[Page S8708]]\n\nof jail or prison. These children are overwhelmingly poor, and a \ndisproportionate number of them are children of color.\n  By the time many of these children are arrested and incarcerated, \nthey have a long history of problems in their short lives. As many as \ntwo-thirds suffer from mental or emotional disturbances. One in five \nhas a serious disorder. Many have substance abuse problems and learning \ndisabilities, and most of them come from troubled homes.\n  Tallulah is not the only offending facility. The Justice Department \nhas exposed gross abuses in Georgia, Kentucky, and other juvenile \nfacilities all across our country. Other States are experiencing \nsimilar problems. Investigators found extreme cases of physical abuse \nand neglected mental health needs, including unwarranted and prolonged \nisolation of suicidal children who are hog-tied, and chemical \nrestraints are used on youth with serious emotional disturbances, as \nwell as forced medication and even denial of medication. Children with \nextensive psychiatric histories who are prone to self-mutilation never \neven saw a psychiatrist. This is a Justice Department report, Justice \nDepartment findings on conditions in our juvenile ``correction'' \nfacilities.\n  Mr. President, our current system fails mentally ill adults and \nchildren. The screening and treatment of mental and emotional \ndisturbances are inadequate or nonexistent at correctional facilities. \nMental illness typically is addressed solely through discipline, \nisolation, and restraint. At Tallulah, children told us they were \nbeaten and put in isolation for long periods, even months, echoing in \npainful detail what has been revealed in the Justice Department \nreports.\n  The tragedy of this situation is that we know what works--treatment. \nBut our current system for adults and children with mental illness \nfavors punishment over treatment. For children, we know that family \nfocused, individualized treatment, delivered in a child's community can \nimprove that child's mental health and prevent them from offending in \nthe first place. It is proven that if you integrate these mental health \nand substance abuse services with schools and child agencies and you \nmake it happen at the local level, it provides even greater success. In \nfact, linked with community services, these other treatment programs \nhave been shown to reduce contact with the juvenile system by 46 \npercent.\n  This amendment, really, builds on this. Under this amendment, States \nreceiving Federal prison construction moneys would be able to use these \nfunds to implement mental health screening and treatment of adult and \njuvenile offenders within their correctional systems. It is badly \nneeded. Those States receiving Federal prison construction moneys would \nalso be required to develop a plan for mental health treatment of \nmentally ill offenders. Finally, States receiving these funds would be \nrequired to provide the attorney general an initial baseline study of \nmental illness in their correction facilities.\n  We can't any longer ignore this tragedy. What I saw in Tallulah is a \nnational disgrace. The wholesale neglect of adults and youth with \nemotional disturbances in our prisons must end. We, as a society, have \nthe moral obligation to see that they get the help they need.\n  I thank both of my colleagues for supporting this amendment. I want \nto end on this note. I said it once earlier. I want to make it crystal \nclear, because I am sensitive to not doing any bashing of any one \nState. Yes, I visited the facility in Tallulah. I will tell you \nsomething, those conditions shouldn't exist. I will tell you something \nelse, beyond the connection of mental health in children and children \nwho have never committed a crime, they just get dumped in these \ncorrection facilities, and then when they are there they get no \ntreatment, no vocational ed treatment, precious little education, no \ncounseling, inadequate medical attention, on and on and on.\n\n  Mr. President, the other thing I want to say, which is another point \nwhich I guess speaks back to the vote we just had, I tell you I am all \nfor holding people accountable when they commit a brutal or heinous \ncrime. I have said it before and I will say it again, when three 16-\nyear-olds beat up an 85-year-old woman and leave her for dead, I don't \nfeel sorry for them. But I tell you Democrats and I tell you \nRepublicans, anybody who believes that those kinds of conditions that I \nsaw at Tallulah Correctional Center--they exist in a lot of other \ncenters, and people in Louisiana are taking action to make things \nbetter, and I believe they will--anybody who thinks that is the answer, \nis way off base. A lot of those kids, those 11-year-olds and 12-year-\nolds I met, I wouldn't have been afraid to meet then at 10 at night \nbefore they came to this ``correction'' facility, but I wouldn't want \nto meet some of these kids at 10 at night alone after they have been in \nthese facilities.\n  What do you think we will get from this with these kinds of \nconditions? What do you think we will get from this when you put kids \nin brutal conditions? You make them brutal. Every one of these children \nwho I visited with is a mother's child and a father's child. This is \ndisgraceful. This is disgraceful.\n  I wouldn't say this is necessarily the central issue in the country. \nThat is why I thank my colleagues for their support. But I am telling \nyou I really believe this amendment will be very helpful, because what \nthis amendment will do is it will say to the States, look, if you want \nto do the assessment before you incarcerate a kid, if you want to find \nout what happened by way of violence in the home or substance abuse, or \nwhether or not the kid should even be in a correctional facility versus \nsomewhere else, and you want to figure if they should be incarcerated--\nsome should--or what kind of treatment is needed, you can use some of \nthis money to do that. We have estimates of up to 25 percent-plus of \nthe kids in these juvenile correction facilities are struggling with \nthese mental problems and we just abandon them.\n  The second thing it said is, look, States, with your prison system, \nyou have to lay out the plan that you have for dealing with some of the \npeople who are in the system who are struggling with these mental \nproblems and what kind of treatment they will get. We are worse off as \na nation in terms of losing our soul if we don't do this. Frankly, it \nis in the self-interest of every family in America to make sure we get \ntreatment to these kids and treatment to some of these people who are \nincarcerated. If they don't get the treatment, or the conditions that I \ndescribed today from Fox Butterfield in the New York Times article, we \nare all worse off for it.\n  So I thank both my colleagues for their support. I hope I will get \nstrong support in conference committee as well. I am very proud to have \nhad a chance to introduce this amendment, and I am pleased that the \namendment is going to be accepted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I have just been informed that the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana wanted to be heard on the amendment.\n  I understand that the Senator will speak after we agree to the \namendment. She will be here shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3252) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand that the amendment by my \ndistinguished colleague, Mr. Wellstone, has been accepted. I wanted to \nsay how much I admire him for bringing this issue to the attention of \nthe Senate and for his eloquent presentation on what I think is a real \nproblem in our Nation. As he outlined, in\n\n[[Page S8709]]\n\nLouisiana, during his last visit, he found that one of our facilities \nsure could stand great improvement. I am also positive that there are \nmany facilities in other States in our Nation that can also use \nimprovement and attention.\n  I wanted to say for the Record that we talk, in campaigns \nparticularly and finally when we get here to this body, a lot about \nbeing ``tough on crime.'' We talk about being smart and tough because \nit takes a combination of that to really drive down these juvenile \ncrime rates, drive down crime rates in America. We need to remain \ntough, with tough penalties; but we also have to be smart. This was a \nsmart amendment that we accepted just a few minutes ago. This was maybe \none of the smartest things we have done in a couple of weeks here--and \nmaybe for a long time --because we have allowed States to take some of \ntheir money for construction and use it for mental health services.\n  It does us no good, Mr. President, as we know, to keep juveniles in \nfacilities that are inappropriate and don't offer the proper training \nand counseling, only to turn them into hardened criminals--for them to \nthen be released to go back into our neighborhoods and communities and \nwreak havoc when we could have done the smart thing, which Senator \nWellstone has urged us to do, and what we have now done, by intervening \nearlier and providing this counseling, which would prevent us from \nspending extra money. But it is not just the extra money that we spend, \nit is also the loss of life, the loss of property, the pain and \nsuffering that is caused when we don't do these things early on. So \nspending a small amount of money for the proper mental health \ncounseling would go a long way, I think, in our Nation toward getting \nus to our goal of reducing crime across the board in America.\n  I want to thank the Senator for his visit to Louisiana. I am familiar \nwith this facility. I had some dealings with this and three other \nfacilities when I was State treasurer in Louisiana. At that time, many \nyears ago, I objected to the construction of these facilities based on \nthe thought that it was profits driving them and not good policies \nabout how to incarcerate, when to incarcerate, and what kind of \ncounseling these juveniles would get. Sometimes they are first \noffenders, sometimes they are nonviolent offenders. The lack of those \nservices has provided a prospective. I did not prevail, obviously, \nbecause these facilities were built. We can clearly see now that there \nare problems when our policies are driven by profits, not good crime-\nfighting policies and good prevention. I am thankful and glad that we \nadopted this amendment. I want to voice my support for what we are \ndoing. Hopefully, we can do more of it.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from North Carolina \nis recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3253\n\n   (Purpose: To amend section 3486 of title 18, United States Code, \n relating to offenses involving the sexual exploitation or other abuse \n                              of children)\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3253.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 51, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       Sec. 121. Section 3486(a)(1) of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting ``or any act or activity \n     involving a Federal offense relating to the sexual \n     exploitation or other abuse of children,'' after ``health \n     care offense,''.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, we all know that the Internet has \nbecome the tool of choice for sexual predators and child pornographers. \nIn fact, the Senate just yesterday attempted to deal with pornography \non the Internet by refining the Communications Decency Act.\n  There are numerous legislative proposals to deal with this issue.\n  I especially want to thank Chairman Gregg. Under his leadership in \nthis bill, he has provided millions for the Justice Department to \ninvestigate these crimes. And his leadership on this issue is to be \ncommended--for the method which he has handled it, and the far-reaching \neffect it is going to have.\n  I asked the FBI what tool is it that they most need to go after \nsexual predators on the Internet. What would do the most good? They \ntell me that a legislative change that is most needed by them is \nadministrative subpoena authority to quickly get records on sexual \npredators--that administrative subpoena authority would do more to \nexpedite matters than anything else we could do.\n  Mr. President, the FBI has an operation known as ``Innocent Images.'' \nThe operation was created in the wake of the disappearance of a small \nboy in Maryland. The FBI found an elaborate operation being used to \nlure children over the Internet. That was its sole purpose. Thus far, \nthe operation has net 200 indictments, 150 convictions, and 135 \narrests.\n  Literally every day you cannot pick up a newspaper without reading \nabout a case of a sexual predator looking for children on the Internet.\n  When the FBI testified before the Senate Appropriations Committee in \nMarch, Director Freeh said that when an agent, pretending to be a \nchild, signed onto a ``chat room'' with 23 other children, 22 of the \n23--23 supposed children--22 of the 23 turned out to be adults seeking \nimproper contact with the girl, the one out of the 23.\n  That is how pervasive this problem is today on the Internet.\n  What the FBI needs most is an administrative subpoena authority for \ncases that involve a Federal violation related to sexual exploitation \nand abuse of children.\n  They have informed my staff that this would be the most useful tool \nthey could have in order to crack these cases.\n  This would allow them to quickly access records from Internet service \nproviders regarding a potential sexual predator using the Internet to \nprey on children. Without this authority, the FBI has to go through a \nvery cumbersome process of contacting the U.S. attorney and convening a \ngrand jury just to get this information.\n  The FBI has already had this administrative subpoena authority in \nnarcotics cases and health care fraud cases. But surprisingly they do \nnot have it in sexual predator cases involving our children.\n  I know that health care fraud is important. But it is not really more \nimportant than catching sexual predators.\n  Mr. President, there is a very practical reason this is needed as \nwell.\n  The FBI task force on this issue has had to get 6,200 grand jury \nsubpoenas for routine subscriber information off of the Internet. This \nwould reduce the administrative burden on U.S. attorneys, and certainly \non the grand jury system. Further, because of grand jury secrecy rules, \nthis information cannot be shared with State and local law enforcement \nofficials. So once it is acquired through a grand jury, there still are \nimpediments to using it.\n  Together with local law enforcement police, the FBI needs help to \ncatch these people. It is very important that we move in this \ndirection. But this is a narrow approval of the use of the \nadministrative subpoena, so that cases involving Internet crimes on \nchildren can be solved quickly and the information obtained quickly.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge the Senate to accept this amendment. \nMr. President, I understand the amendment is to be accepted. I urge its \na adoption.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe there is no further debate on \nthis amendment. I urge simply a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The amendment (No. 3253) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S8710]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3254\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on saving Social Security \n                                 first)\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for \n     himself, and Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3254.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE BUDGET AND SOCIAL \n                   SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) the Social Security system provides benefits to 44 \n     million Americans, including 27.3 million retirees, over 4.5 \n     million people with disabilities, 3.8 million surviving \n     children and 8.4 million surviving adults, and is essential \n     to the dignity and security of the nation's elderly and \n     disabled;\n       (2) the Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds have reported \n     to the Congress that the ``total income'' of the Social \n     Security system ``is estimated to fall short of expenditures \n     beginning in 2021 and in each year thereafter . . . until the \n     assets of the combined trust funds are exhausted in 2032'';\n       (3) intergenerational fairness, honest accounting \n     principles, prudent budgeting, and sound economic policy all \n     require saving Social Security first, in order that the \n     Nation may better afford the retirement of the baby boom \n     generation, beginning in 2010;\n       (4) in reforming Social Security in 1983, the Congress \n     intended that near-term Social Security trust fund surpluses \n     be used to prefund the retirement of the baby boom \n     generation;\n       (5) in his State of the Union message to the joint session \n     of Congress on January 27, 1998, President Clinton called on \n     the Congress to ``save Social Security first'' and to \n     ``reserve one hundred percent of the surplus, that is any \n     penny of any surplus, until we have taken all the necessary \n     measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the \n     twenty-first century'';\n       (6) Section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 \n     expressly forbids counting Social Security trust fund \n     surpluses as revenue available to balance the budget.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress and the President should--\n       (1) continue to rid our country of debt and work to balance \n     the budget without counting Social Security trust fund \n     surpluses;\n       (2) work in a bipartisan way on specific legislation to \n     reform the Social Security system, to ensure that it is \n     financially sound over the long term and will be available \n     for all future generations; and\n       (3) save Social Security first by reserving any surpluses \n     in fiscal year 1999 budget legislation.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator proposing a \nsecond-degree amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President,\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire reserves the \nright to object.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. This is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment on Social \nSecurity.\n  Mr. GREGG. May we have a look at it?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes. We all voted for it. It is the same thing we voted \nfor.\n  Where do you need to ask unanimous consent for an amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will observe that the Senator does \nnot have a right to send a second-degree amendment to the first-degree \namendment until that first-degree amendment has been disposed of, or \nhas had some action, or unless consent is granted, and the Senator from \nNew Hampshire reserves the right to object.\n  Mr. GREGG. I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time that \nthe Senator from South Carolina be recognized for the purposes of \ndebate only, and that immediately upon the conclusion of his remarks \nthe floor be returned to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman.\n  With respect to this particular sense-of-the-Senate amendment, it \nreally goes right to the heart of the expression ``Saving Social \nSecurity first.'' The fact is, as we talk about campaign finance \nreform, the abuses and the scandals of campaign finance reform are not \ncorporate money, labor money, soft money, hard money, Buddhist temple \nmoney, Lincoln bedroom money. The scandal of campaign finance is the \nlooting of the Social Security fund by politicians who want to get \nreelected, whereby they determine every year that they have a big \nsurplus.\n  The reason for this amendment, of course, is the constant chatter, \nparticularly on the other side of the Capitol, about Social Security, \nsurpluses, and taxes.\n  In order to get a surplus, here is exactly the moneys necessary to be \nused and even allow you to talk the language. Under the law, we are not \nallowed to talk the language, under section 13301. But in violation of \nSection 13301, a statute signed into law November 5, 1990, the CBO \nreport uses numbers of the so-called unified budget. This is not a long \nreport, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that excerpts of the CBO \nreport of July 15 be printed in the Record.\n  I understand the Government Printing Office estimates the cost of \nprinting this report in the Record to be $2,222.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     The Economic and Budget Outlook for Fiscal Years 1999-2008: A \n                   Preliminary Update, July 15, 1998\n\n             (Prepared by the Congressional Budget Office)\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that the \n     federal budget for fiscal year 1998 will record a total \n     surplus of $63 billion, or 0.8 percent of gross domestic \n     product (GDP). If current policies remain unchanged, the \n     surplus is expected to rise to $80 billion in 1999 and reach \n     $251 billion (nearly 2 percent of GDP) by 2008. Excluding the \n     surplus in Social Security and the net outlays of the Postal \n     Service (both of which are legally classified as off-budget), \n     CBO's new projections show an on-budget deficit of $41 \n     billion in 1998, which gives way to surpluses in 2002 and in \n     2005 through 2008.\n       The budget outlook has improved significantly in the past \n     six months. Unexpectedly strong revenue collections by the \n     Treasury in the first nine months of fiscal year 1998 are the \n     major reason that CBO has gone from projecting a small \n     deficit last January to estimating a surplus of $63 billion \n     today. The strength of 1998 revenues, together with a \n     slightly more optimistic economic outlook, also forms the \n     basis for increases in CBO's projections of the surplus for \n     1999 through 2008.\n       Determining the degree to which this year's unanticipated \n     revenues should carry over into projections of future \n     revenues is difficult at this time because the reasons for \n     the increase are still largely unknown. In January, CBO \n     projected that 1998 revenues would total $1,665 billion. By \n     March, revenue collections to date suggested that the total \n     would reach $1,680 billion. Based on collections through \n     June, CBO believes that 1998 revenues will total $1,717 \n     billion. New economic data explain less than $7 billion of \n     the increase in the projection since January, while new \n     legislation is responsible for $1 billion. That leaves $45 \n     billion, almost all in revenues from individual income taxes, \n     to be explained by other factors.\n       At this point, analysts can only speculate about the \n     sources of income that produced the added revenues in 1998 \n     and their implications for revenue growth in future years. \n     Certain explanations of the sources of the additional income \n     would suggest that projections of revenues should be adjusted \n     by growing amounts over time. But others point to temporary \n     factors and would suggest an adjustment that fades away over \n     several years. After assessing the possible causes, CBO has \n     chosen a middle path: it has assumed that the factors \n     producing the additional revenues in 1998 will continue to \n     add a similar amount to revenues in future years.\n       Changes in the economic outlook also boost surpluses \n     projected over the next decade. A smaller expected decline in \n     corporate profits as a share of GDP increases projected \n     revenues, and slightly lower real long-term interest rates \n     after 2000 reduce interest payments on the national debt. A \n     reduction in\n\n[[Page S8711]]\n\n     the projected rate of inflation--which holds down required \n     cost-of-living increases, the growth of Medicare costs, \n     nominal interest rates, and assumed increases in \n     discretionary spending after 2002--significantly lowers \n     projected outlays in the longer term. But lower inflation \n     does not have a major impact on the surplus because it also \n     slows the growth of taxable incomes, leading to a reduction \n     in projected tax revenues that offsets the reduction in \n     outlays.\n       CBO now expects lower outlays in 1998 than it projected in \n     March, but that decrease largely reflects temporary factors \n     that are not expected to reduce spending in the future. \n     Legislation enacted since March has lowered projected \n     surpluses by a few billion dollars a year--primarily \n     reflecting higher spending for transportation programs.\n\n\n                          The Economic Outlook\n\n       The economy has continued to grow at a healthy pace, with \n     low unemployment and subdued inflation. CBO projects that \n     growth will slow over the next few years and that the \n     unemployment and inflation rates will gradually rise (see \n     Table I). The current outlook is not dramatically different \n     from CBO's last economic projections, made in January, but \n     small increases in real growth, somewhat lower inflation, \n     profits that account for a larger share of GDP, and lower \n     real long-term interest rates significantly affect the \n     budget's projected bottom line.\n\n                                       TABLE

inventories.\n \nSources: Congressional Budget Office; Department of Commerce; Bureau of Economic Analysis; Federal Reserve Board; Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor\n  Statistics.\n\n     The forecast for 1998 and 1999\n       The growth of real GDP is likely to slow to 2 percent for \n     the rest of calendar year 1998 and early 1999, down from the \n     4 percent pace set during 1997 and the first quarter of 1998. \n     Factors contributing to the slowdown include a continuation \n     of the recent increase in the real trade deficit, a pickup in \n     inflation, and weaker profits.\n       Demand for U.S.-produced goods and services has been \n     dampened by events overseas. The economic contraction in Asia \n     stemming from that region's currency crisis was the major \n     reason for the slowdown in demand, but an already strong \n     dollar and the slowly growing demand in Europe also \n     contributed to stagnating real exports and accelerating \n     import growth. The outlook is for continued strength of the \n     dollar and weak demand growth overseas, which make it likely \n     that foreign trade will continue to depress demand for U.S. \n     goods into 1999.\n       The underlying rate of inflation--the increase in the \n     consumer price index (CPI) excluding energy and food prices--\n     is forecast to rise slightly over the next year and a half \n     because of strong upward pressure on wages and a partial \n     dissipation of the factors that have been dampening price \n     growth for several years. Growth of the overall CPI on a \n     year-over-year basis was 1.7 percent in June, but that \n     measure is distorted by the sharp drop in petroleum prices \n     this year. The underlying rate of inflation was 2.2 percent \n     through June. CBO's forecast assumes that the underlying rate \n     will increase slowly to 2.7 percent by the end of 1999. \n     Because energy prices are expected to remain steady, the \n     forecast growth rate for the overall CPI is similar.\n       Some favors that have held down CPI growth over the past \n     two or three years will continue to have an effect. For \n     example, import prices are expected to continue declining in \n     1998 (in part because of the Asian crisis), and the Bureau of \n     Labor Statistics will institute more changes to the CPI that \n     will reduce its growth by about 0.2 percentage points in 1999 \n     and later years. However, import price deflation is expected \n     to fade during 1999. In addition, medical care inflation, \n     which grew relatively slowly and dampened overall inflation \n     in the past two years, is forecast to bounce back from its \n     1997 low of 2.6 percent to more than 4 percent a year during \n     the next 18 months.\n       Corporate profits, which have stagnated since the third \n     quarter of last year, will remain under pressure through \n     1999. Rising wages and an expected increase in the growth of \n     employee benefits will push the growth of total \n     compensation higher at the same time that sales growth \n     slows. Thus, costs per unit of output will rise more \n     rapidly over the next year and a half than in 1997. Some \n     of those costs will be passed on in the form of higher \n     prices, but some will be absorbed through lower profits.\n       The anticipated rise in inflation may lead to higher \n     interest rates, but any increase is likely to be mild and \n     temporary. If the Federal Reserve Board is uncertain about \n     the pervasiveness of the slowdown in economic activity, an \n     increase in inflation may prompt it to raise short-term rates \n     by the end of the year. Long-term rates may also pick up \n     slightly. However, if economic growth slows to a 2 percent \n     rate for 1999, short-term interest rates will probably ease \n     back to their current levels by the end of that year.\n     The projection for 2000 through 2008\n       CBO does not forecast cyclical economic effects beyond two \n     years. Instead, it calculates a range of estimates for the \n     medium-term path of the economy that reflect the possibility \n     of booms and recessions. CBO then presents the middle of that \n     range as its baseline projection of the economy for 2000 \n     through 2008. Over that period, CBO expects real GDP to grow \n     at an average rate of 2.2 percent a year, the CPI to increase \n     at an average rate of 2.5 percent, and short-term interest \n     rates to average 4.5 percent.\n       The small variations in real GDP growth and other variables \n     during that period that are apparent in Table I do not stem \n     from any assumptions about cyclical effects in those years. \n     The slight drop in the projected growth rate of real GDP \n     between 2002 and 2008 reflects a demographic assumption that \n     growth of the labor force will slow in line with slower \n     growth of the working-age population and an assumption that \n     growth of investment will return to a lower, long-term trend. \n     In order to achieve the projected average values assumed over \n     the 2000-2008 period without having a misleadingly sudden \n     drop at the end of 1999, CBO phases in reductions in \n     inflation, interest rates, and profits as a share of GDP over \n     the first few years of the projection period.\n     Changes since January\n       CBO now forecasts that real GDP in 1998 will be higher than \n     it anticipated in January and projects that real GDP will \n     grow, on average, about 0.1 percentage point a year faster \n     over the entire 1998-2008 period than was projected at that \n     time.\n       Inflation, whether measured by the consumer price index or \n     the GDP price index, is lower this year than was forecast in \n     January, largely because of a drop in energy prices. \n     Inflation is expected to rise over the next two years, with \n     the increase in the CPI projected to grow from 1.7 percent in \n     1998 to 2.7 percent in 2000. However, the average\n\n[[Page S8712]]\n\n     growth rate for the CPI from 2002 through 2008 is projected \n     to be 2.5 percent a year--about 0.3 percentage points lower \n     than had been projected in January. Because of changes that \n     the Bureau of Labor Statistics has made or plans to make in \n     how it measures the CPI, the 2.7 percent inflation projected \n     for 2000 is comparable to 3.4 percent inflation calculated on \n     the basis of the measurement techniques used before 1995. The \n     Federal Reserve Board is unlikely to be satisfied with \n     inflation at that rate over a long period; thus, CBO assumes \n     that inflation will be lower, on average, after 2000.\n       The GDP price index is also projected to increase at a \n     slower pace than CBO anticipated in January. That assumption \n     of lower inflation significantly reduces both nominal GDP and \n     the total national income and product account (NIPA) tax base \n     in the latter years of the projection period. As a share of \n     GDP, however, the total tax base is higher in the current \n     projection than it was in January. Corporate profits as a \n     share of GDP in 1998 and 1999 are similar to the previous \n     forecast, but the projection for subsequent years is \n     significantly higher than before (although the share still \n     drops over time). CBO increased that projection because of \n     lower projected interest rates, which reduce the debt-service \n     costs of companies and boost profits. The projection for \n     wages and salaries as a share of GDP has changed little since \n     January.\n       Nominal interest rates are lower than previously projected \n     because of the assumed decline in inflation. The outlook for \n     real (inflation-adjusted) short-term interest rates is \n     unchanged from January. However, inflation-adjusted long-term \n     rates are projected to be lower because of the dramatic \n     reduction in the variation of inflation. Such a reduction \n     tends to reduce investors' concerns about locking in \n     investments for the long term and reduces the extra \n     interest--the inflation risk premium--that they demand on \n     long-term investments.\n     Uncertainty of the outlook\n       One source of errors in predicting the future performance \n     of the economy is data on its recent performance. Reported \n     data on GDP and the components of national income are \n     regularly revised, sometimes by quite large amounts. Because \n     forecasts necessarily depend on the economic data that are \n     currently available, the likelihood of revisions to those \n     data increases the uncertainty of any forecast.\n       In addition, there is a risk that future events will cause \n     a significant divergence from the path laid out in the new \n     forecast. The economy could be more adversely affected by the \n     Asian crisis than CBO assumes; the tightness of the labor \n     market could cause a significant jump in the rate of \n     inflation (such as the increase of 3 percentage points that \n     occurred in the 1960s); or the stock market could drop \n     precipitously. Conversely, the Asian crisis could have little \n     additional effect on the United States; productivity growth \n     might remain higher than CBO anticipates, which would permit \n     a continuation of rapid noninflationary growth and stronger \n     profits; or labor force participation rates might again \n     increase rapidly, easing pressures on the labor market for a \n     few years. Such alternative outcomes could have a substantial \n     effect on the budget, increasing or decreasing its bottom \n     line by $100 billion or more in a single year.\n\n\n                           The budget outlook\n\n       In March, CBO projected that the total federal budget would \n     show a surplus of $8 billion in fiscal year 1998--the first \n     surplus in almost 30 years--but warned that the final budget \n     numbers for the year could quite easily show a small deficit \n     or a larger surplus. With actual spending and revenues \n     reported for three-quarters of the fiscal year, a surplus \n     this year is now virtually certain, and CBO has boosted its \n     projection of that surplus to $63 billion (see Table 2). \n     Moreover, the improvement in the budget outlook for 1998--\n     primarily associated with higher-than-anticipated \n     revenues--seems likely to carry over to future years as \n     well. Assuming that policies remain unchanged, CBO \n     projects that the surplus will generally increase over the \n     next 10 years, reaching $251 billion (1.9 percent of GDP) \n     in 2008.\n       Although the total budget is expected to show a healthy \n     surplus in 1998, CBO expects that there will still be an on-\n     budget deficit. On-budget revenues (which by law exclude \n     revenues earmarked to Social Security) are projected to be \n     $41 billion less than on-budget spending (which excludes \n     spending for Social Security benefits and administrative \n     costs and the net outlays of the Postal Service, but includes \n     general fund interest payments to the Social Security trust \n     funds). By 2002, and in 2005 through 2008, the budget will be \n     balanced even when off-budget revenues and spending are \n     excluded from the calculation.\n\n                                              TABLE 2.--CHANGES IN CBO BUDGET PROJECTIONS SINCE MARCH 1998\n                                                        [By fiscal year, in billions of dollars]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              1998      1999      2000      2001      2002      2003      2004      2005      2006      2007      2008\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMarch 1998 Baseline Surplus...............         8         9         1        13        67        53        70        75       115       130       138\n                                           =============================================================================================================\nChanges:\n    Legislative:\n        Revenues..........................         1         1     (\\1\\)        -1        -1        -1        -1         1         1         1         1\n        Outlays \\2\\.......................        -1        -3        -4        -4        -4        -3        -2        -1        -1     (\\1\\)         1\n                                           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n          Subtotal........................

Revenues now seem likely to reach $1,717 \n     billion this year, $38 billion (2.2 percent) higher than the \n     March estimate and $53 billion (3.2 percent) higher than CBO \n     projected in January. CBO also expects total outlays of \n     $1,654 billion this year, $18 billion (1.1 percent) less than \n     projected in March.\n       The unexpected revenues in 1998 have led CBO to boost its \n     projection of revenues in later years because some of the \n     unknown factors that have affected 1998 taxes will probably \n     continue to have an impact. The reductions in 1998 spending, \n     by contrast, result largely from temporary factors and have \n     little effect on CBO's projections of spending beyond 1998.\n       CBO's spending and revenue projections incorporate the \n     effects of legislation enacted since March, but those effects \n     are relatively small. Changes prompted by CBO's new economic \n     projections have had a larger effect on the budget \n     projections, but not nearly as large as the revisions \n     stemming from the increased 1998 revenues. The most \n     significant change in the economic outlook is a decline in \n     projected inflation, but that change has a limited impact on \n     projected surpluses because it lowers both spending and \n     revenues.\n       Changes in Projected Revenues. In January, CBO predicted \n     that revenues would total $1,665 billion in 1998. That \n     projection was based on actual collections reported through \n     November, economic data available at that time, and CBO's \n     forecast of economic activity through the rest of the year. \n     In March, actual collections reported through January let CBO \n     to raise its projection to $1,680 billion. Based on actual \n     collections reported through June, revised economic data, and \n     a new economic forecast, CBO now expects total collections of \n     $1,717 billion for the year.\n\n[[Page S8713]]\n\n     Revisions to data on aggregate wages and salaries, corporate \n     profits, and other variables reported in the national income \n     and product accounts, and to CBO's forecast of those NIPA \n     variables, explain about $7 billion of the $53 billion \n     increase in projected revenues since January (Higher-than-\n     expected wages have boosted projected individual income and \n     payroll taxes by $11 billion, including the effects of \n     bracket creep, but lower profits have reduced corporate \n     income taxes by $5 billion.) Legislation enacted since \n     March explains an additional $1 billion of the increase. \n     That leaves a $45 billion increase in expected revenues to \n     be explained by other factors.\n       What is known from the data on actual collections is that \n     the $45 billion increase in the projection results almost \n     entirely from additional individual income taxes. About one-\n     third of the unexplained increase was in final payments in \n     April, which reflect tax liabilities on income received in \n     calendar year 1997. One-third was in higher-than-expected \n     with-holding on 1998 incomes. The other one-third was in \n     higher-than-expected estimated tax payments on 1998 \n     liabilities, which are also based on 1998 incomes.\n       However, available data provide virtually no information \n     about the sources of the increased income that generated \n     those tax collections. A well-founded explanation of the \n     unexpected revenues would require detailed information from \n     tax returns about the incomes that generated tax liabilities \n     in calendar years 1997 and 1998. But such information is \n     available only through 1996. Sufficient data on 1997 incomes \n     and tax liabilities will not be available until late this \n     year, and data on 1998 liabilities will not be available \n     until late 1999.\n       This year will be the third year in a row in which actual \n     revenues exceed the amount CBO estimated in its winter \n     baseline projections. The unexpected revenues represented 1.7 \n     percent of total revenues in 1996, 4.6 percent in 1997, and \n     are likely to represent 3.1 percent this year. Some of the \n     explanations for the additional revenues in the previous two \n     years could apply to the unexplained revenues in 1998. CBO \n     based its projections of 1996 revenues on reported NIPA \n     incomes that turned out to be too low and were later revised \n     upward. Incomes for higher-income tax-payers--particularly \n     income from partnerships--grew faster than expected. In \n     addition, the growth in deductions lagged behind incomes. Not \n     all of the factors affecting the unanticipated revenues in \n     1997 are known yet, but unexpectedly high realizations of \n     capital gains in calendar year 1996 clearly contributed to \n     them. The explanation for the additional revenues in 1998 is \n     likely to be some combination of these and other factors.\n       How projections of future revenues should be adjusted to \n     reflect the outcome in 1998 depends on which of the factors \n     were actually at work, and to what extent. If incomes in the \n     recent past were higher than has been reported in the NIPA \n     data, that discrepancy would produce an effect that would be \n     expected to grow over time at roughly the rate of the \n     projected growth in incomes. Although the incomes of high-\n     income taxpayers could continue to rise more rapidly than \n     average incomes, they could also grow at the same rate or \n     more slowly, producing a constant or declining effect on \n     future revenues. An increase in realizations of deferred \n     income that has accumulated over a number of years--such as \n     capital gains--often is a temporary phenomenon that could \n     even lead to lower revenues in the future.\n       After assessing the possible alternatives, CBO has chosen a \n     middle course. its projections assume that the unexplained \n     revenues in 1998 continue over time, neither growing nor \n     fading away. That assumption, along with small changes \n     resulting from other adjustments, generates the technical \n     changes to revenues shown in Table 2. (Technical changes are \n     those that are not attributable to legislation or the \n     economy.)\n       CBO also revised its revenue projections to reflect \n     legislation enacted since March, primarily the Internal \n     Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. Those \n     changes increase revenues in some years and decrease them in \n     others but boost them by a total of $3 billion over the 1998-\n     2008 period.\n       Changes in CBO's economic projections affected revenues \n     much more substantially than did legislation. Over the next \n     few years, the revised economic assumptions increase revenues \n     by as much as $15 billion a year. But after 2002, the revised \n     outlook reduces revenues by amounts that grow to $43 billion \n     in 2008. Slightly higher real GDP and a not-quite-as-sharp \n     decline in corporate profits as a share of GDP boost \n     projected revenues. However, lower projected inflation pushes \n     down nominal GDP and incomes, resulting in a drop in revenues \n     that more than offsets those upward effects after 2002. \n     Because lower inflation also pushes down spending, that \n     reduction in revenues does not have a major impact on the \n     budget surplus.\n       Changes in Projected Outlays. CBO anticipates that 1998 \n     outlays will be $18 billion lower than projected in March. \n     About $5 billion of that reduction occurs in discretionary \n     spending. A supplemental appropriation bill enacted in May \n     boosted discretionary outlays by an estimated $1 billion, but \n     that increase was more than offset by slower-than-anticipated \n     spending for a number of programs. For instance, spending for \n     highway construction and maintenance is likely to be some \n     $1.5 billion less than was projected in March, largely \n     because of delays in providing funding for the spending \n     allowed by obligation limitations enacted for 1998. Spending \n     for disaster relief is now expected to be $1 billion less \n     than previously estimated, and reductions in projected \n     spending for a variety of natural resources and environmental \n     program total about $1 billion. Projected outlays for various \n     other discretionary programs have been reduced by smaller \n     amounts.\n       Lower projected mandatory spending in 1998 accounts for the \n     remaining $12 billion in decreased outlays. More than $1 \n     billion of that reflects economic effects--unemployment and \n     interest rates that are lower than previously anticipated. \n     Legislation enacted since March as had virtually no effect on \n     net mandatory spending. Thus, the remaining $11 billion \n     reduction in projected mandatory spending is attributable to \n     other, techinal factors. More than $3 billion of the \n     reduction is in Medicare, largely the result of a decision by \n     the Health Care Financing Administration to slow the \n     processing of payments to health care4 providers. Net outlays \n     have also been reduced by $1.8 billion because it appears \n     likely that proceeds from the sale of the United Stated \n     Enrichment Corporation (USEC) will be received in 1998 \n     instead of in 1999, as CBO previously projected. CBO had \n     assumed that $1.5 billion would be paid in 1998 as part of \n     the settlement stemming from the 1996 Supreme Court decision \n     holding the federal government liable for losses resulting \n     from statutory changes in the treatment of certain savings \n     and loan assets. It now appears that almost none of the \n     payments will occur this year. Projected net spending for \n     credit programs of the Federal Housing Administration has \n     been reduced by $1.5 billion. Spending for a variety of other \n     mandatory programs has also been revised downward.\n       Lower outlays in 1998 have not led to a reduction in \n     projected spending in 1999 through 2008. The 1998 reductions \n     largely reflect one-time events that either have no impact on \n     future spending or are likely to increase it. For example, \n     the slowdown in the processing of Medicare payments will \n     lower 1998 spending but will have little or no effect on \n     spending in future years, since the amount saved in any year \n     because of the delay will roughly equal the amount that is \n     carried over to that year from the previous year. And \n     collecting proceeds from the USEC sale in 1998 will clearly \n     increase net outlays in 1999 above what they would have been \n     if the proceeds had been collected in that year.\n       Legislation enacted since March has increased projected \n     spending over the 1999-2008 period by a total of $23 billion. \n     Most of that increase stems from the additional spending \n     provided by the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \n     Century, enacted in June. That legislation boosted total \n     discretionary spending allowed under the Deficit Control Act \n     by creating separate statutory caps on outlays for highways \n     and for mass transit while reducing the existing cap on \n     nondefense spending by an amount smaller than that allowed \n     under the new caps. That increase in discretionary spending \n     was only partially offset by reductions in mandatory spending \n     provided in the act (primarily from overturning a 1997 \n     decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs that made it \n     easier for veterans suffering from smoking-related diseases \n     to qualify for compensation benefits).\n       Changes in CBO's economic projections have reduced \n     projected spending by amounts that grow to $63 billion by \n     2008. A slight reduction in anticipated real long-term \n     interest rates produces savings in interest on the national \n     debt. Much more significant, however, are the reductions in \n     spending that result from lower projected inflation. Lower \n     inflation holds down the size of required cost-of-living \n     adjustments for benefit programs such as Social Security, \n     slows the growth of Medicare spending, and by lowering \n     nominal interest rates, curbs spending for interest on the \n     debt. Since CBO's projections assume that discretionary \n     spending will grow at the rate of inflation after the \n     statutory caps on such spending expire in 2002, the decline \n     in projected inflation also reduces discretionary spending \n     projected for 2003 through 2008. Lower inflation has a small \n     effect on the surplus, however, because it reduces revenues \n     by at least as much as outlays.\n     Current revenue projections for 1998 through 2008\n       CBO projects that revenues will grow about 3.5 percentage \n     points faster than the economy in 1998, reaching 20.5 percent \n     of GDP--a post-World War II high. In 1999, revenues are \n     projected to grow only slightly faster than the economy and \n     will equal 20.6 percent of GDP (see Table 3). After that, \n     revenues are expected to decline gradually as a percentage of \n     GDP through 2003 (when they will equal 19.8 percent) and then \n     grow at the same rate as the economy through 2008. Despite \n     the decline (as a percentage of GDP) from the 1999 high \n     point, the 19.8 percent level projected for revenues in 2003 \n     through 2008 is equal to the level attained in 1997. Thus, \n     even with tax cuts in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 that \n     reduce revenues by an estimated 0.3 percent of GDP a year, \n     revenues are projected to equal a larger share of GDP than in \n     any postwar year before 1997.\n\n[[Page S8714]]\n\n\n\n                             TABLE 3.--CBO BASELINE BUDGET PROJECTIONS, ASSUMING COMPLIANCE WITH DISCRETIONARY SPENDING CAPS\n

million.\n\\2\\ Deficit or surplus of less than 0.05 percent of GDP.\n \nSource: Congress Budget Office.\n\n       Although CBO assumes that the unexplained increase in 1998 \n     revenues carries over into 1999--thus boosting revenues to an \n     all-time high of 20.6 percent of GDP--the projected growth \n     rate of revenues drops sharply, from 8.7 percent in 1998 to \n     4.9 percent in 1999. That drop is attributable in part to \n     economic factors--the growth in taxable incomes is projected \n     to slow to 4.1 percent in 1999, down from 5.8 percent in \n     1998. The rest comes from assuming that the unexplained \n     revenue effect will not increase in 1999. If, instead, that \n     effect increased substantially, revenues would rise at a much \n     faster rate. However, if the unexplained revenues resulted \n     largely from temporary factors in 1998, the rate of growth of \n     revenues in 1999 would decline even more precipitously.\n       Even if revenues continue to grow rapidly in 1999, CBO \n     believes the rate of growth will eventually slow. Because of \n     the scheduled tax cuts provided by the Taxpayer Relief Act, \n     and because corporate profits are expected to fall as a share \n     of GDP, CBO projects that over the next 10 years, the average \n     growth rate of revenues will be slightly lower than the \n     growth rate of the economy. Revenues are projected to grow at \n     the same rate as GDP from 2003 through 2008. During that \n     period, individual income taxes will grow faster than GDP \n     because individual income tax brackets are indexed for \n     inflation but not for changes in real income, which boosts \n     the effective tax rate as real income grows. But excise taxes \n     grow more slowly than GDP because many rates are fixed in \n     nominal terms.\n     Current outlay projections for 1997 through 2008\n       In dollar terms, total outlays are projected to grow from \n     $1,654 billion in 1998 to $2,303 billion in 2008. But as a \n     percentage of GDP, they are projected to decline throughout \n     the period--from 19.7 percent of GDP in 1998 to 17.9 percent \n     in 2008.\n       Net interest, which was the faster-growing category of \n     spending in the 1980s, is now projected to decline from $244 \n     billion (2.9 percent of GDP) in 1998 to $140 billion (1.1 \n     percent of GDP) in 2008 as projected surpluses reduce the \n     stock of debt held by the public by $1.4 trillion (see Table \n     4). Discretionary spending is projected to increase from $552 \n     billion to $657 billion over that period but to shrink \n     relative to the size of the economy--from 6.6 percent of GDP \n     to 5.1 percent. By contrast, mandatory spending is expected \n     to increase both in nominal terms (from $942 billion to \n     $1.626 billion) and as a percentage of GDP (from 11.2 percent \n     of 12.6 percent). That increase comes from both means-tested \n     and non-means-tested programs, with Medicaid and Medicare \n     leading the way (see Table 5).\n\n                                              Table

However, if \n     any of a number of assumptions that CBO has made turn out to \n     be off the mark, budget outcomes could be quite different \n     than projected even if there are no changes in policy. for \n     instance, if CBO's economic projections prove to be just a \n     little too optimistic, surpluses could be much lower than \n     anticipated, while a recession similar to that of the early \n     1990s could even produce a deficit. Likewise, surpluses could \n     be lower than projected if the factors that produced the \n     unexpected revenues in 1998 fade away quickly. Of course, it \n     is also possible that the economy will be more robust than \n     expected or that the unexplained revenue effect will grow \n     over time, in which case the budget outlook is much brighter \n     than CBO currently projects. In the face of those \n     uncertainties, the current budget projections represent CBO's \n     estimate of the middle of the range of likely outcomes.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. These are the updated figures:\n  In 1998, the trust fund surplus is $105 billion in Social Security; \nin 1999, $117 billion; in the year 2000, $126 billion; in the year \n2001, $130 billion; in 2002, $138 billion; in the year 2003, $146 \nbillion; in\n\n[[Page S8716]]\n\nthe year 2004, $154 billion; in 2005, $165 billion; in 2006, $173 \nbillion; in 2007, $181 billion; and in 2008, $186 billion.\n  So what you see in the projection here with respect to so-called \nsurpluses that are now being quoted by the President, distinguished \nMembers of the House of Representatives, distinguished Members of this \nparticular body, on page 11 of the Congressional Budget Office report, \nyou will find that what we actually are spending over the 10 years in \norder to get down to a deficit in the year 2008--they finally reduce \nthe deficit down according to these magnificent projections over a 10-\nyear period--the deficit is down to $1 billion by using $1.621 trillion \nof Social Security trust funds.\n  Last evening--let me compliment the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota--Mr. Grams talked at length about the various countries and \nhow they approach the Social Security problem. He referred in several \ninstances to the Social Security problem--this is just late last \nevening--to the ``looming crisis,'' the ``coming crisis,'' the ``fiscal \ncrisis.'' And most of what he says, by the way, I agree with, but there \nis no real crisis in Social Security if we only stop spending the \nmoney.\n  The problem is that the politicians, both Republican and Democrat, \nsee the Social Security trust fund as a cookie jar they can stick their \nhands in to get their favorite programs. Look here, they think, I can \nget my children's program; oh, no, I get my marriage penalty tax \nreform; I get the corporate taxes here; I get the estate taxes over \nhere; I get another capital gains tax there; oh, no, I want to spend it \nfor Medicare. This is just the biggest scandal I have ever seen, \nbecause that crowd up there in the gallery--namely, the media--will not \nreport the truth.\n  I hope they look right at the Congressional Budget Office report from \nthe 15th of this month, just a week ago. These are the supposedly \nnonpartisan figures. On page 11 you will see that the deficit goes up, \nin 1998, to $105 billion; and then, in 1999, to $119 billion; in the \nyear 2000, $127 billion; and the year 2001, $124 billion.\n  I remember back in 1993, when we on this side of the aisle passed the \nBudget Act, the Republicans claimed that if we passed that particular \n1993 budget plan, the economy would go into a nose dive; there would be \na depression. My friend on the Republican side of the aisle, the \nchairman of the Finance subcommittee, Senator Packwood of Oregon, said \nhe would give us his house if this thing worked. Our distinguished \nfriend in the House, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Congressman \nJohn Kasich, said he would change parties and become a Democrat if that \nthing worked.\n  It has worked. It has worked, Mr. President, until now. That is why \nI, the Senator from Wisconsin, and other Senators here wanted to be \nheard on this. Because what is really occurring is, everybody is \ndealing out the Social Security trust fund to various programs in an \nillegal fashion--certainly in an immoral fashion. They are running \naround telling everybody, you can count on Social Security, except for \nthe baby boomers. It is not the baby boomers in the next generation, it \nis the Members of Congress on the Senate floor and on the floor of the \nHouse. We, willy-nilly, are savaging, ravaging, looting Social \nSecurity. And there is not any question that the law disallows this.\n  I appreciate my distinguished chairman from New Hampshire allowing me \nthis moment. I ask unanimous consent the Greenspan Commission report of \n1983, which I worked on, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Social Security and the Unified Budget\n\n       (21) A majority of the members of the National Commission \n     recommends that the operations of the OASI, DI, HI, and SMI \n     Trust Funds should be removed from the unified budget. Some \n     of those who do not support this recommendation believe that \n     the situation would be adequately handled if the operations \n     of the Social Security program were displayed within the \n     present unified Federal budget as a separate budget function, \n     apart from other income security programs.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The majority of the members of this commission--I am \njust paraphrasing--stated that the Social Security trust funds should \nbe removed from the unified budget. You will see that in report there.\n  When they submitted the Greenspan report, the Commission said to \nremove Social Security from the unified budget. I struggled, as a \nmember of the Budget Committee, for almost 7 years to get it done. But \nI kept moving. I kept trying different ways. I tried on Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings and that particular budget approach. But in the summer of \n1990--that is why I can remember November 5--before the Budget \nCommittee, by a vote of 20 to 1, we removed it from the unified budget. \nWe got it on the floor of the Senate in October, and 98 Senators--if \nany Senator who was here in October is still here, any Senator who was \nhere in October of 1990--they voted just that way, to remove it from \nthe unified budget.\n  I will get, later, the vote record and we will put that in the \nRecord. I am not trying to embarrass or account for any Senators, but I \nam trying to emphasize that this body has pledged time and time again \nto save Social Security first and to stop looting the fund.\n  So we had 98 Senators vote for that, and President George Bush signed \nit into law. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have \nprinted in the Record just that 1-page law, right here, subtitle (c) of \nthe Budget Act on Social Security, 13301. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave it printed in the Record.\n\n                      Subtitle C--Social Security\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security From All Budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in any other surplus or \n     deficit totals required by this title.''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, ``Exclusion of Social Security from all \nbudgets''--this is the formative statutory law. We have been talking \nabout criminals, while many members of this body commit a crime every \ntime they discuss budget surpluses. They are not obeying their own--\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts \n     and disbursements of the Federal Old Age Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts or deficit or surplus for the purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the U.S. Government as submitted by the \n     President,\n       (2) the Congressional budget,\n       (3) or the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control \n     Act of 1985.\n\n  That was Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. We have been struggling a long time, \nbut we cannot get the truth out. We cannot get the truth out.\n  One of the deterrents to the truth is the common belief that every \nPresident since Lyndon Johnson has used Social Security trust funds for \nthe general budget. This is not true, Mr. President. It was not so. No, \nsir. President Lyndon Johnson did not use Social Security in order to \nbalance the budget in 1968-69. I was there. In fact, over on the House \nside we had the conference. George Mahon was the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. We called over and asked Marvin Watson and \nsaid, ``Ask the President if we can cut another $5 billion.'' President \nJohnson said, ``Cut it,'' and we balanced the budget. President Lyndon \nBaines Johnson was very conscientious about guns and butter. He was \nleaving office, and he did not want to leave a heritage of busted \nbudgets and the charge that he had the Great Society and the war in \nVietnam and he could not afford them.\n  Mr. President, do you know what the budget was then? It was $178 \nbillion for all purposes of Government, defense and domestic. Do you \nknow what the interest cost on the national debt is? The interest cost \non the national debt now is going to be $363 billion, according to this \nrecent report here--a billion dollars a day.\n\n[[Page S8717]]\n\n  Do you know what the interest cost on the national debt was when \nPresident Johnson balanced the budget back then? The interest cost was \n$16 billion. That was interest costs for 200 years of history and the \ncost of all the wars, up from the Revolution right on through World War \nI, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. And it was only a debt that \nrequired taxes, interest costs, to be paid of $16 billion.\n  Now we are up there to almost $5.7 trillion without the cost of a \nwar. It has gone right on through the ceiling, a billion a day, $363 \nbillion in interest costs. That is $350 billion more than what we had. \nAnd we are spending the money. This is pure waste.\n  Many say government is too big. I agree, it is too big. But the \nbiggest thing in the budget is the interest costs on the national debt. \nIt is bigger than Social Security, bigger than defense, bigger than the \ndomestic budget. We keep spending for nothing. If we had the extra $350 \nbillion since President Johnson's balanced budget--the defense budget \nis only $250 billion--we could double the defense budget: Instead of 13 \naircraft carriers, we will give you 26 aircraft carriers; instead of 16 \ndivisions, we will give you 32 divisions. Double it, and still have \n$100 billion for research for cancer, NIH, for education, for the \nenvironment, for anything--for cleanups, for agriculture. We have the \nmoney, because we are spending it on interest payments.\n  Why? Because Congress is not minding the store. It has a wonderful \ncookie jar it takes from by the billions every year. And over the next \n10 years, Congress will continue to steal from it. Over the 5-year \nperiod, we are going to have deficits of $557 billion--$557 billion, \nand we are talking about balancing the budget.\n  Each year, every year, instead of a surplus, there is going to be a \nbalance, and we keep going, going to it. In order to verify this, I ask \nunanimous consent that this chart of the budget realities be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           HOLLINGS' BUDGET

CBO's 1998 Economic and Budget\n  Outlook.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  This takes us from President Truman, in 1945, down to President \nClinton's 1999 budget and the one we passed in the U.S. Senate.\n  You will see when President Bush left town that the actual deficit \nwas $403.6 billion. That was how much we were spending. In 1993, we \npassed the budget act I mentioned earlier, and we brought the actual \ndeficit down to $349.3 billion. Then, in 1994, to $292.3 billion. In \n1995, to $277.3 billion. In 1996,\n\n[[Page S8718]]\n\nwe reduced the deficit down to $260.9 billion. In 1997, to $187.8 \nbillion. In 1998, it is down to $105.3 billion. You can see in 6 years, \nwe have gone down, down, down, down.\n  The Congress and the President should be credited. We have a \nwonderful economy, the lowest interest rates, lowest unemployment rate, \nthe highest business investment, more home ownership in America, \nconsumer confidence at its highest, stock market going through the \nroof. We acknowledge that and take credit for it. We participated in \nit.\n  Just when we ought to stay the course and continue to reduce the \nactual deficit, we have an election coming up in November. Oh, boy, \nthey see that cookie jar, and they are breaking ranks now. They voted \nfor this particular amendment unanimously in the Budget Committee. They \nmight want a second-degree amendment. I just want to get an actual \nvote, because colleagues on this side want an actual vote so we find \nout where they all stand.\n  I think they can outmaneuver us, there is no question about that, if \nthey don't want to vote. But they can't change this record. We have a \nsituation where instead of reducing the deficit, they want to go back \nand start to increase deficits, as I related, again and again for each \nyear for 5 years running.\n  They are all talking about surpluses as far as the eye can see. Mr. \nPresident, the surpluses as far as the eye can see are the Social \nSecurity surpluses. These are the moneys that belong, under the law--\nGreenspan said put it off budget. We put it off budget. We continue to \nspend the money. I keep raising the points of order, and they just \nignore it and go on.\n  Right now the word is, ``Wait a minute. If we vote for this, you \ncan't get your tax cuts.'' Well, come, you can't get your tax cuts, \nbecause the only way you can get your tax cuts is to loot the moneys \nout of Social Security. That is how you get tax cuts. That is how you \nget all of these programs that increase spending.\n  In order to do it, they want to use $105 billion of Social Security \nin 1998. In order to get the tax cuts, how do they justify that list \nthe distinguished speaker put out? He had capital gains, he had estate \ntax elimination, he had the marriage penalty, he had tuition tax \ncredits for private education--he just got it all in and said, ``Just \nwatch them vote against that, and we'll go after them and say, `Tax-\nand-spend, tax-and-spend, tax-and-spend.' '' The truth of the matter \nis, he is the one increasing taxes, because as you do this, as you loot \nthe Social Security fund, the debt increases, as we see by the CBO \nrecord; and as the debt increases, spending for interest goes up. It \ncannot be avoided. It is going to be spent. That is exactly what is \ngoing on. It is fiscal cancer.\n  Let me say a word about that. I was on the Grace Commission, Mr. \nPresident, and worked with Peter Grace. We were against waste, fraud \nand abuse. At the very time we put out this magnificent volume, which \nwas 2 inches thick, of our wonderful work of eliminating waste, fraud \nand abuse, we were creating the biggest waste in the history of \nGovernment; namely, deficits and the national debt. We cut revenues, we \nincreased spending, we didn't pay for it, and the debt went up, up, and \naway. Whereby it was a little less than a trillion dollars when we \nfirst started with President Reagan--it was $903 billion at that \nparticular time--it has gone up now with 12 years of Reagan-Bush to \nover $5 trillion. Of course, it has gradually gone up even though we \nhave been reducing the deficit each year. At this minute, we will \nspend, if we approve the budget that has been approved in the Senate \nand what they confirmed over on the House side, over $100 billion more \nthan we take in.\n  On April 15, we are supposed to complete the budget work. I have been \non the Budget Committee since we instituted it. Modestly, I say I used \nto be the chairman, and we did reduce spending at one time. Now it is \nJuly, and we haven't even had a conference. They appointed everybody in \nthe conference committee from both budget groups, but they can't \nconfirm because they can't face up to each other and say, ``Wait a \nminute. Somebody is going to tell the secret that the only way there \nare any surpluses around here is the budget trust fund surplus that we \nhave to loot in order to get all of these tax cuts, children's \nprograms, Medicare costs,'' and everything else of that kind. The media \ndoesn't even report it. It is a scandal.\n  There it is. We started the biggest waste at that particular time. \nYou have to understand why this is given sanction even in the business \ncommunity. I have argued with Alan Greenspan about this one. He loves \nthe unified budget. That business crowd doesn't want the sharp elbows \nof Government crowding in to the bond market running up interest costs, \nrunning up inflation. They don't serve in public office. They don't \nhave to face the statutes, laws and policies that we enact as Members \nof the Congress. They say, ``Oh, it will be taken care sooner or \nlater.'' They go ahead with the unified budget pointing, if you please, \nMr. President, to the difference between the corporate economy and the \ncountry's economy.\n  The corporate economy, of course, is higher profits. The country's \neconomy is for the good of society. And they don't necessarily meld. Or \nit is good for the corporate economy for NAFTA to go like gangbusters \ndown in Mexico. That is where General Motors is headed with that \nstrike. Actually, Honda exports more cars than General Motors this \nminute in the United States of America. We are going out of business.\n  I have lost 24,000 textile and apparel jobs since NAFTA. Those are \ngood jobs. It is an industry that under President Kennedy we found out \nis necessary to the national security. After steel, it was the second \nmost important. It was a finding in the sense you couldn't send the \nsoldiers to war in a Japanese uniform. You had to have clothing.\n  Seventy-five percent of the clothing within the view of us in the \nU.S. Senate is imported. We are at the water's edge of whether or not \nwe are going to have that industry.\n  The other industry is going down, because in the corporate culture, \nif you can save--it is shown that you can save a good 20 percent of \nyour labor costs, 20 percent of volume, by moving to a low-wage, \noffshore country.\n  So if you have $500 million in sales, you can move offshore. Just \nkeep your corporate office, your sales folks, but move your \nmanufacturing offshore and you make $100 million. Or you can continue \nto stay here and work your own employees--they call them associates \nnow--and go broke because your competition is gone. The multinationals \ncould care less. They are in the business of making money. We are in \nthe business of making a good and strong economy.\n  And America's strength is like a three-legged stool. You have on the \none leg your values. That is strong. We sacrificed to go to Somalia. We \nare now out in Bosnia. No one questions the values of the United States \nof America. We have the second leg, of course, which is the military. \nThat is strong. But the third leg, the economic leg, is fractured, and \nintentionally.\n  That is the corporate culture, corporate economy--move on down to \nMexico. And they promised at the time, of course, that we were going to \nincrease the balance of trade that we had of $5 billion. Now it is $15 \nbillion negative. They said we are going to create 200,000 jobs. We \nlost 400,000. They said it was going to solve the immigration problem. \nIt has gotten worse. They said it was going to solve the drug problem. \nIt has gotten worse. The actual Mexican worker is taking home 20 \npercent less pay. So they have suffered.\n  The $12 billion that we paid in there to keep it from going totally \nunder has gone back to Wall Street. It should have gone into a common \nmarket approach where we could have developed in Mexico--and I would \nvote for it this afternoon--the institutions of a free economy, a \nrevered judiciary, the right of labor to strike, the corporate \ninterests of owning property, the right of appeal, and those kinds of \nthings.\n  Over in Europe, the European countries in the common market approach \ntaxed themselves for 4 years, $5 billion before they allowed Greece and \nPortugal.\n  So what happens? We use the free market approach, which is good for \nthe corporate economy, but not the country's economy. And therein is \nwhere we are really headed with the fiscal cancer that is eating us \nalive here, because you have $1 billion a day. We are going\n\n[[Page S8719]]\n\nto meet tomorrow, and we are going to spend another $1 billion for \nnothing. We are going to meet on Friday, and we are going to spend \nanother billion in this Nation's Capital for nothing. We can meet on \nSaturday, and we are going to spend another $1 billion for nothing. We \ncan meet on Sunday, and we are going to spend, like it or not, another \n$1 billion for nothing--total waste.\n  Here we were trying to stop waste, fraud, and abuse, yet under the \nGrace Commission we instituted the biggest waste. I thought finally--\nfinally--we had gotten on it. We not only were bringing down the \ndeficit, but in his message to the Congress, the President of the \nUnited States said, ``Save Social Security first.'' And every \nCongressman and every Senator said, ``Amen, brother. That's what we \nwant to do.'' Everybody went off the floor and had their little \ninterviews. ``We've got to save Social Security.''\n  So we go into the Budget Committee, and we get a vote and unanimously \nvote for it. But now conferences are ongoing with respect to the \nparliamentary maneuvers to make sure that you do not vote. They can \nhave a second-degree amendment. We will come back later on with other \nbills. We will have our chance. Oh, we will just nag them and never get \nto a vote, but we will point it out from now until October: ``Save \nSocial Security first.''\n  There is no surplus. This country has fiscal cancer. If you keep \nspending up, up and away, interest costs on the national debt will \nmount, with the debt increasing each year for 10 years running. These \nare not surpluses as far as the eye can see, but rather deficits as far \nas the eye can see.\n  And this particular report of the Congressional Budget Office--if \nthat is the case, Mr. President, you can see at a glance that \nCongresses that are going to be meeting in the next century--for the \nmillennium and for the next century--we will meet, we will put a little \nbit in Social Security, we will put a little bit in defense, and a big \nbit in interest costs on the national debt, and we will not have any \nGovernment.\n  Now, judging by their Contract with America, that is what they want: \nto abolish the Department of Education, the Department of Commerce, the \nDepartment of Energy, the Department of Housing, the Corporation for \nPublic Broadcasting. Just get rid of highways--they do not even want \nthe highway system. They objected around here and said it busted the \nbudget when we used highway moneys for highways. Very interesting.\n  We passed a highway bill, and all we used was the gas taxes for \nhighways. But, oh, no, they wanted to rob the highway fund for foreign \naid or any other particular project that they had in mind.\n  Because of the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Senator \nChafee, we changed that. I commend him for doing it. We finally agreed \nthat after this year we are going to spend highway gas taxes, highway \nmoney on highways. Boy, I am telling you, just to get something normal, \ndecent and understandable here in the U.S. Congress is next to \nimpossible.\n  But there it is. We have a resolution that says, ``Save Social \nSecurity first.'' Now, they can get into parliamentary maneuvers. I \nguess one thing is: Move to commit the bill, like they did earlier. \nThey can do another one to commit the bill with instructions and hide \nbehind it.\n  But I can tell you, whatever the maneuver is, the issue is clear; it \nis almost undebatable. I want them to say, ``I am wrong on the figures \nI have given.'' I want them to say the CBO is wrong on the figures or \nwhatever. I want them to get up here and debate it and say, ``No. It is \nnecessary to spend the Social Security trust fund.'' That is all I want \nto hear them say. But I do not believe you are going to hear a Senator \nin the Senate say that. They all are going to hide behind the \nmaneuvering here and second degrees and third degrees, and move to \nrecommit, and everything else possible; and we will get a rollcall on \nthat. And that will be the call on whether or not you want to continue \nto loot Social Security.\n  I know my distinguished friend from New Hampshire does not want to do \nit. There is Senator Feingold there. Under the unanimous consent, of \ncourse, we agreed that the distinguished leader of this particular \nbill, our chairman, is to regain the floor, but I hope the other \nSenators here who, of course, are cosponsoring--and I put this up so we \ncan actually get a vote on a sense of the Senate.\n  And don't tell me that this is not relevant to State-Justice-\nCommerce. It is relevant to the fiscal state of the United States. I \ncan tell you that now. We do have fiscal cancer. The media is not \npaying any attention to it. They are all hiding under the unified, \nunified, unified. It is against the law. I have given you the law. It \nis against policies. It is against the vote of the Budget Committee.\n  But there is a quiet discussion. I listened on the weekend shows, and \nagain and again they were talking about surpluses here, surpluses \nthere, including, of course, the Administrator here of the \nCongressional Budget Office. If we have that report--I would like to \nrefer just one second to that particular report so you can see even she \ndisobeys the law. You cannot get even the Congressional Budget Office--\nthe conclusion, on page 13:\n\n       An unexpected increase in revenues in 1998 has virtually \n     ensured the total Federal budget will be balanced for the \n     first time in almost 30 years.\n\n  False, according to her own records, her own figures.\n  The previous pages showed that is not the case. On page 11, all she \nhas to do is read her own document.\n\n       An unexpected increase in revenues in 1998 has virtually \n     ensured that the total Federal budget will be balanced for \n     the first time in almost 30 years and nothing currently \n     visible on the horizon seems to threaten a return to deficits \n     in the near term if policies remain unchanged.\n\n  I know I wouldn't use her to do my income tax return. I would be in \njail, I would be gone, with that kind of doubletalk.\n  There is no surplus. But when the Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office, Madam June O'Neill, comes and says there is nothing on \nthe horizon, when she shows that in order to say that you have to spend \n$1.621 trillion of the Social Security trust fund, Social Security by \nthe year 2008, supposedly, if this weren't occurring, would have a \nsurplus of $2.252 trillion.\n  Look at that, on page 11 of this particular report--$2.252 trillion. \nYet everybody is going around with solutions to Social Security. The \nonly solution, and the first solution, is to quit looting the fund. \nThere won't be any $2.252 trillion. That is why you have all of the \nbills in to solve the Social Security crisis, the Social Security \nshortfall, the baby boomer problem. All nonsense, all out of the whole \ncloth.\n  She is talking again and again, ``However, if any other number of \nassumptions that CBO has made turn out to be off the mark, budget \noutcomes could be quite different than projected, even if there are no \nchanges in policy. For instance, if CBO's economic projections prove to \nbe just a little too optimistic, surpluses could be much lower than \nanticipated.''\n  Surpluses--there isn't any surplus in the report. There is a surplus, \nsupposedly, in Social Security. That is where the surplus is. Section \n13301 of the Budget Act says don't spend Social Security surpluses, \ndon't count on them in reporting a budget; don't count on them, \nCongressional Budget Office, when you analyze a budget. But she willy-\nnilly talks about surpluses. It is just amazing to me, until you see \nher projections, of course, of the interest costs.\n  Again, on page 11, she finds that interest costs on the national debt \nare just going down, down, down. It has been increasing each year \nanywhere from $10 to $20 billion. The debt has been going up. The \ninterest costs--even with that increased debt, even though interest \nrates are down, the interest costs have been going up.\n  If you want to see the pressure brought by the Speaker on the \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office, look at that series of \nfigures straight across the board. She finds that from 1958 to the year \n2008 the actual interest costs decrease $11 billion.\n  Totally out of the whole cloth, this is made. They kept nagging her \nand they held up the Budget Committees. The Budget Committees don't \nmeet; they don't sit down and confer over the budget. They go on the \nweekend talk shows and put out all the documents about tax cuts, \nspending programs, and put in here these optimistic figures.\n\n[[Page S8720]]\n\n  The Director of the Congressional Budget Office has responded to the \npressure of the Speaker of the House; there isn't any question in this \nSenator's mind. We know what is going on.\n  I wish the media--whether print media, TV media, or any other media--\nwould please, please, please, report truth in budgeting. That is what \nwe had when we had Gramm-Rudman-Hollings--truth in budgeting. We sold \nit over on this side of the aisle, 14 votes up and down. Our Democratic \ncolleagues, majority, voted to cut spending over the objection, at that \ntime, of the leader, over the objection of the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. But there was a conscience back in 1985.\n  Now, in 1998, it has become the game of the day: Just look over and \nfind whatever you want in the $100-some billion Social Security \nsurplus, and it grows each year. It is only $105 billion this year; 10 \nyears out, it is $186 billion. So we have plenty of money to spend for \nplenty of programs until we run right up against the wall, run right up \nagainst the wall, and the interest costs eat us alive. We have fiscal \ncancer. We won't acknowledge it.\n  I am glad and proud, on behalf of my colleagues on this side of the \naisle, to bring up this sense of the Senate. It is more important than \nthe entire State-Justice-Commerce bill or any appropriations bill. \nUnless we get ahold of our senses and vote a sense of the Senate that \nwe save Social Security first, we are gone.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have listened to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator has a right to \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I have to yield back to our chair.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Parliamentary inquiry. I believe regular order is for the \nSenator from South Carolina to be allowed to yield for a question; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I understand what the distinguished \nchairman is saying, and I agree with him. But I want to answer that \nquestion and then do as we agreed, because I only have the floor under \nthe courtesy of Chairman Gregg.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand Senator Gregg has the right \nto the floor when the Senator from South Carolina completes his \nstatement.\n  I have been listening to the Senator from South Carolina, who has \noffered an amendment that we have discussed before on the Senate floor. \nWe are reacting to recent press reports that cite one prominent member \nof the majority party as saying that Congress should enact $1 trillion \nin tax cuts over 10 years.\n  Isn t the Senator's point that those who propose massive tax cuts \nwould be taking the money, in effect, from the Social Security trust \nfunds in order to fund a tax cut; would that not be the case?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It is absolutely the case. The only place you can find \nthis kind of money for tax cuts is here in the Social Security trust \nfund, which is a violation in and of itself of section 13301 of the \nstatutory laws of the Budget Act of the United States of America. \nPresident Bush signed it, 98 Senators over here voted for it, almost \nunanimous over in the House of Representatives. We voted for it. But it \nis not hit-and-run driving. Let's stop right there.\n  Let me emphasize, in 1994 we were really distraught with respect to \nthe takeover artists. Individuals were coming in, the corporations, and \nliterally taking the pension funds, paying off the corporate debt, and \ntaking the remaining money and running. The employees were left high \nand dry. So we passed the Pension Reform Act of 1994.\n  Now, our good friend, the former pitcher up there from Detroit, Denny \nMcLain, became the head of a corporation. As the head of the \ncorporation, last year he had paid off the company debt with the \npension fund. That was made a felony. He got an 8-year jail term. If \nyou can find what jail he is in, tell him, next time, instead of \nrunning a corporation, run for the U.S. Senate; instead of a jail term, \nyou get the good government award up here for looting the pension funds \nto pay your debt.\n  That is exactly what we are doing. We go against the formal law that \nwe passed ourselves. We go again the policy set for corporate America. \nBut when it comes to us, we have to get reelected. The worst campaign \nfinance violation and abuse is using Social Security trust funds to \nreelect ourselves, telling them we are trying to protect Social \nSecurity.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for one additional question, \nand then I shall not inquire further. Will the Senator yield for that \npurpose?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this ought not to be a controversial \namendment.\n  The question is, simply, Is there an opportunity for someone to say, \neither in the Senate or the House of Representatives, that they are \ngoing to provide hundreds of billions of dollars, or a trillion \ndollars, of tax cuts under the current fiscal policy? Is there an \nopportunity to do that without using the Social Security trust funds? I \ncan't see that that opportunity exists. While I would like to see some \nadditional tax cuts, I happen to think that saving Social Security \nfirst and reducing the Federal debt would be much more meritorious for \nthe future of this country.\n  In any event, we ought not to be talking about tax cuts before there \nis money to give them. That money available for tax cuts does not \ninclude--I ask the Senator--and that money should never include, the \nSocial Security trust fund money; am I correct?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator from North Dakota is correct. Denny McLain, \nwho was an all-star pitcher for the Detroit Tigers, got sentenced to 8 \nyears for using the pension fund to pay off the company debt, in \nviolation of our law, the Pension Reform Act of 1994. Yet, we do it \nhere in violation of our own law and policy of 1994 for corporate \nAmerica. Fine and dandy. I would tell him to, next time, run for the \nSenate, and instead of a jail term he will get the good government \naward.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, for the purpose of debate only, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Wisconsin be recognized. How \nmuch time does he need?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I need 12 minutes, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Wisconsin be \nrecognized for up to 15 minutes and that the floor then be returned to \nme, unless the Senator from Maryland also wishes to speak. How much \ntime does she wish?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I want to speak on the bill itself regarding cyberporn \nand cybercrime.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Five minutes or less.\n  Mr. GREGG. For the purpose of debate only, I yield 15 minutes to the \nSenator from Wisconsin and 5 minutes to the Senator from Maryland. I \nask unanimous consent that I retain the floor upon the conclusion of \ntheir statements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my good friend, the Senator \nfrom South Carolina, in offering this amendment to express the sense of \nthe Senate regarding the Social Security trust fund balances.\n  I could not agree more with the Senator from South Carolina and also \nthe Senator from North Dakota that there really isn't anything more \nimportant than stopping this practice of using Social Security dollars \nfor things they are not supposed to be used for, including premature \ntax cuts. That is the central budgeting issue in this country. The \nSenator from South Carolina has been the leader for years and years in \nmaking that point. I have greatly enjoyed working with him on this. We \nare going to continue to work on this until this practice is stopped, \nuntil this theft of Social Security funds is prevented.\n  Mr. President, there is a fundamental difference between the way many \nin Congress approach the budget and the way the Senator from South \nCarolina and I approach it. That difference is Social Security.\n\n[[Page S8721]]\n\n  For 30 years, Presidents of both parties, and Congresses controlled \nby both parties, have included the Social Security trust fund balances \nin their budget calculations. As I had a chance to mention during the \ndebate over the budget resolution itself, the result is a false picture \nof our country's fiscal health. And just like a false medical report \nthat covers up a serious illness, it can lead to major problems in the \nfuture.\n\n  This false budget picture has been used so often that, in effect, it \nhas almost become a ``budget convention.'' It has so impressed itself \ninto the vocabulary of the budget that we now hear this word \n``surplus'' over and over again when there is no surplus. We hear \npeople talking about a budget ``surplus'' in Congress, we see it in the \nnewspapers, and we are even seeing it in letters from constituents who \nare, in effect, being misinformed into thinking that there is somehow a \nsurplus at this time.\n  Mr. President, the recent CBO estimates of our budget picture have \nmade this matter all the more urgent. Using this budget sleight-of-hand \nknown as the ``unified budget,'' some are pointing to significant \nsurpluses as a justification for their own budget agenda, as the \nSenator from South Carolina has very eloquently outlined in his \nremarks.\n  Mr. President, we have not achieved a budget surplus, and despite the \ngreatly improved budget picture, CBO still estimates that we will not \nachieve anything indicating a true surplus until at least the year \n2006. There is a deficit that is still being hidden, and Social \nSecurity is the curtain that is being used to hide it.\n  For the current fiscal year, CBO expects the deficit to be roughly \n$41 billion. That is a great improvement over the $340 billion deficit \nwe experienced in 1992. I am proud to have been a part of bringing that \ndeficit down, but that is still a significant deficit.\n  While the deficit picture improves slightly in the next few years, we \nstill face a real problem on the budget deficit. It is true that if all \nof CBO's assumptions are borne out, we will barely achieve a balanced \nbudget in 2002 and then again in the year 2005--just in those 2 years. \nAnd, of course, this is encouraging news. But it is hardly the kind of \nsignificant surplus on which to establish any major new initiatives, \nwhether they be in the spending area or in the tax area.\n  It is obvious that the economy may not perform as well as CBO \nexpects, and the slightest change in the underlying assumptions could \nmean something very different from surpluses. It could mean deficits \nthat are billions of dollars greater than are currently estimated. CBO \nitself makes this point in its current estimates.\n  The report states, ``* * * if any of a number of assumptions that CBO \nhas made turn out to be off the mark, budget outcomes could be quite \ndifferent than projected, even if there are no changes in policy.''\n  Mr. President, the CBO projections also assume that Congress will be \nmaking the spending cuts necessary to comply with last year's balanced \nbudget agreement. Mr. President, as is sometimes said in court, when it \ncomes to assuming that Congress will do everything it should do with \nregard to making those spending cuts, CBO could be ``assuming facts \nthat are not in evidence.''\n  Congress has not yet made those spending cuts, and the attitude that \nis being exhibited by some Members of Congress is not reassuring. We \nare already seeing a bidding war develop over how to spend the so-\ncalled surplus. It is a surplus that isn't even projected to really \nexist for another 8 years, Mr. President, but they are falling all over \neach other to figure out how to spend it before we finish the job.\n  With so many focused on how to dispense this phantom surplus, there \nis an increasing risk that we will not actually finish the important \nwork of truly balancing the budget. Mr. President, just a little over a \nyear ago, a lot of our colleagues were saying it was the most important \nmatter before us and urging us to amend the Constitution itself to \nensure that outlays did not exceed receipts in any given year. Now, \nhere we are, just a few months later, and many who supported this \ndrastic step--and, as it turned out, unnecessary step--to amend our \nConstitution are now very ready to spend a surplus that we don't have. \nIt could not be more inconsistent with what was at least said to be the \nspirit and the purpose of the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, it has taken us several years and many tough votes to \nget where we are today, to get within reach, within vision of truly \nbalancing the budget. It will take more tough votes to finish the job. \nUnfortunately, the notion of a so-called unified budget, which just \nbegan as a political convenience to mask the deficit almost 30 years \nago, has now become budget reality for many, many people. This has to \nstop.\n  ``Surplus'' is supposed to mean something extra like a bonus. What it \nis supposed to mean is that all the bills are paid and there is really \nmoney left over. But, Mr. President, as I noted during the budget \nresolution debate, one dictionary defines ``surplus'' as ``something \nmore than or in excess of what is needed or required.'' But the so-\ncalled unified budget, the surplus is not ``more than or in excess of \nwhat is needed or required.''\n  Those funds are needed; they are needed to pay future Social Security \nbenefits. They were raised by the Social Security system, specifically \nin anticipation of commitments to future Social Security beneficiaries.\n  There is, however, one simple, straightforward step that this body \ncan take to help Social Security and to protect the trust fund. It is \nvery simple. Just do not spend it. Don't spend it. We have no right to \nspend it.\n  I urge my colleagues to join the Senator from South Carolina and the \nother cosponsors of this amendment in passing this amendment and \nexpressing the sense of the Senate that we understand this essential \nfact: That when Congress makes budget obligations today based on the \nSocial Security funds, whether in the form of tax cuts or spending \nincreases, we are committing to a fiscal path that jeopardizes future \nSocial Security benefits.\n  Mr. President, let me once again sincerely thank my friend from South \nCarolina for his tremendous leadership on this issue. It has been a \npleasure to serve with him on the Budget Committee, and I deeply \nrespect his work to promote not only deficit reduction, but honest \nbudgeting as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I will not be speaking on the pending amendment. I \nwill be speaking on the overall nature of the State-Justice-Commerce \nappropriations.\n  I commend Senator Gregg and Senator Hollings for the outstanding job \nthat they have done in bringing an excellent bill to the floor.\n  Yesterday we talked about some of the things we thought were missing \nfrom the bill, and particularly what would affect the safety and well-\nbeing of children.\n  We talked about gun locks. Mr. President, I am a supporter of gun \nlocks. If we put locks on our cars to protect our automobiles, locks on \nour doors to protect our property, I think we should have locks on guns \nto protect our children. We worked our will yesterday. That didn't \npass.\n  But I will tell you, the Gregg-Hollings bill brings before us a real \nJustice Department commitment to protect our children. I would like to \nthank them for that. I would like to thank them for their efforts in \nfighting juvenile crime. I would like to thank them for bringing us \nlegislation to prevent violence in our schools. But most of all, I am \nreally grateful that they have put money in this budget to fight child \npornography on the Internet. We need cops on the beat, and we need cops \non the computers to be able to protect our communities and our \nchildren.\n  Let me share with you a story.\n  There was a little boy in Prince Georges County whose parents had \nbought him a computer where they thought it would be an opportunity for \nhim to learn about the world and be ready for school each and every \nday. However, there was a sexual predator who treated that computer as \nif it were a virtual playground. And they stalked that little boy, and \nit ended in his death.\n  But thanks to the response of the U.S. Congress--and I would like to \nparticularly thank Senator Gregg for his\n\n[[Page S8722]]\n\ncooperation and leadership on this--we have actually put money into the \nFederal budget for the FBI to establish a special headquarters in \nMaryland to fight cyber-kiddieporn on the Internet, with $10 \nmillion bringing 60 FBI folks into this, and 25 special agents. I have \nbeen there, and I have seen what they are doing to protect our \nchildren. You would love to see these FBI agents who are making use of \nthe newest and latest technology to be able to intervene, intercept, \nand detect those people who sit in chat rooms coming after our \nchildren.\n\n  I sat with those agents. I watched the pictures on the screen. I was \nrepulsed. I was horrified not only at what I saw, but what others could \nbe subjected to.\n  Because of our prompt response, the program is actually already \nworking. In the short time that this committee has put money in the \nFederal checkbook to fight cyberporn against children, there have been \n400 search warrants executed, over 200 arrests, and we are well on our \nway to over an 85-percent conviction rate.\n  In my home State of Maryland there have been 15 arrests, 15 \nindictments, and 12 convictions.\n  That means that we will be able to protect our children. The average \nchild molester has more than 70 victims throughout his lifetime.\n  Because of the work we have done here to put cops on the beat through \nour community policing in concert with the computer, both in our \nstreets and our neighborhoods to protect our children, children's lives \nhave been saved.\n  In Maryland alone 15 child molesters have been taken off the streets. \nThat means that 1,000 Maryland children have been saved and rescued.\n  This is just part of what we are doing to protect our children.\n  I know through the work of this subcommittee, of which I am proud to \nbe a Member, $210 million has been put into the Federal checkbook for a \nnew safe schools initiative.\n  We need to hire more security guards, improve coordination with local \npolice, get the violent kids out of our schools, and while we are doing \nthat, in addition to the policing that we are doing, I know that this \ncommittee has put in substantial money for prevention--not the type of \nprevention where we don't know what is going to be shown for it.\n  This committee is a tough committee. We are going to go after the \ncrooks and the criminals and the stalkers. But we know that, if we are \ngoing to have policing and punishment, we are going to do prevention, \nand we are going to do it by creative activity to fight and prevent \ngang violence--to be able to do structured, afterschool activity; \nworking with faith-based organizations.\n  Because of the work of this subcommittee, our streets and our schools \nwill be safer because we put cops on the beat and cops on the \ncomputers.\n  I thank the chairman for allowing me to speak. But most of all, I \nwould like to thank the ranking member for this outstanding bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for those \nwords--those type of words. She could speak all day. We appreciate \nthat, to say the least. I want to especially thank her for her \nextremely supportive and aggressive assistance in the ``Innocent \nImages'' effort, which she has pointed to and explained to us that \narose out of a situation in Maryland. The central nervous system for \nthe FBI initiative is now in Baltimore. What they are doing, I think, \nis very appropriate. They are developing protocol so they can spread \nthis knowledge of how to fight cybercrime against kids across the \ncountry to other levels of law enforcement, and they are using the \nprotocols developed at Baltimore to do that. It has really been a \ntremendous success story for the agency.\n  It is in large part because of the support this committee has given \nto the FBI that they have been successful in this. Although they were \nthe ones who initiated it and they should get the credit for it, that \nsupport has come as a result of the strong and firm commitment of the \nSenator from Maryland, and her understanding of the threat. The threat \nis very significant.\n  As she knows, because she has gone to the actual site of the activity \nwhere the FBI is pursuing these sort of sting operations--I have seen \nit done at remote sites--the amount of attempts by people who are \nclearly not pursuing a positive use of cyberspace for our children, the \namount of hits in a chat room, which appear to have very significant \nnegative potential for our kids, is overwhelming. You can turn on a \nchat room, introduce yourself as a 12-year-old girl, and within a very \nbrief period of time--30 seconds--have five or six hits in that chat \nroom, which will ask for illicit or lead to illicit activity in an \nattempt to get pornographic material, or in an attempt to expose that \nchild to pornographic material.\n  Regrettably, they create travel cases where they try to get the child \nto go and meet with the pedophile. In fact, we had a situation in New \nHampshire where somebody actually traveled all the way from Norway to \nKeene, NH, because that individual thought they were going to be able \nto have some sort of sexual activity with a child. Luckily, in this \ninstance at least, it was a police officer who was using the Internet \nfollowing the protocols that the FBI set out of ``Innocent Images'' \nthat was able to stop and apprehend that individual.\n  But it is a very serious issue because the Internet is a great and \nexpansive source for our kids and something that our kids should have \naccess to with the opportunity to learn, the opportunity to communicate \nwith people across the world. It is just a unique and special \nopportunity or activity that our generation did not have and the next \ngeneration does have. Making it safer for our kids is critical. So I \nthank very much the Senator from Maryland. I am in support of her FBI \ninitiatives in this area and certainly appreciate her kind comments.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3255 to Amendment No. 3254\n\n  At this time, I send to the desk a second-degree amendment to the \npending Hollings amendment and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for himself, \n     Mr. Lott, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Mack, and Mr. Gramm, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3255.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the pending amendment, strike all after the word \n     ``Sec.'' and insert the following:\n\n     SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE BUDGET AND SOCIAL SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Social Security system provides benefits to 44 \n     million Americans, including 27.3 million retirees, over 4.5 \n     million people with disabilities, 3.8 million surviving \n     children and 8.4 million surviving adults, and is essential \n     to the dignity and security of the nation's elderly and \n     disabled;\n       (2) the Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds have reported \n     to the Congress that the ``total income'' of the Social \n     Security system ``is estimated to fall short of expenditures \n     beginning in 2021 and in each year thereafter . . . until the \n     assets of the combined trust funds are exhausted in 2032'';\n       (3) intergenerational fairness, honest accounting \n     principles, prudent budgeting, and sound economic policy all \n     require saving Social Security first, in order that the \n     Nation may better afford the retirement of the baby boom \n     generation, beginning in 2010;\n       (4) in reforming Social Security in 1983, the Congress \n     intended that near-term Social Security trust fund surpluses \n     be used to prefund the retirement of the baby boom \n     generation;\n       (5) in his State of the Union message to the joint session \n     of Congress on January 27, 1998, President Clinton called on \n     the Congress to ``save Social Security first'' and to \n     ``reserve one hundred percent of the surplus, that is any \n     penny of any surplus, until we have taken all the necessary \n     measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the \n     twenty-first century'';\n       (6) saving Social Security first would work to expand \n     national savings, reduce interest rates, enhance private \n     investment, increase labor productivity, and boost economic \n     growth;\n       (7) section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 \n     expressly forbids counting Social Security trust fund \n     surpluses as revenue available to balance the budget; and\n       (8) the CBO has estimated that the unified budget surplus \n     will reach nearly $1.5 trillion over the next ten years.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     Congress and the President should--\n       (1) continue to rid our country of debt and work to balance \n     the budget without counting Social Security trust fund \n     surpluses;\n       (2) work in a bipartisan way on specific legislation to \n     reform the Social Security system, to ensure that it is \n     financially sound over the long term and will be available \n     for all future generations;\n\n[[Page S8723]]\n\n       (3) save Social Security first; and\n       (4) return all remaining surpluses to American taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I offer this amendment on behalf of Senator Lott, Senator \nDomenici, Senator Mack, Senator Gramm, and myself.\n  I will now propound a consent allowing for two votes, hopefully \nshortly, on this Social Security issue, the first vote being a vote in \nrelation to the majority version of the amendment, to be followed by a \nvote in relationship to the Hollings amendment. If an objection is \nheard, I will have no choice but to fill up the amendment tree so that \nour vote is guaranteed to be the first vote.\n  I would note that the amendment we have sent to the desk seeks the \nsame goal in that what we seek is to preserve the surplus for the \nSocial Security system so that Social Security can be saved first. That \nshould be the first and primary purpose of the use of the surplus.\n  However, we make the point in our amendment that after Social \nSecurity has been saved, after we have reached an agreement for how to \nsave Social Security--and I happen to have a bill which accomplishes \nthat. It would save it for the next 100 years. It happens to be a \nbipartisan bill of Senator Breaux and myself. There are other proposals \nfloating around. The Senator in the Chair is a strong supporter of a \nnumber of initiatives to save Social Security. But after an agreement \nhas been reached by the Congress and we have put in place a system for \nsaving Social Security, our sense-of-the-Senate says then let's send \nthe money back to the taxpayers. That seems to be a reasonable approach \nto me.\n  So we do not disagree with the desire to save Social Security first. \nWe only want to make sure that after Social Security has been saved, \nadditional surpluses go back to the taxpayers.\n  So with that being said, I now ask unanimous consent that there be a \ntotal of 60 minutes, and I would be willing to adjust that if there is \na desire to adjust it, but we have been on this for almost 2 hours now, \n60 minutes for total debate, to be equally divided between the majority \nleader or his designee and Senator Hollings, and following the \nconclusion or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on or \nin relationship to the Lott amendment, to be followed by a vote on or \nin relationship to the Hollings amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am trying to clear that now and find out--that is \nagreeable, except for the fact that we have how many Senators seeking \ntime? Four Senators. We have 50 minutes. I will be the fifth one.\n  Mr. GREGG. An hour-and-a-half equally divided?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, an hour-and-a-half equally divided.\n  Mr. GREGG. I amend that request: Instead of 60 minutes, there be 90 \nminutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask for the yeas and nays on both amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is in order to order the \nyeas and nays.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me begin this discussion, although the \ndiscussion has already proceeded. Much of what the Senator from South \nCarolina and the Senator from Wisconsin talked about, I agree with in \nthe area of Social Security reform. There is absolutely no question but \nthat the single, biggest fiscal policy issue facing this country today \nis the question of how we make the Social Security system a strong and \nvibrant system for generations to come and how we avoid what will be a \nfiscal disaster for our Nation if we do not address this issue in the \nnear term.\n  This problem is generated by the fact that we have a baby boom \ngeneration headed towards retirement. It is now turning age 50. In 15 \nyears, it will be fully retired. In 12 years, we will begin to retire a \nbaby boom generation that is the largest generation in the history of \nthis country. And as that generation has moved through the system, it \nhas affected this Nation in every decade throughout its life \nexperience. In the 1950s, the baby boom generation created a huge need \nfor elementary schools and baby carriages. In the 1960s, it created a \ntremendous restructuring of our social fabric with occurrences \ninvolving civil rights, involving rights of women, involving Vietnam. \nIn the 1970s, we saw further impact, and in the 1980s we have seen the \nhuge economic impact, and as we move into the 1990s, we are also seeing \nthe impact of that generation as it begins to save for retirement and \nthat is one of our primary reasons of this economic boom.\n  But the biggest impact this generation is going to have is when it \nretires, and it begins to retire in the year 2008, and not unusually, \nor not to be unexpected, in the year 2008 the Social Security system \nbegins to lose money. In fact, that is the year when we start paying \nout more in Social Security benefits than we are taking in. By the year \n2015, the Social Security system is paying out so much more than it is \ntaking in it basically cannot right itself. By the year 2029 or 2030, \nessentially the country has such a large debt and obligation under the \nSocial Security system that it will be unable, in my opinion, to afford \nto maintain that system and we will face a fiscal meltdown of sorts.\n\n  The way I describe it, it is as if we could pick a date when we know \nas a nation we were going to have a major earthquake, a major flood, a \nmajor hurricane come ashore, and we know that date exists and we know \nit is going to occur. Obviously, it would be irresponsible for us as a \nCongress not to react to that, not to take preventive action, not to \nget our people prepared for that. But we know the date when we are \ngoing to hit a fiscal crisis of inordinate proportions because the \npeople are already born who are going to create such a huge demand on \nthe system. That date is approximately the year 2015.\n  So what should we do? We should address it today. Why should we \naddress it today? Because, basically the sooner we address this, the \nsooner we can solve it in a constructive and effective way and in a \npositive way where everybody will end up being more of a winner than \nend up being a loser. It is a lot like that old oil filter ad, ``You \ncan pay me now or pay me later.'' If we begin to address this problem \ntoday, we can significantly improve the system in the long run for \neveryone. If we wait even 2 years, certainly if we wait 4 or 5 years, \nthe capacity to address it becomes much more acute and we go off a \ncliff.\n  So how should we address it? The proposal we put forward in our \nsense-of-the-Senate is that we should address it by using the surplus \nfirst to address it, and that is absolutely right. That is what should \nbe done.\n  I would note this was not the President's position. The President \nsaid we should reserve the surplus, reserve the surplus until we have \nsolved the Social Security problem. That is what he said in his State \nof the Union Address. Our position as Republicans is we should use the \nsurplus to protect the Social Security system. And one way to do that, \none way that has been proposed by myself and a number of other Members \nin this body, including the person sitting in the Chair, is to give \npeople who are presently working and paying taxes into the system and \nwho, unfortunately, are looking at a very low rate of return for all of \nthe taxes they are paying into the system--in fact, if you just \nhappened to go to work, say, you were 20 years old and you went to work \ntoday, the likelihood that you would get very much back from what you \npaid into the system in Social Security taxes is extremely low. If you \nhappen to be an African American, actually it is a negative number. You \nget less back than you will pay in.\n  So the system has some very serious problems in the way that it \nreturns benefits to people who are younger today. What we have \nsuggested is to give people today who are earning money, paying into \nthe system, let's give them some ownership. Let's give them the ability \nto have an asset which they physically own as part of their Social \nSecurity retirement structure. And these are called personal accounts.\n  Under the present system, what happens is, you pay in taxes all your \nlife. And, unfortunately, let's say you died when you were 58. If you \ndid not have a wife and you did not have children,\n\n[[Page S8724]]\n\nyou have nothing for all those taxes you paid in--absolutely nothing. \nYou have absolutely no vested interest which pays your estate anything. \nIf you had a wife or children, they might get a little bit, but not a \nwhole lot compared to what you paid in.\n  We are suggesting that some portion of the taxes that you pay into \nthe Social Security system today you should have ownership of; you \nshould actually, physically, have the right to claim, upon your \nretirement, as yours. Every year you should get a statement. You should \nhave a little savings book, basically--I didn't bring mine with me \ntoday as an example; the Senator in the chair may have his--but you \nshould have a savings book which says how much you have in your account \nat the Social Security Administration, which is yours, physically \nyours. No matter what happens, it cannot be taken away from you. Those \nare called personal accounts. Thus, if you were, unfortunately, to die \nbefore you reached the age of retirement, your estate would actually \nget an asset. It would get that money that was built up in that \naccount. That is one plus of this.\n  A second plus of this is that under the proposal we have, you would, \nessentially, get the benefit structure which Social Security gives \ntoday, but on top of that benefit structure you would be able to get \nthe benefit of the investment of that personal account. What would that \ninvestment be in? Under the proposal we put forward, it would be in one \nof a variety of what amounts to mutual funds, three or four different \nmutual funds, which you would choose, which would be under the control \nand operation of the Social Security Administration, so there wouldn't \nbe any outrageously risky investments taken. But you would have a \nchoice. You could choose a conservative investment, you could choose a \nmoderate investment--you could choose a moderate investment in \nequities.\n  Why is that important? Today, the entire Social Security fund is \ninvested in Government bonds. And what do they yield? They yield about \n2.5 percent interest. Over no 20-year period in history has the equity \nmarket yielded less than 5.5 percent. So you can see the rate of return \npeople are getting--because the average working life is 40 years--the \nrate of return people are getting on the amount which they are paying \nin Social Security taxes really is pretty weak, 2.5 percent. As I \nmentioned earlier, if you are an African American who happens to go \ninto the workforce today and you are in your early twenties, your rate \nof return is zero--it is actually a negative number.\n  But the fact is, you would have a personal account, which you would \nhave some control over, which is invested by the Social Security \nAdministration in probably three or four different mutual funds which \nyou have the right to choose from but which are set up under the Social \nSecurity auspices, much like we have, in the Federal Government, the \nThrift Savings Plan. If you are a Federal employee today, there is \nsomething called a Thrift Savings Plan, and the Thrift Savings Plan \ntrustees, who work for the Federal retirement plan, set up three \ndifferent options: You can choose a high-growth fund, a moderate-growth \nfund, or a low-growth fund--or a low-risk fund. You can put your money, \nyour savings and your retirement, into whichever one you want. This \nwould be the same idea under Social Security. You would get to choose \nwhich one of those funds you want to put your money in --a low-risk \nfund, a moderate-risk fund, a higher-risk fund.\n  When you retired, you would then own that asset. The appreciation on \nthat asset would be significantly better, we are absolutely sure, than \nthe 2.5 percent that you are presently getting under the Social \nSecurity Administration. So that is an effective way to begin the \nprocess of making the Social Security system solvent. That would be a \ntype of plan that would work.\n  The problem, of course, is, to make this work effectively, you have \nto act sooner rather than later. You cannot wait for 3 or 4 years in \norder to put this in place, because people need time to build up the \naccounts. The accounts we are suggesting do not represent your entire \nSocial Security tax. What we are suggesting is, you use 2 percent of \nyour Social Security tax. We would basically give you a tax cut for \nthat 2 percent. You would then be able to invest that in this \nretirement fund or be required to invest it in a savings fund which \nwould be managed by the Social Security trustees and would give you a \nmuch better rate of return.\n  There are a lot of other ideas out there. The point is, we need to \nget on to this issue, we need to get on to the specifics of how you are \ngoing to make the Social Security system solvent.\n  The President has been traveling around the country. He has been \ntalking about this. Many of us on the Republican side of the Senate \nhave been traveling around, also talking about this. We had a \nbipartisan group which involved myself and Senator Breaux on the Senate \nside, and Congressman Stenholm and Congressman Kolbe on the House side, \nand a whole group of people who are expert in this area. We met for 18 \nmonths, and we put together an excellent plan, part of which I have \noutlined, which would make the system solvent for the next 100 years. \nBut it is a plan; it is not specific legislation. So, what we need is \nspecific legislation.\n\n  This sense of the Senate comes forward, which essentially restates \nwhat everybody wants to do, which is make Social Security solvent. But \nit does not move along the plan. It doesn't move along how you get to \nactual legislation. If we really want to be constructive as a Senate, \nwhat we should do is probably have a sense of the Senate which calls on \nthe President to come forward with a specific plan, and have it to us \nat the end of this year, so the beginning of next year we could \nactually begin to legislate on the Social Security system and Social \nSecurity reform, because our window of opportunity here is really quite \nsmall. If we don't put in place Social Security reform legislation by \nJune of 1999, I am not sure we are even going to be able to put it into \nplace, because then we are going to do a Presidential election. If it \ngets slid past the Presidential election, we have basically missed the \nwindow of opportunity to begin to build up equity in some kind of \npersonal account or any sort of equity activity which involves \ninvesting in the market; we have given away 2 years of opportunity for \nthat type of investment activity.\n  So, what we really need is specific action. Another sense of the \nSenate is nice. It is very appropriate, I suppose, to keep making this \npoint over and over again, so it does not end up being overly \npoliticized. But the fact is, what we need to do is go from the sense \nof the Senate situation to specifics.\n  What is the difference between the two sense of the Senate amendments \nhere? I am not sure the differences are all that substantive, to be \nvery honest with you. Where the difference is, essentially, is in the \nthird point: ``save Social Security first by reserving any surpluses in \nfiscal year 1999 budget legislation.'' Our sense of the Senate adds a \nfourth item: Third, ``save Social Security first,'' which we all agree \non, and, fourth, ``return all remaining surpluses to the American \ntaxpayers.''\n  So we take it a step further. We basically add another point to the \nsense of the Senate by saying, once you have saved Social Security, \nlet's take the other part, the surplus that is left over--there may not \nbe any, but hopefully there will be--and return it to the American \ntaxpayer.\n  I would say this language, ``save Social Security first by reserving \nany surplus in the fiscal year 1999 budget legislation,'' is a little \nconfusing, because fiscal year 1999 budget legislation could either \nmean the year 1999 or it could mean the 5-year period that budget \nlegislation covers. So it is not really clear to me exactly what \nsurplus they are talking about here. Is it a 1-year surplus or is it a \n5-year surplus?\n  In any event, what we are saying is, independent of that issue, let's \nsave Social Security first. But if there is a surplus above saving \nSocial Security, let's do the right thing with it; let's return it to \nthe taxpayer.\n  Who can disagree with that? We don't want to spend it, that is for \nsure. We might want to use it to reduce debt, but of course the best \nway to reduce debt is to save Social Security. Once you have saved \nSocial Security, you have significantly reduced debt, dramatically \nreduced debt, because the biggest debt the Federal Government owes is \nto the Social Security system. So let's take that extra money, if there \nis any, and return it to the American taxpayer.\n\n[[Page S8725]]\n\n  I think our sense of the Senate maybe takes the Hollings sense of the \nSenate, which was a good attempt, good statement on its face, in many \nways, and makes it a lot stronger, because it makes it absolutely clear \nthat not only do we want to save Social Security but we also want to \nreturn any extra surplus, after we have saved Social Security, to the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, briefly I want to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from New Jersey. I ask unanimous consent I add to \nour particular amendment Senator Reid, Senator Ford, and Senator \nJohnson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. And that we have no points of order? If somebody wants \nto raise one--and it is agreed we waive any points of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized \nfor----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I note with interest that all Members \non the floor now are members of the Budget Committee, which I think is \nparticularly significant, because we are here talking about not only \nSocial Security and our obligation to make the system solvent--to \ncreate a degree of confidence that, looking out into the future, we are \ngoing to be able to say to people, some who have already worked a dozen \nyears: Worry not, we are here going to solve the problem of the \nquestion of solvency on the Social Security fund and it will be there \nfor you --but we are also, at the same point, talking about the work \ndone to get ourselves to a balanced budget point and, beyond that, to \ndevelop the surplus stream that we now see flowing very mightily.\n  The fact is, I think the Senator from South Carolina has worked so \nhard for so many years on the independence and on the solvency of the \nSocial Security trust fund that he is almost ``Mr. Social Security.'' \nNo questions are raised about Social Security when the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, isn't there defending \nthe system and defending the right of those who expect to have the \nbenefits to have them there at the time they need them.\n  We shouldn't start spending those projected surpluses that look like \nthey are going to be in abundance until we confront our biggest long-\nterm challenge, and that is to make sure that we have done the things \nnecessary to solve the questions about the Social Security trust fund.\n  We need to ensure that younger Americans can benefit from the system, \njust as their parents and their grandparents are benefiting today. Once \nwe fix that Social Security system and we have really done the job, we \ncan consider using any remaining surpluses to provide real tax relief \nto ordinary Americans, to put more money in the pockets of struggling \nmiddle-class families.\n  Yes, they are enjoying this prosperity that we have, but I don't know \nmany of them who feel like their heads are that well above water that \nthey can provide the education their children will need to help ensure \nthat they, too, will have a decent quality of life, one that is better \nthan those who are working now. They need some help, and we want to do \nit.\n  We have a commitment that, first, we are going to start putting that \nmoney into the Social Security system, so that in the later years they \nhave the reliability of the pension fund, of the Social Security fund. \nWhen we have done that, then we can, again, help the middle-class \nfamilies afford education, health care, and take care of our \ninfrastructure.\n  The point of this amendment is to say, before we start raiding \nprojected surpluses, that we have some hard work to do. We ought to \nmake the decisions that say to our young people, ``Your retirement is \ngoing to be there,'' to do exactly what it is that the President \npledged when we saw the surplus coming, and that is, save Social \nSecurity first.\n  Social Security isn't just another Government program, it is the most \nimportant social insurance program in our Nation. It has dramatically \nreduced poverty among older Americans, and it provides a critical \nsafety net for those who suffer from disabilities or the death of a \nfamily member.\n  Keep in mind that a majority of American workers have no pension \ncoverage other than Social Security; that is it. Nearly a third of all \nseniors get 90 percent or more of their income from the program. \nWithout Social Security, more than half of the elderly would live in \npoverty.\n  It is absolutely critical that we maintain this safety net for future \ngenerations. Yet, Social Security's long-term viability is now \nthreatened by the impending retirement of the baby boomers. Unless we \nact, the trust fund will become insolvent in the year 2032. Do we want \nto say to people who have already worked a dozen years of their life, \non average, that you can start to envision life in your later years \nwithout the help that comes from Social Security? We can't let that \nhappen.\n  Given the importance of solving the Social Security problem, Members \nof Congress on both sides of the aisle have supported the concept of \n``saving Social Security first.'' In fact, I remind my colleagues that \nthe Senate already has approved a budget resolution that proposes to \nsave all future budget surpluses.\n\n  I didn't support that resolution because, like some other Democrats, \nI felt it shortchanged important priorities like education and child \ncare and created procedural obstacles to comprehensive tobacco \nlegislation. But I did support the resolution's fundamental approach on \nthe use of surpluses. The budget resolution said that all new spending \nand all new tax breaks will be fully offset, and it was the right thing \nto do.\n  My friends on the Republican side of the aisle, especially the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee who sits here now, \nSenator Domenici, deserve credit for a job well done. He worked hard, \nas we all did, to get this budget into balance and to make sure that we \nstart on the road to developing some surpluses and protecting Social \nSecurity.\n  Unfortunately, some Members are now suggesting that, ``OK, we have \nsome money in the bank; it looks like it is going to be there; let's \nstart spending the projected surpluses.'' Frankly, I think it is a \npeculiar irony that we see some of those who are most concerned about \nfiscal discipline, sound fiscal policy, are now saying, ``Hey, this is \nthe time to start getting rid of these surpluses.'' I don't understand \nthat when we are so deep in the hole. No one would advise a family or a \nbusiness owner to do the same thing. When you have debt on your hands--\nand we have plenty of it, and it was noted by the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Hampshire that most of that debt belongs to the Social \nSecurity trust fund--I don't understand what it is that suddenly has \nimpelled these folks to want to now spend the money.\n  The weakening of the budget discipline seems to be based in part on \nnew budget projections released only last week by CBO. They are now \nestimating surpluses in future years will be larger than originally \nanticipated. It is great news. According to the CBO, the unified \nsurplus this year will be $63 billion, and by 2008 that figure will \ngrow for that year to $251 billion.\n  These figures are cause for celebration and they are cause for pride. \nThey show that the disciplined policies we have adopted since President \nClinton took office, including last year's bipartisan budget agreement, \nare working. Members on both sides of the aisle deserve credit for \nthat. But CBO's new projections should not be used as an excuse to \nthrow fiscal discipline out the window. They don't change the fact that \nSocial Security still faces real, long-term problems. The trust fund, I \nrepeat, will become insolvent, based on current projections, in 2032. \nWe have to do something about that before we squander any of the \nprojected budget surpluses.\n  I fully support providing tax relief to ordinary working Americans. I \nwant to strengthen at the same time our Nation's commitment to \neducation and health care. But there isn't any reason why we can't \nprovide tax relief or invest more in education, and we can do it today \nif we pay for it. What we ought\n\n[[Page S8726]]\n\nnot to do is start treating future surpluses as a giant piggy bank for \nan excuse to abandon the fiscal discipline that got us to the good \ncondition we are in today.\n  I also note that if Congress goes on a wild spending spree, the costs \nwill not be limited to the long term. We could also trifle with \ninvestor confidence, and that then could create an upset in the market, \nabout which everyone is concerned. People will be watching and saying, \n``When is the downturn going to come?'' It could threaten our economy.\n  Importantly, raiding the surplus could undermine, once again, this \ngreat opportunity that we have to secure Social Security for those in \nthe long-, long-term future. It would be unfair to those baby boomers \nand other young Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \namendment. Let's maintain our commitment to fiscal discipline. Let's \ncontinue the long-term thinking that got us to the good position we are \nin today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Let us fulfill the commitment that was made not \nimplicitly but specifically to protect the retirement benefits of \ntoday's younger Americans. Let us do the right thing. SOS: Save Social \nSecurity first.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield 10 minutes to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much, Madam President. And I thank \nSenator Gregg.\n  First, I am pleased to be on the floor to hear the discussions that \nhave taken place and pleased to hear Senator Lautenberg comment about \nour taxpayers and the need to return to the taxpayers--he described it \nhis own way--but to return to them some of their hard-earned money.\n  Actually, the difference between the two resolutions is very clear \nnow. First of all, on Social Security it could not be more clear. The \nRepublicans do not talk about 1999 and Social Security; they say: \n``Save Social Security first''-- unqualified.\n  The difference between the two resolutions is very, very simple, but \nI think rather profound. First of all, both resolutions purport to say, \nand try to say, that we want to save Social Security first. We just say \nthat, and we do not qualify it with reference to years or which \nbudgets. We just say, ``save Social Security first.'' That is No. (3) \nin our conclusionary resolves.\n  And then we add a fourth one. And I will just read it, because you \ncannot do any better than just reading the language. ``Return all \nremaining surpluses to American taxpayers.''\n  Now, that is very simple. That establishes that this resolution, \nwhich is sponsored by the chairman of the committee, Senator Gregg, \nSenator Lott, and myself, with some additional cosponsors--what we are \nsaying is, take care of Social Security, no ifs, no ands, no buts. Any \nadditional surpluses should be given back to the American taxpayers.\n  Frankly, there is a great debate occurring now on what we should do \nwith the surpluses because, believe it or not, I recall that many \nSenators said, ``We will never see the day that we have real \nsurpluses.'' What was being said was, ``Social Security moneys are \nbeing used to pay for our bills. We will never reach the day when we \nhave surpluses without using Social Security at all that are real.'' \nAnd for this discussion, I will call them ``operating surpluses.'' \n``Never will we see the day.''\n  Well, if CBO is right, Madam President, we have seen the day, as a \nmatter of fact, in the sixth year of this 10-year projection. And it is \nnot a terribly optimistic set of economics; it does not take into \naccount a real big recession, but actually in its overall calculations \nit assumes a rather moderate and then even a slight downturn in this \neconomy, and it still has, in the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth \nyears, a $40-billion-a-year operating surplus, not using a penny of \nSocial Security during those years.\n  I can recall my good friend, Senator Hollings, who is the chief \nsponsor of the resolution, which I commend him for, saying we would \nnever get to that day. And I did not think we would either, I say to \nSenator Hollings. I never thought we would. But we are there. Frankly, \nwe may be--we may be--in a position, believe it or not, when those \nsurpluses occur much sooner than that. And it may be that we can fix \nSocial Security permanently into the next century and have some very \nbig surpluses left over, for we might not need all of the Social \nSecurity money that is in this budget to fix Social Security. We may \nfix it differently and make it very solvent and truly credible for the \nnext 100 years.\n\n  What we are saying--and we want this loud and clear to the American \npeople--the American fiscal policy is such that you are paying more \ntaxes than we need to run our Government. And we are saying, when that \nday arrives that we have fixed Social Security and we still have more \nof your taxes than we need to run this Government, we are saying we \nwill give it back to you. I repeat--return all remaining surpluses to \nthe American taxpayer.\n  I would hope that rather than the two sides have an argument over \nthat, I would hope the Democrats would support ours.\n  Let me tell you, the only thing I can see that would not have them \njoining us is if they perceive that Government isn't big enough now and \nthat what we must do in the future, Madam President, if we have the \nsurpluses that we have both been talking about, is we have to save some \nof that to add more expenditures to Government.\n  Maybe it is wishing too much that both sides of the aisle would agree \non that, but I submit that we on this side of the aisle would have been \nbadly mistaken had we voted for a resolution that did not say to the \nAmerican people we have a big enough Government--we have a big enough \nGovernment. The question now is, take care of Social Security, and then \ndo not use the excess revenues which we took from the public for more \nGovernment; give it back to the people by way of tax relief.\n  That is a simple, as I indicated, but profound difference between the \ntwo resolutions. And I hope--I hope--that we leave here at 4:15 having \nturned a rather inconsequential vote into a very significant vote, \nbecause on the one hand it could be a vote that said we are going to \nsave Social Security. But we have already agreed to that. The President \nhas agreed to that. We put it in our budget resolution.\n  The difference now is that in addition to that, which we are \nreiterating, we added a second part that says: If we get there, and we \nhave these surpluses that it looks like we are going to have, then we \ndo not want to have any ifs, ands, or buts about that, we want to give \nit back to the taxpayer in tax relief.\n  I hope that the second-degree amendment sponsored by Senator Gregg, \nthe chairman of this subcommittee, Senator Lott, and myself, will be \nadopted.\n  If I have any time remaining, I yield it back and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3255, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the Gregg amendment be \nmodified to reflect the first degree status which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE BUDGET AND SOCIAL SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Social Security system provides benefits to 44 \n     million Americans, including 27.3 million retirees, over 4.5 \n     million people with disabilities, 3.8 million surviving \n     children and 8.4 million surviving adults, and is essential \n     to the dignity and security of the nation's elderly and \n     disabled;\n       (2) the Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Fund have reported \n     to the Congress that the ``total income'' of the Social \n     Security system ``is essentially to fall short of \n     expenditures beginning in 2021 and in each year thereafter . \n     . . until the assets of the combined trust funds are \n     exhausted in 2032'';\n       (3) intergenerational fairness, honest accounting \n     principles, prudent budgeting, and sound economic policy all \n     require saving Social Security first, in order that the \n     Nation may better afford the retirement of the baby boom \n     generation, beginning in 2010;\n       (4) in reforming Social Security in 1983, the Congress \n     intended that near-term Social Security trust fund surpluses \n     be used to\n\n[[Page S8727]]\n\n     prefund the retirement of the baby boom generation;\n       (5) in his State of the Union message to the joint session \n     of Congress on January 27, 1998, President Clinton called on \n     the Congress to ``save Social Security first'' and to \n     ``reserve one hundred percent of the surplus, that is any \n     penny of any surplus, until we have taken all the necessary \n     measures to strengthen the Social Security system for the \n     twenty-first century'';\n       (6) saving Social Security first would work to expand \n     national savings, reduce interest rates, enhance private \n     investment, increase labor productivity, and boost economic \n     growth;\n       (7) section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 \n     expressly forbids counting Social Security trust fund \n     surpluses as revenue available to balance the budget; and\n       (8) the CBO has estimated that the unified budget surplus \n     will reach nearly $1.5 trillion over the next ten years.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress and the President should--\n       (1) continue to rid our country of debt and work to balance \n     the budget without counting Social Security trust fund \n     surpluses;\n       (2) work in a bipartisan way on specific legislation to \n     reform the Social Security system, to ensure that it is \n     financially sound over the long term and will be available \n     for all future generations.\n       (3) save Social Security first; and\n       (4) return all remaining surpluses to American taxpayers.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I say to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, I \nhope I can get to Heaven. But if I ever get to Heaven and have to make \nan accounting to the Lord of all my sins, I hope I have you as my \nlawyer, because you are really very persuasive.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Actually, I say to the Senator, in----\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Let me tell you why you miss the point and how you \ndanced around it. Now, here is the difference. It says, ``The CBO has \nestimated''--this is the Domenici-Lott resolution; sense of the \nSenate--``The CBO has estimated that the unified budget surplus will \nreach nearly $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years.'' Absolutely false \nand in violation of section 13301, Madam President.\n  Without reading the whole thing--``Exclusion of Social Security from \nall budgets.''\n  Now, how do you get $1.5 trillion without using $1.621 trillion, \n$1.621 trillion of Social Security money? That is the first mislead \nhere. They first say that they are not going to use Social Security, \nbut then they talk about a budget surplus. And the only way they can \nreally mislead and continue the fraud and continue the campaign finance \nfund for all of us politicians to get reelected is to talk about tax \ncuts and surpluses when there are not any. There are not any, Madam \nPresident--absolutely none. But they use $1.621 trillion in order to \nget to the $1.5 trillion.\n  Now, Madam President, there is a further point to be made. Here is \nthe entire--I ask unanimous consent the trust fund surpluses from \nSocial Security alone for the next 10 years--rather than a $1.5 \ntrillion surplus, there is a $1.621 trillion deficit--I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUND SURPLUSES: CBO SUMMER 1998 BASELINE\n                                                        [By fiscal year, in billions of dollars]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         1998     1999     2000     2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007     2008\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTrust fund surplus...................................      105      117      126      130      138      146      154      165      173      181      186\nInterest received by fund............................      -46      -51      -57      -64      -70      -77      -84      -91      -99     -108     -117\n                                                      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Non-interest surplus.............................       58       66       68       66       68       69       71       74       74       73       70\nTrust fund balance, end of fiscal year...............      736      853      978    1,108    1,246    1,392    1,547    1,712    1,885    2,066    2,252\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS.

Now, we find out with this, Social Security is only \none-half of the problem. The truth of the matter is that this year we \nwill owe--these are CBO figures--$732 billion. We will owe Medicare, \n$113 billion; and the hospital and SMI, $34 billion; military \nretirement, $133 billion; a deficit in civilian retirement of $460 \nbillion; a deficit in the unemployment compensation of $72 billion; a \ndeficit in the highway trust fund of $23 billion; a deficit in the \nairport trust fund of $10 billion; a deficit in the railroad retirement \ntrust fund of $20 billion; and others, like Federal Financing Bank of \n$55 billion.\n  I only limited it to 1 year, trying to get their attention to what is \ngoing on this particular year. We can extend it out. There is no \ndifference there. But don't go along with this continued fraud. Don't \ngo along with this continued trickery. There is $1.652 trillion \noverall. Social Security is less than half; almost $1 trillion from the \nmilitary retirement and civilian retirees and unemployment fund.\n  So the Government, us politicians, have been running around and \ngabbing about everyone. I thought I could get the seniors to pay \nattention to Social Security, but they are only paying attention to \nMedicare and Medicaid. I have been trying my best to get them in that \nparticular movement. The military retirees don't understand it, and \ncivilian retirees don't understand it at all.\n  So what is really wrong is not only that CBO has estimated the \nunified budget surplus will reach nearly $1.5 trillion when there is no \nsurplus, they act like they are trying to give dignity and credibility \nto unified budgets. There is no surplus. Look on page 11 of the CBO \nreport, and for the next 10 years there is listed a deficit, gross \ndeficit. It is listed there in the column like I emphasized--otherwise, \nreturning all remaining surpluses.\n  At this point, tell me, where is a surplus in the Government \naccounts? None--N-O-N-E. In fact, deficits--they mislead and say once \nwe make a plan for Social Security, we can continue to spend the \nMedicare trust funds, the military retirement, the civilian retirement, \nthe unemployment, the railroad retirement, the highway trust fund, the \nFederal Financing Bank. All of these are deficits--not surpluses.\n  So they say I hope we can get together and fuzz it all up, and there \nis really no difference here. This is a cancer, I emphasize again, a \nfiscal cancer because unless and until it shows instead of surpluses \nover the next 5 years--and that is what we are talking about, this \nyear's deficit, $557 billion spent more than we take in. Deficits, \ndeficits, deficits--not surpluses. And we add that to the national \ndebt, the interest costs go up. According to June O'Neill, it doesn't, \nbut I can tell you right now it will go up.\n  You can see Mr. Greenspan hedging his bet right now. When we do that, \nwe will go back to the interest rates we had 10 years ago, and we are \ngoing to be eaten alive. So we have fiscal cancer. Nobody wants to talk \nabout it, and we want to come up on the floor of the U.S. Senate with \nthis nebulous language ``return all remaining surpluses to the American \ntaxpayer.'' If you have them, Brother Hollings would be for that. But I \ndon't want to mislead the American public. I haven't been nearly 50 \nyears in public office to come here with this kind of fraud and \ndoubletalk\n\n[[Page S8728]]\n\nto the American people. There are no surpluses. I challenge them to \npoint out the surplus in the highway fund, point out the surplus in \nMedicare, point out the surplus in military retirement, point out the \nsurplus in civilian retirees, in unemployment, railroad retirement, \nFederal Financing Bank, all of the rest of them.\n  All of them are in deficit. That is why the debt has gone through the \nceiling, and that is why we are increasing spending faster than we can \ncut it. It is $1 billion a day we are increasing spending on the \ninterest costs on the national debt. Who in his right mind is going to \ncut spending $365 billion? That is our problem. The best way to ignore \nit is to put it under the rug, come in here and ``return all remaining \nsurpluses.'' They still want to use that language to give in to Speaker \nGingrich over on the House side; that is what they are trying to do.\n\n  That is why we are raising this all-important point right now. If I \ncan get their attention, just this 1 year we will have accomplished our \nintent here. I retain the balance of our time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been interested in seeing the \nresponses of some who come to the floor and say we support this ``save \nSocial Security first'' notion, and we want to add to it and make it \nbetter.\n  I bet when this vote is over, within 24 hours we will have them or \ntheir cousins or their kin or their friends talking about how big the \nsurplus is and how much of a tax cut they want to give.\n  The question is, Where do you think they can provide the money to \nfund a tax cut if they are not to dip into the Social Security trust \nfunds, and to go back on exactly what they are now proposing in the \nGregg amendment, which is to save Social Security first?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly. That is what they intend to do. But they think \nthe politician makes his own little laws and sits attentive to his own \napplause--Plato's famous words.\n  The language, the image--it is a scandal. It really is a scandal. We \nare going broke, and we are talking about surpluses when we have \nnothing but deficit all around us.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might it be the case that those who say, ``Yes, let's \nsave Social Security first,'' don't really mean that? They want to \nprotect the trust funds because the same people who are talking about \nadditional tax cuts right now can only get it by taking the Social \nSecurity trust funds. Could it be they don't understand the language of \nsaving Social Security first, which means protecting the Social \nSecurity trust funds?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. My dear colleague, they understand the language. They \nknow exactly what they are doing. I can tell you here and now as a \nGovernor who went before Standard & Poor's, went before Moody and got a \ntriple A credit rating, we wouldn't have any rating at all, the U.S. \nGovernment on its bonds, this very minute with these kinds of deficits. \nYou couldn't doubletalk Wall Street about surpluses. Wall Street goes \nalong with the unified because it is business for them. That is why I \npointed out the difference between corporate and the country's economy.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand it would be in my interest to provide tax \ncuts all the time, I suppose, if we could afford to do that.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That would be lovely. Reelect me, I am for all the tax \ncuts. Whoopee.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will continue to yield, if we are \ncollecting more money than is necessary for the Government, it ought to \ngo back to the folks who send it in, no question about that.\n  But the question is, we have a debt of nearly $6 trillion and we have \na problem in Social Security, as the Senator from South Carolina has \npointed out. Just after World War II there were a lot of warm feelings \naround this country and we had the biggest baby crop ever produced in \nAmerican history. People liked each other a lot and we had a lot of \nbabies. Those babies are fixing to retire soon, and when they hit the \nretirement rolls it will be a maximum strain on the Social Security \nsystem. We have accrued surpluses year after year to meet that test for \nthe baby boomers' retirement and those surpluses are invested in \ngovernment bonds.\n  When the folks over here say well, gee, now we have the Congressional \nBudget Office that tells us there is a surplus, they are taking one \npage of the CBO report. They are forgetting the other page. The other \npage says if you include the Social Security fund in your budget \ntotals, there is a surplus. But if you don't count the Social Security \nfund--which you shouldn't be able to do, because that money is paid \ninto a trust fund for only one purpose--if you don't count the Social \nSecurity trust fund, there is no surplus.\n  Those folks are going to the second page, taking the number they \nwant, and saying not only is there a surplus--which there isn't--but \nwith the surplus we want to provide a big tax cut.\n  When? The month before the election. Gee, that is Politics 101, I \nsuppose, but it is not good government. That is the purpose of the \namendment that is offered by the Senator from South Carolina. It says, \nlet us do with the Social Security trust funds what we promised the \nAmerican people we would do--that is, save them for Social Security \nneeds when the baby boomers retire.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. They are telling the baby boomers they are the problem \nwhen we are charging them. They are not the problem; it is us adults on \nthe floor of the Congress. The baby boomers are not the problem. We \nprovided in the Greenspan Commission and in the law passed and signed \nby President George Bush on November 5, 1990, to take care of the baby \nboomers. Instead of taking care of them, we are continuing to charge \nthem and, at the same time, telling them there is going to be a problem \nin the next generation when we are causing the problem.\n  I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you. Madam President, I will just take a few \nminutes out of the distinguished Senator's time to illustrate what is \nbeing discussed here in as direct and simple terms as possible. This \nchart really does it.\n  For years now, the Senator from South Carolina has been sounding the \nalarm. He has been the Paul Revere of Social Security for years now. He \nis always calling our attention to the fact that, yes, we now have \nenough to fund the needs of the Social Security payout program, the \nbeneficiaries. But look out for the future, watch out, there is a train \nwreck coming. And he works at it all the time to make it abundantly \nclear. I hope the message gets through. He endorses, as we do, and as \nour friends on the other side of the aisle said today--and I will use \nthe word perhaps ``admitted'' today--the best idea is to save Social \nSecurity first.\n  Well, frankly, I was a little astounded at what I heard here. In the \nsame breath, they said we are taking in more than we need to spend for \nGovernment, so essentially let's get rid of that which is left over. I \nwonder if the same proponents of that type of a policy would say to \ntheir kids, ``Listen, kids, if you have more money than you need today, \nspend it.'' I doubt it. Would you, if you were running a business, \ndecide that if you had more than you needed for today's expenses, you \nwould go ahead and spend it?\n  I ran a big corporation before I came here. One of the things that we \nalways tried to do was to make sure that we were putting away the funds \nnecessary for long-term investment, for new programs, for new \nmarketing, for new production, to make sure that we would be ready for \nthe future to stay competitive. That is what we are saying now. We are \nsaying, yes, yes, to tax relief for hard-working Americans. But the \nfirst thing that we committed to do is to make sure that we save Social \nSecurity. I use the term ``SOS,'' which is the international call for \nhelp--save our security, save our Social Security--SOS.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has been the one who stood here in \nthe face of all kinds of opposition and worked hard to make sure that \nthe message got through. Finally, it is getting through. And now, as it \ngets through, we want to spend it.\n  Here is the picture in very simple terms. In the 5 years, including \n1999 to 2003, we will have a surplus that includes Social Security--\nincludes Social Security. I repeat, we take in on Social Security more \nthan we spend; thus, we\n\n[[Page S8729]]\n\nare able to portray a surplus--$520 billion in 5 years. Now, if we take \nout the Social Security surplus--that means the funds that the people \npay in through their payroll taxes--we wind up with a $137 billion \ndeficit. So we ought not to continue this sleight of hand, as I call \nit, which is what is helping us to create these surpluses.\n  From 1999 to 2008, the surplus is Social Security; $1.540 trillion is \ncreated because we include the Social Security balance in there. And if \nwe follow the policy that we have developed now, we will use those \nfunds to project the life of Social Security off into the future--into \nthe foreseeable future, beyond 2070. If we don't use the Social \nSecurity surplus, we wind up, in this same period of time, with $31 \nbillion compared to $1.5 trillion.\n\n  So when I hear that, yes, we want to save Social Security, oh, \nabsolutely; we want to send the message out to those who will come of \nretirement age in the years ahead that it will be there for you. But it \ncan't be there for you if we spend it now, if we go ahead and do as we \nhave heard said and subscribe to the Republican policy of huge tax \ncuts, as it comes over from the House. Get rid of this surplus; get rid \nof it now; let everybody feel good; let everybody believe this is good \nbusiness practice --while we go broke in the process and create debts \nthat we will never be able to meet.\n  So I hope that we will take the amendment by the Senator from South \nCarolina and get it passed. I like the amendment that we hear about \nfrom the Senator from New Hampshire because in it they say very \nclearly, save Social Security first. The language is precise: ``and \nreturn all remaining surpluses to the American taxpayer.'' So there is \nfirst and there is second. The second part of this is returning the \nsurpluses to the American taxpayer. Everybody wants to see tax relief \navailable to those who are working and trying to take care of their \nfamilies' needs and provide education and job opportunities. But we \ncan't do it with this kind of hocus-pocus that we are seeing here.\n  Nobody here who understands financial balance sheets would permit \nthis kind of thinking to overtake their judgment if they were running a \nbusiness. I would not, and I know the Senator from South Carolina would \nnot, and our colleagues on the other side would not do it, either. But \nwhen you sprinkle it with a little bit of politics in there, the tune \nchanges, and the tune is: Spend it while you got it, baby. That is what \nis being said here on the floor of the Senate. I think, frankly, it is \nthe kind of a message that the American people will see through.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I yield the Senator from Texas 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Commerce, \nState, Justice Committee for yielding. Every once in awhile, we have a \ndebate on something that really defines the choice that the American \npeople face every 2 years when they go to the polls and decide whether \nthey want a Republican majority in Congress or a Democrat majority in \nCongress. Many of the things we vote on, we agree on. Often, the \ndistinctions are not so clear. And often the issues where they are \nclear, don't appear to be big at the time. But why I think the vote we \nare about to have at 4:15 is a very important vote and why I think the \nissue is significant--or at least it should be--to Americans who sit \ndown every night around their kitchen table and get out a pencil and \nhave the back of an envelope, and at the first of the month they take \nthe amount of the paycheck and write it at the top of the envelope and \nthey start subtracting bills they have to pay and try to figure out if \nthey are going to make ends meet and whether they are coming out ahead \nthat month--why this issue is a defining issue between the two parties \nis that there is one small, but significant, difference between the two \nresolutions that are before us. First of all, there are two very fine \nresolutions. They both talk about the fact that we are blessed by \nhaving a very strong and vibrant economy.\n  We are blessed by having a lot of Americans who are working, and that \nwe have joined together, at least to this point, in a bipartisan \ncommitment to try to save Social Security, which implies two things--\nNo. 1, we admit, on a bipartisan basis, that it needs saving; No. 2, we \nare willing to do the heavy lifting to get the job done.\n  I know Senator Gregg has a plan and has been willing to take a \ncourageous stand in showing us how we can save Social Security. Senator \nDomenici and I are working on a program to try to save Social Security \nand protect its benefits. So the difference here is not about Social \nSecurity, the difference is, What do you do if you save Social Security \nand there is still some money left? Our resolution says that, A, we \nwant to save Social Security first, but we want to return all remaining \nsurpluses to the American taxpayer.\n\n  That is the difference between these two resolutions.\n  Why is that important? Why that is important is that if you take \nFederal, State, and local taxes, the tax burden on American families \ntoday is at the highest level in American history. Never in the history \nof this country--at the peak of the war effort in World War II, at the \npeak of the war effort in the Civil War--have we ever had working \nAmericans face and bear a higher tax burden than they have today.\n  What Republicans are saying is, first of all, we want to live up to \nour obligations; we want to save Social Security not with a slogan but \nwith a real program, to begin to shift from a Social Security based on \nthe debt of the Federal Government to a Social Security based on \ninvestment and wealth. That is the way we believe we can save Social \nSecurity. Obviously, we are going to have a debate on that.\n  But the resolutions before us--both fine resolutions, but the \ndifference is, our resolution has a part 4; and the part 4 is: Return \nall remaining surplus after we save Social Security to the American \ntaxpayer. We believe the tax burden is too high. So we want to save \nSocial Security first. But if money remains after we do that job, we \nwant to give it back to taxpayers.\n  Let me tell you why we are concerned, why we think Congress needs to \ngo on record.\n  The President proposed a budget this year. At the same moment he was \nsaying save Social Security first, he proposed a budget that had $56 \nbillion worth of new discretionary spending programs busting the \nspending caps that we agreed to only last year.\n  What we are saying in our resolution is, we do not intend to see \nthose spending caps breached, we do not intend to increase Government \nspending; we intend to hold the line on spending, tax the surplus, save \nSocial Security with a real investment-based system that belongs to the \nindividual worker, and then to the extent that there is any money \nleft--and if we hold the line on spending, there will be money left, \ntens, hundreds, of billions of dollars left ultimately--we want that to \ngo back to American families.\n  What would we like it to go back in the form of? We would like to \nrepeal the marriage penalty. We have voted on an amendment that I \noffered this year to repeal the marriage penalty so that we don't have \nthis absurd situation where people fall in love and get married and \nthey end up giving the Government $1,400 additional income for the \nright to live in holy matrimony. Unfortunately, that was a bill that \ndidn't become law.\n  One of the things we want to do with the money that is left when we \nsave Social Security, if there is money, is we want to repeal the \nmarriage penalty. We happen to believe that families are important. I \nbelieve, and believe very strongly, that we are overfeeding government. \nWe are starving the one institution in America that really works. That \ninstitution is the family.\n  I would like to stretch out the income tax brackets. The average \nfamily in America is a two-wage-earner family. It earns $49,000 a year. \nIt is in the 28-percent marginal tax bracket. I would like to link them \nto a 15-percent bracket so that more struggling American families who \nare trying to own their own home, trying to send their children to \ncollege, can continue to stay in that lower tax bracket longer.\n  Finally, I would like to junk the current unfair, complicated--and \nunfath-\nomable to most Americans, including me--Tax Code we have now and go to \na\n\n[[Page S8730]]\n\nsimple system that has flatter rates and that is comprehensible to the \ntaxpayer, so that people can fill their tax return out in some \nsemblance of some form they understand.\n  This is a big issue on a relatively minor resolution. What is the \nsense of the Senate? Some would say that it is sort of an oxymoron to \nbe talking about it. But to the extent there is, are we simply trying \nto save Social Security, or do we want to go a step further and say \nthat, if we save Social Security, if any money is left, we want it to \ngo back to the taxpayer instead of being spent? That is what we say.\n  I hope people will vote for our resolution.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, let me go right to the point made by \nthe distinguished Senator from Texas. He said, ``We believe the tax \nburden is too high.'' We all agree on that. But what is increasing that \ntax burden rather than decreasing it is this profligate spending, \nincreasing the deficit, and increasing the debt.\n  If you look on page 11 of the Congressional Budget Office report, you \nfind out that we increase spending over what we bring in for the next \n10 years, and there is nothing but deficits. There are not any \nsurpluses. There are not any surpluses.\n  Go right to the point of, yes, the President did submit a budget, and \nhe increased spending $70 billion. You look on page 10 where the total \nwent up to $1.721 trillion. The budget that passed the Senate with the \nvote of the distinguished Senator from Texas increased spending $70 \nbillion. The President is guilty. The Congress is guilty.\n  This Senator tried a budget freeze. We had a vote on it last year, \ntried it again in the Budget Committee, and couldn't get any support. \nThey call it the ``Fritz freeze.''\n  But the whole point is, return all moneys or surpluses to the \ntaxpayers. Common sense would indicate that there must be some \nsurpluses after Social Security.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this chart printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              TABLE 4.--CBO PROJECTIONS OF INTEREST COSTS AND FEDERAL DEBT\n                                                                    [By fiscal year]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   Actual\n                                    1997      1998      1999      2000      2001      2002      2003      2004      2005      2006      2007      2008\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       NET INTEREST OUTLAYS (BILLIONS OF DOLLARS)\n \nInterest on Public Debt (Gross         356       363       363       365       363       360       357       357       357       356       354       352\n interest) a....................\nInterest Received by Trust\n Funds:\n    Social Security.............       -41       -46       -51       -57       -64       -70       -77       -84       -91       -99      -108      -117\n    Other trust funds b.........       -64       -67       -67       -70       -72       -73       -75       -77       -79       -81       -84       -86\n                                 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Subtotal..................      -105      -113      -118      -128      -136      -143      -151      -161      -170      -180      -191      -202\nOther Interest c................        -7        -6        -7        -6        -7        -7        -8        -8        -9        -9       -10       -10\n                                 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total.....................       244       244       238       232       221       209       198       189       178       166       153       140\n \n                                                FEDERAL DEBT AT THE END OF THE YEAR (BILLIONS OF DOLLARS)\n \nGross Federal Debt..............     5,370     5,475     5,594     5,721     5,845     5,927     6,021     6,102     6,174     6,205     6,223     6,222\n                                 =======================================================================================================================\nDebt Held by Government\n Accounts:\n    Social Security.............       631       736       853       978     1,108     1,246     1,392     1,547     1,712     1,885     2,066     2,252\n    Other accounts b............       968     1,022     1,087     1,154     1,219     1,286     1,354     1,419     1,481     1,541     1,600     1,650\n                                 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Subtotal..................     1,599     1,757     1,939     2,132     2,327     2,532     2,746     2,966     3,193     3,426     3,665     3,902\n                                 =======================================================================================================================\nDebt Held by the Public.........     3,771     3,717     3,655     3,589     3,518     3,395     3,275     3,136     2,981     2,779     2,557     2,320\nDebt Subject to Limit d.........     5,328     5,437     5,557     5,685     5,810     5,893     5,988     6,072     6,145     6,178     6,196     6,196\n \n                                                           FEDERAL DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP\n \nDebt Held by the Public.........      47.3      44.3      41.7      39.3      37.1      34.3      31.6      28.9      26.3      23.5      20.7      18.0\n \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Source: Congressional Budget Office.\n \n Note.--Projections of interest and debt assume that discretionary spending will equal the statutory caps that are in effect through 2002 and will grow\n  at the rate of inflation in succeeding years.\n \na.

I have asked \nthe other side that sponsors this resolution to, for heaven's sake, \nshow that dumb Senator from South Carolina where the surplus is. Show \nme the surplus, and I will hush and vote for your resolution. But you \ncan't show me a surplus.\n  There is nothing but deficits in these reports. And mislead the \npublic so that we can use Social Security as a slush fund to reelect \nourselves--that is what we are doing. It is the greatest campaign \nfinance abuse that I know of to continually have the word ``surplus'' \ncome out of the mouth of that side of the aisle. There ought to be \nashes in their mouths. They oppose--in fact, still are.\n  Down in South Carolina, I have a young Republican colleague running \naround hollering ``the biggest tax increase in history.'' Of course, we \nknow it was under President Reagan and Senator Dole. That has been \nanalyzed in every newspaper. But I plead guilty, I voted for that tax \nincrease. It is not the biggest.\n  What happened was, we cut spending $250 billion. Yes, we increased \ntaxes $250 billion. We downsized the Government by over 300,000 Federal \nemployees. That is what has the economy good--lowest unemployment, \nlowest inflation rate, biggest business investment, stock market \nthrough the ceiling, more home ownership, more young children getting \nhelp in receiving health care. We are in good shape.\n  If we can't talk the truth to each other now about where we stand \nfiscally, we never will. This is one grand fraud. That is what has \noccurred.\n  For those who fought us on down the line, instead of $250 billion--\nyes, the revenues went up.\n  Where is the amendment that says do away with the Social Security \nincrease that we put in that they are now blaming me for? Where is the \namendment that says we reduce the gas tax increase that they are \nblaming me for? I go home and they are blaming me. Yet, they want to \ncome up here and holler, ``Oh, the economy is so good; man, we got \nsurpluses everywhere; now what is in order is, let's all now have a \nbunch of tax cuts.''\n  I want to expose that fraud. Don't go along with this Republic \nresolution to fuzz it, using the word ``surpluses.'' As my sister used \nto say, ``Saying it so doesn't make it so.''\n  There is no surplus. If they can find one in the Federal Government, \nGod bless them. I will join me. But these are all deficits.\n  I ask unanimous consent, once again, to have this chart of the budget \nrealities printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be

1962 CBO's 1998 Economic and Budget\n  Outlook.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will give it to my colleague from New Hampshire, and \nhe can get everything, the Congressional Budget Office figures. And the \nmain point to be made, Madam President, is just that. Where you see an \nactual surplus down here in 1998 that they project of $63 billion, in \norder to do that they had to use trust funds of $168.3 billion. They \nused not only Social Security but all the rest. And then where they \nproject for next year an $80 billion surplus, they had to use $199 \nbillion in trust funds from Social Security and the retirement funds. \nThat is how they talk that language. And I am trying to stop the \ndoubletalk and talk sense to the American people.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I just wanted to return to the specifics \nof the resolution, because I do think it is important to note that the \nresolution put forward by the Democratic membership is a resolution \nwhich tracks the statements made by the President in his State of the \nUnion Address, which were that we should save Social Security first, we \nshould reserve the surplus until we have saved Social Security first.\n  That is a paraphrase, but I think it is an accurate paraphrase. In \nother words, the President did not say, ``We shall use the surplus to \nsave Social Security.'' No, he chose his words very precisely. He said, \n``We would reserve the surplus until Social Security is saved.'' If you \nlook at this proposal brought forward by the Democratic leadership, it \nsays, ``Save Social Security first by reserving any surplus.'' It \ndoesn't say the surplus is going to be used. It says they are going to \nreserve it, again.\n  What is the difference here? We are saying use the surplus to save \nSocial Security. They are saying reserve the surplus until Social \nSecurity has been saved. So all of the arguments they have made \nrelative to the surplus and how it ties into the need to have the \nsurplus for the purposes of benefiting the Social Security system \nreally are not supported by the terms and specifics of their language \nbecause they are not even saying they intend to use the surplus to save \nSocial Security. They are saying they are going to reserve the surplus \nuntil Social Security is saved, which leads one to the conclusion that \nmaybe what they are planning is some change, some horrific change to \nthe Social Security system where they are going to cut benefits and \nslash here and slash there so that they can pump up the surplus and \nhave saved the Social Security system and still have a surplus to \nspend.\n  You can read their language to say that. You can't read our language \nto say that. Our language says, ``Use the surplus to save Social \nSecurity.'' So the histrionics around here are a bit much, and I don't \nknow what they\n\n[[Page S8732]]\n\nmean. I don't know what they mean when they say ``reserve.'' I don't \nknow what they mean when they say, ``The surpluses in the year 1999 \nbudget legislation'' because that doesn't necessarily mean the year \n1999. That could mean the next 5 years, for all I know, that the budget \nlegislation expires.\n  So this is a resolution that is, to be kind, imprecisely drafted, or \nmaybe it isn't imprecisely drafted. Maybe they intended to obfuscate \nthe issue by using the term ``reserve,'' obfuscate the issue by using \nthe term ``1999 budget legislation.'' We do not obfuscate the issue. We \nsay, ``Save Social Security first,'' period. None of this qualifying \nlanguage about reserving anything. And then we say, and we don't \nobfuscate this either, to the extent that there remains a surplus, \n``Give it back to the American taxpayers.'' Give them a tax cut. Across \nthis country in State legislatures where the surpluses are being added \nup--along with our Federal surplus, most States are running surpluses \n--we are seeing tax cut after tax cut because the States understand \nthat they are taking in more than the government needs. You shouldn't \nspend it. You shouldn't create new programs. You should return it to \nthe taxpayers.\n  Now, the Senator from South Carolina has spent a considerable amount \nof time--in fact, he was kind enough to give me his numbers, and they \nare very nice numbers, presented very nicely, well formatted--on how \nthere is no surplus out there besides the Social Security surplus. \nWell, I know the Senator from South Carolina is a student of the \nbudget. In fact, he is one of the most knowledgeable people around \nhere. I would simply refer him to the CBO numbers which say in the \noutyears there is a surplus independent of the Social Security system, \nindependent of the Social Security system. In other words, there is a \nsurplus beginning in the year 2005, which is a surplus that is not \ngenerated in any relationship to the surplus in the Social Security \ntrust fund, and in 2006, in 2007, and in 2008, and beyond that maybe--\nwe hope. But in any event, over that 4-year period, and that adds up to \nalmost, by my calculations, $150 billion of surplus, which is an \nonbudget surplus generated not by the Social Security surplus but \ngenerated after you have taken into account Social Security payments.\n\n  So the CBO is telling us there is a distinct potential for there to \nbe a surplus which has nothing to do with the Social Security trust \nfunds. Not only is there a potential; they say there is going to be \none, specifically saying. So I believe the Senator from South Carolina \nhas misspoken on that point, or I disagree with his position on that \npoint. He may not have misspoken. I am disagreeing with his position, \nbecause I am looking at the CBO July update which says there is a \nsurplus.\n  Should we use that surplus for something other than Social Security? \nMy own personal opinion is no. No. The onbudget surplus, that I just \ntalked about, should probably be also used for the purposes of \naddressing the Social Security issue. That happens to be my personal \nposition. The way it should be done is by cutting taxes, which is what \nwe happen to mention here in our amendment. We should cut taxes.\n  What tax should we cut? We should cut the Social Security tax. Why? \nBecause it is the most regressive tax which we have. It is assessed \nacross the board. Every wage earner pays it, and it is extraordinarily \nhigh. In fact, for most wage earners in America today, the Social \nSecurity tax is higher than their income tax. And it has no \nrelationship to your total income; it simply is applied to your wage \nbase. So it should be cut.\n  That is our proposal. It happens to be a bipartisan proposal. In \nfact, I think it now has something like seven or eight sponsors almost \nevenly divided between the Democrat and Republican side of the aisle \nhere. And what we propose is to cut the Social Security tax by 2 \npercent, allow people to take that money, invest it in a savings \nvehicle managed by the Social Security Administration, which will give \nthem a better return and give them physical ownership of that asset as \nwe have discussed earlier.\n  So substantively I believe the proposal that I have brought forward \nhere that is cosponsored by Senator Lott, Senator Domenici, Senator \nGramm, and Senator Mack is a better idea. It says, ``Save Social \nSecurity,'' period. That has to be done. It has to be done first. And \nthen if there is a surplus, let's return it to the American taxpayer. \nIt doesn't say there will definitely be a surplus, but if we look at \nthe CBO numbers, we know there is a distinct possibility that there \nwill be a surplus because they are scoring one for us. It does not \nobfuscate the issue with words like ``reserve'' and words like ``fiscal \nyear 1999 budget legislation.'' Pretty blunt.\n  So I think if the membership wants to choose a clear, concise, \nspecific statement that says Social Security will be saved and will be \nsaved first, and that then we will look at cutting taxes for the \nAmerican taxpayer, they will want to choose the amendment offered by \nmyself. If they wish to choose an amendment which is a little more \nopaque in its presentation and does not address the issue of cutting \ntaxes, then they will choose one presented by the Democratic \nleadership.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. Certainly.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I think we can bring this right into focus for \neveryone. The Senator was reading from page 10 about surplus, and I \nhave already been critical, of course, of the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office, because that is using surplus funds, that \nis using trust funds and moving them. The question would be--just turn \nthe page--on page 11 you have the Federal debt, 2002, $5.927 trillion, \nand then why, if you have surpluses those years that you are talking \nabout, and return those surpluses to the taxpayers--why is it, in 2003 \nit increases, in 2004, in 2005, in 2006, in 2007, 2008--why does the \ndebt go up, if you have surpluses?\n  Mr. GREGG. As the Senator knows, there are a lot of other functions. \nBut I am looking at the surplus, at the deficit surplus function, on \nbudget, July: $37 million, $46 million, $45 million, $1 million, $11 \nmillion, zero; then we go into surplus, $5 million, $44 million, $55 \nmillion, $65 million.\n  We can spend the entire day here debating what the CBO means when it \nputs a surplus number out which says an on-budget surplus number. But \nthe numbers are there. The Senator said find me a place where we can \nshow a surplus. I found him a place. He wants to try to talk now about \ngross debt--\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is exactly right, because that is not a surplus. \nThey are using trust funds. That is exactly my point. That is what the \nwhole debate is about: Save Social Security.\n  Mr. GREGG. Didn't the Senator ask me to answer his question? I \nbelieve I answered his question by pointing out to where it has shown a \nsurplus. So, obviously, there is an opportunity here to show a surplus \nindependent of the Social Security investments.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. What fund shows a surplus? Because the Federal debt \ngoes up each year. So you show me--that is what I am saying: Name the \nsurplus. I agree she used the word ``surplus.''\n  Mr. GREGG. That is $169 billion, according to the CBO numbers, \nbetween the period 2004 and 2008.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is by using, of course, all these Social Security \nmoneys.\n  Mr. GREGG. No; that is independent of Social Security.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, 2004-2008, you use the year 2004, $154 \nbillion of Social Security moneys to make it a slush fund; 2005, $166 \nbillion; 2006, $173 billion; 2007, $181 billion; 2008, $187 billion.\n  That is how you use the word ``surplus.''\n  Mr. GREGG. No, that is not the same at all.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. What fund here is in surplus?\n  Mr. GREGG. Let's go back to the unified budget surplus.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Unified.\n  Mr. GREGG. If you use the Social Security trust funds, the surpluses \nin 2004 would be $154 billion. If we don't use the unified, you get a \nzero number.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If you use Social Security.\n  Mr. GREGG. If you use the unified, you get $171 billion. If you don't \nuse--those are surpluses that are independent of the Social Security \nsystem.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The Senator and I agree that we are using Social \nSecurity and not saving Social Security. That is what the whole debate \nis about.\n  Mr. GREGG. No, we are not using Social Security. If I may restate the\n\n[[Page S8733]]\n\npoint, CBO numbers, which came out on July 15, showed fairly \ndefinitively that there is a surplus, independent of the Social \nSecurity trust fund, of approximately $169 billion.\n  The Senator may not accept those numbers. He may not like those \nnumbers. He may feel those numbers are inaccurately, inappropriately \narrived at. But those are the numbers which we have been given. Which \nleads to the secondary point, because the numbers are really almost \nirrelevant to the debate. It leads to the secondary point here, which \nis the key point, which is that there is a potential to give the \nAmerican taxpayers a tax cut. Let's give it to them. Let's lock in the \nstatement, ``We want to give a tax cut, if there is a surplus in excess \nof what we need to benefit the Social Security system and make it \nsolvent.''\n  Why would we walk away from the opportunity to say to the American \ntaxpayer, ``If we can make the Social Security system solvent, after we \nhave done that, if we have extra money, we are going to give you a tax \ncut?'' Why would we ever want to walk away from such a statement? I \nthink it is a fairly reasonable statement, a clear statement, concise \nstatement, unlike the statement from the Democratic leadership which is \ntotally--which is very hard to understand because it uses terms like \n``reserve,'' uses terms like ``fiscal year 1999 budget legislation,'' \nboth of which are terms of art and which are very hard to understand, \nwould be very hard to even get a legal definition of, much less a \ncommonsense definition of.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, assuming the Senator was correct, the \nreason you don't walk away, if you can possibly ever quit using Social \nSecurity as a slush fund, is the almost $1 trillion--that is why I put \nthis chart in--from Medicare. We are still using Medicare. There is a \nsurplus in Medicare right now. We have debated that. But we are using \nthat to balance the budget. Military retirement, civilian retirement, \nunemployment, highway, airport moneys, railroad retirement, the other \nfunds there, Federal Financing Bank and others--it is $1 trillion worth \nof other moneys.\n  If we could ever stop using those, which are deficits, and make them \nbalance, just in the black instead of in the red, then I would go along \nwith all the tax cuts. I want to go along with the tax cuts anyway. I \nvoted to save the tax increase on guns just yesterday. I voted to cut \nthe other so-called penalty, marriage penalty, on another item. I don't \nmind cutting taxes. But, overall, let's not act like we have money to \nspend when we are going broke, and that causes the debt to increase, \nwhich causes the interest costs to increase, which causes the waste to \nincrease.\n  They act like, ``We can play the game and we will get to it later.'' \nThat is what is really hurting us, the $1-billion-a-day interest costs \non the national debt for absolutely nothing.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise to support Senator Hollings' \namendment. This amendment puts the Senate on record in support of \nSaving Social Security first. It says before we do anything with the \nbudget surplus, whether that is cutting taxes or funding worthwhile \nprograms, we must ensure the solvency of Social Security. This is a \nvery important vote. It expresses our commitment to the Social Security \nsystem for the millions of Americans who currently rely on Social \nSecurity. It also sends a powerful message to the millions of Americans \nwho have come to doubt that Social Security will be there for them when \nthey retire.\n  I support this amendment because I believe that promises made must be \npromises kept. We must be thoughtful and cautious when addressing the \nneeds of a system that so many Americans count on, especially elderly \nwomen and disabled children. We need to ensure that we have the \nresources necessary to put Social Security on a sound footing, for both \nthe short-term and the long-term.\n  Now we are in the midst of a historic event: the first federal budget \nsurplus in decades. We've gone from a record deficit of $290 billion in \nthe last year of the Bush Administration to a projected surplus of $80 \nbillion for fiscal year 1998. There is no end to the proposals on how \nto use this ``extra'' money. I believe that we should follow President \nClinton's lead and not commit the surplus to any program until we first \nresolve the long-term solvency of the Social Security system.\n  When you remove the Social Security Trust Fund from the budget \ncalculation, there is no surplus and the budget isn't balanced. The \nSocial Security Trust Fund is an important part of our current fiscal \ngood fortune. We must continue to work to bring the budget into true \nbalance without counting Social Security Trust Fund balances. In the \npast, I have voted to remove the Social Security Trust Fund from the \nfederal budget calculation and I will continue to do so in the future. \nWhile Social Security is still in the overall budget calculation, any \nbudget surplus should not be used to justify new spending initiatives. \nOur seniors, disabled, and survivors deserve better.\n  We are in the early stages of a deliberative process to determine the \nbest way to assure the solvency of Social Security. I am pleased that \nPresident Clinton started this initiative by putting Social Security \nsolvency front and center in his State of the Union Address. Since \nthen, various groups, both public and private, have brought forth a \nvast range of proposals. I am taking part in that debate and want to be \nan advocate for the original intention of the Social Security program: \na safety net for our seniors and for the disabled.\n  Let me say again that I believe that promises made must be promises \nkept. I want that to be a guiding principle for any plan to modify the \nSocial Security program. I am pleased to support this amendment that \nreaffirms our commitment to Saving Social Security First.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask that Senator Murkowski be added as \na cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, as I understand it, there are a few \nminutes left. I wanted to come to the floor to commend the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina on his amendment. I believe \nthis is really one of the most critical economic and fiscal decisions \nwe will make this year. It will probably affect, more dramatically than \nanything else we do, the budget, the deficit, and, most certainly, \nSocial Security. There are four numbers that I think everybody needs to \nunderstand. I know a lot of this has been discussed before.\n  The first number is $520 billion; $520 billion is the projected \nsurplus including Social Security trust funds that we anticipate \nbetween now and the year 2003. If you take out the Social Security \ntrust funds, you get to the second number---$137 billion. If we remove \nthe Social Security trust funds, we actually have a deficit over the \nnext 5 years of $137 billion.\n  Let us not kid anybody here. When we talk about a surplus--and I wish \nwe could talk more forcefully and more convincingly that, indeed, we \nhave a surplus--the reality is that we have a surplus only if we \ninclude the Social Security trust funds.\n  Let's move to the second set of numbers. The first is $1.548 \ntrillion. All of these figures, by the way, Mr. President, are CBO \nnumbers. That figure is the budget surplus including the Social \nSecurity trust funds that CBO anticipates for the next 10 years.\n  The fourth and final number is $31 billion; $31 billion is all that \nCBO anticipates that we will have over the next 10 years in surplus if \nwe do not include the Social Security trust funds.\n  There should not be any question about our circumstances. Do we have \na surplus? Yes. But it is yes with an asterisk, and that is what the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina says so forcefully and so \nconvincingly. We have a surplus only if we are prepared to drawn down \nthose Social Security trust funds that we know we are going to need in \nthe outyears.\n  When we talk about how do we use the surplus, it is pretty simple. \nThe question we should be asking is, How do we use the Social Security \ntrust funds? Of the roughly $650 billion over five years and $1.5 \ntrillion over the next 10 years in Social Security trust funds, how do \nwe use them?\n\n[[Page S8734]]\n\n  Most of us believe very strongly that we ought to use those funds for \none purpose and one purpose only: to pay out the commitment that we \nhave made to Social Security recipients in this generation and the next \nand the next.\n  That is the question. That is why this resolution is so important, \nand that is why I hope everybody will support the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Senator from New Hampshire \nhas 3 minutes 3 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time does the Democratic side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute on the other side.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest we yield back all time and go to a vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the agreement which we have been talking about, we \nwill now turn to the Senator from Arizona for an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3257\n\n  (Purpose: To prevent any consolidation of the Patent and Trademark \n  Office until the Administrator of General Services conducts a cost-\nbenefit analysis that is not limited to a specific geographical region \n       and makes a recommendation on the basis of that analysis)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment. The bill \nclerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3257.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 62, strike ``Provided further,'' on line 3 and all \n     that follows through line 16 and insert the following: \n     ``Provided further, That none of the funds appropriated or \n     otherwise made available under this Act or under any other \n     provision of law may be obligated or expended by the \n     Secretary of Commerce, through the Patent and Trademark \n     Office, to plan for the design, construction, or lease of any \n     new facility for that office until the date that is 90 days \n     after the date of submission to Congress by the Administrator \n     of General Services of a report on the results of a cost-\n     benefit analysis that analyzes the costs versus the benefits \n     of relocating the Patent and Trademark Office to a new \n     facility, and that includes an analysis of the cost \n     associated with leasing, in comparison with the cost of any \n     lease-purchase, Federal construction, or other alternative \n     for new space for the Patent and Trademark Office and a \n     recommendation on the most cost-effective option for \n     consolidating the Patent and Trademark Office: Provided \n     further, That the report submitted by the Administrator of \n     General Services shall consider any appropriate location or \n     facility for the Patent and Trademark Office, and shall not \n     be limited to any geographic region: Provided further, That \n     the Administrator of General Services shall submit the report \n     to Congress not later than May 1, 1999.''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand we have a time agreement on this amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. There is no time agreement yet, but I would ask unanimous \nconsent there be half an hour.\n  Mr. McCAIN. This is the Patent Trademark Office relocation. I just \nsay to my colleagues I intend to be brief. I would be glad to have any \ntime agreement that is reasonable. So I would be glad to enter into any \ntime agreement.\n  Mr. HATCH. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have not asked for a unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). There is no unanimous consent \nrequest pending.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would not ask for a unanimous consent, but I would ask \nunanimous consent for the Senator from Utah to be recognized without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, all I ask is that the Senator from Utah be \npermitted the opportunity to speak following the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to that request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, I say to those who are interested, \nI will be glad to enter into a very short time agreement. I know the \nSenator from New Hampshire wants to finish up the bill, and so I will \nbe glad to enter into a very short time agreement.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It prohibits the Patent \nand Trademark Office from spending any funds to plan for or proceed \nwith the consolidation and relocation of its facilities until 90 days \nafter the General Services Administration submits a new report to the \nCongress on the costs versus benefits of relocating all Patent and \nTrademark Office facilities to a new facility or location, and the \ncosts associated with leasing versus lease-purchase, Federal \nconstruction, or other alternatives for new space, and finally, a \nrecommendation of the lowest cost alternative for the project.\n  Most importantly, the amendment requires a GSA report to be prepared \nwithout regard to a specific geographic location. I want to repeat, Mr. \nPresident, so all my colleagues know, the amendment requires the GSA \nreport to be prepared without regard to a specific geographic location.\n  The proposal to consolidate and relocate the various offices of the \nPatent and Trademark Office is an enormous project, the largest real \nestate venture the Federal Government is expected to enter into in the \nnext decade. The current proposal raises serious questions.\n  First, the project is estimated to cost the taxpayers approximately \n$1.6 billion. About $1.3 billion of this amount is to pay for a 20-year \nlease of a new 2-million-square-foot facility somewhere in Northern \nVirginia. The additional $250 million is what the Patent and Trademark \nOffice proposes to spend to ``improve'' the building, to bring it up to \nPTO standards, which appears to me extravagant and luxurious amenities \nthat most of America's businesses do not provide to even their senior \nexecutives.\n  Most alarming, the language contained in the committee bill imposes \nno enforceable ceiling on the potential costs of this huge project.\n  Both the Citizens Against Government Waste and the National Taxpayers \nUnion have raised serious concerns about the enormous cost of this \nproject.\n  How can we claim to wisely spend Americans' hard-earned tax dollars \nwhen we are essentially giving the Patent and Trademark Office a blank \ncheck for this project? I have no desire to prohibit the Patent and \nTrademark Office from streamlining and improving its operations. It may \nbe that the PTO does need to consolidate and relocate. However, we have \na responsibility to ensure that this consolidation takes place in a \nfiscally responsible manner.\n  The proposed Patent and Trademark Office building complex is \nshamefully expensive and extravagant. In addition, in putting the \nproposal together, the Congress limited the Patent and Trademark Office \nto considering only sites in Northern Virginia, which is certainly not \nan inexpensive area for construction and leasing of office space.\n  To make matters worse, the bill before the Senate does not \neffectively limit PTO's budget for this project. The amendment I \npropose would require GSA to reevaluate the site selection process and \nlook at more cost-effective alternatives which are not tied to one \nspecific locality.\n  Mr. President, this $1.6 billion project is entirely too expensive. \nUnder the current proposal, PTO plans to lease a 2-million-square-foot \nbuilding ``shell,'' which is essentially a structure with walls, \nceilings, floors, and windows, but without electrical wiring, computer \nand telecommunication lines, carpeting, furniture, and all the other \nnecessary interior fixtures.\n  The Patent and Trademark Office will not have to pay the costs of \nconstructing the building ``shell.'' However, the Patent and Trademark \nOffice plans to spend an outrageous amount of taxpayers' dollars to \nbring the building up to its ``standards.''\n  First, the PTO is authorized to spend up to $88 million to ``build \nout'' the shell. This includes such necessary items as carpeting, \nelectric, plumbing fixtures, and necessary environmental control \nupgrades to support the computer-intensive work of the office.\n  Unfortunately, compared to the Government's ``standard'' rate for \nthis type of expenditure, building out the PTO building will cost 20 \npercent more than most Government buildings.\n  For example, the PTO building costs are $44 per square foot. NASA's \nnew building was $37 a square foot. FERC's building cost $36 per square \nfoot. And the Government standard is $36.69 per square foot.\n  On top of that $88 million, the PTO also plans to spend another $29 \nmillion for extravagant amenities, including extra elevators, granite \nand marble decor, jogging and walking trails, sculpture gardens, and \noutdoor amphitheaters.\n  That is a total of $117 million to finish the interior of the \nbuilding and to add millions of dollars of extravagant amenities. On a \nper-square-foot basis, that is $58 per square foot of occupiable space, \nor 58 percent over the Government standard. But that is not all. The\n\n[[Page S8736]]\n\nPTO also plans to spend another $135 million to move into the building, \ninstall the telecommunications equipment and buy furniture. Almost half \nof this money, $65 million, is for the purchase of new furniture and \nfurnishings, including $250 shower curtains--$250 shower curtains--\n$1,200 chairs, $1,000 coat racks and $562 mailroom stools.\n  Mr. President, in case my colleagues missed that, I will repeat, $250 \nshower curtains--I would like to view that shower curtain--$1,200 \nchairs, $1,000 coat racks, and $560 mailroom stools.\n  Altogether, then, the PTO will pay $250 million to bring the building \nup to its standards, standards which far exceed the Government's norms, \nand which can only be called luxurious by any standard.\n  After spending $252 million to spruce up the premises, the PTO is \nprepared to pay $50 million per year for a 20-year lease, over and \nabove the cost of its improvements listed above. That is approximately \n$1.3 billion in lease payments alone over the next 20 years.\n  Altogether, now, the PTO project is expected to cost the taxpayers \nalmost $1.6 billion, and we will not even own the building at the end \nof 20 years. Let me repeat, we will not even own the building at the \nend of 20 years.\n  Remember how the cost of the Ronald Reagan building skyrocketed? The \nRonald Reagan building, which is 3 million square feet, began at $362 \nmillion and ended up costing $800 million. That is a huge cost \nincrease. This deal will be worse than the Ronald Reagan deal. The PTO \nproject involves a 2.3 million square foot facility that will cost $1.6 \nbillion when finally completed.\n  The new PTO building will be smaller than the Reagan building, \n700,000 square feet smaller, and it is much more expensive. We spent \n$800 million on the Reagan Center, but at least we own a building that \nis designed to last at least 200 years and includes rentable space to \noffset its costs. The PTO deal is insane. The taxpayers pay to finish \nthe interior building, add a myriad of extravagancies, and then pay to \nlease it for a total of $1.6 billion over 20 years, and at the end of \n20 years, we give the building back to the owner. What kind of a deal \nis that? I think it is remarkable, remarkable.\n  The project was destined to become a fiscal nightmare. Our first \nmistake was we didn't allow ourselves to look at all possible locations \nto determine the most cost-effective facility to house the PTO complex. \nInstead, we only looked at sites in Northern Virginia. The sheer \nexcesses in the PTO's proposals for the building's amenities are \nunbelievable: $250 shower curtains, $1,000 coatracks, and miles of \nwalking and jogging paths. The tax dollars should be spent on \nprocessing patent applications. We should not be spending America's \nhard-earned tax dollars on extravagant perks. We should be spending tax \ndollars on processing patent applications, and we should make sure we \nspend them in the most cost-effective manner possible, by looking at \nall possible locations for this Government facility, not just one \nregion.\n  Mr. President, I am not trying to kill this project. Maybe the PTO \ndoes need to consolidate. However, I think we, as a body, have a \nresponsibility to act to ensure that the cost of this project is \njustified and kept in check. The amendment will require the GSA to take \nanother look at this project before we spend $1.6 billion on it.\n  I would like to quote from a letter from the Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste:\n\n       At a starting price tag of $1.3 billion, the PTO facility \n     will dwarf the final cost of the $800 million Ronald Reagan \n     International Trade Building, which has 700,000 more square \n     feet. Adding insult to injury, at the end of the 20-year \n     lease period, the government would not even own the PTO \n     building.\n       The PTO says it needs 2.3 million square feet. However, the \n     Department of Commerce Inspector General has issued a report, \n     Insufficient Planning is Jeopardizing PTO's Space \n     Consolidation Project, which casts serious doubt on the \n     appropriateness and cost-effectiveness of the venture.\n\n  In the letter they mention not only $250 shower curtains and $1,000 \ncoatracks but $700 baby cribs.\n\n       On behalf of the 600,000 members of [Citizens Against \n     Government Waste], we are pleased to endorse your amendment. \n     . . .\n\n  I have a letter from the National Taxpayers Union.\n\n       . . . the Reagan Building is built to last 200 years, at \n     about half the cost of the proposed 20-year PTO lease.\n\n  That is just the start of this giant boondoggle.\n\n       PTO's costs just for moving into the new headquarters could \n     run more than $130 million. That ought to buy a new building, \n     not just pay for relocation.\n       As part of the move, PTO plans to purchase $65 million in \n     brand new furniture, including $250 shower curtains, $750 \n     cribs, $309 ash cans. . . .\n\n  On that list are $309 ash cans.\n\n       The environmental clean-up costs of possible PTO relocation \n     sites could be as high as $194 million--some may contain \n     carcinogens or even unexploded ordnance.\n       . . . the PTO plan is ``flawed because the lease \n     development project lacks a defined cost ceiling.'' By a 3 to \n     1 margin, PTO employees represented by the Patent Office \n     Professional Association oppose the move to a new complex.\n\n  I am surprised at that. Maybe they don't like $250 shower curtains.\n\n       It would appear that PTO Commissioner Bruce Lehman is \n     seeking a grand monument to his tenure, to be leased at \n     government expense. If your amendment fails, the PTO lease \n     will stand as the largest monument ever erected to government \n     excess.\n       For these reasons we endorse your PTO Amendment and urge \n     your Senate colleagues to support it. The vote will be . . . \n     weighted [et cetera].\n  I have a letter here from the American Intellectual Property Owners \nassociation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am almost finished. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator has made frequent use of ``taxpayers \ndollars,'' but I think in a sense of fairness, and I will eventually \nspeak in greater detail, primarily the funding for this important \nfunction is entirely derived from the fees paid by the users of the \nservices. It is not involved, these egregious sums of taxpayer dollars. \nI thought the Senator might want to comment on that, because I \ncertainly will bring that out.\n  Mr. McCAIN. My only comment is when somebody pays a fee to the \nGovernment for a service, I don't know how you differentiate between \nthat and money being taken out of someone's paycheck--because they are \npaying. They are not receiving this Government service for free. So you \ncan call it a user fee, but that is the same thing as when you and I \nbuy an airline ticket and 10 percent of that goes to the FAA to keep \nthe FAA in operation, the air traffic control system, et cetera. Most \npeople still view that as a tax.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my distinguished friend, when we go to the \nDepartment of Transportation to consult and get their advice on an \nissue, issues which are very much foremost in my distinguished \ncolleague's mind now on aviation, we don't pay any fees. When we go to \nthe Department of Defense or the Department of Justice to work with \nother Government agencies and Departments, fees are not paid. This \nthing was devised by Congress, this institution, to operate on a \nrotating basis of fees paid, which fees are passed on down the line to \nthe consumers. I just wanted to bring that out.\n  Last, you mentioned the IPO. They just sent in a letter today \nendorsing it. I know the Senator is trying as hard as he can to list as \nmany persons with an objection, but at the appropriate time I will put \nthis letter in the Record. In the meantime, I will get a copy for the \nSenator. I thank the Chair and thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Virginia. When he does talk, I \nwould be interested in hearing him discuss the $250 shower curtains, \n$750 cribs, $309 ash cans, and $1,000 coatracks. I would be very \ninterested in hearing--perhaps he has had an opportunity to view those. \nI would like to see them myself. In fact, perhaps we could have a \nhearing and view some of that, because it must be exciting stuff there, \nand all of the miles of trails.\n  Also, I would have to ask about the logic of my friend from Virginia. \nWe pay $1.3 billion over 20 years, we take a shell and we put in all \nthe furnishings, all the wiring, all the plumbing and everything into \nit, and then after 20 years it is not even ours, after a payment of \n$1.3 billion. I don't understand it.\n  By the way, let me mention two things to my friend from Virginia real \nquick. No. 1, I know this amendment will not be agreed to. That is why \nI am willing to have a relatively short time agreement. I have no \nillusions about that. But I think it is important to put all of this on \nthe record here.\n\n[[Page S8737]]\n\n  I also am aware both Senators from Virginia are very committed to \nthis project. I understand and admire their commitment.\n  I also want to mention one thing about the chairman, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee. He is going to say, \nand I will respectfully agree with him, he has wrestled with this issue \nfor years. He has done everything he can to try to resolve this issue. \nHe has my utmost respect and appreciation for his efforts. I just \nhappen to think this is the wrong answer. I think it is wrong to pay \n$250 for a shower curtain. I think it is wrong, after 20 years, to have \nto give back a building that you basically built, except for the shell. \nFrankly, I think it is wrong, in all due respect to my two friends from \nVirginia, that we should earmark any Government facility in a \ngeographic-specific location. I think there should have been \ncompetition for this from all over the Washington, DC, area, if not \nfrom all over the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor. Again, I will be glad, for the \nsake of the managers, to enter into a time agreement with my colleagues \nwho want to speak on this issue so we can move on to the next \namendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nUtah is to be recognized at this time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield to the distinguished chairman \nwhile reserving my rights to the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would like to reach a time agreement, if possible. I \nunderstand the Senator from Utah wishes to speak for about 10 minutes?\n  Mr. HATCH. Probably less, but if the Senator will list 10 minutes, \nthat is fine.\n  Mr. GREGG. And the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Both Senators, Mr. President, would like, say, 15 minutes \nequally divided between my distinguished colleague and myself.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest all debate on this amendment be concluded within \n25 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. GREGG. The allocation will be 10 minutes--sorry, 30 minutes--10 \nminutes to the Senator from Utah, 15 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia, and 5 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \namendments be the next amendments in order, subject to relevant second \ndegrees, and that following debate, each amendment be laid aside to \nreoccur at 9:30 this evening in a stacked sequence in the order in \nwhich they were debated.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes prior to each \nvote for closing remarks.\n  The amendments are:\n  The pending McCain amendment, a Durbin amendment on guns, a Thompson \namendment on federalism, a Bumpers amendment on telephone privacy, a \nNickles amendment on defenders, a Feingold amendment on child \nexploitation, and a Kyl-Craig amendment on gaming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I simply state that the next series of \namendments with rollcalls will be at 9:30 this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that if my remarks are less than \n10 minutes, that it be cut off the time that the Senator asked for.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nproposed by the Senator from Arizona. If adopted, the McCain amendment \nwould result in needless, costly delays in the user process to obtain \nbetter facilities for the Patent and Trademark Office.\n  Look, we studied this thing to death. We know doggone well if this is \ndelayed again, you are only going to have one bidder instead of three, \nand there is the question of whether that one bidder will do anything \nto save any money.\n  In fact, the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Arizona \nwould cost a lot more money. Let me make my case.\n  The PTO procurement process has been studied to death. We don't need \nanother study. Let me catalog for you the attention that has been paid \nto this procurement process. The PTO procurement process has been the \nsubject of two comprehensive studies: one by the Inspector General of \nthe Department of Commerce and another by an independent consultant who \nreported to the Secretary of Commerce. The independent consultant was \nJefferson Solutions, which is headed by the former director of OMB's \nOffice of Procurement Policy in the Reagan and Carter administrations. \nBoth studies agreed that the competitive lease procurement should \nproceed so that the PTO can obtain the benefits of competition. Let me \nemphasize that, from the start, the PTO procurement process followed \nall the rules and complied with all the safeguards in the Standard \nFederal Government Procurement Procedures.\n  These studies are in addition to the normal Government procedures. Of \ncourse, they do provide for competitive bidding. Mr. President, Senator \nMcCain's amendment calls for a study of the benefits of leasing versus \npurchase, Federal construction, and other housing alternatives, such as \nlease purchase. This has already been done.\n  The GSA, the Department of Commerce, and the OMB thoroughly evaluated \nthe options before submitting the lease prospectus for congressional \napproval. Both the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and \nthe House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure concurred, \nwhen the prospectus was authorized in the fall of 1995, and in light of \nthe limited funds available for capital investment and operating lease \nof the PTO, that is in the best interest of the PTO's fee-paying \ncustomers, which the distinguished Senator from Virginia has raised.\n  Furthermore, in a colloquy between Senators Gregg and Warner \nconducted on the Senate floor during the vote on H.R. 3579, Senator \nGregg agreed that no funds would be available in the foreseeable future \nto purchase or construct a facility to house the PTO.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. The Senate is not in \norder. The Presiding Officer cannot hear the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n  H.R. 3579, which became law, required the Secretary of Commerce to \nreview the project and submit a report to Congress by March of 1998. \nThis is the Jefferson Solutions report that I referred to earlier.\n  The cost-benefit analysis that accompanied it, called the Deva \nreport, showed the PTO will save $72 million over the 20-year life of \nthe lease by consolidating.\n  I don't know about the shower curtains, but that is a lot of money to \nbe saving compared to what we would lose if we went ahead with the \namendment of the Senator from Arizona. I know he is trying to save \nmoney, and I have no problem with that.\n  The Jefferson Solutions report found that the consolidation of PTO \nspace through a competitive lease would improve workflow efficiencies \nand improve the environment for employee retention, as well as reduce \ncosts.\n  In addition to these studies and reviews, the procurement process has \nbeen tested judicially. A 1997 protest by the existing landlord \nalleging improprieties in the terms and conditions of the procurement \nwas dismissed. Similarly, an unfair labor practice complaint filed by \none of the PTO's unions was dismissed earlier this year.\n  Given these numerous studies, reviews, and court tests, why is it \nthat we are here debating this issue yet once again? There appears to \nbe a campaign to delay the procurement process, and I have to ask who \nis behind it. I don't think it is a matter of $250 shower curtains.\n  I know that Senator McCain is not motivated by a desire to merely \ndelay. I am sure he has real concerns based on facts as he views them. \nBut the fact of the matter is, he is talking about peanuts compared to \nthe millions and millions of dollars that will be lost if we do another \nstudy rather than go ahead after all of this work has been done, all \nthe studies have been done. It is crazy. Nevertheless, there has been \nan ongoing campaign to delay this.\n\n[[Page S8738]]\n\n  Who is behind it? Is it the parties who use the PTO services? No. The \nparties who use the PTO are the patent applicants, patentees, and \ntrademark registrants. They oppose this amendment, and they want the \nprocurement process to go ahead.\n  But, Mr. President, the current landlord of the PTO makes over $40 \nmillion a year from renting space to the PTO. Would 1 year's additional \nrent be worth mounting a campaign of delay? That is $40 million plus \nthe $72 million we are talking about we lose by another study. I think \nyou can buy a lot of shower curtains for that.\n  It would be to the landlord's benefit to delay it. That is why he has \nhired a major lobbying firm to kill this process. It is not the public \ndemanding a delay, it is the PTO's current landlord. I can hardly blame \nhim, because he will make $40 million more. But I would blame us if we \npermitted that to go on just because of some shower curtains and a few \nother things that the distinguished Senator from Arizona has mentioned.\n  I conclude, Mr. President, with an assurance that I am as concerned \nas anyone with cost overruns and lavish spending in the procurement \nprocess. I am disturbed by allegations of amphitheaters, exercise \ntracks, and high-priced furniture. I pledge to work with anyone who has \na concern about specific excesses in the procurement prospectus. In \nfact, I intend to support the Inhofe-Brownback amendment that cuts back \non build-out appropriations and the ability of the PTO to get more \nmoney for moving expenses. Congress should investigate these particular \nallegations and take a surgical approach. Another comprehensive study, \nhowever, is not the answer.\n  Let me just say for the benefit of the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, he may have some points here, but they are very, very minor in \ncomparison to the moneys that will be saved by moving ahead rather than \nhaving another delay by losing $72 million on one side and $40 million \non the other over a few shower curtains. It just seems penny-wise and \npound-foolish. I am against this amendment. I hope we defeat it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I will be very brief. I concur with the assessment \njust rendered by the distinguished Senator from Utah. My distinguished \nsenior Senator, Senator Warner, and I are both very much opposed to \nthis amendment. It is a delaying tactic that simply benefits the status \nquo and costs money.\n  For the benefit of Senators, I will quote from a couple of the \nreports that were referenced indirectly by the Senator from Utah, if I \nmay. The Appropriations Committee, July 2, committee report:\n\n       The committee has reviewed the reports submitted by the \n     Secretary, and does not object to the Secretary's direction \n     that the competitive procurement process should continue.\n\n  An independent report dated May 15, 1998, by Jefferson Solutions, \nInc., BTG, Inc., Economics Research Associates:\n\n       The PTO has used a sound methodology and valid reasoning in \n     defining its need for new space, in researching its current \n     and future functional needs, and in managing its \n     consolidation and space acquisition process.\n\n  With respect to this, the Department of Commerce inspector general \nreport in March 1998 in terms of its fiscal prudence:\n\n       Long-term cost savings should be realized because the \n     current leased PTO space is more expensive than the $24 per \n     square foot authorized by the Congress.\n\n  An independent report, May, 22, 1998, by Deva & Associates:\n\n       The conclusion of this business case analysis . . . is that \n     the PTO should proceed . . . because the agency will incur, \n     over the 20-year lease period, $72,395,278 less in costs.\n\n  A Department of Commerce inspector general report with respect to \nnecessity, dated March, 1998:\n\n       Most of PTO's current leased facilities . . . are in need \n     of alterations to comply with fire, safety, and handicapped \n     accessibility laws.\n       PTO has a growing workload and is currently occupying \n     noncontiguous space that is operationally inefficient.\n       The new facility should promote the collocation of various \n     working groups, thereby improving efficiency and \n     productivity.\n\n  From an independent report by Jefferson Solutions and others, dated \nMay 15, 1998:\n\n       The proposed PTO amenity package is not ``gold plated,'' \n     and is consistent with other recent federal and private \n     sector office projects.\n\n  A point that was made earlier by my distinguished senior colleague, \nit is the customers who pay the fees. And here is what they have to \nsay, the executive director of the Intellectual Property Owners:\n\n       We are at a loss for why anyone would want to keep the PTO \n     in outdated facilities at higher cost . . .\n\n  The executive director of the American Intellectual Property Law \nAssociation:\n\n       Further delaying the procurement would likely result in an \n     additional loss of interest. The result would be to award, by \n     default, a sole source lease extension to the existing \n     landlord. Moreover, a new competitive process would almost \n     certainly have to open up the area of consideration to a \n     larger geographic territory, with additional costs and \n     dislocations for [current] PTO employees and [their] users.\n\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that to the extent that there are \nany excess costs--first of all, I believe that is a worst case \nscenario.\n  Second, it can be addressed by the amendment that is going to be \noffered by Senators from Idaho and Kansas. And I will support that \namendment, as the Senator from Idaho has indicated he will support it.\n  But the bottom line is, this is designed to save $72-plus million. \nDelay will simply continue the inefficiency and cost more money. If \nthere is a concern--and I would share the concern that the Senator from \nArizona expressed about any unnecessary costs--we can address that, but \ndo not stop the process that has been ongoing for years, which simply \nwill increase the costs in a very significant way.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor to my distinguished \nsenior Senator. And I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for his \nvery clear remarks on this. I worked until late last night with \nSenators Brownback and Inhofe to devise an amendment to which I have \nnow added my name. And I send this amendment to the desk just for the \npurpose of filing it. And the managers have indicated--both the \nmajority and minority--that it will be eventually accepted as part of \nthe managers' package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be printed in the Record.\n  (The text of the Amendment (No. 3259) is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Amendments submitted'')\n  Mr. WARNER. But this amendment achieves many of the goals recited by \nSenator McCain, to crunch this down to a realistic purchase of \nequipment and not have the items which clearly were excessive in cost, \nas recited by our distinguished colleague from Arizona.\n  I credit the distinguished Senator from Arizona. He is a constant \nwatchdog on these various issues. And I responded to one of his points \nhere. This is not taxpayers' dollars. Secondly, the reason we are \npursuing this type of an arrangement is simply because there are \ninsufficient taxpayers' dollars in the Treasury for the Government to \nbuild the building. And therefore, we have to work on this building \nlease type of financing to lower the burden of cost, indeed, to the \ntaxpayers for the construction of a building which is absolutely \nessential.\n  This vital function of Government, patent and trademark, is now being \nperformed by very loyal, highly skilled Government workers. And they \nare disbursed in a number of buildings--a number of buildings. And \nanyone who understands the simple basis of management and trying to do \na job knows that if you have your employees, first, in 16 different \nbuildings--I want to repeat that; 16 different buildings--this concept \nis to bring it into a central concept financed under a lease \narrangement, not by taxpayers' dollars, but by the payment of fees.\n  So I say to my colleagues, this is a matter which both sides of the \naisle have addressed in terms of cost containment. Both sides of the \naisle have addressed in terms of its need and the propriety of a \nprocess that started in\n\n[[Page S8739]]\n\n1995 in the Senate Environment Committee which has overall oversight of \nthis type of work.\n  I have today a letter addressed to me from the General Services \nAdministration which, once again, reiterates in absolute clarity the \nfact that they have reviewed this process, they have reviewed the \nproposals, and it is their conclusion that it is in the public \ninterest.\n  This is the Government agency in which we have reposed the trust and \nthe confidence to make the vast number of technical decisions which are \nrequired for a very expensive contract, or in this instance a lease \narrangement build.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the General Services \nAdministration letter and a letter from the IPO printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              General Services Administration,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 1998.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: The purpose of this letter is to \n     express my strong support for continuing the ongoing \n     procurement of leased space for the Patent and Trademark \n     Office (PTO) in Northern Virginia. After studying the various \n     alternatives for providing this space; new federal \n     construction, leasing, lease purchase and other alternatives, \n     we concluded that leasing was the most advantageous given the \n     resources available for such activities.\n       Since 1993 the PTO and the General Services Administration \n     (GSA) have worked together to meet the requirements \n     stipulated in the authorization provided by the Congress. As \n     a result of this joint effort, we have initiated a \n     procurement which has been both fair to the competitors and \n     efficient in the way it has been accomplished.\n       This action has been reviewed by the Inspector General of \n     the Department of Commerce, an independent set of procurement \n     experts hired by the Secretary of Commerce and other \n     independent experts. In each case it has been determined that \n     the proposed action is cost effective and in the best long \n     term interest of the PTO. These studies have shown that a \n     $72,000,000 savings will occur over the term of this action \n     when compared to the current situation.\n       Furthermore, this action has the full support of the \n     intellectual property community that the PTO serves.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David J. Barram,\n     Administrator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Intellectual Property Owners,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 1998.\n     Re IPO's opposition to your proposed amendment to the \n         Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill (S. 2260) \n         that would delay the competitive procurement of new \n         office space by the PTO.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: We are writing to urge you not to \n     offer your proposed amendment to the appropriations bill that \n     would have the effect of stopping or delaying the procurement \n     of office space for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office \n     (PTO).\n       Intellectual Property Owners (IPO) is an association that \n     represents companies and individuals who own patents, \n     trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. Our members obtain \n     about 30 percent of the U.S. patents that are granted to U.S. \n     residents and pay more than $100 million a year in user fees \n     to the PTO.\n       We have followed the plan for procurement of office space \n     by the PTO for the past year, received several briefings, and \n     examined several documents and reports. We are confident that \n     the current procurement of new office space for the PTO on a \n     competitive basis is in the best interest of IPO members. The \n     latest information available to us indicates that the PTO \n     will save $72.4 million over the 20-year term of the \n     projected lease under the competitive procurement, compared \n     with the cost of remaining in existing space. The study on \n     which this conclusion is based prepared by the consulting \n     firm of Deva and Associates, P.C. We understand it has been \n     reviewed by numerous authorities, including a consulting firm \n     hired by Commerce Secretary Daley, the Commerce Inspector \n     General, the PTO, the GSA, and the OMB. Allegations that the \n     PTO is proposing extravagant above-standard fit-out costs, or \n     that the competitive bidding procedure has been mismanaged, \n     are unsupported by any facts, as far as we can determine.\n       We have been briefed on the very high costs listed in the \n     Deva report for certain furnishing. We are satisfied that \n     these number do not yet reflect savings that the PTO will \n     realize through mass purchases, standardization, and \n     competition. We hope Congress will not delay the procurement \n     simply because of these cost estimates for furnishing. \n     Congress, with the benefit of advice from PTO users, will \n     have the opportunity to control the costs of PTO furnishing \n     when it approves annual appropriations requests.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Herbert C. Wamsley,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to reiterate, I rise today in opposition \nto the McCain amendment which seeks to delay the procurement of space \nfor the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office pending an evaluation by the \nU.S. General Services Administration (GSA). It should be noted that I \nhave agreed to accept an amendment offered by my colleagues Senator \nBrownback and Senator Inhofe regarding cost containment measures for \nthe PTO consolidation in the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations \nbill.\n  The Government's prospectus process provided thorough answers to all \nquestions raised by the McCain amendment. Through the prospectus \nprocess, authorized by the Public Buildings Act, as amended, the \nGovernment submitted to the Congress detailed justification for \nprocuring a new consolidated space for PTO.\n  The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Subcommittee on \nTransportation and Infrastructure, which I chair, in addition to the \nHouse Transportation and Infrastructure Committee held extensive \nhearings on this prospectus and approved the prospectus in the Fall of \n1995. Both committees concurred that in light of the limited funds \navailable for capital investment, an operating lease for the PTO is in \nthe best interest of the PTO fee paying customers.\n  Mr. President, during these hearings, the government testified and \nthe House and Senate committees of jurisdiction agreed, that procuring \nconsolidated space for the PTO would achieve greater efficiency as well \nas cost-savings to the taxpayer while providing a more effective work \nenvironment for the PTO to perform its mission.\n  Pursuant to the language in the supplemental appropriations bill, the \nDepartment of Commerce performed a review of these same issues and \nfound conclusively that the PTO consolidation is in the best interest \nof the United States and the procurement should proceed.\n  This project has been studied and studied and studied. These studies \ninclude: the Department of Commerce's Inspector General; an independent \nconsultant to the Secretary of Commerce (Jefferson Solutions; headed by \nthe ex Directors of OMB's Office of Procurement Policy in the Reagan & \nCarter administrations), both of which agree that the competitive lease \nprocurement should proceed, so that the PTO can obtain the benefits of \ncompetition.\n  Mr. President, it should further be noted that GSA, the Department of \nCommerce and OMB thoroughly evaluated the benefits of leasing versus \npurchase, Federal construction and other housing alternatives, such as \nlease purchase, before submitting the lease prospectus for \ncongressional approval in the first place.\n  The PTO procurement does not involve expenditure of taxpayer money. \nPTO and all its operations and procurement are supported entirely by \nfees paid by its customers. The PTO does not, and will not, receive any \ntaxpayer money.\n  In a colloquy between myself and the distinguished floor manager of \nthis bill, Senator Gregg during the Senate debate on the supplemental \nappropriations bill H.R. 3579, P.L. 105-174, Senator Gregg agreed that \nno funds will be available in the foreseeable future to purchase or \nconstruct a facility to house the PTO.\n  P.L. 105-174 already required the Secretary of Commerce to review the \nproject and submit a report to Congress by March 1998. That report, \nconducted by Jefferson Solutions, and the cost benefit analysis report, \nreferred to as the DEVA Report that accompanied it, show that the PTO \nwill save $72 million over the 20-year life of the lease by \nconsolidating.\n  Mr. President, this $72 million is a conservative estimate of the \nsavings that will be achieved. For example, if the PTO were to purchase \nless expensive furnishings than are reflected in the DEVA Report, the \ncost savings would be greater.\n  While Senator McCain and others may charge that the furniture \nestimate used in the DEVA Report is high, I would indicate that the \nDEVA Report shows the ``worst case'' costs. These costs are used to \ncalculate the potential savings of consolidation, and are certainly not \nthe actual costs that the PTO will spend on furniture.\n\n[[Page S8740]]\n\n  The actual furniture costs will be lower, because they will include \neconomies that will be achieved through competition, mass purchase and \nstandardization. Therefore, the savings from consolidation will likely \nbe higher than $72 million.\n  The PTO intends to conduct a furniture inventory and will use \nexisting furniture where practicable.\n  In conclusion Mr. President, PTO is not contracting for a new $1.3 \nbillion building. It is contracting for a new competitive 20-year \nlease. It would cost at least $1.3 billion for the PTO to remain where \nit is for the same 20-year period. The offerors in the prospectus have \nthe option of building, renovating or consolidating to meet the PTO's \nspace needs.\n  The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works carefully \nconsidered the need for the facility, various alternatives, and the \ncosts of each approach before authorizing the lease procurement to be \nconducted by the GSA for the PTO.\n  PTO will only move if it is economic and efficient to do so under the \ncurrent competition. It is not a foregone conclusion that PTO will \nrelocate. Crystal City, the current site of the PTO, is one of the \nthree sites competing in the procurement.\n  Taxpayer protections include the following:\n  The rental rate ceiling of $28.50 per square foot contained in the \napproval resolutions are at or below the rates that PTO is currently \npaying, and current market rates in Northern Virginia; the build out \nallowances for the interior space are fixed in the procurement \ndocuments at less than $45.00 per square foot; an amount that is \ncomparable to most government facilities; PTO currently leases 1.9 \nmillion rentable square feet of office space in 16 separate buildings \nin Arlington, Virginia. The prospectus calls for 2.17 million to 2.39 \nmillion square feet of space, which is between 15% to 25% more than \ncurrently exists, due to a projected increase in PTO's work from the \nnow 5,200 employees to 7,100 employees by 2002. This is overall a 37% \nincrease in the work force of PTO, which accounts for the increase in \nspace needed to house this growing agency.\n  PTO will only move if it is economic and efficient to do so under the \ncurrent competition in which the incumbent lessor is one of the four \nfinalists.\n  I have seen the PTO study that compares costs of consolidation to \nremaining in existing buildings. Even with all these costs, the bottom \nline is that the PTO will save $72 million over the life of the new \nlease.\n  Senator McCain said he would yield back his time. So I say to the \ndistinguished manager, the time allocated for debate on this side, \nindeed, with my fellow colleague from Virginia has been completed. And \nMr. McCain asked me to inform you he would yield back his time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senators from Virginia for their prompt and \nconcise debate. I appreciate it very much.\n  Mr. WARNER. We wish to accommodate our distinguished colleagues, the \nmanagers of our bill.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  Mr. CRAIG. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I do not know of a request. I imagine the manager can \nproceed with the vote.\n  Mr. GREGG. Do you wish to have the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. WARNER. I do not ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think we will wait for Senator McCain to return to \ndetermine whether or not we need that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. I think we should accommodate my colleague and \nfriend from Arizona. I just wished to raise the fact that a recorded \nvote had not been sought yet.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is absolutely correct. We will now proceed to the \nDurbin amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the debate on the Durbin amendment and \nsecond-degrees--I will reserve my unanimous-consent request.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Illinois be \nallowed to lay down his first-degree amendment, that that then be laid \naside and the Senator from Idaho be immediately recognized to offer a \nfirst-degree amendment relative to firearms enforcement. Further, I ask \nthere be 40 minutes for debate on both the Durbin and Craig amendments \ncombined, to be equally divided between Senator Craig and Senator \nDurbin, with no second-degree amendments in order to either amendment, \nand following the conclusion or the yielding back of time, pursuant to \nour previous unanimous consent request, a vote will occur at or about \n9:30 in relation to the Craig amendment, to be followed immediately by \na vote on or in relation to the Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3260\n\n(Purpose: To prevent children from injuring themselves and others with \n                               firearms)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, it is my understanding under the unanimous \nconsent request we have 40 minutes equally divided between the Senator \nfrom Idaho and myself.\n  I say by way of introduction, it is interesting we have two \namendments that I don't believe are in conflict. I believe they are \ncomplementary. They both relate to guns. As I understand the amendment \nof the Senator from Idaho, he is seeking to reduce gun crime. I believe \nI will be able to support him. It appears to be consistent with my \nview, that those who misuse guns in the commission of a crime shall be \naccountable, regardless of their age. If that is what the Senator from \nIdaho seeks to do, I fully support it.\n  The amendment which I offer is complementary and very important \nbecause it addresses an issue which all of us, unfortunately, know too \nwell. On the floor of the U.S. Senate a few weeks ago, my colleague \nfrom California, Senator Feinstein, came up and said to me, ``There's \njust been a wire story report that two children in Jonesboro, AR, have \ntaken guns and shot classmates and a teacher.'' We couldn't believe \nthat horrible story. Then it turned out to be true--four children \nkilled, and a teacher, who put her life on the line to protect another \nstudent, also died.\n  As the information started coming in about Jonesboro, AR, we heard a \nstory similar to what had happened in Pearl, MS, and what would later \noccur in Springfield, OR. The curious thing about the situation in \nArkansas was that an 11-year-old child and a 13-year-old child took 10 \nlethal weapons and a reported 3,000 rounds of ammunition, went to the \nwoods behind the school, activated the fire alarm, and shot away at the \nclassmates.\n  Where did an 11-year-old child and a 13-year-old child come up with \n10 lethal weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition? That question \nstuck with me as I considered this legislation. The story goes, now, \nthat one of the kids went to the parents' home to pick up the guns and \ngo about this violent, grizzly business and found out that the parent \nhad locked the guns up under lock and key. The kids tried to break open \nthe storage locker. They failed. They went to a grandfather's house, \nwhere they picked up the guns and ammunition and went out in the woods \nand went about their deadly task.\n  How many times have we heard this story or versions of it? How many \nvariations have we heard? The next day, in Dale City, CA, a high school \nstudent turns up at school with a semiautomatic pistol. You can bet \nthat high school student didn't legally purchase it at a gun dealer. \nAnd that same day in Cleveland, OH, a 5-year-old turns up at a day care \ncenter with a loaded handgun.\n  The point of my amendment is to say let's get down to the bottom line \nhere. We are as concerned about troubled children and violent behavior \nas anyone can be. Let us focus our attention on all that we can do to \nstop that. Make no mistake, a troubled child is a sad reality. A \ntroubled child with a gun is a tragedy about to happen, not just to \nhimself but to other innocent people.\n  This amendment which I am offering, called the Child Access \nPrevention Law, sets to establish a national standard which says that \nevery gun owner in America has a responsibility to store his gun \nsafely. An adult who has a gun in the house and knows, or should know, \nthat a child could gain access to the gun, and a child does gain access \nand thereby causes death or injury or exhibits the gun in a public \nplace, is subject to a Federal misdemeanor penalty of up to 1 year in \nprison, with up to $10,000 in fines.\n\n  But the exceptions are important as well. If that adult has stored \nthe gun with a trigger lock, with another safety device, or under lock \nand key, then they are not bound by this law; they have met the \nstandard of care.\n  If the juvenile uses the gun in a lawful act of self-defense, this \nprovision does not apply either.\n  If the juvenile takes the gun off the person of a law enforcement \nofficial, the gun law that I have suggested here does not apply either.\n  If the owner has no reasonable expectation that children will be on \nthe premises, then this law does not apply either.\n  Finally--and this is a point I want to make clear--we specifically \nsay if the juvenile, the child, came up with the gun as a result of a \nburglary, stealing the gun out of premises where they did not have a \nlegal right to enter, then there is no liability on the part of the gun \nowner.\n  We are talking about a situation where a gun owner owns guns, knows \nthat children are present, and doesn't store them safely. Fifteen \nStates have\n\n[[Page S8742]]\n\nalready addressed this. Ten years ago, the State of Florida passed the \nfirst law. They said: ``There are too many children being killed with \nguns accidentally and intentionally. We want gun owners to accept the \nresponsibility of storing them safely.'' In the first year after the \nFlorida law was passed, gun accidents involving children went down 50 \npercent. Fourteen other States have passed this law. Nationally, there \nhas been a reduction of 20 percent in the gun accidents that have \noccurred in those States that have already passed a similar law to this \none.\n  What we are talking about here is establishing a national standard \nbut not preempting any State law. If your State has a child access \nprevention law, then that will be the controlling law in every \ncircumstance, and not this Federal law.\n  But I tell you this, you need only sit and talk to parents who have \nbeen through this to understand how important it is for us to have a \nstandard of care for gun owners across America. A woman from my \nhometown sent me a handwritten letter about her little boy going to \nplay next door, and another playmate pulls out a gun that his parents \nleft unattended. It was loaded. He fired the gun. She wrote:\n\n       That little bullet went through my little boy's heart, and \n     mine too.\n\n  And mine, too.\n  Susan Wilson who came here just a few weeks ago, the mother of a \nlittle girl that she sent off to school, gave her a kiss goodbye and \nsent her off to school in Jonesboro, AR, never to see her alive again.\n  This suggestion for a change in law is not about taking anybody's \nguns away, it is about taking guns seriously. It says to every gun \nowner: You not only have the right to own a gun and the right to use it \nlegally and safely, you have a responsibility--a responsibility--to \nstore it safely and keep it away from children.\n  One of the experts on the Senate floor when it comes to guns is the \nSenator who is engaged in this debate with me, the Senator from Idaho, \nSenator Craig. Yesterday, during the course of a debate on trigger \nlocks, Senator Craig said:\n\n       Proper storage of firearms is the responsibility of every \n     gun owner.\n\n  And then Senator Craig said:\n\n       A general firearm safety rule that must be applied to all \n     conditions is that a firearm should be stored so that it is \n     not accessible to untrained or unauthorized people.\n\n  And, in Senator Craig's words:\n\n       That is the right rule. That is the one that really fits. \n     That is the one that really works well and then you don't \n     have the accidents to talk about.\n\n  I think that is as strong an endorsement of the bill that I am \noffering as any language I could offer as part of this record.\n  I will tell you what I have found as I have traveled around and \ntalked about establishing this standard of care so kids don't have \naccess to guns. What I have found is overwhelming support from law \nenforcement. These are the men and women who answer the calls after \nthere has been a terrible accident or a child has taken a gun out and \nshot someone intentionally. There has been solid support on this \nproposal from teachers. Can you imagine, a teacher who goes into a \nclassroom, prepared to teach children, wonders if one of those kids has \nbrought a gun to school. In my home State of Illinois, last school \nyear--not this last one, the one before--144 kids were expelled for \nbringing weapons to school. It is, unfortunately, a growing trend in \nAmerica.\n  In most instances, those weapons came from homes where the guns had \nnot been safely stored. Mark my words, a child will always find \nChristmas gifts and a gun, no matter where you hide them. If you put it \nin the back of the drawer, behind the T-shirts, or up on the shelf in \nthe closet, it is not good enough. We are a nation of 265 million \npeople. We are a nation of 300 million guns, or more--300 million. At \nthis moment, it is estimated that half of those guns are readily \naccessible to children, and a third of all guns are loaded. That is a \ntragic accident about to occur.\n  My goal in introducing this is not to send people to jail. My goal is \nto initiate a national conversation raising the level of awareness and \nsaying to gun owners nationwide: Accept your responsibility to store \nyour guns safely. If you want to own a gun, if you want to exercise \nyour right, exercise your right responsibly. Save the children from \nthese tragedies. Save the parents from this grief. Save innocent \nvictims from what might occur.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I send a modification of my amendment to \nthe desk.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment will \nbe so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3261), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     ``--.

Mr. President, in section (2) of my original amendment, \nthis was the same language with the same intent. Senator Specter, who \nhas this initial program in Philadelphia, had some concerns about the \nlanguage. I will be happy to provide you with a copy. It doesn't change \nthe intent of the amendment at all.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois, in all respects, I am sure, \napproaches this Senate with the right intent, an intent that I think \nall of us would honor--that is, to try to make the world a safer place, \nto try to make people more responsible. There is a problem, a very real \nproblem. Our bills are different, and I think they are very \nincompatible in that regard. I hope the Senator from Illinois can \nsupport my legislation. I wish I could support his, but I cannot.\n  Mr. President, here is the reason I cannot. The Senator from Illinois \nwould like to take a victim and make that individual a criminal. In \nother words, if an adult owns a gun and a child of that adult, or a \nfriend of that adult who happens to be less than 18 years of age, or a \nnephew, finds that\n\n[[Page S8743]]\n\ngun and that gun is used in an accident or in the commission of a \ncrime, or certainly when a death occurs, the victim--the person who had \nhis or her gun stolen from them--all of a sudden becomes the criminal. \nThat is an interesting juxtapose in our society from which we really \nhave tried to stay away. We have focused on criminals and criminal \nacts. But a failure to make secure or to abide by what the Senator \nwould say is a safekeeping of all 300 million guns in this society \nwould make a person a criminal.\n  We know how guns are used. In high crime areas, they are used for \nself-protection. In high crime areas and urban housing--not the nice, \nsuburban household the Senator might envision in his debate--oftentimes \na gun is kept loaded. Is that house totally secure? Do children come \nand go from it? Is it in a high-rise suburban environment, where there \nmight be gang violence, where some members of gangs might have full \naccess to the house because they are cousins or the children of that \nperson using that gun for self-protection? That is very possible. Those \nexceptions are not provided for here. They must be provided for here if \nthe Senator from Illinois is to have a law with any teeth in it.\n  The reality is simple. We reverse, for the first time in our society, \nthe kind of a test as it relates to an act of violence. In this case, \nthe person who has the gun stolen from them all of a sudden becomes the \ncriminal. That is an interesting and strange argument that we have \nnever had put before us before. All of us are interested in controlling \nviolent acts and criminal acts that occur in the commission of a crime. \nMy amendment moves very directly to do that.\n  In fact, my amendment is a movement in a direction that I think is \nextremely positive and is already underway. It is already underway \nbecause what it says is that the Federal firearm laws we have on the \nbooks will be implemented and they will be enforced. Judges don't like \nthem. They don't like to play around with them. They don't necessarily \nlike to prosecute them. Yet, where it happens, crime rates go down and \nlife becomes much safer.\n  What I am talking about and what I wish the Senate to vote on and \nplace into law is the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative, which is \ncurrently a 17-city demonstration project aimed at reducing youth \nfirearm violence and expanding this initiative by putting some real \nteeth in it, much like the model of the Richmond, VA, program that I \nwill discuss in a few minutes. My idea, although it is not novel, is \nthat when most Federal firearm laws were enacted, the notion was to \npunish criminals who commit violent firearm crimes, not to go after the \ninnocent victim who might have had their guns stolen from them. This \nhas not happened.\n  We already heard on the floor yesterday that this administration has \ncut the prosecution of violent acts where guns are used by nearly half. \nThey simply don't pursue the criminal. Yet, it ought to happen. My \namendment suggests that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, in \nconsultation with the attorney general, work with the State of \nPennsylvania and the city of Philadelphia to establish a demonstration \nprogram where the objective will be to identify, apprehend, and \nprosecute all persons who commit firearm violations.\n  Let me tell you about something happening in Richmond, VA. Down \nthere, a Federal prosecutor said to law enforcement officers, ``If you \nwill report to me felons who are arrested in the commission of a crime \nwho are using a firearm, I will prosecute them. Plain and simple. No \nplea bargaining. We are going to prosecute.'' That Federal officer \nhanded out this little card to every cop in Richmond, VA. This card has \na listing of all of the Federal gun possession crimes. It goes on to \nlist them. There is a number to call. An individual officer can call \nthe ATF, and there is a pager number.\n  Here is the rest of the story. Gun-related homicides dropped from 140 \nlast year to only 34 this year.\n  Now, what I am saying is what we ought to be doing in Richmond and in \nPhiladelphia, and a lot of other places across the Nation, is \nincorporating Federal authority along with local authority to go after \nthe criminal who uses the gun. I am sure the Senator from Illinois and \nI have voted for laws or bills that create laws that say if you do thus \nand so, and you use a gun, it is a Federal firearms violation. But we \ndon't get the courts to prosecute them, and we don't follow through; we \ndon't insist.\n  This administration, by their own statistics, has truly been asleep \nat the switch. Let's incorporate juveniles, education, tracking, gun \ntrafficking, and all of those combinations together, and go after the \npeople who are truly responsible. Guess what happens? The crime rate \ngoes down. Incorporate that with the kind of work that has already been \ndone and you will create a safer place.\n  The Philadelphia Exile Project--generally called Project Exile all \nover the country--creates that kind of dynamic. Then I go on to expand \nit, so that we go from 50 cities to, by October of 2000, 75 cities, and \nby 2002, to 150 cities and counties across our country. This is the \nkind of proactive thing that goes directly at the problem. What does it \nsay? It doesn't say to the innocent victim who has had their property \nstolen and it gets used in a crime, and if you didn't do all of these \nright things, guess what, you are the criminal.\n  Now we haven't criminalized a child taking a car and having an \naccident against the parent--especially if they stole the car, took it \nwithout permission. Yet, today we would be doing that with guns. I \nthink that is wrong. I think the Senator from Illinois is right. He \nshould be able to support my amendment because it goes at the root \ncause. It incorporates all of the agencies, and it makes real the very \nthing that he and I want done. We want the laws enforced. We want \ncriminals prosecuted. We know that 90 percent of the crime out there is \nthe result of not new action, but old action --people with criminal \nrecords. That is what this is all about.\n\n  We have taken the concept of going after the criminal, we have \nincorporated it with the juvenile crime gun interdiction initiative, \nbrought those kind of things into combination, and I think we have a \ndynamic force here.\n  What do we do?\n  We provide new information about illegal firearm activities to \ncommunities. We identify differences in adult, juvenile, and youth \nillegal firearms activities. We extend access to firearm-related \nenforcement information. We initiate community, State, and national \nreporting on firearms trafficking. We enable enforcement officers to \nfocus their resources where they are likely to have the greatest impact \non illegal trafficking to juveniles and violent youth gang members.\n  I think for those who were listening yesterday, when we look at the \ndeaths created by juvenile activities with firearms today, the vast \nmajority of the 95 percent are in that higher bracket. The accidental \nare there--not insignificant, but very, very small.\n  That is the reality of what I attempt to do. It incorporates \ndemonstration projects today that are working. It makes them Federal \nlaw. It expands them across the Nation. It goes after the criminal, and \nnot the innocent victim who has had their property stolen. My colleague \nfrom Illinois would like to make them the criminal. That is a strange \nposition to have in Federal law. We ought to leave that alone.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask that I might have 7 minutes to \nspeak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would appreciate it if the Chair would let me know when \nthe 7 minutes are up.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to yield to my cosponsor of \nthis legislation, the Senator from Rhode Island, 7 minutes.\n  I say at the outset that I support the bill offered by the Senator \nfrom Idaho. It is a good bill. It tries to establish more care with \nhandguns. But it doesn't address the issue which the Senator from Rhode \nIsland and I seek to address.\n  I yield to him.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the Senator \nfrom Idaho and his remarks.\n  He indicated that it was a ``shocking''--if I am quoting him \ncorrectly--``shocking'' event to punish the person\n\n[[Page S8744]]\n\nwhose weapon caused the damage; the person who is careless in the \nstorage of that firearm under this legislation pays a penalty. The \nSenator from Idaho, as I understood him, thought that was a very \nstrange procedure.\n  I will say this, Mr. President. I think every one of us know that if \nyou own a pit bull, and you don't keep that pit bull tied up properly, \nand it mauls some innocent child, that the owner of that pit bull is \nliable. We have a situation akin to that--not pit bulls, but \ndangerously loaded weapons that are carelessly strewn about someone's \nhome. A youngster comes in and gets hold of them and uses it for \ndestructive purposes. That person that owns that weapon ought to pay \nthe penalty. The suggestion that this is something strange and unheard \nof strikes me in itself as being strange.\n  Mr. President, we have seen, all of us, these horrible incidents that \nhave taken place over the past year in schools where youngsters have \nobtained weapons frequently because the weapons are not properly \nstored. They are not properly locked up. They are left around not only \ncarelessly, but they are loaded.\n  Let's just review these, if we might.\n  In October, a 16-year-old at Pearl High School in Mississippi went to \nschool with a hunting rifle. He shot and killed a student and a \nteacher, leaving a second teacher with a bullet wound in the head.\n  In December, a student at Heath High School in West Paducah, KY, used \na pistol to kill three other students.\n  I mean, this is what is happening in our schools.\n  The shooter was 14 years old.\n  In March, two boys in Jonesboro, AR, one 11 years old and the other \n13 years old, pulled the fire alarm in their school. As students and \nteachers left the building, the two boys began shooting. They killed \nfive people: Four young girls, and a teacher.\n  In April, a 14-year-old boy in Edinboro, PA, went to a school dance \nwith a gun he apparently removed from his father's bureau drawer. He \nkilled a science teacher and injured two students and another teacher.\n  At Thurston High School in Springfield, OR, a 15-year-old who was \nsuspended for carrying a gun to school returned to school the next day \nand opened fire in a crowded cafeteria. He killed two students and \nwounded 19 others--19 others. He killed two, and wounded 19 others. \nPolice suspect he shot and killed his parents as well.\n\n  These are terrible, tragic shootings.\n  According to Handgun Control, 91 percent of handguns involved in \nunintentional shootings come from the home where the shootings occur.\n  Mr. President, this is a national disaster. There are 192 million \nfirearms--192 million firearms--in the possession of private citizens \nin our Nation, and 35 percent of American homes contain at least one \ngun.\n  Each year, more than 500 children accidentally shoot themselves or a \nsibling, a family member, with a family gun.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, the firearms-related \ndeath rate for American children under the age of 15--I mean, I think \nit is important we realize what we are talking about here. These \nyoungsters are under 15. The rate in the United States for the death \nrate of these children through guns is 12 times higher than that of the \nother 25 industrialized nations combined.\n  One thing is certain. It is simply too easy for children to get a \ngun. At the very least, adults should be encouraged to store their guns \nin a manner and a place that is inaccessible to children. If they \ndon't, and if the child uses the gun to harm himself or someone else, \nthe adult should be held responsible.\n  I find it hard to argue with that premise. As I say, if there is a \npit bull, no one would argue a bit that the pit bull should be chained \nup. We have seen incidents--certainly, I have seen them in my State--\nwhere they are not chained and they maul some youngster terribly. The \nowner of that dog, that pit bull, is held responsible. And the owner of \na gun that is far more dangerous than that pit bull should likewise be \nheld responsible.\n  Are we embarking on something radical here, something that is \nunacceptable by the public?\n  In April, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll was taken--a bipartisan \npoll by Peter Hart and Bob Teeter, whom most of us know. We know Bob \nTeeter. We have worked with him. Others on the other side have worked \nwith Peter Hart.\n  This is the question:\n\n       Congress is considering legislation that holds adults \n     criminally responsible if they allow young children to have \n     access to firearms that are used to injure or kill another \n     person. Do you favor or oppose this legislation?\n\n  That was the question. You are going to hold adults criminally \nresponsible if young children have access to firearms that are used to \ninjure or kill another.\n  The answer was 75 percent said they favored this type of legislation; \n21 percent said they opposed it, and 4 percent were undecided.\n  It seems to me that it is time that we in Congress caught up with the \nAmerican people on this issue. Here is an opportunity to encourage gun \nowners to act responsibly by keeping their weapons out of the reach of \nchildren.\n  This amendment does not prevent anybody from owning a gun. That is a \nred herring, if anybody suggests that. It says if you are a gun owner \nwho has reason to expect a child to be on the premises, you must store \nyour gun safely. I don't think the National Rifle Association would \nobject to that. Certainly, it seems to me, they would encourage people \nto store their weapons safely. If they failed to store them safely, and \na child uses it to harm himself, or someone else, the gun owner can be \nheld criminally liable. That makes total common sense to me.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this commonsense approach to \ngun safety.\n  I thank my cosponsor who worked so hard on this, and I thank the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes thirteen seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me only make a few comments as it \nrelates to what Senator Chafee has said, because I think it is \nimportant that we understand the reality of some of what he has \nportrayed. The pit-bull argument sounds not only exciting, it sounds \nhorrifying. Now, there is a little thing in law called, in this \ninstance, the first bite. In other words, if it is known that the dog \nis dangerous, then there is a responsibility. If it is not known that \nthe dog is dangerous and the dog has never shown dangerous tendencies, \nthen the owner is not liable, and that has stood up in court. But if \nthe dog is known to be dangerous, and the dog is chained in the \nbackyard, and the backyard is fenced, and the gates are locked, and a \nchild crawls in the range of the dog that is chained and is injured, \nthe owner is not liable.\n  But what the Senator is saying is, if you have a gun in your house \nand your house is gained access to by someone, oh, yes, if the door is \nopen and a child invites another child in, and that child finds a gun \nand misuses it, then, of course, the owner of the gun is liable.\n  I don't believe that is the pit-bull argument. And I don't think it \ncan be, because the owner may have put the gun away, and did in this \ninstance.\n  What if the owner had it locked up but the child of the owner knew \nwhere the key was? Now, who is liable there? A lot of definitions go on \nwanting and my argument still holds, I do believe, that the victim in \nthis instance, the owner of the gun, who has had the gun stolen from \nhim, all of a sudden becomes the criminal.\n  The pit-bull argument cannot and does not hold in this instance, nor \nshould it. We understand those kinds of arguments. You can store your \ngun in safety, and all of a sudden it is taken and used and you are \nliable. The victim should not be the criminal.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to offer my support of the \nDurbin Amendment to the Commerce, Justice, and State Department \nAppropriations Bill. The recent tragedies in Arkansas and Pennsylvania \ncall our attention once again to the youth violence facing our nation: \nthe pointless injury and loss of life, the families that are ripped \napart, the classmates who witness the horror or lose a friend, and the \ncommunities consumed in fear. No one can calculate the direct and \nindirect costs flowing from any one of the 14 times every day in which \na child dies\n\n[[Page S8745]]\n\nfrom a gunshot wound. National response to this death toll has been \nminimal, and little has changed in our approach to regulating guns \nsince 1973. Although no one can replace what was lost, we can at least \ntake steps to prevent future tragedies.\n  But as we know from harsh experience, you can't arrest your way out \nof these problems. We must be equally credible on enforcement and \nprevention to have an impact. And we have to keep guns out of the reach \nof our children. We need to keep children away from guns. And it means \nadoption of the Durbin amendment, which requires adults to lock up \ntheir guns. The guns used in school shootings in Arkansas and \nPennsylvania belonged to adult relatives of the children who used them. \nFifteen states already have child access prevention laws, and those \nlaws work.\n  What we are talking about here today is taking responsibility for the \nsafety of our children. That means all of us taking responsibility to \nchange the culture of violence, and taking sensible steps to keep \nchildren safe. The Durbin amendment takes such a step and it deserves \nto be enacted this year by this Congress. How much longer must we \nendure the horrors of juvenile violence before we respond with measures \nthat we already know are effective?\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield 1 minute of the 3 remaining to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I compliment both Senators for this legislation. I think it is common \nsense. I think it is long overdue.\n  I most profoundly disagree with the Senator from Idaho. If the gun is \nunder lock and key, the owner is exempt from criminal liability. Let me \nrepeat that. If the gun is under lock and key, the owner is exempt from \ncriminal liability.\n  On Monday, a 4-year-old boy in Maryland was shot with his \ngrandfather's .22 caliber handgun. The gun was loaded. It was not \nequipped with a trigger lock. The children were playing with the gun. \nThe gun discharged and struck the 4-year-old in the face. Fortunately, \nthe boy was not seriously injured and is expected to recover.\n\n  On Tuesday, unfortunately, 61 Senators voted against a common-sense \nrequirement to require handgun manufacturers to include childproof \ntrigger locks with every handgun they sell. A simply safety requirement \nthat would help to stop the growing number of accidental gun-related \ninjuries and deaths that involve children every year.\n  In my view, the sharp contrast between these two events is striking. \nOne day, a child is shot in the face because the gun he and his \nplaymates find does not have a trigger lock. The next day, the Senate \nvotes against requiring all guns to be sold with trigger locks.\n  What is the matter when we cannot fulfill our basic responsibility to \nkeep children safe from the dangers of irresponsible gun ownership?\n  I believe that the legislation currently before us authored by \nSenators Durbin and Chafee, offers an excellent avenue for ensuring \nthat gun owners who allow children access to their guns are held liable \nwhen their negligence leads to death or injury.\n  The bipartisan Child Firearm Access Prevention Act will keep kids \nfrom taking guns owned by adults and, either purposely or accidentally, \nkilling or injuring themselves or another person.\n  The legislation puts the burden on the adults who own the guns to \nstore their guns in a safe and secure manner--with a trigger lock, a \ncombination lock, in a gun safe, or in a lock box.\n  If an adult who owns a gun chooses to store the firearm in a loaded \ncondition--unlocked and unsafe--and a child uses that gun to kill or \ninjure someone or exhibits that firearm in a public place, then that \nadult can be imprisoned for 1 year and fined as much as $10,000.\n\n  The need for this legislation should be entirely obvious. I would \nwager that there is not a single Senator who hasn't heard of the parade \nof senseless violence that has plagued our nation's schools.\n  Some recent incidents include:\n       Barry Loukaitas, 14, February 2, 1996, Moses Lake, \n     Washington: Allegedly shot and killed two students and a \n     teacher at his school. In his confession Barry said he got \n     two of his guns from an unlocked cabinet in his house and one \n     from the family car.\n       Evan Ramsey, 17, February 19, 1997, Bethel, Alaska: Shot \n     and killed a student and a principal, and wounded two other \n     students, at his high school. According to police, the gun \n     Evan used was kept unlocked at the foot of the stairs in his \n     house.\n       Luke Woodham, 16, October 1, 1997, Pearl, Mississippi: \n     Allegedly stabbed his mother and then shot nine students, \n     killing two, at his high school.\n       Michael Carneal, 14, December 1, 1997, West Paducah, \n     Kentucky: Accused of killing three students and wounding five \n     students who were participating in a high school prayer \n     circle.\n       Andrew Golden, 11, and Mitchell Johnson, 13, March 24, \n     1998, Jonesboro, Arkansas: Accused of shooting to death four \n     girls and a teacher, and wounding ten, at his school. The \n     boys took the guns they used in the crime from Andrew's \n     grandfather who said he usually kept his guns unlocked in the \n     house.\n       Andrew Wurst, 14, April 24, 1998, Edinboro, Pennsylvania: \n     Shot a teacher to death at a school dance.\n       Jacob Davis, 18, Fayetteville, Tennessee, May 19, 1998: \n     Allegedly shot and killed a high school classmate.\n       Kipland ``Kip'' Kinkel, 15, Springfield, Oregon, May 21, \n     1998: Shooting spree at both home and school which left four \n     dead and twenty-two injured.\n  In all, these tragedies total 20 deaths and 48 injuries.\n  Other non-fatal incidents include:\n       A 5-year-old kindergarten student in Memphis who took a \n     loaded .25-caliber pistol to school because he wanted to kill \n     his teacher for putting him in a ``timeout'',\n       A police officer's 10-year-old son who was arrested when he \n     took an unloaded, semiautomatic pistol to school in his \n     bookbag,\n       A 15-year-old high school student who was arrested when \n     authorities confiscated 20 pistols, rifles, and shotguns from \n     his home after the boy threatened his 9th grade teacher,\n       And a 16-year-old boy, suspended from school for vandalism, \n     who was caught by authorities on campus with a .22-caliber \n     revolver in his front pocket.\n  Indeed, the scope of this problem is reaching epic proportions.\n  The National School Safety Center indicates that, during the 1997-\n1998 school year, there were 41 school-associated violent deaths in the \nUnited States. That's nearly a 61 percent increase from the year before \nwhen there were 25 such incidents.\n  And it's no wonder the incidents of school violence are increasing. A \n1998 study by the National Center for Education Statistics and the \nBureau of Justice showed that, of 10,000 students surveyed, 1,200 \nstudents knew someone who had taken a gun to school. It is amazing to \nme that, given the large number of students who have taken guns to \nschool, there haven't been even more gun related deaths in our schools.\n  Since the National School Safety Center began keeping track of \nschool-associated violent deaths in July 1992, there have been 227 \nstudents who have died on campus. 53 of them--nearly 1 out of every 4--\nwere from my home state of California.\n  In fact, the problem of gun fire on campuses has gotten so bad that \nstudents in some California schools practice ``duck and cover'' drills \nmuch in the same way that students in the 1950's and 1960's practiced \ntaking cover during nuclear air-raid drills.\n  An article in the Los Angeles Times last August detailed how the \nthreat of gun fire has become like the new nuclear threat looming over \ntoday's elementary, middle, and high school students.\n  The article reads: ``They're called drop drills, crisis drills, and \neven bullet drills. In many schools, a special alarm sounds, as it \nwould during an actual nearby shooting. Teachers shout ``Drop!'' and \nstudents duck under their desks or sprawl on the ground, covering their \nheads. Many schools also immediately initiate a lock-down during the \ndrill, as they would with a shooting, sealing the campus off from the \nviolence outside.''\n  And it continues: ``The drop procedure was used by students at \nFigueroa Street Elementary School in February 1996 when teacher Alfredo \nPerez was hit by a stray bullet. Perez's fifth-graders ducked when the \nbullet flew through the window, and then they crawled out of the room \nand stayed on the floor until teachers told them they could get up.\n  Principal Rosemary Lucente credits the drop bill, which they practice \nat least once a month, with keeping the students out of further \ndanger.''\n  And so it has come to this. Our students are forced to practice duck \nand cover drills because their schools have gotten too hazardous for \nthem to focus on what they're there for in the first place which is to \nlearn.\n  When the situation has gotten that bad it is my view that it is our \nresponsibility to try and help provide some sanity in our schools and \nprotect children from guns.\n\n[[Page S8746]]\n\n  We can do that by holding adults who own guns responsible if their \ncareless storage of dangerous firearms results in the threat of death \nor injury. What's more, we must also encourage parents to spend more \ntime with their children, to reconnect with them, to teach them that \nguns are not toys, and to teach them the difference between right and \nwrong.\n  Opponents of this bill will argue that it won't solve all the \nproblems of kids with guns, that it won't stop kids from getting killed \nor injured by firearms. Frankly, I don't know if that's true or not. \nBut I do know that one thing this legislation will do is it will force \nadults to be more safe and more responsible with their guns and that \nwill save lives.\n  I support this legislation whole-heartedly and I encourage my \ncolleagues in the Senate to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has 6 minutes 43 \nseconds remaining. The Senator from Illinois has 2 minutes 4 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let's talk about that tragic situation in \nJonesboro, AR. What the Senator from Illinois is proposing would not \nhave solved the problem in Jonesboro, AR, even though that young child \nobtained his gun from a grandfather who had locked his house and the \nchild entered the home without permission and the gun was locked in a \ncase. I don't know how we legislate against that. My guess is, we do \nnot, not very successfully. All of a sudden grandpa becomes the \ncriminal, and you are going to go after grandpa at a time when his \ngrandchild has done that onerous act?\n  Now, the Senator mentioned 15 States that have similar laws and yet \nthe courts very seldom use them and juries very seldom give decisions \nbecause we know the parent is in a horrible situation at the time that \nkind of accident occurs. They are the victim, and they become the \ncriminal. We all know that underage children in our care who act as \nthose children do, we are every bit as much the victim.\n  Why don't we pass the legislation that I have proposed that \nincorporates the forces of the Federal Government, the State \ngovernment, and local government, and goes after criminals who use guns \nand criminal acts and bring down our crime rates and work to take the \nguns out of the hands of the juveniles where the killings are really \ngoing on in this country?\n  No, it isn't as dramatic; it doesn't make for the political speech in \nthe Chamber, but it sure makes the streets a lot safer. It doesn't take \nlaw-abiding citizens and make them criminals. That is what this Senate \nought to be doing, and I hope the Senate will do that tonight. It is \nthe right and the responsible approach.\n  Let me, once again, briefly go through my proposal. It is patterned \nafter the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative that is working right \nnow in Philadelphia. It incorporates the Project Exile in Richmond, VA, \nwhere a Federal prosecutor says, ``Report to me felons who are using a \ngun in the commission of a crime, and I will prosecute them, and I will \nput them away.'' He has, and the crime rate has plummeted. Bring those \ntwo forces together and we make this world a safer place. And we take \nguns out of the hands of juveniles.\n  No, we don't deal with the accident. I am not sure I know how to do \nthat. I don't think we can do that here. I don't think we can make \nparents criminals. We have chosen not to do that in the past for a \nvariety of reasons. We have argued safety. We have educated safety. We \nhope parents and adults will be responsible with their rights. In this \ninstance there is a clear division. It is an important division. Our \ninstitutions have to recognize that juveniles in our society today are \nmore violent than they have ever been, and we are searching for answers \nto that. We do not know all of the answers, but we do know we have a \nproblem. Our problem is to penalize the parent who has tried to act \nresponsibly? I don't think so. It is certainly our job to encourage \ngreater parental responsibility, and we all know that a person who owns \na gun in a law-abiding way has a responsibility for his or her right in \nthis society. And we encourage that. But we say a $10,000 fine and a \nFederal offense and you are a criminal if somebody misuses the gun? I \nhope not. I hope that is not the case.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I believe I have 2 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 3 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, with every right in America, there is a \nresponsibility, even with the second amendment right to bear arms. \nEvery gun owner has a responsibility to store his gun safely.\n  What I find interesting about the argument from the Senator from \nIdaho is that when I speak to responsible gun owners across America, \nthe first thing they tell me is, ``Senator, I do not want any of my \nguns to harm any of my children or anyone else's children or any \ninnocent person. I understand I have a responsibility to store them \nsafely.''\n  The Senator from Idaho is arguing that gun owners have no \nresponsibility and should have no responsibility under the law to store \ntheir guns safely.\n  That is not a fair standard. The overwhelming majority of the \nAmerican people may support an individual's right to own a gun, but the \noverwhelming majority of the American people also understand that right \ncarries a responsibility to protect innocent children. The fact that \nthere has not been an enforcement action in 15 States where the laws \nare on the books should be heartening to the Senator from Idaho, and \nnot discouraging, because in those same States that have passed laws \njust like this, the number of accidents involving firearms with \nchildren have gone down over 20 percent.\n  We can save children's lives with this amendment by saying to gun \nowners: ``Take this issue responsibly.'' Let us send America's kids \nback to school safely, schools that are gun free and violence free, and \nlet the parents of those kids realize they have a responsibility, if \nthey are gun owners, to store their guns safely so their children \ncannot get their hands on them and hurt themselves or others.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator from Illinois can say a good many things on \nthis floor, but he cannot say something I did not say and attribute it \nto me. I did not say there was not a responsibility to manage and \nhandle your guns in a law-abiding and safe way.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I agree with the arguments made both by \nthe Senator from Idaho and the Senator from Illinois that it is very \nuseful to have a Federal crackdown on those who violate the law with \nguns. When I was district attorney in Philadelphia, I sought to have \nthe Board of Judges impose a standard rule that there be at least some \njail time for those who violate the law with guns, and was unsuccessful \nin that effort.\n  One of the first pieces of legislation I introduced on coming to the \nSenate provided for the armed career criminal bill, which mandates a \nsentence of 15 years to life for a career criminal who has been found \nin possession of a firearm.\n  I am pleased the legislation offered by the Senator from Idaho will \nencompass the City of Philadelphia on a Federal crackdown.\n  Let me say, parenthetically, this is the first opportunity I have had \nto take the Senate floor. I thank my colleagues for the standing \novation which I received when I returned and thank them for the very \nmany good wishes.\n  I wish I had longer to talk about this issue. But I do believe the \nFederal jurisdiction, with the speedy trial rules and the tougher \nsentencing and the avoidance, at least in my experience, in the \nPhiladelphia State courts of judge shopping and plea bargaining, will \nbe a great boon to cracking down on those who violate the law with \nguns.\n  Just a word or two about a couple of earlier votes. I supported the \nproposition to allow counsel into the grand jury room. That is sort of \nan onerous proceeding, where the prosecutor is present with the witness \nand up to 23 grand jurors. It is a little anomalous, given the right to \ncounsel, that the witness must appear alone in the grand jury room, \nwhich is a closed Star Chamber proceeding, but I think the orderly \nadministration of criminal justice will be served better if a witness' \ncounsel is permitted to be present.\n  An earlier vote, too, occurred on an effort by the Senator from \nAlabama,\n\n[[Page S8747]]\n\nSenator Sessions, to allocate more funds to law enforcement as opposed \nto rehabilitation. I supported the motion to table Senator Sessions' \namendment because I believe there ought to be more on the seamless web \nfor rehabilitation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a legislative \nfellow in the office of Senator Wyden of Oregon, Martin Kodis, be \npermitted the privilege of the floor during consideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent, on both the Craig amendment and \nthe Durbin amendment, the yeas and nays be ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to ordering the yeas and \nnays en bloc at this time?\n  Without objection, it is in order.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, so my colleagues know where we stand--and I \ncertainly thank the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Idaho \nfor their timely discussion of what was a fairly complicated issue; \nboth Senator Hollings and I greatly appreciate their courtesy in moving \ndebate along--we are now waiting for Senator Thompson, who I understand \nis on the way to the floor to offer his amendment. Then we will go to \nSenator Bumpers. We will probably be skipping over the amendment by \nSenator Nickles. As I understand it, he is not available until probably \n9 or 9:15. So we will go to Senator Feingold after Senator Bumpers.\n  That is the order we are proceeding under, under the previous \nunanimous consent. As soon as Senator Thompson arrives, we shall take \nup his amendment.\n  I make a point of order a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3256, As Modified\n\n   (Purpose: To reinstate certain principles, criteria, and policies \n            relating to Federalism, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3256 and I \nsend a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Thompson], for himself, Mr. \n     Lott and Mr. Nickles, proposes an amendment numbered 3256, as \n     modified.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . POLICIES RELATING TO FEDERALISM.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the President should \n     repeal Executive Order No. 13083, issued May 14, 1998 and \n     should reissue Executive Order No. 12612, issued October 26, \n     1987, and Executive Order No. 12875, issued October 26, 1993.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, this amendment is offered to protect and \npreserve federalism. If there is one concept in recent years that has \ngained in credence, it is the concept of federalism. We have seen a lot \nof innovation happen in this country that has started at the State and \nlocal level. We have paid credence to it with regard to welfare reform \nand other measures.\n  The Supreme Court, in recent years, has struck down cases based upon \nthe tenth amendment. The tenth amendment has been reinvigorated, and I \nthink we have come together as a nation in many respects in our belief \nthat many of our problems need to be addressed at the State and local \nlevel, and that is what our original framers of the Constitution had in \nmind. Not only is it constitutionally sound but it has worked in \npractice.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Majority Leader Lott and \nAssistant Leader Nickles be added as cosponsors. They have long fought \nfor the principles of federalism.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, in May the President issued Executive \nOrder 13803 which purported to set out a new definition of \n``federalism.'' However, it explicitly replaced President Reagan's \nExecutive order on federalism and, in reality, the new order undermines \nfederalism.\n  Furthermore, it was written in secret without even any consultation \nwith State and local officials. Every major State and local government \ngroup opposes this so-called federalism order, and they have asked the \nPresident to withdraw it.\n  My amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the President \nrevoke his May 14th order and help restore the proper respect for State \nand local government and in our Federal system by reinstating both \nPresident Reagan's and his own prior orders on this subject.\n  The Founding Fathers believed that the Federal Government had limited \npowers. The tenth amendment states that the powers not delegated to the \nStates are reserved to the States or to the people. The public clearly \nwants important decisions to be made closer to home and not dictated \nfrom Washington, DC.\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton's order will undermine federalism \nand promote Federal meddling into local affairs. President Clinton's \norder revokes President Reagan's Executive Order 12612 which was a \nclear commitment to the tenth amendment principles of a limited Federal \nGovernment. The new Clinton order shifts the Reagan presumption against \nFederal involvement in State and local matters to a presumption for \nFederal intervention. President Clinton's new order also revokes his \nown 1993 Executive Order 12875 which directed the Federal Government to \navoid unfunded mandates.\n  To add insult to injury, the White House never talked with State or \nlocal governments while the new order was being developed. Ironically, \nit was issued from England. More ironically, White House officials did \nnot consult with local officials on an Executive order which itself \ncalls for more consultation with local officials. In a recent \nWashington Post article, one anonymous White House official admitted, \n``This was a mistake. We screwed up.'' Mr. President, I agree.\n  The White House belatedly has offered to delay the order and take \ncomments from State and local officials, but the Clinton administration \nhas shown no willingness to rescind this order, as State and local \nofficials have requested.\n  State and local officials were understandably irritated that the \nWhite House shut them out of this process. But more importantly, they \nimmediately saw through the rhetoric that was coming out on this matter \nand saw the real purpose of the Executive order. State and local \nofficials know that the order is basically a Government power grab at \nthe Federal level that will undercut their ability to serve the public, \nand that is why they are so exercised about it.\n  President Clinton was asked to rescind the order by the ``big \nseven,'' as they are called--big seven State and local government \ngroups. They include the National Governors Association, the National \nConference of State Legislature, the Council of State Governments, the \nNational Association of Counties, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the \nNational League of Cities, and the International City/County Management \nAssociation.\n  Mr. President, this order will promote Federal intrusion into local \ndecisionmaking, and it shows contempt for the ability of State and \nlocal officials to manage their own affairs. We don't want that. That \nis not the message that has been coming out of this Congress. That is \nnot even the message that has been coming out from prior Executive \norders by this administration, as late as 1993.\n  Even though, as I say, it was promoted as a concept that would \nenhance federalism, and it has a lot of good language in there about \nthe principles of federalism, when you get right down to it, it \nrescinds the basic presumption that when Federal agencies look at a\n\n[[Page S8748]]\n\nmatter, it basically presumes, unless it is very clear, that the \nmatters should be resolved at the State and local level. That is a \npresumption that has worked very well for us, and I urge the adoption \nof this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the seven state and local \norganizations, an article from the Washington Post, and a letter from \nGovernor Voinovich of Ohio be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     Washington, DC July 17, 1998.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing on behalf of the \n     nation's elected state and local government leaders to \n     request that you withdraw Executive Order 13083. We urge this \n     action to provide for meaningful consultations with state and \n     local officials not on E.O. 13083, but on whether any changes \n     ought to be considered with respect to Executive Orders 12875 \n     (Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership) and 12612 \n     (Federalism). No state and local government official was \n     consulted in the drafting of E.O. 13083. In contrast, this \n     administration fully engaged state and local officials and \n     their associations in the drafting of your E.O. 12875.\n       While we appreciate the offer by your administration to \n     extend the comment period by 90 days, we feel that Executive \n     Order 13083 so seriously erodes federalism that we must \n     request its withdrawal.\n       Because we all have imminent meetings of our elected \n     leaders, we believe it especially critical for you to \n     consider and act upon our request to withdraw the order as \n     quickly as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor George V. Voinovich,\n       Chairman National Governors' Association.\n     Senator Richard Finan,\n       Senate President, President, National Conference of State \n     Legislatures.\n     Commissioner Randy Johnson,\n       Hennepin County, Minnesota, President, National Association \n     of Counties.\n     Deedee Corradini,\n       Mayor of Salt Lake City, President, The U.S. Conference of \n     Mayors.\n     Representative Charlie Williams,\n       Chairman, Council of State Governments, Mississippi.\n     Brian O'Neill,\n       Council Member, City of Philadelphia President, National \n     League of Cities.\n     Gary Gwyn, City Manager,\n       Grand Prairie, Texas, President International City/County \n     Management Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 16, 1998]\n\n Executive Order Urged Consulting, but Didn't; State, Local Officials \n                          Want Federalism Say\n\n                          (By David S. Broder)\n\n       Two months ago, while attending the economic summit of \n     industrial nations in Birmingham, England, President Clinton \n     signed Executive Order 13083 on federalism. After setting \n     forth nine conditions for when federal intervention and \n     preemption is justified, it required every executive agency \n     to ``have an effective process to permit elected officials \n     and other representatives of state and local governments to \n     provide meaningful and timely input in the development of \n     regulatory policies that have federalism implications.''\n       On Tuesday, two months to the day after Clinton signed the \n     order, the Washington representatives of the ``Big Seven'' \n     organizations of state and local government had a stormy \n     meeting with Mickey Ibarra, the chief of White House \n     intergovernmental relations, and then drafted a letter to \n     Clinton demanding that he withdraw the executive order.\n       The reason: No state or local government official was \n     consulted in the drafting of the executive order, a directive \n     the Big Seven officials said in the draft ``calls into \n     question fundamental principles of federalism.''\n       Because the new order revokes the previous federalism \n     guidelines signed by former President Ronald Reagan and by \n     Clinton himself in 1993, the draft letter said ``we are \n     concerned that all references to the Tenth Amendment, \n     identification of new costs or burdens, preemption and \n     reduction of unfunded mandates are revoked. . . . We believe \n     the changes in the order and the manner in which they were \n     made raise serious questions'' about the administration's \n     commitment to partnership with state and local governments.\n       White House officials yesterday denied the order signaled \n     any change of policy and scrambled to appease the Big Seven, \n     knowing that almost all the groups will be meeting in the \n     next few weeks and that congressional Republicans are on the \n     trail of the controversy. Indeed, yesterday afternoon, Barry \n     J. Toiv, a White House spokesman, said administration \n     officials had decided to recommend to the president that he \n     issue another order delaying implementation of the first one \n     so officials would have the opportunity to meet and discuss \n     the issues with state and local authorities.\n       ``We thought there were no real substantive changes . . . \n     but in retrospect, it wouldn't have hurt'' to review the new \n     language with the state and local officials, Toiv said. The \n     first executive order was not scheduled to go into effect \n     until Aug. 14.\n       Another Clinton aide, who did not want to be identified, \n     said of the lack of consultation, ``This was a mistake. We \n     screwed up.''\n       William T. Pound, executive director of the National \n     Conference of State Legislatures, welcomed the news of the \n     planned delay.\n       ``It's a first step. A second step is--we clearly want \n     substantive changes,'' Pound said.\n       Officials said the staff work on the executive order had \n     been done by Sally Katzen, who supervised regulatory work at \n     the Office of Management and Budget until recently becoming \n     deputy director of the White House National Economic Council, \n     and by lawyers in the White House counsel's office.\n       After the meeting with Ibarra and White House lawyers, \n     Pound said, ``They gave us no good reason why this was done \n     without consultation. They order everyone else to consult, \n     but then do exactly the opposite. It's a slap in the face, \n     really.''\n       The other groups that attended the meeting were the \n     National Governors Association, the Council of State \n     Governments, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National \n     League of Cities, the National Association of Counties and \n     the International City/County Management Association.\n       The long delay in the group's explosive reaction came \n     about, Pound said, ``because none of us knew they were going \n     to do this, and none of us knew they had done its. It was a \n     stealth executive order.\n       The first official to raise the alarm was Rep. David M. \n     McIntosh (R-Ind.), a subcommittee chairman on the House \n     Committee on Government Reform and Oversight and a man who \n     had occupied the same OMB position as Katzen during the \n     Reagan administration. He wrote Clinton saying that in \n     revoking the previous orders, ``you stripped the most basic \n     protection accorded the states, the preparation of a Federal \n     Assessment,'' which required agencies to analyze the burdens \n     any new regulation imposes on state and local governments.\n       Instead of requiring federal agencies to ``refrain to the \n     maximum extent possible from establishing uniform national \n     standards for programs,'' as the previous orders did, \n     McIntosh wrote, ``your order requires no restraint or \n     deference to the states.''\n       In a July 1 letter of reply, White House counsel Charles \n     F.C. Ruff said the Unfunded Mandates Relief Act, passed in \n     1995, requires the same kind of assessments the old orders \n     did. But McIntosh said yesterday the administration does not \n     practice what it preaches, pointing to the recent \n     administration directive--that states said was done without \n     adequate consultation--that states must pay for Viagra \n     prescriptions for Medicaid patients no matter what the cost.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              George V.

Fred Thompson,\n     Chairman, Governmental Affairs Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Thompson: I am writing in strong support of \n     your amendment to repeal President Clinton's Executive Order \n     13083 (Federalism).\n       Executive Order 13083 undermines and replaces previous \n     Executive Orders 12875 (Enhancing the Intergovernmental \n     Partnership) and 12612 (Federalism), which recognized and \n     guaranteed the division of governmental responsibilities \n     embodied in the Constitution.\n       Executive Order 13083 was promulgated without any \n     consultation with state and local elected officials. I \n     strongly oppose Executive Order 13083 because it \n     fundamentally contradicts the 10th Amendment to the \n     Constitution and the basic principles of federalism.\n       Previously, the leaders of the seven bipartisan \n     organizations representing state and local elected officials \n     wrote to the President stating, ``Executive Order 13083 so \n     seriously erodes federalism that we must request its \n     withdrawal.'' I appreciate your efforts to repeal this \n     unfortunate attempt to justify and broaden federal preemption \n     of state and local governments.\n       Thank you again for your leadership on this critical issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              George V. Voinovich,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am still nonplused as to the \nparticular content of those Executive orders. I say nonplused. I know \nthe President,\n\n[[Page S8749]]\n\nand if there is one group he really yields to, it is local and State \ngovernments, having been a Governor, having come to office as a new, \nwhatever they call this thing--leadership, Democrat, or whatever else. \nHe hadn't been necessarily on the side of the Federal Government but on \nthe side of State and local governments.\n  I understand the misgivings of the Senator from Tennessee, and I \nunderstand what he said, that the Governors have asked and yet, \napparently, the White House has declined. That is why I am nonplused, \nbecause I would like to know a little bit more about it, and I am \nchecking right now those Executive orders and with members of our \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, which does have jurisdiction on this \nparticular matter.\n  In short, in other words, Executive Order 12612 and Executive Order \n12875, the Senator from Tennessee says they change a basic presumption \nfrom federalism--local and State levels to be employed and approached, \nbefore we take over at the Federal level--with which I agree. I happen \nto think that the President agrees, too. That is why I want a little \ntime to check this out.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest it might be acceptable to the Senator from \nTennessee, because the Senator from South Carolina does have concerns \nthat haven't been addressed and he has to get information, maybe we can \nset this amendment aside and move on to the Bumpers amendment. We are \ngoing to have votes at 9:30. Prior to the 9:30 period, if the Senator \nfrom South Carolina feels he needs to come back for further debate, we \ncan go to it at that time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If the Senator will yield, I will be most happy to \nproceed in that direction. I suggest perhaps I consult with the Senator \nfrom South Carolina. I have the Executive orders here.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I appreciate that. I am sort of ready to go along with \nwhat the Senator from Tennessee said. Let me look at those Executive \norders.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Very well.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3257\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment \nNo. 3257.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is in order to ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest at this time we turn to the amendment from \nSenator Bumpers. I ask unanimous consent that he be recognized on his \namendment, that there be 40 minutes, equally divided, on the Bumpers \namendment, and that at the conclusion of that, that we turn back to the \nThompson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Would the Senator be willing to add a requirement that \nno second-degree amendments be in order? I do not anticipate any. I am \njust thinking we could save some time.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield, the unanimous consent agreement \ndid not preclude second-degrees. At this time I am not in a position to \npreclude second-degrees. I do not expect one. I am not aware of one, \nbut I am not in a position to agree to that.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I was thinking, in exchange for a time agreement I \nthought we could agree that there will be no second-degree amendments. \nIs that not the case?\n  Mr. GREGG. That was not my understanding.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask unanimous consent that no second-degree amendments \nbe in order on the Bumpers amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that there also be no second-\ndegrees on the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3262\n\n(Purpose: To require a report by the Judicial Conference of the United \n   States concerning whether the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure \n should be amended to provide for the presence of witness' counsel in \n                          the grand jury room)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, in order to \nexpedite the passage of this bill, that an amendment that has been \ncleared on both sides and offered by Senator Hatch and me--that we \ndispose of that now before I offer the other amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself and \n     Mr. Hatch, proposes an amendment No. 3262.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n\n     ``SEC.   .

Mr. President, I hope that we can probably yield time \nback on this amendment. Senator Hollings is a cosponsor of the bill \nwhich this amendment is based on, as are several other Senators. It is \na very simple amendment.\n  I first brought this issue to the Senate's attention in 1984 when it \nwas determined that Charles Wick, who at that time was head of the U.S. \nInformation Agency, had been tape recording conversations with just \nabout everybody he talked to, including President Reagan and President \nCarter, without their knowledge or consent.\n  He revealed that he had recorded over 80 conversations--Cabinet \nmembers, Presidents, everybody. They did not even know it. I do not \nmind telling you, while I knew that that was legal, I was deeply \noffended by it. And I am still offended by it. This is an area, that is \nso often the case, where the States are way ahead of the Senate.\n  Recently, Attorney General Janet Reno testified before our \nAppropriations Committee, and I asked her, ``General Reno, I have a \nbill pending in the Congress that would make it a crime to tape record \nconversations where only one party knew it was being tape recorded; \nnamely, the person doing the recording, and the other person didn't \nknow it. How do you feel about that, General Reno?''\n  ``Well,'' she said, ``you know, that came up in the Florida State \nlegislature back in the early 1970s. And we passed a law in Florida \nthat made it a crime to tape record telephone conversations where only \none party knew about it.'' And I said, ``Well, let me ask you this: \nWhat were you doing at the time?'' I guess she was district attorney or \nwhatever they describe that position in Dade County, FL. And finally I \nsaid, ``Well, General Reno, how did you feel about the Florida \nlegislation?'' She said, ``I favored it.'' Well, I favor it, too.\n  And Charles Wick is not the first, and he certainly will not be the \nlast, to have ever recorded telephone conversations without telling \npeople.\n  I have introduced this legislation three times--1984, 1993 and 1998. \nI will never understand--as those of us who lose never seem to--how, on \nGod's green Earth, anybody would vote against prohibiting and outlawing \nsuch an outrageous invasion of people's privacy.\n  Sometimes I am sitting in my office and talking on the telephone to \npeople back home that are wanting me to support legislation, and \nsometimes I am sort of hanging foot loose and fancy free, saying things \nthat I would not say publicly. And do not be offended; that applies to \nevery single Member of this body. Every one of them have done it.\n  Sometimes I say things, and later on I get to thinking, ``You know \nwhat? If that guy was tape recording that''--he had a perfect right \nto--``I wouldn't have to know about it.'' And you know something else? \nApproximately fifteen States have done exactly what Florida did; they \nhave outlawed this.\n  The Congress is the last one to ever get the word. On that grand jury \namendment I offered this morning, 28 States allow a witness' attorney \nin a grand jury room. And Congress is still dithering and ringing its \nhands and saying--``Well, I don't know. We need to study it.'' And here \nwe are with one of the most egregious abuses known-- and we continue to \ntolerate it.\n\n  What if you called from Maryland to Virginia? Let's just assume the \nGovernor of Maryland calls the Governor of Virginia. Now, the Governor \nof Maryland assumes that he is protected because Maryland has a law \nagainst recording a telephone conversation when both parties are not \nprivy to it. But the Governor in Virginia can tape-record the \nconversation and he hasn't violated Maryland law because he isn't in \nMaryland, he is in Virginia, where it is legal to tape-record such \nconversations. If for no other reason, we should have a Federal law to \nmake the matter consistent.\n  Now, in 1984, when I joined with Senator Metzenbaum on a floor \namendment on this subject, I listened to the arguments over and over \nagain that this would impede law enforcement. I want to tell you, so \nthere will be no misunderstanding about this, I don't want any Senator \ncoming on this floor and asking me, ``How about law enforcement?'' I \nhave exempted intelligence gathering; CIA, DEA, everybody else is \nexempt; I have exempted the FBI, every sheriff, every police \ndepartment. I have exempted anybody who even professes to know anything \nabout law enforcement or intelligence gathering. I have exempted \ntelemarketers, whose bosses have a right to monitor their conversations \nto see how effectively they are doing on the telephone.\n  We have made this provision as palatable as we can possibly make it, \nand we have done it in a sensible way. Colleagues, you will never get a \nchance to vote for an amendment that has been thought out any better \nthan this one has. It has now been 14 years since I first gave the \nSenate an opportunity to pass such an amendment as this. As I say, it \nis very narrowly tailored.\n  All I could do, if I wanted to use up the entire 40 minutes, is to \nstand here and repeat over and over again how offended I am at the \nthought of somebody tape-recording a conversation with me and not \ntelling me about it, and the first thing you know, I see it on the \nfront page of the Washington Post.\n  This amendment has nothing to do with Linda Tripp. This is not a \npartisan, political amendment. I am telling you, I introduced a bill on \nthis subject in the Senate in 1984, and I introduced a similar bill in \n1993, and I am offering it to this body in 1998. Linda Tripp played no \npart. You make up your own mind about that case, whatever it may be. I \nam just telling you, as a general principle and as a citizen of the \nNation that values the privacy of its citizens above all, please \nsupport this amendment and let's put this one to rest once and for all.\n  I yield the floor and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the call of the \nquorum be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I want to make one other point that was \nbrought to my attention by the floor managers which I failed to mention \na moment ago. That is that my amendment also provides an exemption for \nanybody, male or female, who is threatened by a stalker. They would be \nexempt if they tape-recorded a conversation.\n  I wanted to make that clear so everybody would understand that is \nalso covered as an exemption under this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. COATS). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, we have been in a quorum call. Who is the \ntime being charged against under the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have had 2 quorum calls in place. One was \ncharged against Senator Gregg who asked it be charged against his time, \nand the other was charged against the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. So under the order, a quorum is charged against whoever \nasked for the quorum call?\n\n[[Page S8751]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That's correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I won't be asking for a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time will be charged equally.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, is the time being charged equally now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest that for the next 5 minutes the \ntime be charged to my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The next 5 minutes of time will be allocated \nto the time of the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How much time do the opponents of the amendment have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 14 minutes \n49 seconds. The Senator from Arkansas has 2 minutes 16 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will inform the Senator from New \nHampshire that the 5 minutes allotted to him have now expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that the next 5 minutes also be \nallocated to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time that \nall time be yielded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. All time \nis yielded.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we will now move on to the Feingold \namendment. For Members' notice, the next item in order will be Senator \nFeingold's amendment dealing with the cable issue. I presume he will be \nhere at any time to start that. Those Members wishing to speak on that \namendment should be on the floor as I assume there will also be a time \nlimit on this amendment. In fact, I ask unanimous consent that debate \non the Feingold amendment be limited to 40 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Is the Senator propounding a unanimous consent \nagreement with regard to my amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I just asked that there be a time limit of \n40 minutes equally divided on the amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Does that include the understanding that there will be \nno second-degree amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. At this time I can't agree with that. I am not aware of a \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I object, momentarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The consent order has already been agreed to. \nThe Senator would have to ask unanimous consent.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprevious order be vitiated pending a few moments to talk with the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3264\n\n     (Purpose: To require a report from the Federal Communications \n           Commission with respect to cable television rates)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Feingold) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3264.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 135, between lines 11 and 12, insert the following:\n       Sec. 620. (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Since the adoption by the Federal Communication \n     Commission of the so-called ``Going Forward Rules'' to relax \n     regulation of cable television rates in 1994, cable \n     television rates have increased by 6.3 percent per year. \n     Since the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \n     (Public Law 104-104), such rates have increased by \n     approximately 8.2 percent per year.\n       (2) The rate of increase in cable television rates has \n     exceeded the rate of increase in inflation by more than 3 \n     times since the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996. The increase in such rates is faster than when such \n     rates were not regulated between 1986 and 1992. Such rates \n     are rising 50 percent faster than the Commission predicted \n     when it adopted the so-called ``Going Forward Rules''.\n       (3) In 1996, many United States cities experienced \n     increases in cable television rates that exceeded 20 percent. \n     Overall, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, cable \n     television rates increased at an annual pace of 10.4 percent \n     in 1996, compared with 3.5 percent for all consumer goods.\n       (4) The Nation's largest cable television company boosted \n     its rates approximately 13.5 percent in 1996. In Denver \n     alone, it raised rates by 19 percent in the summer of 1996, \n     then another 8 percent in June 1997. The Nation's second \n     largest cable television company increased its average rates \n     12 percent in the New York City area in 1996.\n       (5) The cable television industry continues to hold the \n     dominant position in the market for multichannel video \n     programming distribution (MVPD) with 87 percent of MVPD \n     subscribers receiving service from their local franchised \n     cable television operator.\n       (6) Certain factors place alternatives to cable television \n     at a competitive disadvantage. For example, direct broadcast \n     satellite (DBS) service is widely available and constitutes \n     the most significant alternative to cable television. \n     However, barriers to both the entry and expansion of DBS \n     include--\n       (A) the lack of availability of local broadcast signals;\n       (B) up front equipment and installation costs; and\n       (C) the need to purchase additional equipment to receive \n     service on additional television sets.\n       (7) Telephone company entry into the video programming \n     distribution business has been limited.\n       (8) With the increased concentration of cable television \n     systems at the national level, the percentage of cable \n     television subscribers served by the 4 largest cable \n     television companies rose to 61.4 percent in 1996.\n       (9) Recent agreements in the cable television industry have \n     given TCI and Time Warner/Turner Broadcasting ownership of \n     cable television systems serving approximately one-half of \n     the Nation's cable television subscribers.\n       (10) Financial analysts report that cable television \n     industry revenue for 1995 was $24,898,000,000 and grew 8.9 \n     percent to $27,120,000,000 in 1996. For 1996, revenue per \n     subscriber grew 5.6 percent to reach $431.85 per subscriber. \n     Analysts estimate 1997 year-end-total revenue for the \n     industry was approximately $30,000,000,000, an increase of \n     9.9 percent from 1996 year-end revenue.\n       (b) Report.--(1) Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications Commission \n     shall submit to Congress a report setting forth the \n     assessment of the Commission whether or not the findings \n     under subsection (a) are consistent with the Commission's \n     fulfillment of its responsibilities under the Cable \n     Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 \n     (Public Law 102-385) and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \n     to promote competition in the cable television industry and \n     ensure reasonable rates for cable television services.\n       (2) If the Commission determines under paragraph (1) that \n     the findings under subsection (a) are consistent with the \n     fulfillment of the responsibilities referred to in that \n     paragraph, the report shall include a detailed justification \n     of that determination.\n       (3) If the Commission determines under paragraph (1) that \n     the findings under subsection (a) are not consistent with the \n     fulfillment of the responsibilities referred to in that \n     paragraph, the report shall include a statement of the \n     actions to be undertaken by the Commission to fulfill the \n     responsibilities.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the amendment I offer today is prompted \nby the continuous rise in cable rates across this country over the past \nfew years. You will remember when Congress passed the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996, we were promised that competition would \nbring lower cable rates for consumers. Well, it hasn't happened. In \nfact, rates have gone up--alot--in many communities around the country.\n  About two-thirds of the households in this country now rely on cable \nfor their television programming. More\n\n[[Page S8752]]\n\nand more, cable is part of the monthly budget for the average consumer. \nIt is not a frill or a luxury. We rely on cable for information and for \nentertainment. And instead of the cost going down because so many \npeople now use the service, the cost just keeps rising.\n  In my home state of Wisconsin, the cable company in the Madison area \nraised its rates by 9% in June. That's on top of a 7% increase just a \nyear ago, and an 18.8% increase in 1996. According to the Federal \nCommunications Commission, average cable rates across the country rose \n8.5% from July 1996 to July 1997, three to four times faster than the \nrate of inflation.\n  Now, Mr. President, I voted against the Telecommunications Act in \npart because I was concerned that it would not really promote \ncompetition in the cable industry. And look what has happened. The top \ntwo cable companies now have over 50% of the market in this country, \nand the top four cable companies have over 60% of the market.\n  And the biggest problem, of course, is that despite the promises of \nthose who promoted the new telecommunications law, there is no \ncompetition at all in the vast majority of cable markets. In all but a \nhandful of communities in this country, consumers still have no choice \nin buying cable service. Alternatives to cable, such as satellite \nservices, are not readily available to most consumers, or they are too \nexpensive to offer much competition. The number of areas where \nconsumers have a choice between cable operators is very small indeed. \nOnly five million homes out of the 94 million that are capable of \nreceiving cable programming can now choose between two cable operators.\n  Now here's a shocking statistic from the FCC's most recent annual \nstudy of competition in the video programming market: Cable rates have \ngone up more slowly in areas where there is competition!\n  Mr. President, in a truly competitive market, the cable companies \nwould try to keep their rates as low as possible to retain their \ncustomers. Companies could charge higher rates based on new investment \nin facilities or programming only if they could convince their \ncustomers to accept those increases rather than take their business \nelsewhere to a competitor in the same town.\n  Just think about it. You get a notice that your cable bill or a bill \nfor any other crucial service is going to go up significantly. What is \nthe first thing you would do? The first thing you would do in a \ncompetitive situation is check out the competitor's rate, of course. \nBut without competition, cable companies are able to increase rates \nwith very little fear of losing their customers. Most people will \nendure a pretty big increase before they decide to give up their cable \nservice. But even a minor increase might prompt a call to the \ncompetitor down the street, if only such a competitor actually existed.\n  The FCC has made it very clear that notwithstanding the fact that its \nauthority to regulate cable rates does not expire until March 1999, it \ndoes not intend to take any action this year to hold down cable rates. \nI am concerned that when the power expires next year we will see even \ngreater rate increases than we have seen since the Act passed in 1996. \nAnd those have already been dramatic increases.\n  Earlier this year, I wrote to the Chairman of the FCC, asking him to \ngive serious consideration to a request that had been filed by \nConsumers Union to freeze cable rates until the FCC could investigate \nthe reasons for the recent increases and also determine whether current \ncable TV rates are reasonable.\n  In response, FCC's Chairman William Kennard indicated that he \nbelieves a rate freeze would be unfair to cable companies that have \nacted responsibly, and that it would hurt small independent cable \noperators. With all due respect, I don't think this is an adequate \nresponse. The FCC has essentially said that it does not know why cable \nrates are going up. If that is the case, then it has no idea whether \ncable companies are acting responsibly or not. And it certainly is in \nno position to ensure that cable rates are reasonable for consumers. \nFurthermore, the Telecommunications Act has already deregulated the \nsmall operators who serve rural communities. So that is not \nparticularly relevant or a justification for not examining what is \nhappening with these cable companies.\n  At the same time, Mr. Kennard told me that the FCC ``continues to \naggressively enforce its cable rate regulations to ensure that cable \nrates are reasonable under the law.''\n  I'm not sure what the FCC means by aggressive enforcement, but I \ndon't see it, and certainly consumers whose rates have risen at three \ntimes the rate of inflation are not seeing the aggressive enforcement \neither.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to Chairman \nKennard and his response be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 1998.\n     Hon. William Kennard, Chairman,\n     Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennard: I was very disappointed to hear of \n     your decision, conveyed in remarks to the Washington Post \n     last Thursday, that the FCC will take no action this year to \n     hold down cable TV rates. Abdicating the FCC's responsibility \n     in this area is a serious mistake. I urge you to reconsider \n     your position.\n       Cable television rates across the country have risen by \n     more than 5 times the inflation rate over the past year. In \n     my own state of Wisconsin, the cable franchise operator in \n     Madison recently announced a rate hike of 9 percent that will \n     take effect in June. That follows a 7% increase just a year \n     ago, and an 18.8 percent increase in 1996. Increases of this \n     size are unconscionable, notwithstanding the cable companies \n     dubious argument that they are justified by investment in new \n     equipment and by increased programming costs.\n       In a truly competitive market, the cable companies would \n     try to keep their rates as low as possible to maintain their \n     customer base. New investment in improved facilities or \n     programming could be reflected in increased rates only \n     insofar as consumers are willing to accept those increases \n     rather than take their business elsewhere. Real competition \n     is still only found in only a handful of communities. In that \n     environment, the cable companies are able to increase rates \n     without fear of losing market share. Only the FCC can step in \n     and demand that rate increases be justified.\n       Your frank admission to the Washington Post that the FCC \n     does not know why cable rates are going up is disturbing. If \n     that is the case, how can the agency fulfill its statutory \n     obligation to assure that the rates for basic cable service \n     are reasonable and do not exceed the rates that would be \n     charged if there were real competition in the market? Even \n     though the FCC's authority to regulate cable rates does not \n     expire until March 31, 1999, is the Commission now just \n     taking the cable companies' word for it that rate increases \n     are justified?\n       Despite the promises of those who supported the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996, competition has not yet \n     arrived in the cable industry. Until it does, or until the \n     FCC's statutory authority expires, the FCC has an obligation \n     to protect consumers from the kind of price gouging that is \n     now going on in the cable industry. I urge you to reconsider \n     your decision to advance the date of complete deregulation in \n     the cable industry by almost a year. Instead, the Commission \n     should give serious consideration to the pending petition to \n     freeze cable rates. Anything less is an abdication of the \n     Commission's statutory responsibility and an abandonment of \n     the consumers that the agency is supposed to serve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Russell D. Feingold,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Federal Communications\n\n\n                                                   Commission,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 8, 1998.\n     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feingold: Thank you for your letter concerning \n     the recent article in The Washington Post discussing the \n     regulation of cable television rates and the sunset of the \n     Federal Communications Commission's authority to regulate the \n     rates charged for cable programming services. I appreciate \n     learning your views on cable regulation and welcome your \n     perspective on this issue.\n       The Commission is committed to protecting consumers from \n     unreasonable cable television rates and to promoting the \n     development of strong competition in the marketplace for \n     multichannel video programming. Like you, I am concerned \n     about the recent trend in cable television rates. In many \n     communities, cable rates are increasing at a rapid pace. In \n     some cases, cable rates are going up much faster than the \n     general rate of inflation.\n       Please be assured that the Commission continues to \n     aggressively enforce its cable rate regulations to ensure \n     that cable rates are reasonable under the law. Indeed, since \n     the adoption of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and \n     Competition Act of 1992, the Commission has received more \n     than 17,000 cable programming services tier rate complaints \n     and ordered a total of $84 million\n\n[[Page S8753]]\n\n     in refunds to more than 58 million cable subscribers. In \n     addition, under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which \n     modified the rate complaint procedures, the Commission has \n     resolved more than 670 rate complaints and order total \n     refunds of more than $13 million to 9.4 million subscribers.\n       While I have indicated that I believe some of the \n     Commission's cable rate regulations may need to be \n     reevaluated, I am concerned that we do not have sufficient \n     information nor adequate time to develop and adopt revised \n     regulations before the Commission's authority to regulate the \n     rates charged for cable programming services terminates on \n     March 31, 1999. I believe we need to attain a better \n     understanding of the behavior of cable rates before we \n     undertake any steps to change our rules. Moreover, at this \n     time, with the sunset of cable programming services \n     regulations less that one year away. I am not persuaded that \n     a major reformation of our rules would be the most productive \n     use of the Commission's limited resources. This should not be \n     interpreted to mean that the Commission does not intend to \n     vigorously enforce its current rate regulations.\n       At the same time, I am not convinced that a freeze of cable \n     television rates is appropriate and in the public interest. A \n     broad rate freeze would arbitrarily penalize cable television \n     system operators who have acted responsibly. A rate freeze \n     also could undermine the important capital investment that \n     the cable industry must make to modernize its networks and \n     bring new services and choices to consumers. I am also \n     concerned that a freeze may have an adverse and \n     disproportionate effect on small independent cable operators \n     which would jeopardize the provision of new services to small \n     towns and communities across the country.\n       As pointed out in the Washington Post article, the \n     Commission can play an important role in collecting and \n     analyzing the information you and other policymakers will \n     need to determine whether cable rate regulation should be \n     extended beyond March 31, 1999. To begin this effort, I \n     recently directed the Cable Services Bureau to undertake a \n     review of a number of issues related to cable television rate \n     increases, including the sources of programming cost \n     increases. We are interested in learning more about \n     programming costs and the revenues cable operators generate \n     from sources other than monthly subscription charges, such as \n     advertising, commission, and program launch fees. The review \n     also will help us determine if the relationships that have \n     developed between cable system operators and programmers \n     affect the prices charged for programming as well as the \n     availability of the program services to competitive \n     multichannel video programming distributors. As part of this \n     review, the Bureau recently asked several large cable \n     television companies to complete a questionnaire to \n     supplement the information they provided to the Commission \n     for the 1997 Cable Price Survey. I expect the Bureau to \n     complete its work this summer and to report its findings to \n     the Commission soon thereafter.\n       Because competition is the optimum way to discipline cable \n     television rates, the Commission also continues its work to \n     promote increased competition in the marketplace for \n     multichannel video programming. For example, the Commission's \n     program access rules have been credited as an important \n     factor in the development of both the direct broadcast \n     satellite and the multichannel multipoint distribution \n     industries. Moreover, the Commission has adopted a Notice of \n     Proposed Rulemaking that is designed to strengthen our \n     program access rules and enhance the competitive position of \n     alternative multichannel video providers.\n       Similarly, the rules the Commission adopted to implement \n     section 207 (Restrictions on Over-the-Air Reception Devices) \n     of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 have helped to bring \n     new choices to consumers and promote competition in the video \n     distribution market. In addition, the Commission recently \n     issued its cable inside wiring rules designed to facilitate \n     competition among video service providers in apartment \n     buildings and other multiple dwelling units.\n       As important as the Commission's initiatives may be, in \n     some cases, enhanced competitive opportunities in the \n     multichannel video programming distribution market may \n     ultimately depend more upon changes in the law than on \n     additional actions by this Commission. For example, some \n     direct broadcast satellite providers contend that their \n     service had limited consumer appeal because they are \n     generally prohibited by the Satellite Home Viewer Act from \n     providing local television broadcast signals to consumers. \n     These same provider also may be placed at a competitive \n     disadvantage because the current compulsory license regime \n     requires direct broadcast satellite providers to pay \n     substantially higher copyright fees than cable operators pay \n     for the same programming. As Congress considers potential \n     reforms in these and related areas, parity among the various \n     multichannel video programming distributors should be a \n     primary goal.\n       I appreciate hearing from you on these important issues and \n     hope you will continue to share your thoughts with me on \n     these and other communications matters of concern.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William E. Kennard,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered is designed \nto tell the FCC that this situation is unacceptable. It makes findings \nto which I have alluded here--that cable rates are rising and there is \nno competition in the cable market--and asks the FCC to report back to \nus within 30 days as to whether it believes that these findings are \nconsistent with the FCC having fulfilled its responsibilities under \nfederal law to promote competition and ensure that cable rates are \nreasonable.\n  I do not believe that the FCC will be able to tell us in the face of \nthese findings that it has fulfilled its responsibilities. The \namendment therefore requires that the FCC inform us of the steps it \nintends to take to ensure that those responsibilities are fulfilled.\n  The Telecommunications Act was enacted in early 1996. For over two \nyears, the American people have watched with alarm as cable rates have \ngone in exactly the wrong direction. It is time for the Congress to \ntell the FCC that is not what was supposed to happen, and that the \nCommission has to do something to change it. I urge my colleagues to \nvote for this amendment. It, of course, will not singlehandedly solve \nthe problem, but it should move the Commission, and I hope cable rates, \nin the right direction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two newspaper articles \nconcerning rising cable rates and the FCC's decision not to take \naction, one from USA Today, and one from the Washington Post, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the USA TODAY, Mar. 16, 1998]\n\n        Cable's Cash Cow Operators Pad Channel List To Pad Bills\n\n                          (By David Lieberman)\n\n       NEW YORK--For the third year in a row, the nation's 65 \n     million cable subscribers are getting hit with an average 8% \n     hike in their monthly bills.\n       That's an increase of four times the inflation rate for \n     what has become a staple of the American media diet--channels \n     such as CNN, MTV, Nickelodeon and ESPN.\n       The typical family now pays more than $31 a month for \n     standard cable fare, up from $28.83 last year. And some \n     households pay nearly twice that amount once the cost of \n     premium channels, such as Showtime and HBO, and services like \n     pay-per-view are added.\n       Cable operators justify the rate hikes, citing higher \n     programming costs, among other things. But what most \n     consumers don't know--and what the cable industry usually \n     doesn't tell you in their bill stuffers--is that the lion's \n     share of the extra money they're charging you for expanded \n     basic cable pays for new services that few consumers want.\n       Operators, eager to improve cash flow, are using lax \n     federal rules to raise rates by adding channels that few \n     customers want and that some times cost companies nothing. \n     They're charging consumers for expensive equipment that most \n     can't use yet. And they're making customers subsidize \n     construction of interactive phone and video services that \n     won't be available to most for years. Once they are, some \n     services--such as high-speed Internet--will be so costly that \n     they'll appeal only to affluent videophiles and technophiles.\n       Cable operators still think their current rates are a good \n     deal and that future services will make cable even more \n     appealing. ``The rate increase that we put in has, by and \n     large, been accepted because it's usually been in the context \n     of a system that is upgrading and providing more services,'' \n     Time Warner CEO Gerald Levin says.\n       But consumers--unwilling to give up what has become for \n     them must-have TV and weary of the government's failure to \n     rein in cable rates--are quietly seething.\n       ``It's never going to change,'' says cable subscriber Dory \n     DeAngelo, 59, a local historian in Kansas City, Mo. ``I \n     looked into a satellite dish, but I'd still need cable to get \n     the local channels . . . A lot of people are very tired of \n     this.''\n\n\n                         a good deal for cable\n\n       When city officials were asked last fall which problems are \n     getting worse in their communities, 72% mentioned cable \n     rates, up from 62% in the 1996 and 47% in 1995. It was the \n     most frequently mentioned growing problem in the annual \n     survey conducted by the National League of Cities.\n       Members of Congress and the Federal Communications \n     Commission (FCC) have soured on rate regulation. Economists \n     say current federal rules let companies charge as much as \n     they want. Consumers Union telecommunications expert Gene \n     Kimmelman calls the regulations ``worthless.''\n       During the past two years, medium and large systems with no \n     local competitors have added about six channels, to an \n     average of 51, the FCC says. That wasn't necessarily because \n     most subscribers wanted them. It was because federal rate \n     rules gave cable companies a great deal. They could charge \n     consumers the full cost of carrying up to six new channels--\n     plus tack on a profit of 20 cents per subscriber per month \n     for each channel. Forever.\n\n[[Page S8754]]\n\n       The FCC found the average cost per channel rose from 57 \n     cents to 60 cents from 1995 to 1997 at the noncompetitive \n     medium and large systems.\n       ``Loading channels on is a nice thing from their \n     perspective,'' says Larry Irving, President Clinton's chief \n     telecommunications adviser. ``But do I get what I'm asking \n     for? With cable, I get to write a check whether or not I want \n     them.''\n       Even without the 20-cent profit, cable companies have \n     incentives to add channels and raise rates:\n       Several channels--including Fox News, Animal Planet and \n     Home & Garden TV--paid cable companies to get on the dial.\n       Others--including MSNBC, TV Food Network and BET on Jazz--\n     give local systems three minutes of ad time to sell each \n     hour, instead of the usual two minutes.\n\n\n                            profiting twice\n\n       The arrangement is especially sweet for most large opeators \n     because they also own, or invest in, cable programming.\n       For example, Time Warner owns CNN, TNT and Cartoon Network. \n     Tele-Communications Inc. has stakes in Discovery, Fox Sports \n     and Odyssey. MediaOne, Comcast, Cox and Cablevision Systems \n     also have major investments in cable channels.\n       ``It creates an odd paradigm,'' says Bruce Leichtman of The \n     Yankee Group, a research and consulting firm. ``It's kind of \n     a shifting from one pocket to the next.''\n       Operators say they're giving the public what it wants by \n     adding services such as Animal Planet, MSNBC, FX, ESPN2 and \n     ESPNews.\n       ``Every one of those channels gets a good rating,'' Comcast \n     President Brian Roberts says.\n       But FCC Commissioner Gloria Tristani, for one, is concerned \n     that cable operators will continue to add unwanted \n     programming just to rake in more money from subscribers.\n       ``This may not have been a significant problem in a 30- or \n     40-channel universe,'' she said recently. ``But in a 70-, 80- \n     or 100-channel universe, these unwanted channels can have a \n     dramatic effect.''\n\n\n                              future shock\n\n       Operators are getting more flexibility to add channels as \n     they upgrade equipment. Yet state-of-the-art digital cable \n     boxes--which most companies may eventually offer--also could \n     deliver huge profits. Systems plan to sell a new tier of \n     channels, including lots of premium services and pay-per-\n     view, that consumers who have those boxes could order.\n       But in a coup for the cable industry, the law allows \n     operators to pass the costs of those units on to all \n     subscribers--not just the people who have them installed in \n     their homes. A system with 10 million subscribers that bought \n     100,000 boxes for $400 apiece could raise everyone's rates by \n     33 cents a month, according to an example prepared by Paine \n     Webber.\n       Fees add up quickly. The typical subscriber pays about 67 \n     cents a month in 1998 to compensate operators who buy \n     upgraded boxes. That will rise to $1.47 in 1999, $2.59 in \n     2000 and $3.04 in 2001, Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette \n     estimates.\n       The arrangement benefits the few customers who get the \n     latest equipment but does nothing for others--including the \n     nearly 50% of today's subscribers who don't use any decoder \n     box at all.\n       Cable operators, however, are thrilled. An estimated 37 \n     million subscribers will pay $7.2 billion for digital \n     programming in 2005.\n       What's more, the digital services could slow the growth of \n     satellite services such as DirecTv and Echostar. Their \n     ability to offer up to 175 channels has been a big selling \n     point with the 6.6 million satellite subscribers.\n       If you build it . . .\n       The average cable customer is paying other fees, too. An \n     estimated $1.75 per month goes to help operators upgrade \n     their systems and offer a host of other interactive \n     services--including high-speed Internet access and telephone \n     services.\n       The major operators, Morgan Stanley forecasts, will spend \n     about $46.7 billion between 1996 and 2004 to replace old \n     wires with high-capacity fiber-optic cables and buy \n     sophisticated technologies capable of handling two-way \n     digital communications.\n       ``I raise the rates so that we can fulfill the promise of \n     this network to be digitally capable by the year 2000,'' Time \n     Warner's President Richard Parsons says. ``Most of the money \n     we get goes right back into the system in terms of \n     upgrades.''\n       Operators say consumers will benefit from cable's \n     investment in local telephone service. That will introduce \n     competition, possibly lowering prices. Some systems, for \n     example, plan package deals for customers who buy cable and \n     phone service. ``Doesn't everybody have a telephone?'' says \n     Cablevision Systems CEO James Dolan, whose company is far \n     ahead of most operators in preparing for telephony. ``We're \n     going to offer those discounts to everybody.''\n       Yet critics say it's unfair to ask all subscribers to help \n     pay for upgrades largely designed to help operators enter new \n     businesses--not to improve existing cable service. And lots \n     of today's subscribers won't want the new products. For \n     example, only about 5% of all adults say they are willing to \n     buy high-speed Internet service at the expected price of \n     about $40 a month, according to a survey by The Yankee Group.\n       And it will take years before most subscribers get a cable-\n     provided dial tone. Only about 3.4 million will subscribe to \n     a cable system's telephone service by 2002, Montgomery \n     Securities estimates.\n       That projection might be optimistic at a time when \n     technology and the economy are changing so fast. AT \n     recently observed that wireless services may become potent \n     competitors to local phone providers. ``Companies say, `We're \n     building for the future,' '' Harvard Business School \n     Associate Professor William Emmons says. ``Well, that's a \n     little dicey. What if they're building huge systems that will \n     be obsolete? Or what if nobody wants them?''\n\n\n                              cable's edge\n\n       For now, cable companies assume that lots of people--\n     particularly those who are well-to-do--will want the new \n     array of services. Although all subscribers, rich and poor \n     alike, are paying for the upgrades, the most advanced systems \n     tend to be in affluent communities, including Orange County \n     and Fremont, Calif.; Long Island, N.Y.; Arlington Heights, \n     Ill.; and West Hartford, Conn.\n       The cable industry also believes that it has a big lead \n     over other businesses--including phone companies--in \n     delivering advanced video and communications services.\n       ``The surprise to most has been how slow the competition is \n     developing,'' former Continental Cablevision CEO Amos \n     Hostetter says. ``All that talk about (phone companies) \n     getting into the video business has been hollow.''\n       That's one reason most Wall Street analysts say basic cable \n     rates will rise--albeit at a more moderate pace--even after \n     operators are through making big expenditures for their \n     upgrades. They anticipate that operating cash flow for most \n     companies will grow an average of nearly 13% a year over the \n     next five years, vs. about 7% growth now.\n       The assumption contributed to the 87% appreciation in cable \n     stocks in 1997, a year when the Standard & Poor's 500 grew \n     31%. ``The market decided that government policies were a \n     failure, and competition presents no risk to cable now and in \n     the foreseeable future,'' Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Tom \n     Wolzien says.\n       That's good for cable, but it isn't the way things were \n     supposed to turn out when the federal government in 1992 \n     tried to crack down on soaring cable prices and then pulled \n     back in an attempt to encourage competition.\n       ``There are going to be people paying for things they don't \n     want,'' says Michael Katz, a professor of economics at the \n     University of California at Berkeley and a key architect of \n     the cable rules as the FCC's chief economist in 1994 and \n     1995. ``It's one of the unintended consequences of \n     regulation.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 15, 1998]\n\nFCC Chief Declines To Curb Cable Prices; Kennard To Await Deregulation \n                                in March\n\n                            (By Paul Farhi)\n\n       Consumers looking for relief from rising cable TV bills \n     won't be getting it any time soon from federal regulators.\n       Though he declared earlier this year that ``cable rates are \n     rising too fast,'' the head of the Federal Communications \n     Commission said yesterday that his agency won't step in to \n     freeze or roll back cable prices before a congressionally \n     ordered deregulation of cable prices kicks in next March.\n       FCC Chairman William E. Kennard says his agency will \n     continue to study the problem, with an eye toward influencing \n     debate in Congress. Cable prices have been rising at more \n     than five times the rate of inflation.\n       ``We're running out of time'' to enact new regulations, \n     Kennard said. Besides, he added, ``it doesn't make a whole \n     lot of sense for us to try and create a whole new regulatory \n     regime only to have [deregulation] in March of 1999.''\n       In December and January, Kennard had raised the possibility \n     of putting new controls on the rates.\n       Kennard's statements yesterday, made in an interview with \n     The Washington Post, amount to a major victory for the cable \n     industry, which has been fighting efforts at tougher \n     regulation for months. It is also a political victory for \n     Republicans in Congress, who have pressed the FCC to avoid \n     more regulation.\n       ``This is good to hear,'' said Torie Clarke, spokeswoman \n     for the National Cable Television Association in Washington. \n     ``It means the FCC is paying attention to what the industry \n     is doing, and that it won't get into micromanagement and \n     regulation that will stall everything.''\n       Added Clarke, ``We're spending a lot of time and effort \n     trying hard to deliver on our promise to customers. We're \n     fulfilling a lot of those promises, and we think the \n     government should stay out of our business.''\n       But consumer advocates were seething. ``The FCC has reached \n     a new low,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of Consumers \n     Union's Washington office. ``The agency . . . won't lift a \n     finger to stop spiraling cable rates. This is irresponsible. \n     They're thumbing their noses at the American public.''\n       Consumers Union and the Consumer Federation of America \n     asked the FCC in September to freeze rates, but the \n     commission has not yet acted on that petition.\n       Cable TV prices rose an average of 7.9 percent in the 12-\n     month period that ended March 31, according to the Bureau of \n     Labor Statistics. That is more than five times the general \n     inflation rate of 1.4 percent during the same period.\n       In the early 1990s, with price hikes running at only three \n     times inflation, a Congress controlled by Democrats enacted a \n     law designed to bring cable prices back to a ``reasonable'' \n     level.\n\n[[Page S8755]]\n\n       The FCC subsequently wrote regulations that succeeded in \n     restraining--and in some cases reducing--the average monthly \n     bill. But the FCC liberalized its rules in 1995, after the \n     cable industry complained that the price controls were \n     smothering innovation. There followed another price spiral. \n     In 1996, the Republican-dominated Congress agreed to phase \n     out most of the price rules by early 1999.\n       Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin (R-La.), who chairs the House \n     Subcommittee on Telecommunications, accused the FCC of \n     ``ignoring'' vigorous enforcement of its price rules. But \n     Tauzin and other Republicans have repeatedly inveighed \n     against tougher regulations, such as a rate freeze or an \n     extension of the current rate rules, saying incentives to \n     help other companies be more competitive with cable are \n     preferable.\n       Only a handful of the nation's 11,000 cable systems have a \n     direct competitor, despite years of efforts to ignite \n     competition by phone, cable, satellite and other TV \n     providers. Earlier this week, Joel I. Klein, the Justice \n     Department's top antitrust enforcer, said the cable industry \n     held ``a significant, durable monopoly'' over subscription TV \n     services.\n       Kennard said he isn't exactly sure why rates are rising so \n     fast and has directed his agency to gather information from \n     the cable industry about the potential causes. Without \n     drawing conclusions, he said the problem probably has several \n     facets, including the rising cost of producing programs. He \n     added that the regulations themselves may be to blame because \n     they gave the industry too much latitude to raise prices.\n       ``We don't have a firm comprehensive analytic study as to \n     why rates are going up,'' said Kennard. ``We hope to have a \n     definitive answer'' in time to effect debate in Congress next \n     year about possibly extending the current rules.\n       Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) has proposed an extension of \n     the regulations past March, and Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) \n     has proposed an immediate freeze.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I certainly appreciate the concern \nexpressed by consumers about rising cable rates, and share the desire \nof the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] to better \nunderstanding the reasons for this trend. While further attention to \nthis matter is warranted, I am not persuaded that the amendment before \nus will substantially further that worthy goal.\n  The amendment is intended to compel the FCC to tell us how it plans \nto address cable rates. But the FCC is already required to report on \ncompetition in the cable industry at the end of this year. The 1992 \nCable Act requires the FCC to conduct an annual study on the status of \ncompetition in the cable industry, and our focus should be on ensuring \nthat that study sheds new light on this issue.\n  The FCC has done little about cable rates, and the agency's track \nrecord raises doubt that yet another study by that agency, the very one \nthat the Senator from Wisconsin faults for inaction, will add to public \nunderstanding of this matter. In addition, the amendment requires a \nreport within 30 days, which is woefully inadequate to achieve any real \ninformation about an issue of this scope.\n  There are initiatives under way which should add to the policy \ndebate. The senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] and I have asked the \nindependent General Accounting Office to conduct a study of the causes \nof increasing cable rates. It is my expectation that this review will \nprovide new evidence about steps we need to take to help control cable \nrate increases.\n  In addition, as the distinguished Ranking Member of both the Commerce \nCommittee and the Subcommittee on Commerce-Justice-State [Mr. Hollings] \nhas said, the Senate Commerce Committee is holding a hearing on cable \nrates next week. As noted by the Senator from South Carolina, the \nSenate need not prejudge that hearing and the findings of the committee \nof jurisdiction with a premature amendment.\n  Indeed, the Commerce Committee is fully capable of ensuring that the \nexisting statutory requirement to study this issue is fulfilled in a \nmanner that answers the concerns raised by the Senator from Wisconsin \nand other members of the Senate. I encourage my colleagues on that \ncommittee to vigorously exercise their oversight responsibility in this \narea.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, while well-intentioned, is not the \nanswer to our constituents' frustration about their cable rates. \nHopefully, the FCC study currently underway and required by year's end, \nand the GAO review, will shed new light on this issue.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that \nall debate on the Feingold amendment be completed at 8 o'clock, the \ntime between now and 8 o'clock be divided between Senator Feingold and \nMembers or a Member in opposition, and that no second-degree amendments \nto the Feingold amendment be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on this particular amendment, I talked \npreviously with the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin. I thought it \nwas in conformance with the actions of the committee with respect to \nthe cable rates. When we passed the 1996 Telecommunications Act, we \nmandated that cable rates would not increase, under that particular \nact, until March of 1999. Thereafter, of course, rates did increase in \naccordance with the 1992 act.\n  The 1992 act allowed increases with respect to additional channels \nand additional services and costs incurred in expanding and in \ncompeting. That, generally speaking, is as I understood it with the \ncable companies. Because we have had complaints I, myself, looked at it \nearlier this year. The FCC has been monitoring it. We discussed this \nwith Chairman Kennard and the other Commissioners as they came on in \ntheir confirmation hearings. They have been monitoring it.\n  As I understand, the distinguished chairman of our Commerce \nCommittee, Senator McCain of Arizona, is headed to the floor. Because I \nhave been engaged in other matters, I didn't even realize we had a \nhearing scheduled for Tuesday of next week on this same thing, to hear \nfrom the Commissioners on what has occurred. So I would not favor this \nparticular resolution. It is not just a matter of 30 days, it sort of \npreempts the committee in its action with respect to listening to the \nCommission and finding out.\n  I know, good and well, we are all familiar with the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act provision against increase in rates through \nMarch of 1999. Of course, then we relate back in all of these \npercentages. It sounds, in the resolution of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wisconsin itself, that all you need to do is look at the \npercentages and they are in excess of the inflation rate and everything \nelse. The inflation rate is not the question. It is the question of the \nservices, the channels, and the programming itself, and the costs of \nexpanding and competing.\n  I think perhaps this would have a disruptive effect on that \nparticular trend at this time. The committee has yet to have heard from \nthe Commission itself and from those engaged in this particular \nbusiness.\n  So I just comment that the chairman of the committee and the chairman \nof the subcommittee, Senator Burns of Montana, are on their way, as I \nunderstand it, to the floor. I didn't want to just waste this time and \nlet it go past on the premise: Wait a minute, in 30 days----\n  Incidentally, the Federal Communications Commission is just like a \ntenth-round boxer. They have more mergers, more rulings, and everything \nelse like that, trying to implement all the petitions that they have \nbefore them. You could not find fault if they could not find out in 30 \ndays, 60 days, or 90 days.\n  So I do not think this is well taken, with respect to what the \nCongress has asked the FCC to do. They have had one backup of time, \ntrying to make findings here, after their particular investigations. \nMind you me, if there are 60,000 lawyers registered to practice in the \nDistrict of Columbia, 59,000 are communications lawyers. They have more \nappeals and petitions and reviews and everything else of that kind. So \nthe work at the FCC is not necessarily the most prompt, or what we \nwould wish to have, but it has to be understood. The committee itself \nis working.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n\n[[Page S8756]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the ranking \nmember, the Senator from South Carolina, about the amendment. I simply \nwant to point out that, in fact, this 30-day period is not 30 days from \ntoday that the FCC would have to complete this report, it is 30 days \nfrom the time of enactment of this bill, if the amendment were \nsuccessful, and that is obviously some weeks, if not months, down the \nroad, to the point where the President would actually sign it.\n  All we are asking here is that a report be issued, not that actions \nbe taken to change the cable rates during this period, but that the \nCommission actually give us a sense of whether they agree with the \nfindings we have in this report or not and what they intend to do about \nthe problem. I don't think that is an unreasonable request for a 30-day \nperiod, or even realistically what it is more likely to be, which is a \n60-day to 90-day period.\n  Just to illustrate why we are concerned, why we think it \nis appropriate that Congress agree to this amendment and make this \nstatement, it is because, in fact, the studies the FCC is doing now I \ndon't think are getting done in a timely manner to answer the questions \nthat have to be answered.\n\n  For example, Chairman Kennard recognized that there was a problem \nwith regard to its annual assessment of competition in the video-\nprogramming market when he said in his statement:\n\n       Less than 15 months away from the sunset of most cable rate \n     regulation, it is clear that broad-based, widespread \n     competition to the cable industry has not developed and is \n     not imminent.\n\n  He also noted that perhaps the Commission ought to do something to \naddress the problem. He said:\n\n       When confronted with allegations of price gouging, cable \n     operators reflexively point to additional programming costs. \n     The Commission's own rules and policies may be a source of \n     this problem. We need to examine whether there are targeted \n     adjustments that should be made to our rate rules. For \n     example, our rules allow programming cost increases to be \n     passed on to subscribers. But is this right?\n\n  The Chairman went on to say that the FCC was going to look at the \nproblem of programming costs, and that is the study that has been \nreferred to. He said about this:\n\n       I am therefore directing the Cable Services Bureau to \n     commence a focused inquiry into programming costs to \n     determine the sources of these increases, the variance in \n     costs among various distributors, whether existing \n     relationships impact the prices charged, and if programmers \n     restrict consumer choice. This inquiry will require the \n     cooperation and forthrightness of the industry.\n\n  I don't know if the FCC got the cooperation of the industry. What I \ndo know, and what is in response to the comments of the Senator from \nSouth Carolina, is that it is now July and there is still no report or \nresult from that inquiry.\n  I also know, as I have indicated before, that rates have continued to \ngo up, with many increases taking effect at midyear. I also know that \nin May the Chairman told the world that the FCC was not going to take \nany further action to address rising cable rates.\n  So, this amendment is not duplicative of what is going on at the FCC. \nIt has a deadline and a requirement the FCC outline a specific action \nplan to address the problem of the lack of competition in the cable \nindustry.\n  Based upon the track record that I have just described with respect \nto the narrower issue that there was supposed to be a study on, it is \nnot getting done. I think we need to follow up on previous \ncongressional directives and have the entire Senate and the other body \ndirect that a more specific study and plan of action result within the \ntimeframe that this amendment calls for.\n  Mr. President, I think this is a reasonable amendment. It is not too \nmuch to ask this agency to take a look at the dramatic increases, \nwhether they are reasonable and what they intend to do about it.\n  I urge my colleagues to back the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will simply note for my colleagues that \nwe are making pretty good progress through these amendments that have \nbeen lined up. We lined up seven amendments to do before 9:30. We are \nmaking excellent progress. If there are Members who have other \namendments, it is possible we can work them in. If they can come down \nto the floor and discuss them, that will be helpful. We are going to \nstay on the bill until it gets done, if I have my option. The sooner we \ncan wrap up these amendments, the better.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I withdraw that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, with respect to the amendments pending, \nI know the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, the Senator from Oregon, \nSenator Wyden--I think that one can be worked out or I think it perhaps \nmay have already been worked out--Senator Leahy from Vermont, Senator \nDorgan from North Dakota, and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts have \namendments, if they are within the view and sound of the action on the \nfloor, please be alerted. We want to bring up those amendments. I am \nasking the staff to contact them.\n  Mr. President, with respect to this particular study, there is an \naction required here, as I read it. In other words, it is not just a \nstudy, but a report. The purpose is to require a report from the \nFederal Communications Commission, but the report really is a \nresolution requiring action, because the very last paragraph, Mr. \nPresident, reads as follows:\n\n       (3) If the Commission determines under paragraph (1) that \n     the findings under subsection (a) are not consistent with the \n     fulfillment of the responsibilities referred to in that \n     paragraph, the report shall include a statement of the \n     actions to be undertaken by the Commission to fulfill the \n     responsibilities.\n\n  I think that is just a little too mandatory; an unfunded mandate, I \nthink we call that here in the U.S. Senate. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I always enjoy debating with the Senator \nfrom South Carolina. I have to differ, though, with the \ncharacterization of the words that are in this amendment. It says:\n\n       . . . the report shall include a statement of the actions \n     to be undertaken by the Commission to fulfill the \n     responsibilities.\n\n  If the Commission determines it doesn't need to take any action, this \ndoesn't require them to do anything. There is no mandate at all. We \njust want to know what they are planning to do. That is all this calls \nfor, a statement of the actions to be undertaken by the Commission.\n  There is simply nothing mandatory about that language at all. We are \njust asking for a statement of the ideas they have about what to do \nabout the increases in cable rates, if anything.\n  I differ with the Senator from South Carolina that there is no \nlanguage in here that asks for anything other than a report as to what \nthe Commission may plan to do in the future about the problem of cable \nrates.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to amend the \nprevious consent agreement dealing with disposition of this bill after \nfinal passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that S. 2260, as passed, be held at the desk \nand not engrossed, and that after Senate passage of H.R. 4276, the \nHouse companion measure, that the vote on S. 2260 be vitiated and S. \n2260 be indefinitely postponed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be\n\n[[Page S8757]]\n\nyielded back on the Feingold amendment and all debate on that amendment \nbe concluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, for the information of our Membership, we \nare waiting for two Members who have amendments on the list to go \nbefore 9:30: One dealing with gaming, Senator Kyl; and one dealing with \ndefenders, Senator Nickles. As soon as they arrive we will begin those \namendments and begin debate on those amendments.\n  As I mentioned earlier, if there is a Member who wishes to bring \nforward an amendment at this time, it appears we have some time to do \nthat. We will welcome their attendance on the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3265\n\n   (Purpose: To amend section 505 of the Incentive Grants for Local \nDelinquency Prevention Programs Act relating to the illegal possession \n                       of firearms by juveniles)\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I offer a bipartisan amendment that has \nbeen authored by Senator Smith of my State and myself and a number of \nother Senators.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Is the Senator willing to enter into a time agreement on this \namendment?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I certainly am. The chairman of the subcommittee has been \nvery gracious. I do not anticipate going more than 15 minutes myself, \nand I think Senator Smith will be coming shortly. I know he would \nprobably want 15 minutes or less, as well.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask that all debate on this amendment be completed by \n8:25.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I now send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. WYDEN], for himself and Mr. \n     Smith of Oregon, proposes an amendment numbered 3265.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 51, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       Sec. 121. Section 505 of the Incentive Grants for Local \n     Delinquency Prevention Programs Act (42 U.S.C. 5784) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) in paragraph (6), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) in paragraph (7), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(8) court supervised initiatives that address the illegal \n     possession of firearms by juveniles.''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by striking \n     ``demonstrate ability in'';\n       (B) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``have in effect'' after \n     ``(1)'';\n       (C) in paragraph (2)--\n       (i) by inserting ``have developed'' after ``(2)''; and\n       (ii) by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (D) in paragraph (3)--\n       (i) by inserting ``are actively'' after ``(3)''; and\n       (ii) by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; \n     and''; and\n       (E) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) have in effect a policy or practice that requires \n     State and local law enforcement agencies to detain for not \n     less than 24 hours any juvenile who unlawfully possesses a \n     firearm in a school, upon a finding by a judicial officer \n     that the juvenile may be a danger to himself or herself, or \n     to the community.''.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and colleagues, Senator Smith and I, having \nvisited with our constituents at home and in Springfield, OR, after the \nterrible tragedy at Thurston High School, believe it is absolutely \ncritical that concrete steps be taken between now and the beginning of \nthe school year to increase the safety for our young people in schools \nacross the land.\n  We believe this legislation, which has now been agreed to by both the \nmajority and the minority, can be the first concrete step that will be \ntaken to ensure that this fall our young people and their families can \nhave an added measure of safety when they attend our Nation's schools. \nWe believe that when a young person brings a gun to school, that ought \nto set off a five-alarm warning that there are problems for our \nsociety.\n  Our colleagues on several occasions have mentioned today that in a \nnumber of States it has been documented that in several hundred \ninstances a year young people bring a gun to school, disciplinary \naction is taken, but then it is essentially at the discretion of law \nenforcement officials and others as to what additional steps will be \ntaken.\n  Law enforcement officials across our State and across the country \nhave made it very clear that they don't believe it is appropriate to \nput that discretion in their hands. They would like to make sure that \ngovernment sets out a policy that would stipulate that when a young \nperson brings a gun to school, that that young person will be detained \nfor an adequate period of time to have a mental health assessment, to \nhave law enforcement officials involved, to have health policymakers \nparticipate in what action should then be taken to best promote safety \nin our society. If my home State of Oregon had this policy in effect at \nthe time of the tragedy at Thurston High School, Kip Kinkel, who is \nalleged to have perpetrated these crimes, would have been before a \njudge and held, and, in my view, unquestionably, would have been \ndetained rather than sent home, where he allegedly killed his parents \nand then came back, literally, within a relatively short time, and shot \nand injured more than 20 young people at Thurston High School in \nSpringfield.\n  What our legislation does is ensure that States that have put in \nplace a policy of detaining a student caught with bringing a gun--that \nStates with that policy would be accorded a priority for title V \nfunding, the prevention and delinquency funding program, under this \nlegislation. That way, we would ensure that, on an ongoing basis, every \nState in our country would have an incentive to ensure that when young \npeople bring guns to school, as was done in the case of the Springfield \ntragedy, rather than simply leave to fate what happens next, there \nwould be a finding of what was the most appropriate step to take to \nensure the safety of the community.\n  Mr. President, I think we all agree that our schools ought to be \nplaces of learning, not of tragedy and violence. One lesson that has \nbeen learned from the tragic shootings in Oregon and Arkansas and other \nStates is that clearly there is something wrong today with the policies \nfor dealing with young people and guns. The policies today aren't \nworking. Young people are falling through the cracks, and some of them \nare shooting other children. Bringing a gun to school ought to be a \nwarning signal, an early sign, that there is a serious potential threat \nfor our society. When that act takes place, it is important to get the \nstudent out of the classroom, off the streets, and in front of a \nprofessional who can make a determination of how much of a threat that \nstudent is to the community.\n  I think most legislators would agree we don't have all the answers, \nbut we do know that keeping an angry student with a gun out of the \nclassroom and off the schoolyard ought to be part of the solution. That \nis why the amendment that I sponsor today, with Senator Gordon Smith of \nmy home State, focuses on two tracks. First, Senator Smith and I seek \nto remove the threat of violence from our schools as soon as it is \nidentified. Second, we help our communities find the resources they \nneed to identify and serve at-risk students so it is possible to \nprevent a potential health and safety problem from becoming the sort of \ntragedy that was seen at Thurston High School.\n  This amendment provides concrete incentives to States to immediately \nremove any student who brings a gun to school and to get that student \nbefore a judge and other qualified professionals. If the judge \ndetermines that student is a threat to the community or to the \nindividual themselves, the State must hold that student for a period of \ntime that would allow for an appropriate placement that protects our \nsociety.\n  If a State has in place this sort of policy to protect the community, \nfamilies, and students, our legislation will give that State priority \nwhen it comes to funding juvenile justice grants. That\n\n[[Page S8758]]\n\nmeans they will be in a position to devote more resources to make sure \nthat at-risk students don't follow that path of crime and delinquency, \nand it will be possible with these grants to target high-risk young \npeople for aggressive and early intervention so these young people can \nbe reached with appropriate treatment before they fall through the \ncracks.\n  What has been learned in Springfield and the other communities across \nthis country is that expelling a student for bringing a gun to school \nmay adequately punish the student's behavior, but it is not enough to \nprotect the community and our society.\n  It is important to ensure that the appropriate steps are taken at \nthat time--at that time when the student is apprehended by school \nofficials, so that that student has every opportunity to work through \npotential problems they may be having at home, or with their peers, and \nour society can find a balance between preventing these crimes from \noccurring and punishing them when they actually take place.\n  There isn't a Member of this U.S. Senate who is not deeply concerned \nabout this set of incidents across our country--literally across our \nNation--where young people have been taken from us by school violence. \nIn Springfield, OR, where Senator Smith and I visited with the \nPresident--who deserves great credit, in my view, for supporting our \nbipartisan legislation--the community promised Senator Smith and I that \nthey wanted to let the violence end here.\n  It is our hope that this legislation will give States the incentive \nthey need to enact tough detention statutes to ensure that what \nhappened in Thurston doesn't happen across this country. My friend and \ncolleague, Senator Smith, is here and I want to yield the floor in just \na moment. I want to thank him for the bipartisan effort that has been \nmade on this legislation and on so many other issues that have been \nimportant to the people of Oregon. The people of Oregon and the people \nof our country do not see these as bipartisan issues. There is not a \nDemocratic approach to preventing school violence and a Republican \napproach to preventing school violence. I tell our colleagues that the \napproach Senator Smith and I bring before the U.S. Senate tonight has \nbeen supported by those who oppose gun control and those who are for \ngun control because they see this as commonsense Government that will \nbe good for our students and our families.\n  I will close by saying that when the Senate acts tonight, this can be \nthe first concrete step that actually protects students and families \nwhen school starts this fall. So we are very grateful to our colleagues \nfor helping us, including our friends Senator Hollings, Senator Gregg, \nand Senator Leahy, who is not on the floor, and Senator Hatch has been \nso helpful. Senator Sessions has added an innovative approach with \nrespect to establishing a court supervisory initiative to addressing \nunlawful juvenile gun use. This is a bipartisan step forward in making \nour schools safe across this land.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Oregon, Mr. \nSmith, is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I want to publicly thank my \ncolleague, Senator Wyden, for his leadership on this issue. He and I \nrecently faced a tragedy in our State that, frankly, left us speechless \nand groping for a way to respond to an unspeakable tragedy--that of a \nyoung person, troubled, from a good family, but in possession of \nweapons and willing to use them on his parents and his fellow students.\n  In the face of that kind of violence--a young man who would violate \nfour gun control laws to do what he did--Senator Wyden and I, frankly, \nstruggled to find out how we can respond to this, how we can, as public \nservants, lay down a new marker, provide a new barrier for stopping \nthis kind of violence. Also, how can we do it in a way that doesn't \nimpose the Federal will upon the States, but provides a carrot, and not \na club, for them to enact laws that would have captured this young man \nand prevented a horrible tragedy from being visited upon our State and \nthe city of Springfield.\n  We are not alone in this. Arkansas, Mississippi, and Pennsylvania \nhave also suffered these kinds of tragedies. So it is a growing \nnational concern. The reason I commend this legislation so strongly to \nmy colleagues is because it is, in fact, bipartisan because it does \nenjoy the support of gun control advocates and antigun control \ndefenders. As my colleague described, what this does is simply put in \nplace a new safety net, so that if a young person does bring a gun to \nschool, they will be detained--not to be just released to their \nparent's custody, but actually to undergo an evaluation in terms of \ntheir psychological health and their safety to the community at large.\n  It is unfortunate that this has to occur, but it has to occur \nbecause, at the end of the day, no other communities should suffer this \nconsequence again. So I commend my colleague for his leadership. I also \nwant to thank Senator Hatch, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nand Senator Sessions, for their input into this amendment; it was \nconsiderable. We worked it out with them. I think we have, in the end, \nan amendment that doesn't fix the situation entirely, but it goes a \nlong way toward accomplishing that very thing.\n  I thank all my colleagues for indulging us. I ask for their support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3265) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are now in order to go to Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3266\n\n                (Purpose: To prohibit Internet gambling)\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me briefly describe what this amendment \ndoes and indicate the degree of support that exists for it. Before I do \nthat, let me say that this amendment passed out of the Judiciary \nCommittee with one dissenting vote several months ago. It had been our \nintention to bring the amendment to the floor as a separate, \nfreestanding bill, but because there was not floor time available to do \nthat, we have had to resort to the amendment process under this bill. I \nregret that we have to do that, but that is the only way we would get \nthis important piece of legislation before the full Senate.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, it has been good because, during the interim, \nwe have been able to work with parties who had concerns about the bill, \nand I think, for the most part, we have worked the concerns out. I know \nthat one matter remains to be dealt with later. But except for that, we \nhave been able to improve on the bill since it passed out of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  As a result of that, I report to my colleagues that some of the \ngroups and organizations that support this legislation--to give you an \nidea of the breadth of support we have, it came up because of the \nAttorneys General of the United States; all 50 attorneys general from \nour States approve of this and support this legislation and, frankly, \nthey are the ones that asked the Judiciary Committee to move forward \nwith the legislation.\n  Jim Doyle, the Democrat attorney general from Wisconsin, testified \ntwo times before our committee strongly in support of this legislation. \nOne of the things he said was--I will quote it; I will find the quote.\n  But, in effect, what he said was ordinarily attorneys general don't \ncome to the Federal Government and ask for statutes to be federalized; \nthey like their own jurisdiction. But in this case they had to come \nbefore the Congress. The individual attorneys general simply cannot \nenforce their own State prohibitions. Why is that so? Because, if the \nState of South Carolina, for example, has made a public determination, \nas it has done, that this kind of gambling is illegal and ought to be \nillegal, and a neighboring State--let's say North Carolina--should \nallow people to broadcast into South Carolina these virtual casino \ngames that people can now find on the Internet, or let's say that comes \neven from outside the country, which is where these actually emanate \nfrom for the most part, then the people of South Carolina cannot be \nprotected even though their State policy is that their people not be \nsubjected to this kind of gambling. That is why all 50 State attorneys \ngeneral got together and came to us, and said, ``Would you please help \nus solve this problem?''\n  We have to be able to have a Federal law that is enforceable through \nthe Federal courts as well as the State courts to prohibit this kind of \nactivity. That was why we introduced the legislation and moved forward \nwith it. But what we soon found was that the support for the \nlegislation was much broader than that. You might expect that Louis \nFreeh, Director of the FBI, has expressed strong support for it.\n  But we have also had strong support coming from amateur and \nprofessional sports organizations. You can understand why, because the \nintegrity of sports depends upon people knowing that the outcome of any \nsporting event is not determined by someone gaming the system.\n  Unfortunately, we have seen these kinds of stories about point \nshaving and the like. I will give you an example from my own State of \nArizona where a student got deeply into debt. He played basketball and \nended up pleading guilty to shaving points and trying to throw games in \norder to pay off his gambling debt. Neither amateur nor professional \nathletics can stand that kind of attack on the integrity of sports, and \nas a result they came to us.\n  We have strong support for this legislation from the NCAA, the \nAmateur Athletic Association, from the National Football League, the \nNational Collegiate Athletic Association, the National Hockey League, \nthe National Basketball Association, major league baseball, and a lot \nof different organizations that understand how insidious gambling can \nbe when it is conducted in a medium such as the Internet, and as a \nresult they strongly support this legislation.\n  We also like to say until he moved on that, this legislation is \nsupported all the way from Ralph Reed to Ralph Nader. Ralph Reed has \nmoved on, but the Christian Coalition still supports the legislation; \nas does Ralph Nader, the Public Citizen organization which he \nrepresents, the National Coalition Against Gambling Expansion, the \nNational Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, Focus on the Family, \nFamily Research Council, and many other organizations.\n  The reason I wanted to mention this at the very outset is simply to \nillustrate the fact that this legislation has broad, widespread support \nfrom a variety of organizations and interests around the country.\n  In the meantime, from the time it passed out of the Judiciary \nCommittee, we have been able to work with the so-called horse industry \nand the pari-mutuel betting to assuage concerns that they had \noriginally expressed.\n  We have also worked with the Internet providers who will be an \nintegral part of the enforcement of this legislation. We have a letter \nfrom the main Internet providers indicating that they have no objection \nto this legislation passing in the form that it has passed.\n  Mr. President, I have kind of given you an idea of the kind of \nsupport that we have for it.\n  It is opposed, frankly, by two groups. One you will hear from--at \nleast one Indian tribe. And perhaps some other Indians would like to \nhave a carve-out; they would like to be excepted from this. Second, \nnaturally the gambling interests offshore who stand to make billions of \ndollars from this illegal activity do not like it. So that is who is \nagainst it.\n  Mr. President, I said this ``illegal activity,'' and I did that with \na reason. The activity that we are largely prohibiting tonight is \nalready illegal. The Wire Act, so-called, Telephone and Wire Act of \n1961, makes it illegal to conduct sports gambling over the telephone, \nor a wire. So much of what is being prohibited in this legislation is \nalready illegal.\n  For those people who say, ``Well, we would like to be able to conduct \nthis activity,'' their beef is not with our bill. Their beef is with \nexisting law. One of these days wires are not going to be the means of \nelectronic transmission. It is going to be fiber-optic cable or \nmicrowave transmission through satellites. We are not at all sure that \nwhen that happens that the Telephone and Wire Act will be able to be \nused by prosecutors in their prosecutions.\n\n  Just a couple of months ago, the district attorney for the district \nof New York indicted 14 people for conducting this kind of illegal \nactivity under the Telephone and Wire Act. But, Mr. President, that \nmight not be possible in the future. That is why we want to update the \nTelephone and Wire Act.\n  In addition to that, the second thing that this bill does is to \nensure that, whether it is sports betting or not, the activity is \nillegal on the Internet because what has cropped up in recent months is \nsomething called the ``virtual casino.'' It looks a lot like a casino \nthat you would go to that is perfectly legitimate such as Las Vegas or \nAtlantic City. It is on the Internet, and it comes outside of the \ncountry, because, of course, it is not illegal outside the United \nStates--at least in some countries. But that is being, in effect, sent \nto American citizens in our country.\n  The attorneys general of Florida, South Carolina, Arizona, and other \nStates have no way to stop it under existing law. Our bill ensures that \nkind of ``virtual casino'' over the Internet is illegal, and that it is \nenforced through not only the usual means of enforcement but also with \nthe ability of the prosecutors to go to the court and after a finding \nthat this activity is being conducted over the Internet, to enjoin its \nfurther conduct by bringing in the Internet service provider, in most \ncases, and asking the Internet service provider to cut off the service, \nto pull the plug on the service from that particular web site. In some \ncases it will be very easy to do. In other cases, it is more \ncomplicated. We provided for that in the legislation.\n  As I said, the Internet service providers--at least some of the \nlargest groups, and I can provide the names if anyone is interested--\nare satisfied that the language that we have worked out in the bill for \nthis purpose is at least not objectionable to them.\n\n[[Page S8760]]\n\n  Let me indicate that this is a relatively new phenomenon, but it is \npretty clear that we need to stop it now because it is quickly \nbecoming, or will become, a multibillion-dollar activity.\n  A recent ``Nightline'' piece, which was devoted to Internet gambling, \nreported that there are now an estimated 140 gambling sites online. Two \nyears ago, Internet gambling was a $60 million business. Last year it \ngrew to $700 million, and some believe that by the year 2000 the figure \nwill be $10 billion.\n  Mr. President, if we don't stop this activity now, the money that is \ngenerated by this kind of illegal activity is going to, I am afraid, \nbecome so influential in our political process that we will never get \nit stopped. That is why we have to act this year.\n  I might add, Mr. President--and I am so delighted to have the \nexpertise and the support of the Senator from Nevada, Senator Bryan--\nthat one of the reasons why the legitimate gaming organizations and \nactivities in our country are also in support of this legislation is \nbecause they understand. They don't want gambling to get a bad name. A \nlot of money is made, and a lot of people are employed in the gaming \nindustry in these States. They are highly regulated.\n  When you go to a gaming activity in Las Vegas, you know that you are \ngoing to be treated fairly. If you win, you will get the money. You \nknow exactly what the odds are. And there is a regulation commission \nthat ensures that the rules are abided by. But that is not the case on \nthe Internet.\n  Here is the problem.\n  Young children are getting really good at logging onto the Internet. \nThey can log on in the morning. You have to put down a deposit of $100 \nor $500--whatever it might be. You do that with a credit card, \nfrequently. And this child, in the privacy of the home, without any \nsupervision, can simply gamble away whatever fortune the family had \ntied up in that particular credit card with no supervision.\n  The kind of gaming that we have legalized in this country is the kind \nof thing where you have to go to that site. You have to engage in the \nactivity there. It is highly regulated.\n  One of the reasons this kind of activity is so dangerous is because \nthere is nobody there to check the activity. It occurs in the privacy \nof your own home with nobody there to say, ``Wait a minute. Haven't you \ndone this long enough? Haven't you lost enough money?''\n  Dr. Howard Schaeffer of the Harvard Center for Addictive Studies \npredicts that within 10 years youth gambling will be more a problem to \nsociety than drug use. And the youth of our society are the most at \nrisk for conducting Internet gambling. First of all, they are the most \nadept at using the Internet. Secondly, they are in college and school, \nand this is where a lot of the computers are that our kids start on \ntoday. And on every major campus today there is organized gambling \nactivity, according to law enforcement officials. Sports is the \npreferred subject of the gambling.\n\n  So it doesn't take any imagination to appreciate that our Nation's \nchildren are at risk. And there is much more risk in this Internet \ngambling activity than in any of the other kinds of legalized gaming, \nhighly regulated gaming, that is authorized in our country today.\n  I won't go into all of the details about bankruptcies and suicide and \nthat kind of thing except just to cite a couple of things here that \nought to cause us pause. We know that about 5 percent of the people who \ngamble will become addicted. It is an addiction. Of those, about 80 \npercent will contemplate suicide, and about 17 percent of those will \ncommit suicide. Bankruptcies are huge and growing. As a matter of fact, \nTed Koppel noted that in his ``Nightline'' program, that last year \n1,333,000 American consumers filed for bankruptcy, thereby eliminating \nabout $40 billion in debt. And he talked about the percentage of that \nwhich is attributable to gambling, going into some of the statistics \nabout a large percentage of that--in fact, something like 60 percent of \npeople will get gambling debts that they can't pay.\n  In fact, up to 90 percent of pathological gamblers commit crimes to \npay off their wagering debts. That is the testimony before our \ncommittee. So suicides, bankruptcies, crimes committed to pay off \ndebts, and the effect, of course, on the families.\n  What does this have to do with our bill? This is the kind of activity \nthat, by definition, is not regulated and is susceptible to addiction \nbecause there is nobody there. There is no inhibition in your own home; \nyou just log on and you go do it. Of course, these virtual casinos are \nreally good-looking things when you look at them on the screen. You can \npull them up tonight, as a matter of fact.\n  So, as I say, what we have done in the Judiciary Committee is to \nfocus on this specific kind of activity as (A) needing to be updated \nbecause wire may no longer be the method of transmission of data and \n(B) because of these virtual casinos offshore.\n  Let me describe a couple of the problems that we have dealt with in \nthe legislation. One of the concerns was that the service providers \nwould have difficulty in stopping the activity. Remember, what we have \ndone here is to say that this activity is illegal, just like the Wire \nAct does. Theoretically, you could even prosecute the bettor, although \nthat has never been done, and I don't anticipate it being done.\n  What we are after here are the people running these gambling \noperations. The U.S. attorney in New York has indicted some people, \nsome of whom were in the United States. So they have actually acquired \npersonal jurisdiction over those people. They might be able to \nprosecute them, fine them, and send them to jail. But for the most \npart, these activities are going to be abroad, because the activity is \nillegal in all 50 States. As a result, you are not going to be able to \nget personal jurisdiction over the offender.\n  How do we, therefore, stop the activity? That is where the service \nproviders come in. And after, as I say, a finding of illegality has \noccurred, they will be brought in to appear before the court and be \nasked to pull the plug on a service that they are providing or, through \nthem, is being provided to people on the net here in the United States.\n  As I said, in the case of a direct provider, it is a little more \ntechnical than this but almost as easy as pulling the plug, because \neach of these sites has an identifier, an identifying number for \nbilling purposes. Of course, you know that and you can simply cut off \nthat particular service. In other cases, it will be more complicated \nthan that.\n  So what we have done is to provide a complex series of protections \nfor the Internet provider to ensure, for example, that if they are \nasked to participate in this law enforcement activity, first of all, \nthere won't be any injunction issue against them if it is not \ntechnically feasible; and, secondly, that they can demonstrate, if it \nis the case, it is not economically feasible for them. Then the \ninjunction could not issue. This isn't a matter of what they are \npermitted to argue; these are actually conditions for the imposition of \nthe injunction.\n  I want to make it perfectly clear to my colleagues, up until a few \ndays ago, you may have been contacted by various Internet providers, \npeople like America Online, for example, or U.S. West. Their \nrepresentatives, who are all over this town, may have told you that \nthere were certain problems with this language. But they are among the \norganizations that have bought off on the language that I have \npainstakingly negotiated with them to ensure that, while they are \nhelping law enforcement, we are not imposing an impossible burden on \nthem. They are not going to have to do something that is not \ntechnically feasible, and they are not going to have to face \nunreasonable costs in complying with law enforcement.\n\n  I know some people say they are part of the problem because they are \nactually transmitting this illegal information. But I don't think it is \nfair to ask them to monitor this activity or to stop it unless law \nenforcement deems it sufficiently serious to stop. And that is why we \nhave only provided for them to be involved in this process in that \neventuality. I think that is very, very fair.\n  A second group that we have had discussions with is the virtual \ncasino networks and operators. I know that Senator Bryan is going to \ntalk to that because that is a part of his amendment. I must say that I \ntotally support the amendment of Senator Bryan to add the protections \nin this legislation to\n\n[[Page S8761]]\n\nthose who are providing the games involving, for example, baseball \nwhere you get together with other people and you create your own \nbaseball team and you then are judged by how well those teams and \nplayers do in the future. Sometimes there are prizes awarded, and \nsometimes there are not. But in any case, you usually pay a fee to do \nthat, and if you win, you can win the prize.\n  Now, the people who operate these kinds of activities on the Internet \nhave variously claimed that it is not gambling or that no prizes are \nawarded. And if that is the case, then they have nothing to worry about \nunder this legislation because both of those are requirements for it to \nbe considered gambling. We also make it clear, if they charge \nadministrative fees rather than collecting money to pay off bets, they \nwould be exempt.\n  I indicated before that we had solved the problems of the horse-\nracing industry. We essentially said with respect to that industry that \nthis legislation does nothing to take away from any of the activity \nthat they can do today, and, in fact, given the fact they are going to \nbe using computers in their operation, and also in their advertising in \nthe future, we make sure that activity is not prohibited. So, as I \nsaid, they are supportive of the legislation.\n  I want to make it clear to anybody who has heard from anybody with \nrespect to first amendment rights that the first amendment is totally \nprotected here. All advertising is permitted. Any kind of advertising \nof legal activity is absolutely legal, and it would not even be \nconstitutional for us to try to prohibit it. We have not done that.\n  That leads me, Mr. President, to the last point which has to do with \nthe treatment of the Native Americans. Now, under the IGRA, the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act, Native Americans are permitted to enter into \ncompacts with States to conduct the same kind of gambling or gaming \nthat is legal in those States. They can't do any more than what is \nlegal in the States, but they can compact to do that which is legal. We \nhave provided in this legislation an explicit recognition of the Indian \ntribes to conduct that kind of activity on their reservations. We have \nalso made it clear that they can engage in the kind of pooling \narrangements that many of them will engage in and that that would not \nbe illegal.\n  So everything that is done by every tribe except one, which may be \nviolating the law today and that you will hear more about here--\neverything that is currently being done and can be done legally is \ntreated as legal in this legislation and would be permitted to \ncontinue.\n  To the extent that the tribes were also concerned about enforcement \nby States attorneys general, we have made it clear that the States \nattorneys general are not to enforce this law against Indian tribes; \nthat the only time a State attorney general could be involved is if the \ntribe itself compacted for that, so the tribe would have had to have \nagreed to it in the first instance.\n  So we have satisfied all of the concerns of the tribes except one, \nand what you will hear is that they want to be able to do anything that \nis so-called legal or lawful under IGRA.\n  But the problem with that is this. This legislation, just like the \nWire Act that is still the law today, makes it illegal to conduct these \nkinds of activities. So since the Wire Act exists, a tribe could not \nconduct this activity claiming it to be legal under IGRA, because IGRA \nsays you cannot do it if you do not have a compact, and you cannot have \na compact unless it is legal.\n  So, because this legislation and the Telephone and Wire Act both make \nit illegal to conduct this kind of activity, or continue to make it \nillegal, then, by definition, it would not be possible for a tribe to \nconduct this activity.\n  What I am concerned about is that trying to add any other language \nthat suggests that, if it is lawful under IGRA it would still be OK, \nwould very much confuse and complicate the issue and raise a question \nabout what the basic intent of this legislation is. And, at worst, it \nwould actually permit the Native Americans or Indian tribes who wish to \ndo so, to do something that nobody else in the country would be able to \ndo, that would be illegal for every other American. What we have done \nis to treat the Native Americans fairly, to treat them like everybody \nelse--no better, no worse. It would be, I think, a grave injustice to \neveryone else to allow a special exception for the Indians that nobody \nelse in the country would have.\n  Mr. President, I will have some more to say about a couple of the \ndetails of what we do, especially if there are questions, and also to \nfurther talk about the kind of testimony that was presented to the \nJudiciary Committee in support of this legislation. As you might \nimagine, there was a wide variety of testimony provided by law \nenforcement officials, people familiar with gaming and with addiction, \npeople who understood the Internet and wanted to advise us about that. \nFrankly, we just had a lot of great testimony that supports this.\n  I will just close with this one comment that I think helps to make \nthe point. I mentioned the attorney general from Wisconsin--I was going \nto quote this before--James Doyle. He is the head of the Attorneys \nGeneral Association. He said:\n\n       Gambling on the Internet is a very dumb bet because it is \n     unregulated. Odds can be easily manipulated and there is no \n     guarantee that fair payouts will occur. Internet gambling \n     threatens to disrupt the system. It crosses State or national \n     borders with little or no regulatory control. Federal \n     authorities must take the lead in this area.\n\n  I close where I began. For State attorneys general to urge the \nFederal Government to take Federal jurisdiction over something like \nthis is almost unprecedented. They wouldn't do it if they didn't feel \nthat the problem societally justified it and, from a law enforcement \nstandpoint, that it was the only way to ensure that this illegal \nactivity could not be continued.\n  So, as a result of that, we have adopted this legislation out of the \ncommittee and brought it to the floor under this mechanism because, as \nI said, it is really the only way we could bring it to the floor. I \nurge my colleagues to support the legislation and to support the \namendment offered by the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I would like to preface my comment, before \nI say anything specific about the legislation, commending the Senator \nfrom Arizona for his untiring and unflagging efforts, trying to perfect \nan amendment which I am pleased to cosponsor. The junior Senator from \nArizona has spent the better part of this past year working with \nvarious groups, specifically the States' attorneys general who are the \nprime movers in this amendment. I believe the amendment which he has \noffered, and the underlying amendment which I have offered as a second-\ndegree amendment, accomplishes the purposes that we intend.\n  This amendment is supported by a wide spectrum of interest. I am \naware that within this Chamber there is a broad diversity of \nperspectives and viewpoints on gaming. Some States, such as my own, \nhave adopted for decades open and regulated casino gaming. Other \nStates, such as the States of Utah and Hawaii, by their public policy \npronouncements through their legislative actions, permit no gaming at \nall. But I think it is indicative of the broad spectrum of support that \nthis Internet gaming prohibition amendment enjoys, that from Ralph Reed \nto Ralph Nader, all of the groups that may represent the spectrum in \nbetween, have joined with Senator Kyl and me in supporting this \namendment: The Christian Coalition, the National Association of \nAttorneys General, from public citizen to the National Football League, \nand other groups as well.\n  Let me cite, if I may, a couple of reasons for that. The National \nCollegiate Athletic Association, the National Football League, the \nNational Hockey League, Baseball, Office of the Commissioner, National \nBasketball Association, major league soccer, are in strong support of \nthe Internet gaming prohibition amendment that we are debating this \nevening. In a letter received by my office on March 25:\n\n       We are writing to urge you to support the passage of S. \n     474, [that is in effect the amendment that we have before us] \n     the Internet Gaming Prohibition Act of 1998. As amateur and \n     professional sports organizations, we believe that S. 474 \n     would strengthen existing enforcement tools to combat a \n     growing national problem--illegal sports gambling conducted \n     over the Internet.\n\n\n[[Page S8762]]\n\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter I have identified be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 25, 1998.\n     Hon. Richard Bryan,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bryan: We are writing to urge you to support \n     the passage of S. 474, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act \n     of 1998. As amateur and professional sports organizations, we \n     believe S. 474 would strengthen existing enforcement tools to \n     combat a growing national problem--illegal sports gambling \n     conducted over the Internet.\n       Sports gambling tarnishes the integrity of athletic \n     competition. It taints the way fans view sports contests. It \n     creates suspicion and cynicism about game and performance \n     outcomes and degrades players in the eyes of fans. The \n     amateur and professional sports organizations have long \n     understood this problem and have aggressively policed the \n     relationship between gambling and sports.\n       Congress has also long recognized that gambling has no \n     place in amateur and professional sports. For example, under \n     the Interstate Wire Act of 1961 (18 U.S.C. 1084), it is a \n     federal crime to use wire communication facilities in \n     interstate or foreign commerce for purposes of sports \n     gambling. Faced with efforts to establish sports lotteries \n     and other forms of legalized sports betting in the late \n     1980s, Congress enacted the Professional and Amateur Sports \n     Protection Act (28 U.S.C. 3701 et seq.) in 1992, prohibiting \n     any further legalization of sports betting by states or other \n     governmental entities.\n       Despite existing federal and state laws prohibiting \n     gambling on professional and college sports, sports gambling \n     over the Internet has become a serious--and growing--national \n     problem. Many Internet gambling operations originate from \n     offshore locations outside the U.S. The number of offshore \n     Internet gambling websites has grown from two in 1996 to over \n     70 today. It is estimated that Internet sites will book over \n     $600 million in sports bets in 1998, up from $60 million just \n     two years ago. These websites not only permit offshore \n     gambling operations to solicit and take bets from the United \n     States in defiance of Federal and state law but also enable \n     gamblers and would-be gamblers in the U.S. to place illegal \n     sports wagers over the Internet from the privacy of their own \n     home or office.\n       S. 474 would strengthen the tools currently available to \n     enforce existing federal and state laws prohibiting sports \n     gambling. If enacted, this legislation would make it more \n     difficult for Internet gambling operators as well as the \n     individuals who gamble to evade the law. S. 474 would extend \n     criminal penalties to include individuals who gamble on the \n     Internet, not just those who operate Internet gambling sites. \n     Most importantly, S. 474 would provide law enforcement \n     officials with an effective and much-needed civil enforcement \n     mechanism to keep the Internet or any other interactive \n     computer service from being used to place, receive or \n     otherwise make a sports bet or wager.\n       S. 474 makes it clear that a new communications medium, the \n     Internet, cannot be used to circumvent existing federal and \n     state laws that prohibit sports gambling in this country. We \n     strongly urge you to vote in favor of S. 474 when it is \n     considered on the Senate floor.\n           Sincerely,\n     National Collegiate Athletic Association.\n     National Football League.\n     National Hockey League.\n     Baseball, Office of the Commissioner.\n     National Basketball Association.\n     Major League Soccer.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, as I indicated, the National Association of \nAttorneys General have been the prime mover of this legislation. The \ndistinguished occupant of the Chair has served as an attorney general \nfrom his State and, indeed, headed the National Association of \nAttorneys General. As the distinguished occupant of the Chair and \nothers know, States' attorneys general do not frequently come to the \nCongress of the United States and ask for legislation unless they are \nof the opinion that State action is insufficient and incapable of \naddressing the problem. That is the view of the National Association of \nAttorneys General in urging Senator Kyl and me and others to move \nforward with the legislation that bears the S. 474 designation, and \nwhich, in essence, is the amendment we are debating on the floor this \nevening.\n  The attorneys general make a very important point. They say, in part, \nin a letter which was sent to me on March 20 of this year, and signed \nby a number of States' attorneys general that:\n\n       The potential problems cautioned by the availability of \n     games worldwide through the Internet are exacerbated because \n     of the current inability of Internet technology to address \n     many of the policy considerations that have caused states to \n     create such widely disparate legal and regulatory schemes.\n\n  Then they go on to say in this letter:\n\n       Additionally, there is currently no [I want to emphasize \n     ``no'' effective technological means to verify the physical \n     location of players and proprietors in order to ensure the \n     participants and businesses are operating under the laws of \n     the individual jurisdictions where they are physically \n     located.\n\n  That is the view of the Nation's attorneys general as they have come \nto the Congress and asked us to support this legislation.\n  Again, I ask unanimous consent that the letter sent to me dated March \n20, 1998, from the National Association of Attorneys General, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                            Attorneys General,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 1998.\n     Hon. Richard H. Bryan,\n     Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bryan:\n       As the members of the Internet Working Group of the \n     National Association of Attorneys General, we write to \n     express our support for S. 474, the Internet Gambling \n     Prohibition Act. As introduced by Senator Kyl in March of \n     1997, the bill closely modeled the changes in federal law \n     suggested by a resolution adopted by the National Association \n     of Attorneys General in June, 1996. Although the bill has \n     undergone several substantive changes prior to reaching the \n     Senate floor, it continues to be the most appropriate measure \n     to address the growing problem of gambling via the Internet.\n       Gambling laws and regulations have more state-to-state \n     variety than almost any other area of law. Each state's \n     gambling policy is carefully crafted to meet its own moral, \n     law enforcement, consumer protection and revenue concerns. \n     Most states believe they have crafted the perfect \n     combinations of law and policy to address their own \n     populations' needs. The Internet threatens to disrupt this. \n     As recently noted by the U.S. District Court for the Western \n     District of Wisconsin, ``[The State] has a powerful interest \n     in enforcing its anti-gambling laws which would be \n     substantially undermined if defendant could evade enforcement \n     through Internet gambling.''\n       The threat of technology provides the only exception to the \n     preeminent role of the states to regulate gambling and \n     control gambling policy formulation. Today, the federal \n     government's only role in gambling policy formulation relates \n     to specific instances where technology threatens to disrupt \n     the individual states' carefully balanced policy choices in \n     this area. For example, the Interstate Horseracing Act, 15 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1301 et seq., addresses the use of wires and \n     satellites to facilitate the combination of parimutuel \n     wagering on horse races and prevent different pools from \n     endangering the integrity of the horse racing industry. The \n     Lottery Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1301 et seq., allows states to \n     limit import of out-of-state lottery tickets via mail and \n     other forms of transportation. The Johnson Act, 15 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1171 et seq., places limits on the interstate \n     transportation of slot machines, using our national \n     transportation infrastructure, allowing states to make their \n     own determinations on whether they will allow those machines \n     in their states. Finally, the Wire Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1081 \n     et seq., prohibits the use of the wires to transmit wagering \n     information.\n       The proposed Internet Gambling Prohibition Act would \n     provide the same appropriate degree of federal involvement \n     for the Internet. The Internet represents the latest form of \n     technology that threatens to disrupt state policies: almost \n     anything that can be done on a computer, like gambling, can \n     be done via the Internet anyplace in the world where a \n     connection is available. A wide variety of card, dice and \n     other games of chance can be entertainingly simulated on a \n     computer screen via the Internet. In addition, traditional \n     forms of horse and race betting are well-suited to \n     computerized participation. All of these activities can be \n     conducted on a computer, and the Internet allows this conduct \n     to be made available worldwide and across state lines, \n     regardless of any state's carefully crafted and explicitly \n     stated gaming policy, laws and regulations.\n       The potential problems caused by the availability of games \n     worldwide through the Internet are exacerbated because of the \n     current inability of Internet technology to address many of \n     the same policy considerations that have caused the states to \n     create such widely disparate legal and regulatory schemes. \n     These crucial policy concerns include general moral attitudes \n     towards gambling, basic issues of game integrity, effective \n     customer dispute resolution procedures, underage gambling, \n     cash controls to hinder money laundering and other criminal \n     activity, as well as efforts to recognize and treat problem \n     gamblers. Additionally, there is currently no effective \n     technological means to verify the physical location of \n     players and proprietors in order to ensure that participants \n     and businesses are operating under the laws of the individual \n     jurisdictions where they are physically located.\n       The proposed Internet Gaming Prohibition Act, in its \n     current form, continues to address the important policy \n     concerns we first expressed in the summer of 1996. We urge \n     your\n\n[[Page S8763]]\n\n     continued efforts in making this bill the law of the land.\n           Sincerely yours,\n         James E. Doyle, Attorney General of Wisconsin, Co-Chair, \n           NAAG Internet Working Group, Hubert H.

Pine, Attorney General of \n           Rhode Island, John Knox Walkup, Attorney General of \n           Tennessee, William Sorrell, Attorney General of \n           Vermont, William U. Hill, Attorney General of Wyoming, \n           Christine O. Gregoier, Attorney General of Washington,\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I think my colleague has done an \nextraordinarily good job and given a very clear explanation of what we \nare seeking to create in this amendment. This simply represents an \nupdate to reflect the change of technology. Under current law, it is \nillegal to wager over mail and telephone communications. We simply \nintend, by this amendment, to bring current technology into compliance \nwith the technology that was covered previously by this prohibition. \nInternet gambling is spreading exponentially. It approaches nearly $1 \nbillion of annual revenue; 140 web sites currently operate on the \nInternet. It will be, as my colleague from Arizona indicated in his \ncomments, a multibillion-dollar industry by the turn of the century.\n  Why have the States' attorneys general approached us and asked us to \nenact this legislation? What vice exists with respect to Internet \ngambling that does not exist with respect to regulated gaming in the \nvarious forms the States have chosen to adopt?\n  First of all is access. Whether one favors gaming or one has a strong \nreligious or moral view opposed to gaming, I believe that all would \nacknowledge that gaming ought to be an adult recreational activity--\nunderscoring the word ``adult.'' When one accesses the Internet and the \nvarious web sites that are currently on the Internet, there is no \nmeans--no means to enforce the age of that individual who is accessing \nthe Internet. We all know from our children and grandchildren that \ntoday's youngsters enjoy a proficiency and sophistication, if you will, \nin terms of their ability to surf the net, to understand the world of \ncomputers. It is very easy--very easy for very young children to gain \naccess to the Internet and thereby to participate in Internet gambling.\n  I repeat, whether one supports the open casino style of gaming that \nNevada has legalized for more than six decades, or takes the more \nrestrictive view that the policymakers of the States of Hawaii and Utah \nhave adopted, and that is to permit none, no one can justify access to \na gaming experience to young children who may be 12, 13, or 14 years of \nage. And there is no way to enforce limited access to the Internet and \nto limit it to only those who are adults.\n  Second, let me make the point that in those States that have chosen \nto adopt, and those tribes that have adopted forms of gaming pursuant \nto the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, there is or ought to be mechanisms \nin place that make sure that the individuals who are licensed to \noperate those games have been carefully screened for both integrity, in \nterms of their records, and suitability. Nobody is permitted, in the \nState of Nevada, for example, to operate a gaming activity unless he or \nshe, or its corporate officers, have been carefully screened by the \nState Gaming Control Board and ultimately approved by the State Gaming \nCommission.\n  When you participate in a gaming experience in States that permit \nsome form of gaming, it is regulated. You know the individual operators \nof the game. In the world of cyberspace, you know not with whom you are \ncommunicating. Nobody, Mr. President--I repeat, nobody--has screened \nthose individuals in terms of background, who they are, in terms of \ntheir track record, their integrity or their suitability. You are, in \neffect, participating in a gaming experience in which you do not know \nwho the people are who are running that particular web site.\n  No. 3: the actual virtual gaming experience itself. Every gaming \ndevice that is made available in my own State for customers to \nparticipate in has been approved by the Nevada Gaming Control Board and \nthe Gaming Commission to make sure that the device provides a \nreasonable and fair opportunity for the player to win, so that the game \nis not rigged, so that under no circumstances could the player win. \nNone of us is naive enough not to recognize that the odds clearly favor \nthe house. That is not my point. But the game of chance is an honest \none. Participants, players, have an opportunity to win, and, indeed, \nmany of them do.\n  In the world of cyberspace, no one, but no one, has regulated that \nparticular device that is being offered. There is no way for the player \nto know whether that virtual game is rigged in such a way that it is \nimpossible for him or her to win under any circumstance.\n  Finally, assuming for the sake of argument that one does participate \nand does win, how do you know whether anybody is going to be around \nwhen you come to collect the money?\n  Mr. President, the Internet and the e-mail system is filled with \ndozens and dozens of people who have had experiences that highlight the \npoint I am seeking to make this evening. I will not impose upon the \npatience of this Chamber to cite all of them, but a couple of them, I \nthink, are illustrative and make the point.\n  This is in a communication dated April 1 of this year by an \nindividual who had participated in Internet gambling. I quote from his \nletter:\n\n       I tried both of the above online casinos, and I'm beginning \n     to notice a strange trend. When I played the games offline \n     just for practice, the odds seemed to conform, but when I \n     played online for real money, the win-loss ratio seemed very \n     disproportionate compared to what they were when I was \n     playing offline. Of course, I may have been just very unlucky \n     playing online, but I'm strongly suspicious. I suspect that \n     the odds for real play and the practice are quite different. \n     I think these guys cheat somehow, and I've given up on them \n     and online gambling altogether. Of course, I can't prove that \n     they cheat. Who can?\n\n  Mr. President, the point being, there is no regulator who, first of \nall, makes a determination as to who ought to have a web site for \ngaming activity, no regulator to determine whether or not the game of \nchance itself is a fair and honest one, and no regulator to make sure \nthat, indeed, if the player prevails, he or she is able to collect.\n  Let me cite one other which I think is illustrative, and this is a \nletter dated April 30 of this year. The writer goes on to observe:\n\n       This is what you find at the bottom of the barrel--\n\n  Referring to the individual letter writer's experience on the \nInternet with his or her gambling experience.\n\n       Presumably from New Hampshire, these guys set up an online \n     bingo site that went belly up in a hurry. The most popular \n     theory is that they had fewer players than anticipated and \n     couldn't afford to pay off the winners, so they pulled off a \n     disappearing act that would turn David Copperfield green with \n     envy.\n\n  That is the point that I am seeking to make.\n  The point needs to be made that Internet gambling is a bad bet. It is \nan unregulated activity in which children have access to the gaming \nexperience, and it is not an enterprise that is subject to regulation. \nThat is why the States' attorneys general have asked us to impose this.\n  Let me simply say that I believe that the prohibition needs to be \nacross the board. My amendment makes one exception--and perhaps some of \nmy colleagues have participated--and that is in the so-called fantasy \nsports leagues or educational games that operate over the Internet. \nSome have estimated that nearly 1 million Americans participate in \nfantasy or rotisserie sports teams on the Internet ranging from \nbaseball to golf to auto racing.\n  The second-degree amendment which I have offered to the first-degree \namendment of the Senator from Arizona will simply indicate that that \nkind of activity which exists will not be prohibited under the \nprovisions of this legislation.\n  Finally, let me say that Internet gambling currently is in violation \nof the law. States' attorneys general and U.S. attorneys are trying to \ncombat it, but, Mr. President, they need our help,\n\n[[Page S8764]]\n\nand the enforcement tool or mechanism that they need is in the \nlegislation offered by the junior Senator from Arizona and the Senator \nfrom Nevada. I hope that all of my colleagues will support this, \nirrespective of their own personal views toward gaming itself.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the second-\ndegree amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3267) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3268 to Amendment No. 3266\n\n     (Purpose: To clarify that Indian gaming is subject to Federal \n                             jurisdiction)\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], for himself, Mr. Inouye \n     and Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 3268 to \n     amendment No. 3266.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, I want to see what is in \nthis amendment. Do you mind?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Not at all. I am about ready to explain it, but you can \nhave it read if you wish.\n  Mr. FORD. I won't object, but I want to be sure about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3 of the amendment, strike lines 9 through 12 and \n     insert the following before line 13:\n       ``(iii) a contract of indemnity or guarantee;\n       ``(iv) a contract for life, health, or accident insurance;\n       ``(v) lawful gaming conducted pursuant to the Indian Gaming \n     Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.); or''.\n       Beginning on page 13 of the amendment, strike line 4 and \n     all that follows through page 14, line 25, and insert the \n     following:\n       (2) Proceedings.--\n       (A) Institution by federal government.--\n       (i) In general.--The United States may institute \n     proceedings under this paragraph. Upon application of the \n     United States, the district court may enter a temporary \n     restraining order or an injunction against any person to \n     prevent a violation of section 1085 of title 18, United \n     States Code, as added by this section, if the court \n     determines, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing, \n     that there is a substantial probability that such violation \n     has occurred or will occur.\n       (ii) Indian lands.--With respect to a violation of section \n     1085 of title 18, United States Code, as added by this \n     section, that is alleged to have occurred, or may occur, in \n     whole or in part, on Indian lands (as defined in section 4 of \n     the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2703)), the \n     United States shall have the authority to enforce that \n     section.\n       (B) Institution by state attorney general.--The attorney \n     general of a State (or other appropriate State official) in \n     which a violation of section 1085 of title 18, United States \n     Code, as added by this section, is alleged to have occurred, \n     or may occur, after providing written notice to the United \n     States, may institute proceedings under this paragraph. Upon \n     application of the attorney general (or other appropriate \n     State official) of the affected State, the district court may \n     enter a temporary restraining order or an injunction against \n     any person to prevent a violation of section 1085 of title \n     18, United States Code, as added by this section, if the \n     court determines, after notice and an opportunity for a \n     hearing, that there is a substantial probability that such \n     violation has occurred or will occur.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand on the floor this evening in \nsupport of the concept of the Kyl bill, and I support the second-degree \namendment that the Senator from Nevada has just successfully placed on \nit.\n  I believe that unregulated Internet gaming is and can be dangerous. \nIt must be monitored closely and restricted to adults.\n  To date, the only form of gaming regulated at the Federal level is \nIndian gaming. I am not a big fan of most Indian gaming. We have \nstruggled with it in my State for some time. However, through the \nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act, known as IGRA, Congress established clear \nand precise laws governing all forms of Indian gaming.\n  Authority to regulate Indian gaming was given by Congress to the \nNational Indian Gaming Regulatory Commission. In addition, developments \nin Indian gaming are followed closely by the Senate Committee on Indian \nAffairs and its counterparts in the House. In fact, it is my \nunderstanding that the committee has held a series of hearings this \nyear on examining the possible changes in IGRA.\n  Mr. CRAIG. What I want to point out is that there is an established \nprocedure in dealing with laws which impact Indian gaming.\n  Mr. President, the Kyl bill ignores this procedure and changes IGRA \nwithout the input of the Indian Affairs Committee or the National \nIndian Gaming Regulatory Commission. The Kyl bill does this in a number \nof ways, including placing new restrictions on tribal gaming \noperations, overrides and nullifies existing State tribunal pacts, \nmakes illegal some forms of Indian gaming determined by the courts to \nbe authorized under IGRA.\n  Those who would support the bill claim that it does not impact IGRA. \nI cannot agree with that argument. If it, in fact, sought no change in \nIGRA, why do they then oppose the amendment that would guarantee no \nchange? Because that is exactly what my amendment does. The truth of \nthe matter is that the bill severely limits authority granted IGRA.\n  The Craig amendment does not expand Indian gaming. Let me repeat: The \nCraig amendment does not expand Indian gaming. And that would be argued \nby the Federal courts. The amendment would only protect a gaming \nenterprise if it were already legal under IGRA. The amendment would \nonly protect a gaming enterprise that was already sanctioned by a \nState-tribal compact, the very kind of thing that this Congress set up \nin the law that created IGRA.\n  The amendment would not allow for any form of new Indian gaming. The \nreason these issues are important--and the Senator from Arizona was \nexactly right when he spoke in general terms about the possibilities of \nmy amendment, speaking specifically to one Indian tribe. That Indian \ntribe happens to be in my State, and they have established what is \nknown as the National Indian Lottery.\n  They have withstood three separate Federal court tests and have \nargued that they are legal, and the courts have so ruled. Yet, the \nInternet Gaming Prohibition Act that Senator Kyl has just offered \namends section 1084 of the so-called Federal Wire Act to include \nlotteries. Only by his act would they become illegal.\n  By the current law, and by the current regulatory process, they are \nlegal; and they have been found that. This tribe has been sued. They \nhave taken their issue to court and have successfully won. Lotteries \nare defined as class III gaming and are governed by the terms of the \ntribal-State compacts, the rules and the regulations, the National \nIndian Gaming Commission. Idaho's case is no different. And that is \ncertainly the case that I argue here tonight.\n  In 1992, the Coeur d'Alene Tribe signed a compact with the State of \nIdaho which specifically provided for the conduct of these National \nIndian Lottery games. Article 621 of the compact authorizes the tribe \nto conduct lotteries, so-called State lotteries to the compact, defined \nin article 419, to include a variety of things.\n  The compact was approved by the Secretary of the Interior in February \n1993, and, therefore, noticed in the Federal Registry. Since that time \nit has fallen under regulation. What the Senator from Arizona is doing \ntonight--and I agree with him--is making illegal that which is \nunregulated, and provides either an outright prohibition or establishes \nregulatory effort.\n  Now, he has exempt a variety of things, exempt very powerful gaming \norganizations. So I do not think the Senator can argue tonight that \nthere have not been some exemptions. He says he is after the offshore \nkind of Internet activity. I agree with him. The kind I am trying to \nprotect is onshore, legal and regulated by IGRA and the National Indian \nGaming Commission. I could not stand here tonight and argue for an \nunregulated activity. We expect them to be fair. We expect them to be \nhonest. We expect them to be\n\n[[Page S8765]]\n\ncontrolled and only to be made available to adults. That is exactly \nwhat is happening here and why I argue it.\n  All of the regulations that this Congress has put in place is adhered \nto by the National Indian Lottery. It is regulated, as I said, at the \nFederal level. It is regulated at the State level. It is regulated at \nthe separate governmental or tribal level. And that is the way it \nshould be. It is audited regularly by Arthur Andersen. It is protected \nso that only adults can participate in it. And that is constantly \nscanned.\n  My amendment would simply say that these kinds of activities--legally \nsought--would be regulated under the current regulatory process, \nbecause it is Indian gaming; and we have established the IGRA and the \nNational Indian Gaming Commission for that purpose. The amendment of \nthe Senator from Arizona would deny that right and place, by its \nadoption, this as an illegal activity where the Federal courts have \nruled that under current process it is legal.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I would like to lend my support to the \namendment offered by my friend and colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, \nfor several reasons.\n  The Internet presents opportunities for education, business, and \ngovernance that were unthinkable until recently. Concepts such as \n``distance learning'', and ``e-commerce'' are tied to this new and \nlittle understood technology.\n  As a Congress and as a nation, we must come to grips with this \ntechnology in a way that encourages development and at the same time \nprovides protection from abuses for our most vulnerable citizens.\n  So let me start out by saying that I have a healthy respect for the \nInternet and the possibilities it holds.\n  Like Senator Kyl, however, I am troubled by unregulated gambling and \nother objectionable material or services being offered on the Internet, \nparticularly when young children and other vulnerable people are \ninvolved.\n  Nonetheless, as chairman of the committee on Indian affairs, I must \npoint out that there are several objectionable provisions in the bill \nbefore us, not the least of which is that S. 474 amends the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act in significant ways, without the benefit of \ncommittee deliberations, or the input of the many affected tribes.\n  I firmly believe that any legislation aimed at Internet gambling \nshould be ``technology-neutral'' and not tied to or focused on a \nspecific technology.\n  Given the creativity and genius of computer and high-tech \nindividuals, such as framework would quickly become obsolete--and \nrequire new legislation.\n  For instance, there are 30 Indian tribes operating games like \n``Megabingo'' and ``satellite bingo''; dozens of tribes that operate \nparimutuel betting and other games that are authorized by and regulated \nunder the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n  The IGRA provides that bingo games that rely on or use electronic or \ntechnological aids, are legal and are explicitly permitted by the IGRA.\n  In addition to the jurisdictional issues raised, S. 474 would \ncriminalize certain games that are legally played as class II games \nunder the IGRA.\n  When the IGRA was enacted in 1988, the position of this Congress was \nto ``provide maximum flexibility'' to tribes in terms of technology or \nin terms of conducting multi-state operations through the use of such \ntechnology.\n  The Congress' intent included the use of technological aids for bingo \nand similar games ``on or off of Indian lands.'' The bill before us \nshould provide a categorical exception for these and similar games.\n  The bill defines ``person'' as including ``other governments'' which \nmay be construed to include tribal governments. Together with section \n4, which authorizes state attorneys general and other state officials \nto bring enforcement actions against Indian tribes for violations that \noccur on Indian lands, this provision will alter the law regarding \njurisdiction in ways that I strongly oppose.\n  This bill is a serious change in federal Indian law not seen since \nthe enactment of ``P.L. 280'' in 1953, which conferred state \njurisdiction over Indian lands without tribal consent.\n  Section 4 is also in direct conflict with the IGRA, which provides \nthe United States with enforcement authority over Indian gaming \nactivities.\n  The civil enforcement remedy granted to the states in S. 474 is \nunnecessary and unwarranted. Current law provides that class II gaming \nis regulated by the tribes and the federal government; and class III \ngaming is regulated pursuant to tribal-state compacts. Contrary to the \nassertions of many, the Indian gaming industry is subject to many \nlayers of regulation.\n  Federal law already establishes enforcement remedies under the IGRA. \nThese very jurisdictional issues arose when Congress considered the \nIGRA.\n  In 1987, the Supreme Court decided the Cabazon case which says that \nIndian tribes have the right to conduct gaming on Indian lands largely \nunhindered by state interference. With S. 474, we are re-opening an \nissue that has been settled for years.\n  Tribes and states can and often do resolve these issues in \nnegotiations. Tribal-State compacts, and P.L. 280, only allow state \nenforcement activities with the consent of the affected tribes.\n  The IGRA established the mechanisms for tribes and states to \nnegotiate and come to agreement on these matters and some tribes and \nstates have freely entered negotiations to resolve these matters--in \nthe form of state-tribal compacts.\n  Third, this bill amends the IGRA by requiring that any persons who \nplace or receive the wagers involved be ``physically located'' on \nIndian lands.\n  As my friend from Idaho knows, there is ongoing litigation to \ndetermine the meaning of the term ``on Indian lands'' contained in the \nIGRA.\n  One question that is inherent in this debate over S. 474 is \ndetermining where the ``transactions'' that will be prohibited will \ntake place?\n  Recognizing the complexities of Internet commerce and the tax issue, \nthe nation's Governors recently agreed that an enlightened policy \nrequires more information and deferred a decision regarding a \n``national Internet sales tax policy''.\n  The notion that with this or any other bill, the United States can \nstop the flow of electronic gambling on American modems and computers \nis just not realistic.\n  For instance, the Caribbean nations of Antigua and Barbados actively \npromote what they call their ``on-line casinos'' to players both on the \nislands and to anyone off the islands with a computer.\n  So one consequence of this bill if enacted will be the elimination of \nAmerican-based Internet gaming providers to the benefit of off-shore \ngaming operators like our friends in the Caribbean. Will this Congress \never stop pursuing policies that send American jobs overseas?\n  Last, let me say a few things about the ``Craig amendment'' which I \nbelieve will eliminate the conflicts between S. 474 and the Indian \ngaming act and will appropriately provide that those games that are \ncurrently authorized and regulated under the IGRA would remain outside \nthe purview of this legislation.\n  I am in favor of tribes and others being treated similarly as far as \nInternet gaming goes, and feel very strongly that tribes should not be \nsingled out either for special treatment or for special scrutiny as far \nas the Indian Gaming Regulatory act goes.\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, I know full well the \ncontroversy that surrounds gaming activities. I also know that the \nIndian gaming act represents a complex and delicate balance of \ncompeting interests--including state and tribal interests.\n  The tribes are seeking nothing more than what is already sanctioned \nunder federal law in the form of the IGRA. As is the case with the \nCoeur d'Alene tribe, there is now pending federal litigation that the \nCongress ought not upset in the form of this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Craig amendment to \nprovide equity and fairness to this Internet gaming legislation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the amendment offered by my colleague, \nSenator Kyl, addresses a serious problem in our society, and I support \nmost of its provisions.\n  I agree that we should protect children from having the opportunity \nto gamble on the Internet.\n  I agree that we should regulate gambling in a responsible manner.\n\n[[Page S8766]]\n\n  I agree that we should take steps to protect the integrity of our \namateur and professional sports.\n  The amendment offered by Senator Kyl will address these problems, \nwhich have accompanied the rise of Internet gambling. The problem with \nthe amendment is that it does not address these problems in a manner \nthat treats Native Americans fairly.\n  To address this situation, I am cosponsoring the amendment offered by \nSenator Craig. This measure will exempt from the Kyl amendment those \nIndian gaming activities regulated and sanctioned by the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act, thereby retaining the current jurisdictional structure \nestablished under IGRA for Indian gaming, a structure that involves the \nfederal courts and the National Indian Gaming Commission.\n  Mr. President, it would not be fair to Indian tribes to enact the \nrestrictions of the internet gambling prohibition amendment offered by \nSenator Kyl without retaining the regulatory structure of the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act as Senator Craig suggests. If Congress wants to \nmodify the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, it should do so only after \nserious review that includes the input of those parties affected \ndirectly by that change--in this case, the tribes and tribal gaming \nenterprises.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the Craig amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kyl \nAmendment, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act. I am an original \ncosponsor of S. 474, on which this amendment is based.\n  This amendment takes important steps to address the dangerous, \nbillion-dollar-a-year threat to our communities and our laws of \nInternet gambling.\n  The Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and \nGovernment Information, on which I serve as Ranking Member, held \nhearings on the subject of Internet gambling in March of last year. At \nthat time, I joined Senator Kyl in introducing S. 474, on which this \namendment is based. The bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee by \nvoice vote in October of last year.\n  Since that time, this proposal has been carefully fine-tuned to \naddress concerns raised by various groups.\n  This proposal enjoys the support of a wide range of groups, including \nlaw enforcement, family and consumer advocates, and professional and \namateur athletics.\n  Most importantly, FBI Director Louis Freeh, at a Senate Judiciary \nCommittee hearing, when asked if the FBI supports the Internet Gambling \nProhibition Act, Prohibition Act, replied, ``Yes, I think it's a very \neffective change. We certainly support it.''\n  Similarly, the National Association of Attorneys General explained \nwhy such legislation is important in letters to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and to the full Senate. The State Attorneys General wrote:\n\n       [M]ore than any other area of the law, gambling has \n     traditionally been regulated on a state-by-state basis, with \n     little uniformity and minimal federal oversight.\n  The availability of gambling on the Internet, however, threatens to \ndisrupt each state's careful balancing of its own public welfare and \nfiscal concerns, by making gambling available across state and national \nboundaries, with little or no regulatory control.\n\n  This amendment brings our laws on gambling up to date with advances \nin technology. It ensures that the new medium of the Internet will not \nprove to be the latest frontier of illegal gambling.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Internet Gambling \nProhibition Act, and I am proud to support this amendment, to provide \nlaw enforcement with the tools it needs to keep the Internet free of \nthe scourge of illegal gambling.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I rise in support of the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Arizona. And I want to, specifically, because it does address a \nserious growing problem of the utilization of the Internet to provide \nunregulated gaming activities, but also because there is a broader \nissue at stake here that I think we need to consider. We will not be \nvoting on it this evening, but it is very much a part of this and it \nneeds to be addressed.\n  First of all, the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona is a \ngood one because we clearly are dealing here with a new dimension in \ngaming, a new means by which gaming is provided to millions of \nAmericans that is not accessible in the same way as it was before.\n  In 1961 Congress, wisely, I believe, passed the Wire Act. The Wire \nAct was designed to prohibit the utilization of telephone facilities to \nreceive bets or send gambling information.\n  I do not have the regulative history in front of me, but I am almost \ncertain Congress did that because it did not want the invasive nature \nof telephone lines and telephone access, which run into virtually every \nhouse in America, to be a means by which Americans could utilize that \nform of communication to enter into gambling. It did so because I am \nsure, if you went back and read the record, it understood the social \ncost, the consequences of gaming, and it wanted gaming to be a \nrestricted activity.\n  Of course, the advent of the Internet as a communications medium was \nnot anticipated by Congress or even envisioned by Congress at that \ntime, so therefore this Wire Act does not cover that. The Senator's \namendment extends pretty much the provisions of the Wire Act to the \nInternet. I think for that reason, it is legitimate in terms of \nupdating it to comply the law to changes in technology.\n  The fact that it is supported by the FBI, with strong testimony from \nthe FBI Director, the National Association of Attorneys General--as I \nunderstand, all the attorneys general have supported this from each \nState. Professional, amateur sports groups, including the National \nFootball League, the NCAA, the NHL, NBA, Major League Soccer, Major \nLeague Baseball, for obvious reasons, are strongly in endorsement of \nthis.\n  But then one of the most adverse collections of public interest \ngroups and consumer advocates that have come together on an issue that \nI have seen for a long, long time--maybe ever--ranging from Ralph \nNader's Public Citizen to the Christian Coalition, the National \nCoalition Against Legalized Gambling, Focus on the Family, Family \nResearch Council, have all endorsed the Kyl language which prohibits \nthe Internet gambling. Now, they have not just specifically done so \nbecause it only addresses Internet gambling. They have done so because \nInternet gambling is simply a piece of a much larger program that is \nhaving, in my opinion, a dramatically adverse and negative effect on \nour culture. They see the Kyl amendment as one way of addressing a \nbroader question.\n\n  Ultimately, I think, we as Congress, we as representatives of the \npeople, will have to come to grips as to what the impact of gambling is \nas it proliferates throughout our States and as access to gambling \nbecomes more and more available to our citizens--and not just our adult \ncitizens, but to our young people.\n  There is a growing concern about pathological aspects of gambling. \nFor decades, our Nation has studied and Congress has struggled with how \nwe deal with drug and alcohol addictions, but the rapid expansion of \ngambling is injecting a new narcotic into our Nation's bloodstream. The \nproblem of pathological gambling is on the rise. The National Council \non Problem Gambling places the number of Americans with serious gaming \nproblems at around 5 percent. Most studies confirm that estimate. \nHowever, as gambling becomes more pervasive and as gambling becomes \nmore accessible, this number is increasing dramatically. Some say it \nhas doubled; some say it might have tripled.\n  As with other addictive behaviors, gambling not only affects the \nindividual who does the gaming but it affects their families, it \naffects their careers, virtually every aspect of their lives. \nSeparation, divorce, spousal and child abuse, neglect, substance abuse, \nand suicide have all been linked as side effects of problem gambling.\n  Studies of high school students which have recently been undertaken \nhave indicated that gambling is spreading into our high schools and \nspreading into minors' use in dramatic ways. Of course, nothing is more \naccessible to gaming than the Internet. If you want to bypass the \nnormal restrictions and regulations that are placed on gaming--and \nthose have been loosened dramatically--the quickest and easiest and\n\n[[Page S8767]]\n\nmost effective way to do so is through the Internet.\n  I think Senator Kyl's amendment is particularly relevant at this \nparticular time to address a part of the gaming problem and the \ngambling problem that exists in America. It does so in a way that can \nbe utilized to at least make it more difficult, significantly more \ndifficult, for minors to utilize the Internet as a means of gaming. \nKnowing what the pathological results and the consequences are, as we \nsee a proliferation of individuals entering into gambling, we know that \nthe raw number of individuals who are affected by problem gaming is \ngoing to increase dramatically.\n  I will just say one more word about the second-degree amendment \nbefore the Senate. I think the second-degree amendment creates a huge \nloophole. In a sense, it creates a monopoly. It creates a monopoly for \none entity to use the Internet to provide gambling access and therefore \ntotally undermines the intent of the Kyl amendment.\n  I understand that there is a statute outlining procedures by which \nthese decisions are made. Nevertheless, that doesn't invalidate the \namendment of the Senator from Arizona which addresses the broader \nissue. If we allow a significant exception for one entity, that one \nentity, obviously, will take advantage of that loophole and we will \naccomplish virtually nothing that the Senator is attempting to \naccomplish.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the second-degree amendment and \nsupport the underlying amendment by the Senator from Arizona which \naddresses, as I said, only a part, but a very significant part, of the \nproblem, and particularly because it addresses the infusion and the \nexplosion of gambling that is entering the lives of our children and is \nbecoming accessible to them in ever easier ways, and particularly \nthrough the Internet.\n  I urge my colleagues as we move toward a vote here to support the \namendment of the Senator from Arizona.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Craig's \nsecond-degree amendment to the amendment proposed by Senator Kyl.\n  Mr. President, I am privileged to represent the State of Hawaii \ntogether with Senator Akaka. The State of Hawaii is one of two States--\nUtah being the other--where all forms of gaming, gambling, are \nprohibited. To play bingo in Hawaii would be a crime. I support \nHawaii's position.\n  There have been countless attempts made to introduce gaming into our \nislands, but in each case I am happy to report that the political \nleaders of Hawaii have opposed it and we have prevailed. So it may \nsound strange to some of my colleagues to see me standing here \nsupporting the second-degree amendment of Senator Craig.\n  Eleven years ago, there was a very important decision rendered by the \nSupreme Court of the United States, the so-called Cabazon case. The \ndecision in the Cabazon case was a most important one, because it once \nagain declared clearly that Indian nations were sovereign. Our \nConstitution declares that Indian nations are sovereign. The laws of \nour land and the laws that we have passed in this Chamber have \nconsistently indicated that Indian country is sovereign, whether we \nlike it or not.\n  The Cabazon decision was a simple one. It said if a State does not \nprohibit gaming, then it cannot prohibit gaming in Indian reservations. \nCalifornia did not prohibit gaming. Therefore, the Cabazon Tribe had \nthe authority to do that.\n  Immediately, many of us in this Chamber saw the potential for utter \nchaos in the United States if all of the Indian reservations rose as \none to claim their right under Cabazon to conduct gaming in the various \nStates. There would be no regulation, no supervision. Therefore, we \ntook it upon ourselves to pass the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and we \ndid so not by consultation but by advice and by the recommendation of \nhow the law should read, from the States, the Governors, and the AGs of \nthe States, who told us how they wanted this law to be passed.\n  The law that is now regulating Indian gaming is the creature of the \nStates. We took away a bit of Indian sovereignty to bring this about \nbecause, as we all know, the sovereignty of Indian country results in a \ntrust relationship between our Government and an Indian government; it \nis not a relationship between Indian government and State government.\n  This Kyl amendment has an ambiguity because, on one hand, it says the \nFeds will implement the law in Indian country, but there is another \nprovision that says the State government will enforce the provisions of \nthis amendment in Indian country.\n  What we have tried to do here is to simply carry out the intent of \nthe amendment as set forth by Senator Kyl.\n  I was very encouraged by the statement made in Senator Kyl's recent \n``Dear Colleague'' letter in which he stated his amendment ``will \nneither explicitly or implicitly amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory \nAct.''\n  Mr. President, Senator Craig's amendment is a very simple one. It \nwould simply accomplish what Senator Kyl has indicated as being his \nintention. The amendment will accomplish two objectives: First, make \nclear that gaming, which is lawful under the Indian Gaming Regulatory \nAct, would not be rendered unlawful by the Kyl amendment. Secondly, the \namendment would conform the enforcement of Federal laws on Indian lands \nto the Federal regulatory scheme that has been in place for over 100 \nyears; namely, that the United States is, and will continue to be, \nresponsible for the enforcement of Federal criminal laws on Indian \nlands.\n  The Craig amendment is necessary because the Kyl amendment will \notherwise shift the responsibility for the enforcement of this new \nFederal criminal statute to the States. Mr. President, I don't think \nthat was the intention on the part of Senator Kyl.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support the second-degree \namendment submitted by Senator Craig, because that will assure that \nthere is no unintentional effect of our action on the provisions of the \nKyl amendment on the lawful conduct of gaming on Indian lands.\n  Mr. President, if I had my way, I would recommend that gaming be \noutlawed. With the Craig amendment, I will be supporting the Kyl \namendment to make certain that Internet gaming is not made wild and \nwidespread throughout this whole Nation and world. I urge my colleagues \nto look upon the Craig amendment with seriousness. We do believe in \nwhat our Constitution says and what the Supreme Court decision has so \ndeclared.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have been informed that the second degree \nI sent to the desk needs a correction. I ask unanimous consent that \namendment No. 3268 be corrected as ordered in drafting.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nnot object. I am a little bit concerned that the hour of 9:30 is \napproaching and we haven't had time to fully discuss the amendment the \nSenator from Idaho has offered, the second-degree amendment. This is a \nvery significant amendment. If it passes, I will vote against the \namendment Senator Kyl and I have cosponsored.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield, I recognize there is a \nconsiderable need for more debate on this. I don't plan to vote on this \nissue at 9:30. After we finish the votes in order, we will come back to \nthe Kyl amendment, as amended by Craig, and go forward from there.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I think that would be all right.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, could you \nhave a unanimous consent that we return to this immediately after the \nvote on the last amendment? Would that be suitable?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes. I ask unanimous consent that, upon completion of the \nfinal vote in the series of votes beginning at 9:30, we return to the \nKyl amendment, as amended by Craig.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I want to ask \nthe Senator from Idaho a question. Is that a technical correction or a \nsubstantial change? In other words, we need to know what it is that we \nare talking about if the Senator has submitted a correction.\n\n[[Page S8768]]\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is a technical correction. The intent of the amendment \nis as originally presented to you.\n  Mr. KYL. We need to have a copy of that, obviously. I will not \nobject.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to provide that. I made the mistake of \namending the Bryan amendment and, as a result, now I have amended your \namendment, as amended. That is the appropriate way to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I want to associate \nmyself, as we say, with the remarks of the Senator from Hawaii. I am \nprobably only the second person who is going to rise today who opposes \ngambling. My State has decided to go that route. I have taken an \nunpopular position in my State. Fortunately, I am not Governor, I am a \nSenator, and everybody knows we don't pay attention to Senators back in \nthe State--at least in my case.\n  I do support the Craig amendment on the grounds stated by the Senator \nfrom Hawaii. It seems to me that what the Craig amendment does is \nexactly what the Senator from Hawaii has stated, which is that it makes \nit clear that the intention stated by my friend from Arizona is in fact \nmet, that it does not in fact directly, or indirectly, by inference or \notherwise, amend IGRA.\n\n  It seems to me that, on a larger principle, we are always all too \nready, in the 25 years I have been here, to say we believe in the \nsovereignty of the Indian nations. And we are very ready, whenever they \ndo anything we don't like, to conclude that we in fact do not recognize \nand should not recognize their sovereignty. Further, we add insult to \ninjury and the only time we treat them as sovereign nations is when we \nare handing out money, when we have programs. One of the exceptions in \nthe crime bill is that Indian nations can apply for police officers \ndirectly, just like the State of Delaware, or the town of Wilmington, \nor the county of Columbus could do so.\n  So I find it somewhat interesting when, in fact, we find it in our \ninterest--meaning we are not going to spend money--to recognize the \nsovereignty of Indian nations--we are ready to do that. But when Indian \nnations want to do something that somehow is viewed as impinging upon \nanother interest in a State in which the Indian nation happens to be \nlocated, we are all ready to say, no, no, no, let's hold up.\n  I will not take any more time, in light of the hour. We are about to \nvote. I agree fully with the Senator from Hawaii. I share his view \nabout gambling generally, and I share his view about the Craig \namendment specifically.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to make something very clear since the \nSenator from Delaware is still on the floor.\n  The Senator from Idaho has proposed an amendment that is a poison \npill. I want to make it very clear that if by some chance it should \npass, I will urge all of my colleagues to vote against my bill, because \nwhat it will do is create a monopoly. Indian tribes will be the only \npeople in the country that will be permitted to engage in Internet \ngambling. Offshore casinos, virtual casinos, and Indian tribes would be \nable to do it; no other citizen would be allowed to do it. This is not \na violation of IGRA. We do not provide for State enforcement unless an \nIndian tribe has already agreed by compact to do that.\n  So I want to make it clear. I will read to you two sentences from a \nletter from the National Association of Attorneys General. I want the \nSenator from Delaware to listen to these words and to appreciate that \nthis activity is illegal; it will be illegal for all Americans, and I \nthink the last thing we want to do is create a situation in which one \ngroup of Americans can do this and nobody else can. This is a letter to \nActing Chairman Deer and Commissioners Foley and Hogen of the National \nIndian Gaming Commission with respect to this issue:\n\n       We are writing to you to express our strong opposition to \n     and legal analysis regarding the use of the Internet for the \n     purpose of engaging in gaming activity allegedly under the \n     Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (IGRA). The undersigned \n     have concluded that such gaming is not authorized by IGRA.\n\n  That is signed by all of the attorneys general, including the \nattorneys general of Hawaii and Idaho and, as I said, all of the other \nattorneys general.\n  I have practiced law for 20 years. I am very familiar with the law in \nthis area. I am not misreading the law. With all due respect to our \ncolleagues from Idaho and Hawaii--and I love them both, and they are \ngreat and fine Senators--on this matter, in my opinion, they are simply \nnot correct. The effect of their amendment is so bad, as I said, it is \na poison pill. It is so bad that I would have to urge all of my \ncolleagues to vote against this amendment that Senator Bryan and I have \nproposed.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the regular order?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3257\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is that the hour of 9:30 \nhaving arrived, under the previous order the pending question is the \namendment numbered 3257 offered by the Senator from Arizona, Mr. \nMcCain. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \ncompletion of the McCain amendment that votes on further amendments \nthat are in this stacked group be limited to 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COATS. Reserving the right to object, I don't intend to object. I \nask the manager of the bill if he could give us some indication of what \nhis intention is this evening relative to the schedule. How many votes \nwill we have? After this series of votes, it is my understanding that \nwe are going to return to the Kyl amendment for further debate. Does \nthat mean further votes this evening?\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my expectation that what will occur is we will have \nmaybe a minimum of five votes during this sequence, and potentially \nsix. At the completion of that, we will go back to the Kyl amendment, \nas amended, by Craig. We will debate that until it is in a position to \nbe voted on. Then we will vote on it. Then we will go on to the next \namendment on this bill, and we will vote on that.\n  Mr. COATS. Is it the Senator's intention that we will stay on this \nbill this evening until this bill is completed?\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my hope--I know it is the hope of the ranking \nmember--that we can work out a unanimous consent to be more \naccommodating to our colleagues. But that unanimous consent has not \nbeen agreed to. Our hope would be to get a unanimous consent where all \nthe pending amendments to the bill, of which we have agreements on the \nlist, to be debated tonight and then voted tomorrow. However, as of now \nthere are objections to that unanimous consent. As long as there are \nobjections, it is my intention to proceed on with votes.\n  Mr. COATS. So we will be here until at least 11 p.m. voting, and \nmaybe not even be voting yet on the Kyl-Craig amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. My expectation is that we will be voting until 11 p.m. on \nthis sequence, and further debate on Kyl-Craig, which I presume will \ntake another hour, and we will be voting on that, unless we can get \nagreement on unanimous consent requests, which the Senator from South \nCarolina and I have asked both our colleagues to support us on, which \nwould be to allow debate on all pending amendments, of which we have a \nlist, tonight with votes to occur stacked tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. COATS. Absent that, my last point, as a consequence we will \ncontinue this evening?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct. That is my intention.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator. I withdraw any objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has all time been yielded?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be \nyielded on the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nArizona. On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 47, nays 53, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8769]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 223 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Hutchinson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Breaux\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Reed\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 3257) was rejected.\n  Mr. WARNER.

The pending question is now on amendment No. \n3261, offered by the Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3256\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent the Thompson amendment, No. 3256, \nbe agreed to.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3256) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know the Senators are trying to get some \nidea of how this will go from here on. I have been working with Senator \nDaschle.\n  Mr. President, we have four more votes in this stacked sequence, \nwhich will take us a good portion of the next hour. We are trying to \nwork an agreement whereby we would then, at the conclusion of this \nseries of votes, go back to the Kyl amendment and have the debate on \nthat concluded tonight, with a vote occurring at 9 in the morning. Then \nwe would get an agreement that all other amendments and final passage \noccur by noon tomorrow.\n  I think that is reasonable. Senator Daschle is working with me to see \nif we can get everybody to agree to that. We are trying to find a way \nto give you some reasonable night tonight and get this to a conclusion. \nI do not want to prejudge amendments that are being offered, but I \nreally think we have reached a point where we need to get a conclusion. \nIf we do not put an end to it, it will go on and on and on, on this \nbill. The alternative is to go back to Kyl and vote on that and to have \nother votes. I still have the luxury of going to the Executive \nCalendar, if all else fails, and have some votes on that.\n  We need cooperation so Senators can make progress so the rest of us \ncan get a decent night's sleep and so we can complete this bill \ntomorrow. I am not going to ask that right now, to give both of us time \nto work with those who have amendments, but I think that is a very \nreasonable arrangement, so I hope all of our colleagues will help us by \ntalking to other colleagues who might have amendments, and I hope we \ncan get this worked out by the next vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3261, as Modified\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, they are being \nasked to vote in just a couple of minutes on what I think is an \nextremely important amendment. We move the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction \nInitiative, that is now a demonstration project in Philadelphia, \nnationwide over a period of 5 years. With the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms, working with counties, States and local law \nenforcement agencies, to provide information on the illegal activity of \nfirearms in communities, to create adult, juvenile and youth illegal \nfirearm activities, identify them and control them, to make firearm \nviolations Federal violations prosecutable and move it in that \ndirection.\n\n  Mr. President, if this Senate wants to move against youth violence \nwith the misuse of firearms, this is a major initiative and a major \nstep in that direction. I hope my colleagues will work with us as we \nexpand this from 17 demonstration projects to 50 to 75 to 150 across \nthe Nation in high-crime areas going directly at juveniles and the \nmisuse of firearms and prosecuting felons who use firearms in the \ncommission of a crime, which is already a Federal violation of law, but \nnow goes unprosecuted.\n  I hope my colleagues can join with me in supporting this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition? The Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I started in opposition to this amendment, \nbut I now rise in support of this amendment. I think the Senator from \nIdaho is right. I think we should adopt this amendment with an \noverwhelming margin, and I believe he was right yesterday during the \ncourse of the debate when he said:\n\n       A general firearm safety rule that must be applied to all \n     conditions is that a firearm should be stored so that it is \n     not accessible to untrained and unauthorized people.\n\n  The Senator went on to say:\n\n       Proper storage of firearms is the responsibility of every \n     gun owner.\n\n  The next amendment after we adopt the Craig amendment will give us a \nchance to adopt a children's access prevention law which says to every \ngun owner in America, you have the right to bear arms; you have the \nresponsibility to store them safely. I urge all my colleagues to vote \nwith Senator Craig and then support the Durbin-Chafee amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, in light of the Senator's statement, I ask \nunanimous consent that the yeas and nays on this amendment be vitiated \nand that the amendment be agreed to my unanimous consent.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Craig \namendment No. 3261, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3261), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3260\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the amendment by \nthe Senator from Illinois No. 3260. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am going to yield a minute to my \ncolleague and cosponsor, Senator Chafee of Rhode Island. I urge my \ncolleagues to understand that 15 States have enacted these laws to \nprotect children. We all read about these horrible situations in \nJonesboro, in Springfield, in Pearl, MS. Let us not just lament this \nsituation, let us do something about it.\n  Gun owners understand their responsibility. That is why the NRA \nsupported this law in its enactment in five different States. We can do \nthis tonight to save children's lives.\n  I yield my remaining time to my colleague from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Order in the Senate. Senators will take their \nconversations off the floor of the Senate.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is clearly recognized that if you own a \npit bull and it is recognized as dangerous, you better control that pit \nbull. And if that pit bull slips away and injures, severely mauls a \nchild, you are liable. So it is with guns. If you leave a gun lying\n\n[[Page S8770]]\n\naround that a juvenile gets to and that juvenile causes severe damage \nwith that gun either to himself or to another individual, then you are \nto be liable, likewise.\n  If you are liable for a pit bull, you certainly ought to be liable \nfor a dangerous weapon like a rifle or a handgun that is left lying \naround. If you keep it under lock and key, that is a different matter, \nyou are not liable. I urge everyone to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I say to fellow Senators, don't be fooled \nby this amendment. For the first time, we take the victim, the person \nwho has had his or her firearm stolen, and we make them the criminal. \nFor the first time, we say you can become a Federal criminal without \never being involved in the crime. That is what this amendment does.\n  Don't fall for the analogy of the pit bull. If the pit bull is \nchained in the backyard, and there is a fence around the yard, and the \nyard is locked and somebody gets in that yard and inside the circle of \nthe pit bull and is injured, it is not the owner's fault. That is the \nlaw.\n  I hope you can join with me in opposing this. Don't make the victim \nthe criminal. Don't say that the person should become a Federal \ncriminal who is not even associated with the crime.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table amendment No. 3260, offered by the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin. The yeas and nays have been ordered on this \nquestion. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 69, nays 31, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 224 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--69\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kyl\n     Leahy\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--31\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Robb\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 3260) was agreed \nto.\n  Mr. GREGG.

The next order of business is the Bumpers \namendment numbered 3263, with 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, if you vote no on this amendment, you \nshould be prepared to go home and say to your constituents that you \nreally don't believe in privacy. When we have a law in this country \nthat allows people to tape-record a conversation with you and only they \nknow it is being taped and you don't and that is quite legal, we no \nlonger have any privacy in this country. How do you explain that to \nyour constituents?\n  This bill would make it a criminal offense, as Janet Reno said she \nfavored in Florida, as 15 States have already adopted. We \noverwhelmingly passed a law to make it a criminal offense to intercept \na cellular phone call. What I am trying to do is to extend that to the \nold archaic rule--think of this, think of this. You can be talking to a \nperson who is your best friend; he or she can be tape-recording that \nconversation and publish it on the front page of the New York Times or \nthe Washington Post, and there isn't a thing you can do about it.\n  I have exempted law enforcement; I have exempted intelligence \nagencies; I have exempted everybody who has to make telephone calls in \ntheir business; I have exempted people who are threatened or stalked.\n  Please, let's correct this once and for all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, usually I have some empathy for what my \ncolleague is saying, but this amendment requires both parties to \nconsent before phone calls are being taped. This hasn't been debated \nbefore the Judiciary Committee and involves all kinds of ramifications.\n  It is setting a Federal standard where one is not needed, because \nmany States now allow taping by one party. It is brought up only after \nthe Linda Tripp situation.\n  I frankly think it is the wrong thing to do. We are willing to look \nat this, but we are willing to look into this on the Judiciary \nCommittee, and we certainly will do it. But I think it is the wrong \nthing to do right now. I don't believe we should federalize this at \nthis point.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask unanimous consent for 10 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I offered this amendment in 1984 when \nCharles Wick, head of the United States Information Agency, said that \nhe had taped 84 phone calls, including Reagan, Cabinet Members, \nPresident Carter. I offered it then, and I got 41 votes. I offered it \nagain in 1993. Linda Tripp has nothing to do with this.\n  This is plain decency. It is constitutional. It is an invasion of \nyour privacy for somebody to record a conversation of you and you not \nknow it.\n  It is offensive in the extreme.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 10 seconds.\n  The way to do this is not to federalize it. Let's at least not impose \nsomething on the States without full committee hearings before the \nJudiciary Committee and find out what should be done.\n  I am not necessarily saying I am rejecting what the Senator said, but \nI have to reject it under these circumstances. I hope we will reject \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I remind the Members, this is a 10-minute \nvote, and the faster we can get it done, the faster we can get out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The question is on the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest now. If we can get this worked out, then we will have one \nremaining vote tonight.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. LOTT. If we can get this unanimous consent agreement worked out, \nthen there will be one remaining vote tonight and then the first \nrecorded vote will be about 9:20, I believe, in the morning. Then we \nwill go on to other issues with time limits, and we will probably have \nanother series of stacked votes on over in the morning after \nconsultation with the managers, if that would be all right.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following the next vote, the Senate \nresume the pending Craig amendment to the Kyl amendment and a vote \noccur on or in relation to the Craig amendment at 9:15 on Thursday, \nwith 10 minutes equally divided for closing remarks prior to the vote.\n  I further ask that following the vote in relation to the Craig \namendment, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Kyl amendment, \nas amended. I further ask, following the Kyl amendment, the following \namendments be the only amendments to be offered to the pending \nlegislation other than the managers' amendment, with no second-degree \namendments in order, and limited to the times, where specified, all to \nbe equally divided.\n  The list is as follows: A Nickles amendment regarding defense \nattorneys, 10 minutes; a Bingaman amendment regarding trademark and \nIndian tribes, 20 minutes; a Bumpers amendment regarding immigrant \ninvestor program, 20 minutes; a Kerrey of Nebraska amendment regarding \ncopper, 40 minutes; a Kerry of Massachusetts amendment regarding \nVietnam, 20 minutes; a Wellstone amendment regarding abuse of immigrant \nspouses, 30 minutes; a Hatch amendment regarding gun prosecutions, 20 \nminutes; a Grams amendment regarding criminal court, 10 minutes; a \nGrams amendment regarding U.S. nationals, 10 minutes; a Grams amendment \nregarding budget certification, U.N., 10 minutes; a Smith of Oregon \namendment regarding guest workers, 10 minutes.\n  I further ask that following the debate on the above-listed \namendments, the Senate proceed to vote in a stacked sequence, with 2 \nminutes for debate to be equally divided prior to each vote, and \nfollowing those stacked votes, Senator Gregg be recognized to offer the \nmanagers' amendment, and following its disposition, all other \nprovisions of the previous consent agreement with respect to the \npassage vote then occur.\n  Before the Chair puts this to a question, I thank Senator Daschle for \nhis cooperation in getting reasonable time agreements here. I think \nmaybe some of these amendments would actually require less time than \nhas been identified. But we are trying to make sure that all Senators \nhave the time that they need.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will yield----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senator from California had made a \nrequest that she be on that list, as had the Senator from New Jersey. \nThe Senator from California had asked for a half-hour on her amendment. \nShe is continuing to negotiate with the managers. The Senator from New \nJersey had asked for an amendment, 10 minutes as well.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, if we could get 20 \nminutes on the guest worker, with the possibility of a second-degree \namendment and 30 minutes evenly divided on the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think I hear additional amendments which \nwould require second-degree amendments beginning to evolve here. The \nalternative is, we go ahead and keep voting tonight. We have had plenty \nof debate here. I would like to find a way that we can get this \ncompleted at a reasonable hour tomorrow.\n  Does the Senator from California have something worked out that I \ncould include in this request?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes. If I could have a half-hour.\n  Mr. LOTT. The problem with all of these is that if we have them \noffered, then second degrees would be requested by others. So if we \ncan't get this agreed to, then I think we will just have to go on with \nthis vote and keep going tonight.\n  Now, we can work during this vote and see if we can work it out. But \nit is 30 minutes for first degree, 30 minutes for a second degree, and \nthere is no end to it. We have tried to work up a reasonable agreement \nhere.\n  I would like for Senators to work during this vote. We cannot tell \nyou this is the last vote now. So you are not going to be able to vote \nand leave unless we can get something worked out very quickly.\n  Any other reservations we need to be made aware of here?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as they say, reserving the right to object, \nI don't think there is a problem; we may be able to work it out. But \nyou mentioned two amendments Senator Grams of Minnesota has regarding \nthe United Nations. If we can't work out the second one relating to \nU.N. arms, I would want a second-degree amendment, or else I would \nobject.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let's proceed to vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request has been withdrawn.\n\n[[Page S8772]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 3264\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nWisconsin. There is 2 minutes of debate equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment simply states what we all \nknow to be true, and that is that cable rates across the country have \nrisen steadily since the Telecommunications Act of 1996. And there is \nvirtually no competition in the industry. The amendment instructs the \nFCC to report to us whether this situation is consistent with the FCC's \nresponsibilities, which it still has until March of 1999, to make sure \nthat cable TV rates are reasonable. If not, the amendment asks the FCC \nto give us an action plan; in other words, what is it going to do to \ncarry out its duties?\n  This is an amendment designed to hold the FCC accountable. We gave it \na mission to promote competition and ensure that the rates are \nreasonable. The American people deserve to know why the agency has not \nsucceeded. The amendment is supported by the Consumers Union and will \nbe a signal whether this body is content to see cable rates rise as \nhigh as three to four times the rate of inflation, as has happened \nduring the past year.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this simple amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The time of the Senator has \nexpired. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will take 30 seconds and give the other \n30 seconds to the Senator from Montana.\n  This is not the time or place to take such action which would \nrepresent the beginning of cable reregulation. Mr. President, I hope my \ngood friend from Wisconsin will withdraw the amendment and testify \nbefore the Commerce Committee next Tuesday, where we are examining the \nissue of cable rates. This is not the place to have this kind of \namendment, which has such profound effects. It requires separate \nlegislation. I understand his problem, but this is not the solution.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am concerned that the Feingold amendment \nis an inappropriate attempt to continue excessive government regulation \nof the cable industry. I believe that additional reports on the \nindustry by the Federal Communications Commission would be an \nunnecessary waster of taxpayer money. Furthermore, any efforts to deal \nwith cable rates should be dealt with in the upcoming hearing we have \nscheduled before the Commerce Committee this Tuesday.\n  The Cable Bureau is largely a product of the 1992 Cable Act. I \nopposed that Act because I believed it was overly regulatory and heavy \nhanded. I believe that my concerns were proven to be correct. However, \nin 1996, Congress responded to some of the excesses of the 1992 Act and \nto the growing competitiveness of the marketplace by adopting several \nCable Act reform provisions as part of the Telecommunications Act.\n  The aim of the Telecommunications Act as it related to cable services \nwas to provide increased choices at lower cost by opening up \nhistorically monopolistic, regulated markets to new entrants. In \nreturn, cable operators would be allowed to enter new communications \nmarkets such as telephone and information services. As we move beyond \ntraditional models of monopolies and excessive regulation to a climate \nof open competition, exciting new educational and commercial \nopportunities are beginning to appear.\n  I am also very concerned about the recent spate of increases in cable \nrates. However, the answer to increasing rates is not found in ever-\nincreasing government regulation but in providing for increased \nconsumer choice. Rather than engaging in micromanaging the rate-\nstructure of the cable systems, government should create a level \nplaying field where new entrants can compete effectively with incumbent \nproviders.\n  It was for this reason that I must oppose further misguided efforts \nto engage the government in regulating cable rates.\n  Mr. President, this issue has been studied to death. When this \nCongress decided to deregulate the cable industry, it was to expand \nservices and enhance services of the cable industry. That has happened. \nIf you look at the services and the expanded television coverage that \nwe have now on cable as compared to as near as 5 years ago, you would \nsee a big difference in the services that you receive today.\n  There is a hearing on next Tuesday. We invite the Senator from \nWisconsin to testify. This is no place to deal with this situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on the \nmotion to table. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. MACK (when his name was called). Present.\n  The result was announced, yeas 63, nays 36, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 227 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--63\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--36\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     D'Amato\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murray\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Specter\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                        ANSWERED ``PRESENT''--1\n\n       \n     Mack\n       \n\n\n               boys and girls club capital flagship club\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to engage the distinguished manager of the \nbill, Senator Gregg, in a colloquy.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would be pleased to respond to the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee on a matter that I know is of great importance to \nhim.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the floor manager and subcommittee chairman.\n  I was pleased that the Commerce, Justice, State, Judiciary \nappropriations bill as reported to the Senate included an increase of \n$20,000,000 over current levels for the Boys and Girls Clubs, bringing \ntotal funding for this outstanding organization to $40,000,000 in \nfiscal year 1999.\n  As the chairman knows, I support additional funding in his bill to \nallow the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Washington and the national \norganization to establish a state-of-the-art national capital flagship \nBoys and Girls Club facility in Washington, DC, near the Capitol.\n  Mr. GREGG. I am aware of the Senator's deep interest in this \nmeritorious project and for his longstanding support of the Boys and \nGirls Clubs.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleague.\n  Although there is no clarifying language contained in the Senate \ncommittee report regarding how the additional $20,000,000 over last \nyear's level would be utilized by the Boys and Girls Clubs, I would \nhope that the committee's intent was that a significant portion of \nthose additional Boys and Girls Clubs appropriations would be used to \ncover the cost of establishing the national capital flagship club \nfacility in the Nation's Capital at a site to be selected by the Boys \nand Girls Clubs of Greater Washington in consultation with the national \norganization.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator and chairman of the Judiciary Committee is \nabsolutely correct. The additional\n\n[[Page S8773]]\n\n$20,000,000 provided in our bill for the Boys and Girls Clubs was in \npart to cover the cost of the proposed national capital flagship club \nfacility in Washington and for other purposes. It is my understanding \nthat at least $6,000,000 will be require for the site, design and \nconstruction of the proposed flagship facility and that amount would be \ncovered by these additional funds.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee for \nthat clarification and I deeply appreciate his strong support for the \nnational capital flagship club facility in Washington. The flagship \nclub will be run by the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington in \nconcert with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and will provide a \nprototype, technology-based club facility to help troubled youth both \nhere and around the nation.\n  Mr. GREGG. I look forward to working with the Senator to make sure \nthat this flagship project is fully funded and that the Office of \nJustice programs carries out this project effectively, beginning in \nfiscal year 1999.\n\n\n                  FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT THE 2000 CENSUS\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the bi-\npartisan leaders of the appropriations subcommittee, Chairman Gregg and \nSenator Hollings, for providing adequate funding to allow the Census \nBureau's census 2000 plan to proceed. The funding will permit the \ncensus professionals to continue their plan to guarantee that everyone \nin every city and rural area will be counted.\n  I ask that when this Appropriations bill goes to conference with the \nHouse that the Senate conferees stand united against any effort to \nreduce the decennial census funding level or micro-manage the \nprofessional census gathering process.\n  I am very concerned about the critical 2000 census, because I believe \nSenator Gregg and Senator Hollings will face a difficult conference \nwith the House. Contrary to the Senate plan, the House funds the Census \nBureau for only six months, crippling the bureau and denying the census \nprofessionals the tools they believe will help them conduct the most \naccurate 2000 census possible.\n  The House leadership has also challenged the Census Bureau sampling \nplan in federal court, asserting it violates the United States \nConstitution. The federal court should proceed with their review, but \nthe Census Bureau professionals need to proceed with their plan, which \nrepresents the best efforts of census professionals and academics to \nmeasure the population.\n  Before we look forward to conference, I would like to briefly look \nback and put the current sampling dispute in its historical context. \nRegrettably, the public debate over the 2000 census has been dominated \nby the use of sampling, a simple, statistical method proposed by the \nCensus Bureau to count the historically ``difficult to count'' \npopulations of the nation's urban and rural poor. The Bureau's sampling \nplan was developed in direct response to the unprecedented census error \nrates in 1990, the first census in US history to be both more costly \nand less accurate than the census that preceded it.\n  Why is an accurate census important for the nation? The decennial \ncensus is the basis for distributing funds throughout the country for \nmore than one hundred federal programs.\n\n       Is the local police force eligible for federal grants for \n     cops on the beat or drug education programs? Check the \n     census, which sets eligibility for Byrne grants, DARE funds \n     or community policing grants.\n       How about education funds for schools? The census \n     determines title one or title two education grants.\n       How about funds for homelessness, mass transit or other \n     transportation funds? Again, the census determines state and \n     local government eligibility for Social Services block grant \n     money, highway and mass transit grants.\n       What about health care for low-income families? Again, the \n     census helps set state Medicaid reimbursement levels.\n\n  The census is instrumental for the effective administration of \ngovernment at all levels, providing the basis for distributing billions \nof dollars throughout the country through hundreds of programs. The \nnation cannot afford the error rates and inaccuracy experienced in the \n1990 census.\n  The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, \nconcluded the 1990 census failed to count about 15 million Americans, \nwhile an additional 11 million Americans were double-counted. The \nCalifornia population was undercounted by more than 2.7%, representing \n20% of the nation's net undercount.\n  If we squander this opportunity for reform and the 2000 census proves \nto be equally inaccurate as its 1990 predecessor, between 5 and 6 \nmillion individuals, would be ``missed.'' If we do not reform our \ncensus plan, 1 to 1.2 million Californians, 3% of the state's \npopulation, will fail to be counted. If the census misses 1 million \npeople in California, about 300,000 children will not be counted, \ndepressing state education funding and seriously compromising education \nin the state.\n  Mr. President, concerns for undercounting the United States \npopulation are as old as the nation itself. Thomas Jefferson, \ntransmitting the first census to President Washington, commented, ``we \nknow in fact that the omissions have been very great.'' However, the \nCensus Bureau sampling plan, which enjoys the support of the National \nAcademy of Sciences, academics and census professionals, is a reasoned \nresponse to the unprecedented error rates of the 1990 census. Congress \ncannot make the same mistake again.\n  The Census Bureau plan needs to go forward. It's time to allow the \ncensus professionals to implement their best plan to improve on the \n1990 undercount and deliver the most accurate 2000 census possible.\n  I thank the chairman, Senator Gregg, and ranking Democrat, Senator \nHollings, for their efforts and extend my continuing support.\n\n\n                        iraq war crimes tribunal\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to commend my colleagues, Chairman \nGregg and Senator Hollings, for including in this legislation $5 \nmillion to cover initial costs of establishing a War Crimes Tribunal \nfor prosecution of Saddam Hussein and other Iraqi government officials \nfor crimes committed during the Gulf War and afterward.\n  I sought these funds in a letter to Chairman Gregg dated April 24, \n1998, because I believe it is critical that we have the prosecutorial \ninfrastructure in place to deal with Iraqi war crimes. I also noted in \nmy letter that every effort must be made to obtain contributions from \nour allies and other U.N. member countries for this vital effort.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues as this bill moves \nforward to ensure that these funds are retained in Conference.\n\n\n                                  OECD\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to bring my colleagues \nattention to the excellent work being done by an important \ninternational organization--the Organization for Economic Cooperation \nand Development (OECD). Since 1961, when it was founded, the OECD has \nworked to open up and help develop the world economy, not only for its \nmember states but also for those nations outside the OECD area.\n  We live in an era when the term global economy is redundant. There is \none economy, and it is global. And one of the things we need as a \nnation to keep us competitive is accurate, up-to-date information. We \nalso need a forum in which to work with other nations equally committed \nto economic openness to achieve the highest sustainable growth and \nstandard of living. That is what the OECD is all about: helping its \nmember nations achieve a better standard of living and higher \nsustainable growth rate by providing a forum for the exchange of \ninformation and policy prescriptions.\n  While the OECD has 29 member nations, its reach is global. For \nexample, for a number of years, the OECD had in place the Center for \nCooperation with the Economies in Transition (CCET). The CCET was \ninitiated by the U.S. as a result of an amendment I introduced to the \nSEED Act. My colleagues will recall the SEED Act was designed to help \nthe economies of Central and Eastern Europe build market economies. \nWell the work of the CCET was so successful, that three nations from \nthat region--Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic--have become \nmembers of the OECD.\n  Now, the OECD has revised its approach to helping non-member nations \nto reach beyond the CEE nations. For example, the OECD does a lot work \nwith Russia. It is also closely following the Chinese economy. It has \nbeen part\n\n[[Page S8774]]\n\nof the team of international organizations and governments who have \nbeen working on what to do about the economic crisis in Asia.\n  The OECD's work is not limited to handling macroeconomic issues. It \nworks on a number of other key economic areas. The Convention to combat \nBribery and Corruption is an example of an important OECD initiative. \nIt is also taking the lead on helping governments can best respond to \nthe rapidly changing world of electronic commerce. It is involved with \nissues relating to regulatory reform, corporate governance, and \nsustainable development to name a few.\n  But perhaps what really distinguishes the OECD from other \ninternational organizations is its internal reform efforts. The OECD \nhas undertaken on its own, a significant reform effort. Specifically, \nit has pledged to cut its overall spending by 10% during the three year \nperiod beginning in 1996. It is well on its way toward reaching this. \nSo far that has meant a loss of 180 staff, more than 10% of its total.\n  It is my understanding that the subcommittee has decided to use a \nformula to cut the budgets of international organizations that have \nadministrative costs above 15%. But the data it is using is based on a \n1997 State Department study that only goes up to 1995. The OECD has \ntold me that it has brought down administrative costs to about 12.4% of \nits budget.\n  I agree with the committee's goal of trying to get international \norganizations to make necessary reforms and reductions. The era of big \ngovernment ought to be over not only at home but with international \norganizations as well. The OECD is a good story. It has reformed on its \nown. My fear is that if despite all its efforts to enact cuts, the \nCongress calls for further arbitrary cuts of the OECD based on data \nthat is not up-to-date, then it will undermine the reformers in the \norganization who share our goal of getting international organizations \nto be ``leaner and meaner.''\n  I, therefore, urge the committee and the Administration to fully fund \nthe OECD at the request level made by the Administration. Let's show \nthat we are willing to reward and encourage organizations like the OECD \nthat make real reforms.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                      unanimous consent agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Again, Mr. President, I thank Members for the cooperation \nwe have been receiving. We have worked out time agreements on which I \nbelieve we can get a unanimous consent agreement. Let me read the whole \nthing once again. We have made changes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate resume the pending Craig \namendment to the Kyl amendment and that a vote occur on, or in relation \nto, the Craig amendment at 9:15 a.m. on Thursday, with 10 minutes for \nclosing remarks, to be equally divided. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat following the vote in relation to the Craig amendment, the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the Kyl amendment, as amended, with 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to the vote.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the Kyl amendment, the \nfollowing amendments be the only remaining amendments to be offered to \nthe pending legislation, other than the managers' amendments, with no \nsecond-degree amendments in order, unless specified, and limited to the \ntimes where specified, all to be equally divided.\n  The list is as follows: Senator Nickless amendment regarding defense \nattorneys, 10 minutes; Senator Bingaman, 20 minutes; Senator Bumpers, \n20 minutes; Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, 40 minutes; Senator Kerry of \nMassachusetts, 20 minutes; Senator Wellstone amendment for 30 minutes; \nSenator Hatch amendment, 20 minutes; the first Grams amendment for 10 \nminutes regarding criminal courts; a second Grams amendment regarding \nU.S. nationals for 10 minutes, with a possible second-degree amendment \nby Senator Biden with 10 minutes; a Senator Grams amendment regarding \nbudget certification for 10 minutes; Senator Smith of Oregon amendment \nregarding guest workers with 20 minutes, with a second-degree amendment \nfor 20 minutes by Senator Kennedy. We are still hoping they can work \nthis out. If this matter is not resolved, we will have an amendment by \nSenator Daschle on this subject for 10 minutes, and an amendment by \nSenator Lott for 10 minutes. Also, a Torricelli amendment regarding \nnonpoint source, 20 minutes; a Lieberman amendment regarding Asian \nfinancial crisis, 20 minutes; and a Lautenberg amendment regarding \npolice cars, 20 minutes.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the debate on the \nabove-listed amendments, the Senate proceed to vote in a stacked \nsequence, with 2 minutes for debate to be equally divided prior to each \nvote, and following those stacked votes Senator Gregg be recognized to \noffer the managers' amendment, and following its disposition, all other \nprovisions of the previous consent agreement with respect to the \npassage vote then occur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. In light of this agreement, then, thanks again for the \ncooperation of all Senators. There will be no further votes tonight. \nThe next vote will occur at approximately 9:15 a.m. in the morning, \nperhaps slipping a minute or two to 9:20 on Thursday, and then a series \nof votes to be announced at a specified time later in the morning on \nThursday.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3268\n\n  Mr. GREGG. As I understand it, under the previous order we are now to \nreturn to the Kyl amendment, as amended by Craig, for debate with the \nvotes to occur tomorrow morning. I ask unanimous consent that the \ndebate on this amendment, for this evening's purposes, be limited to 20 \nminutes, 10 minutes on each side.\n  Mr. KYL. Ten minutes per side is fine for me. Five minutes per side \nis fine with me.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that we have 10 minutes, 5 minutes \non each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I think many of us have spoken tonight to \nthe issue of Internet gaming and our opposition to it; most assuredly, \nour opposition to unregulated offshore Internet gaming. The Senator \nfrom Arizona has brought forth an amendment that controls that, in \nfact, prohibits that. But it also prohibits something else that we in \nthe Congress and law, by agreements, treaties with American Indians, \nhave said is separate, should be, and should be regulated. And we have \nsaid Indian gaming should be regulated. And it is. But the Senator from \nArizona has made the exception as it relates to any Indian gaming on \nthe Internet. I am saying, that is an intrusion that should not be \nallowed.\n  Regulate? Absolutely. Control? Absolutely. Build and maintain a \ntribal-State compact? Absolutely. We have wrestled with this issue over \nthe years. When I was in the House, I worked with a Congresswoman from \nNevada. We were outruled by the courts. The Senator from Hawaii has \nclearly spoken to the issue of the courts.\n  What I am saying is that I sense there is a clear and important \ndivision. Through the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, Congress \nestablished a clear and precise law governing all forms of Indian \ngaming. And I think it is important that I repeat that--all forms of \nIndian gaming. Authority to regulate Indian gaming was given by \nCongress to the National Indian Gaming Regulatory Commission.\n  I believe the Kyl bill ignores this procedure and IGRA. I do not \nbelieve we can ignore that as a Congress. The Kyl bill does this in a \nnumber of ways, including placing new restrictions on tribal gaming \noperations, and overrides and nullifies existing State-tribal compacts.\n  My amendment simply sets the issue of Indian gaming aside as it \npertains to that. But it recognizes, as I think we all should, that \nIndian gaming via the Internet ought to be regulated and it ought to be \ncontrolled. And that is exactly what is happening today.\n  So I hope that for any of my colleagues who might be listening this\n\n[[Page S8775]]\n\nlate into the evening, that we could revisit this for a short time \ntomorrow, because the Internet Gaming Prohibition Act by Senator Kyl \ngoes in and amends section 1084 of the Federal Wire Act to include \nlotteries. It is excluded there today. Decisions have been rendered on \nbehalf of Indians as it relates to this in Federal courts. We think \nthis is the appropriate decision, and it exempts them currently. And \nthey are regulated now.\n  This is not an unregulated activity that I advocate by this \namendment. It is a fully regulated activity under Federal law, under \nthe Indian gaming laws as controlled by the National Indian Gaming \nCommission. That is the appropriate intent of this amendment.\n  I retain the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield from the time 1 minute.\n  I wish that I had 1 hour. This could be the most important thing we \ndebate in this session of Congress. Yes, there is Indian gambling. Yes, \nthere is some limited gambling on the Internet. The wording in this \namendment can change the national flow. This can provide for a national \nlottery by an Internet monopoly--an Internet monopoly. This could \neliminate the grocery store sales in each person's State that allows a \nlottery at the present time, because it would be much easier to pick it \nup on the Internet.\n  There is a good reason why gambling is limited to on premises for the \nmost part. That is so you can enforce the age requirements. That is so \nyou can check on the different kinds of gaming that there are, so you \ncan check on the dollar limits that there are, so you can audit the \nprocess. The Internet is not something you can audit. This will not be \na protection for any of the States.\n  Some of our States have had a referendum on whether we want any kind \nof local gambling, whether we want any kind of State gambling. And it \nhas lost 2 to 1. We do not want gambling in Wyoming. But there is no \nprotection against gambling in Wyoming. There is no protection on age \nin Wyoming. So kids can take parents' credit cards, get into this \nnational lottery and violate State law.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I want to make very clear what is at issue \nhere. If you oppose kids gambling on the Internet, then you are with \nSenator Kyl and the Senator from Nevada. We think that is a disastrous \npolicy for American families. Your 10-year-old child can dial up a site \non the web and gamble without you knowing it and without any ability to \ncontrol it. So the Kyl-Bryan amendment opposes Internet gambling in \nAmerica for everyone.\n  Now, if that policy makes sense to you, and I think it makes sense \nfor American families, then you have to oppose the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Idaho who says, in effect, Internet gambling should be \nprohibited for everyone except Indian tribes.\n  Now, what logic is that that a child in Utah, which is prohibited \nfrom all forms of gaming, would be able to surf the web, access the \nIndian gaming site in Idaho, and be able to participate over the \nInternet. That makes no sense at all. I think most families, if they \nwere tuned into the debate tonight, would say Kyl and Bryan are \ncorrect, we don't want our kids on the Internet, and we believe it \nought to be prohibited.\n  Senator Craig's amendment would emasculate that by saying the Indian \ntribes have an exception. No compact in America, none entered into by \nany Governor, any State or Indian tribe, authorizes Internet gambling. \nNone. And no court in America, State or Federal, has ever held that \nIndian tribes are entitled to gamble on the Internet at such web sites.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, a few moments ago you talked about this \ndestroying lottery systems. The national Indian lottery is up and \noperating today, and State lotteries are not falling by the wayside. In \nfact, they are stronger than ever in their level of participation. They \nare as tightly regulated as is this national lottery. That is the \nreality with which we talk about this, tightly regulated control.\n  Do I advocate 10-year-olds using this? I do not, and they cannot. \nThere is a screening process. They would be in violation of it. They \nwould have to go through all of the procedures of an adult. Yes, I \nguess if they stole their parent's credit card in the first instance it \nmight work; in the second, it would not. Any winnings would be repealed \nand they might be in violation of the law.\n  So you can talk about scare tactics, if you will. The reality is we \nhave a national Indian lottery today that is deemed legal on the \nInternet. The amendment by Senator Kyl attempts to make it illegal. \nThat is the reality with which we are dealing. I suggest that any \neffort to talk about great fears and scare tactics just doesn't fit \nbecause it is tightly, tightly controlled.\n  What the Senator from Arizona talks about, about offshore, I agree \nwith an unlimited approach in an unregulated way. That is what is \nimportant. That is what my amendment does. We should allow Indian \ngaming to be regulated under Federal law as it currently is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me respond, then, to my friend from \nIdaho. First, let me begin by saying that the Presiding Officer, when \nhe spoke a few minutes ago, I think hit the nail right on the head. The \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from Wyoming, pointed out that it didn't \nreally matter who conducts the activity on the Internet. Whether it is \nan Indian tribe or an offshore virtual casino, the result is the same \nfor the people of the State which has established the public policy of \nprotecting its people from such activity. You can't do it. You can't \nprotect your citizens.\n  The State of Wyoming has made that decision, and yet if the Indians \nwere allowed an exemption under this bill, they would be permitted to \nrun Internet gambling operations, they could reach every citizen in \nevery State and every young person in every State, as the Presiding \nOfficer pointed out.\n  No one is allowed to do that today. No one would be allowed to do \nthat under the legislation, but under the Craig amendment, a special \nexception would be made for the Indians. The Senator from Idaho argues \nthat it is legal for the tribes to do that. In this he is simply wrong.\n  Again, let me quote from a letter from all 50 attorneys general, \nincluding the attorney general of Idaho, on this exact point. They are \nwriting to the National Indian Gaming Commission.\n\n       We are writing to you to express our strong opposition to \n     and legal analysis regarding the use of the Internet for the \n     purpose of engaging in gaming activity allegedly under the \n     Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1998. The undersigned have \n     concluded that such gaming is not authorized by IGRA. [One of \n     the reasons, I might say, contained in the next sentence] As \n     you know, under IGRA, gaming activity is allowed only on \n     Indian lands.\n\n  This goes beyond that. It goes to any State, into any home, to be \nused by any child who might log on to the Internet. All the people I \nquoted before who testified before the Judiciary Committee said this is \na pernicious activity for young people who get into the Internet and \nbegin gambling. It could become the most addictive way for children \nand, later, adults to become addicted to gambling.\n  As a result, it is an activity that needs to be stopped before it is \nallowed to spread. What we should not do is create an exception just \nfor the Indian tribes, because, in effect, that is an exception that \nprecludes us from protecting our children. I urge, tomorrow, that we \ndefeat the Craig amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/22/senate-section/article/S8689-5", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8775-S8776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute has \nreported that for the week ending July 17 that the U.S. imported \n8,750,000 barrels of oil each day, 605,000 barrels a day more than the \n8,145,000 imported during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 58.1 percent of their needs last \nweek. There are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before the \nPersian Gulf War, the United States imported about 45 percent of its \noil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the \n1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of America s oil \nsupply.\n  All Americans should ponder the economic calamity certain to occur in \nthe U.S. if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double \nthe already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the U.S.: now \n8,750,000 barrels a day at a cost of approximately $98,875,000 a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/22/senate-section/article/S8776-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8776-S8777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LOBBING ONE MORE GRENADE AT MICROSOFT\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwill hold yet another hearing designed solely to lob one more grenade \nat Microsoft. It is entitled ``Competition and Innovation in the \nDigital Age: Beyond the Browser Wars.''\n  Just as I have said of the Justice Department's case against \nMicrosoft, the Judiciary Committee's efforts to paint Microsoft in a \nnegative light seems to be merely an attempt to give software companies \nthat cannot compete against Microsoft on their own merits an \nopportunity to catch up. It is this practice, the practice of using the \nUnited States Senate and the Department of Justice as a means to help \nless successful companies compete against Microsoft, that is unfair--\nnot Microsoft's business practices.\n  As all of my colleagues will remember, the Committee held a similar \nhearing only a few months ago. At that hearing in March, Microsoft's \nCEO, Bill Gates, patiently answered questions from committee members \nand witnesses representing his competitors for four hours. The \nquestioning focused primarily on whether Microsoft has the right to \nintegrate new and innovative products into its Windows operating \nsystem--specifically, Microsoft's Internet Explorer.\n  This is precisely that issue that a gaggle of lawyers over at the \nJustice Department's Antitrust Division and a dozen state attorneys \ngeneral are currently litigating. The DOJ and state attorneys general \nallege that Microsoft, in including its browser software in Windows 98, \nis in violation of U.S. antitrust laws.\n  Only a few weeks after this case was filed, Microsoft won a major \ncourt victory in a related battle. On June 23, a three judge United \nStates Circuit Court of Appeals panel overturned the preliminary \ninjunction issued against Microsoft last December by U.S. District \nCourt Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. In my opinion, this ruling is so \nsignificant as to make the Department of Justice's current case against \nMicrosoft even more questionable than it was at the time of filing.\n  The question before the panel was whether Microsoft violated \nantitrust law and a 1995 consent decree by integrating its web browser \ninto Windows 95. The panel ruled that Microsoft's actions did not \nviolate the consent decree and that Microsoft should indeed be allowed \nto integrate new and improved features into Windows. Such integration, \nthe judges ruled, benefits consumers.\n  The judges went on to warn that the government is ill-suited to make \ntechnological determinations and that the dangers of doing so far \noutweigh the potential benefits that ``antitrust scholars have long \nrecognized the undesirability of having courts oversee product design, \nand any dampening of technological innovation would be at cross-purpose \nwith antitrust law.''\n  The Judiciary Committee's hearing will apparently focus on issues \nother than the integration of browser software into Windows 98. The \nwitnesses will instead give testimony, among other subjects, alleging \nthat Microsoft competes unfairly in the server operating system \nmarket--a market in which Microsoft is one of many competitors and in \nwhich no one company is dominant. No monopoly here--what's the beef?\n  The network server market includes competitors such as IBM, Sun \nMicrosystems, Novell, Microsoft and several others. Many of these \ncompanies have chosen strategic business models in which they sell \ntheir customers not only the software that runs network servers, but \nsometimes the servers themselves, the applications that run on the \nservers, and even the workstations that sit on employees' desks. In \nsuch models, every piece of hardware and software is designed to work \ntogether, and as long as customers use only that one company's \nproducts, everything works fine.\n\n  Sales volumes in the network server market are fairly low but profit \nmargins are high. Once a customer decides to buy a one-company network, \nhe tends to stick with that system because the cost of switching to \nsomething else is quite high. Thus, this business model is a good one \nthat can make, and has made, some companies very successful.\n  Microsoft has chosen a different business model for the network \nserver market. It's model is not unfair, illegal, or anti-competitive. \nIt is merely a different way of doing business. Microsoft doesn't make \nhardware or enterprise applications that run on servers. It does not \nmake the workstation computers that sit on employees' desks. Microsoft \nmakes network operating system called Windows NT. For a customer to use \nWindows NT on its server, it does not need to buy anything else from \nMicrosoft. NT is designed to work with any manufacturer's hardware and \nsupport any company's software. It is a high volume, low profit margin \nmodel.\n  It is certainly not difficult to understand why companies like \nNovell, Sun, and IBM might be concerned about competition in the server \nmarket. After all, they have been in this market for a long time and \nhave done very well in it. Because the margins on their sales are high, \nlost sales are more damaging to them than they are to their competitors \nwhose margins on each sale are much lower. But if Sun, IBM, and Novell \ncontinue to respond to the needs of their customers, they will continue \nto do well in the server market.\n  Just as the appeals panel ruled last month on the browser issue, the \ndecision on whether the business model chosen by Sun, IBM, and Novell \nor that chosen by Microsoft is a decision best made by the free market \nand the free market alone. The Department of Justice and the Senate \nJudiciary Committee have no legitimate role to play in this \ndetermination.\n  Let me make it clear, Mr. President, that throughout this attack, \nMicrosoft has gone out of its way to cooperate both with the Committee \nand with the Justice Department. Even while its reputation is being \ntarnished by these two organizations, Microsoft has provided them both \nwith everything it has been asked to provide and more.\n  So, I admonish my friend and colleague Senator Hatch to reciprocate. \nGiven the list of witnesses scheduled to testify, however, I am afraid \nthat the deck is already stacked against Microsoft. That is precisely \nwhy I advised\n\n[[Page S8777]]\n\nBill Gates to decline an invitation from the Committee to appear at the \nhearing. Once is enough, Mr. President. The Committee can drag Mr. \nGates and his company through the mud if it so choose, but Mr. Gates \ndoes not have to be there to validate a travesty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/22/senate-section/article/S8776-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DENVER-LONDON DIRECT FLIGHT HOLDUP\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am here today to tell my colleagues \nabout an issue of great importance to the people of my state of \nColorado. This summer, the state of Colorado has lost an estimated $23 \nmillion, at least, due to the problem I am here to address. We have \nbeen assured again and again by the Administration that the situation \nwould soon be resolved. I no longer have faith in that assurance, and I \nbelieve that I am going to have to make my point stronger and louder in \norder to secure fair treatment for the State of Colorado. I am \ndisappointed that the problem has lingered for this long, and that my \nattempts to cooperate with the Department of Transportation have been \nmet with apathy and diluted efforts.\n  This is a problem that I have been working on for months, and I am \ncontinually and increasingly frustrated by the lack of concern shown by \nthe Administration. I was first made aware in April of this year that \nan application for international service into Denver International \nAirport was near approval. A foreign airline filed an application with \nthe Department of Transportation to provide direct service between \nDenver and London. This flight was to be the first overseas flight at \nDenver's young international airport. British Airways wants to provide \nthis service, and to date is the only airline that has applied to do \nso. Of course the prospect of a direct flight to Europe is exciting for \nthe people of Colorado; our booming economy, growing business sector, \nand tourism industry are primed for this direct international service.\n  The application process under the bilateral Air Transport Services \nagreement between the United States and the United Kingdom is designed \nto be a routine step. By law, final review by the United States of the \nBritish Airways flight is intended only to assure compliance with \ntechnical requirements for air safety and ownership.\n  At some point in the review process, the Department decided to hold \nthe British Airways flight hostage to influence an unrelated situation. \nAn American airline had approval to provide service between Charlotte, \nNorth Carolina and London, but being a new entrant into the market, \nchoice slots were not available for their service. That airline, US \nAirways, and the Department of Transportation demanded that British \nAirways relinquish its established slots into London's Gatwick Airport \nbefore the Denver-London service would be approved.\n  The Senior Senator from Colorado, Senator Campbell, and I met with \nSecretary Slater. We offered our assistance and shared our concerns, \nand the Secretary assured us that the situation would be resolved soon. \nSubsequently, US Airways participated in an international slot \nconference, and legitimately negotiated more desirable slots at \nGatwick. The original conditions for approval of Denver-London service \nwere met. Still, the Department refused to approve the British Airways \napplication.\n  My patience in this matter has not been respected. Frankly, the \nexpanding complaints of US Airways have absolutely no connection to the \npending Denver-London service, and Department is inappropriately using \nthe people of Colorado. I do not approve of the Department leveraging \nthe concerns of one state against another, or using our international \nflights as a bargaining chip in an unrelated matter.\n  This is the first time the Department has withheld final approval on \na US/UK flight to influence the status of another flight. The precedent \nbeing set indicates bureaucratic abuse and blatant disregard for a fair \nresolution of Colorado's problem. The Department should focus on the \ninternational flights between London and Charlotte; there is no need to \npush Coloradans around while the Administration and US Airways are \nengaged in an unrelated fight.\n  It is reasonable to think that this service would easily win support \nfrom the Transportation Secretary. British Airways has a clear right to \noperate this service under the term of the UK/US Air Services \nAgreement. In addition, Secretary Slater is attempting to negotiate an \nopen skies aviation agreement with Britain. In light of this fact \nalone, failure to approve the Denver-London route is ridiculous. After \nthis episode with the Denver flight, does the Administration really \nbelieve that the British authorities will have faith in the ability of \nthe United States to be forthright in international flight \nnegotiations?\n  The issue of approving Denver-London service was postponed recently \nwhen the Secretary and several of his top staffers traveled to Africa. \nPatiently awaiting his return, I came across a story on the AP wire \nabout the Secretary's activities in Africa. I was stunned to see the \nstory that began, and I quote, ``Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater \nFriday called on European authorities to respect aviation agreements \nnegotiated by the United States with individual countries.'' It is \nironic that the Secretary lectured Europe on fulfilling its obligations \nunder air service pacts when he will not honor the current US/UK pact \nand approve Denver-London service. How the Secretary could make these \ncomments while keeping a straight face is beyond me.\n  Speaking of that trip, I would like to know why the Secretary has \nbeen able to find so little time to deal with this pressing issue. When \nI last spoke to Mr. Slater on the phone, he told me that he was working \nto resolve the issue in the next few days. I expected his call at the \nend of that week and hoped to learn that they had approved service. It \nwas the week before our July recess, and the call never came. After \nwaiting for another week and investigating the delay, I learned that \nthe Secretary was traveling to Africa for the second time this year, \nand that Colorado's problems would have to wait until July 15. While he \nsimply set the issue aside, I could not. Unfortunately, neither myself \nnor my staff could reach the Secretary or his top aides on this issue \nbecause they were all traveling and unavailable. I am concerned that \nthe Secretary and Assistant Secretaries have so much time for traveling \nand so little time for important issues here at home. I am outraged to \nknow that my constituents' tax dollars, and mine as well, are buying \nflights to Africa while the state is losing money because of the \nDepartment's inaction. There is absolutely no reason that the Secretary \ncould not have approved Denver-London service before he and his staff \nleft for Africa. Now, after being assured that this would be his top \npriority upon returning from his trip, I am astounded that Mr. Slater \nis not prepared to be straightforward and make this decision.\n  Several Colorado officials have told Secretary Slater, in no \nuncertain terms, that this is an important issue to Colorado. I watched \nthe original start date for British Airways service move from June \nFirst to August First, and saw it again postponed to September First. \nThe Secretary knew very well that the service had to be approved by the \nend of last week for the airline to be prepared to begin on that date. \nFailure to approve the flight has resulted in moving the start date to \nOctober first. Colorado has already lost four months of direct Denver-\nLondon service, and the reasons that the Department has provided for \nthis delay are inadequate. I am through standing by while the \nDepartment is delinquent on its approval of Denver-London direct air \nservice. I am prepared to consider using any means available to me to \nhasten a decision by the Department.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/22/senate-section/article/S8777-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8777-S8778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      Executive Messages Referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S8778]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/22/senate-section/article/S8777-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8777-S8778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      Executive Messages Referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S8778]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/22/senate-section/article/S8777-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nREPORT CONCERNING ABATEMENT OF INTEREST ON UNDER-PAYMENTS BY TAXPAYERS \nIN PRESIDENTIALLY DECLARED DISASTER AREAS--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--\n                                 PM 147\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on the Budget.\n\n     To the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to section 3309(c) of the Internal Revenue Service \nRestructuring and Reform Act of 1998, I hereby designate the provisions \nof subsections (a) and (b) of section 3309 of such Act as an emergency \nrequirement pursuant to section 252(e) of the Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.\n                                                   William J.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of qualified acupuncturist services under part B \nof the medicare program, and to amend title 5, United States Code, to \nprovide for coverage of such services under the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         The Patient Access to Acupuncture Services Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nPatient Access to Acupuncture Services Act of 1998, to provide limited \ncoverage for acupuncture under Medicare and the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits Program. This is an important bill that reflects an \nappropriate and needed response to both progress in science, and to the \ndemand for complementary and alternative treatments of pain and \nillness.\n\n  I would like to acknowledge Senator Mikulski, who is cosponsoring \nthis bill with me. Senator Mikulski has been a strong supporter of \neffective alternative therapies and has long realized and appreciated \nthe importance and significance of such therapies to our health care \nsystem.\n  Mr. President, approximately 90 million Americans suffer from chronic \nillnesses, which, each year, cost society roughly $659 billion in \nhealth care expenditures, lost productivity and premature death. \nDespite the high costs of this care, studies published in the Journal \nof the American Medical Association reveal that the health care \ndelivery system is not meeting the needs of the chronically ill in the \nUnited States.\n  Many of these Americans are looking desperately for effective, less \ncostly alternative therapies to relieve the debilitating pain they \nsuffer. In 1990 alone, Americans spent nearly $14 billion out-of-pocket \non alternative therapies. Harvard University researchers have found \nthat fully one-third of Americans regularly use complementary and \nalternative medicine, making an estimated 425 million visits to \ncomplementary and alternative practitioners of these therapies--\nsurpassing those made to conventional primary care practitioners!\n  And with good reason. Last November, a consensus conference of the \nNational Institutes of Health approved the use of acupuncture in \nstandard U.S. medical care. It was the first time that the NIH had \nendorsed as effective a major alternative therapy, and it was just the \ntype of medical breakthrough that I had hoped for and envisioned when I \nworked to establish the Office of Alternative Medicine at NIH.\n  The NIH experts cited data showing that acupuncture can effectively \nrelieve certain conditions, such as nausea, vomiting and pain, and \nshows promise in treating chronic conditions such as lower back pain, \nsubstance addictions, osteoarthritis and asthma.\n  In 1993, the FDA reported that Americans spent $500 million for up to \n12 million acupuncture visits. In 1996, after reviewing the science, \nthe FDA removed acupuncture needles from the category of ``experimental \nmedical devices'' and now regulates them just as it does other devices, \nsuch as surgical scalpels and hypodermic syringes. Acupuncture is \neffectively used by practitioners around the world. The World Health \nOrganization has approved its use to treat a variety of medical \nconditions, including pulmonary problems and rehabilitation from \nneurological damage.\n  It has been reported that more than 1 million Americans currently \nreceive acupuncture each year. Access to qualified acupuncture \nprofessionals for appropriate conditions should be ensured. Including \nthis important therapy under Medicare and FEHBP coverage will promote a \nprogressive health system that integrates treatment from both \nacupuncturists and physicians. It will expand patient care options. I \nalso believe it will reduce health care costs because of the relatively \nlow cost of acupuncture compared to conventional pain management \ntherapies.\n  Research is still needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of other \nalternative therapies. This research is vitally important, but we must \nact now to help the millions Americans who can benefit from the \nknowledge we have already gained.\n  The 21st century is just around the corner. Less than 50 years ago, \ntreatments that are now considered conventional--organ transplants, \nnitroglycerin for heart patients, immunology, and x-ray and laser \ntechnology--were decried as quackery by the medical establishment. \nEveryday we face new biological and emotional challenges for which \nmodern Western medicine has no remedy. Now science is revealing the \neffectiveness of many complementary and alternative treatments, \nincluding acupuncture, and increasingly more Americans are choosing \nthem to manage their health and treat their illness.\n  Let us listen to the science, and heed the urgent need for progress. \nMr. President, the nation's leading scientists have demonstrated the \nsafety and effectiveness of acupuncture as a treatment for a wide range \nof pain and illness.

Mr. President, today I join my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Harkin, in introducing a bill to allow for coverage \nof acupuncture services under Part B of Medicare and the Federal \nEmployee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). I am proud to be the lead \ncosponsor of this legislation.\n  I like this bill for three reasons: it gives patients access to \naffordable, quality health care; it offers patients choice of \ntreatment; and it lets patients decide what treatment works for them.\n  Some years ago I had some very severe illnesses. Western medicine was \nof limited utility for me and I turned to acupuncture. Acupuncture \nhelped me get well and has helped me stay well. Time after time, \nconstituents have confirmed what I already know about acupuncture--it \nis an effective treatment for a number of conditions.\n  Last November, the Western medical establishment formally endorsed \nwhat American consumers have been saying for a long time. The National \nInstitutes of Health convened a federal panel of experts in medicine, \nanthropology, biostatistics, epidemiology and other scientific \ndisciplines to discuss the validity of acupuncture as an effective \ntreatment option. The panel concluded that there is clear evidence that \nacupuncture is an effective treatment for certain kinds of pain and \nnausea and may be effective for other conditions. Equally important, \nacupuncture has fewer side effects and is less invasive than many \n``traditional'' medical practices. The panel decided that, given its \ngood safety profile and the fact that it is often less expensive than \nconventional medicine, it's time to take acupuncture seriously.\n  I think it's time that the federal government take it seriously, too. \nThe time has come for Medicare and FEHBP to cover acupuncture for \nAmerican patients who seek this treatment option. I urge the Senate to \napprove this legislation to allow American patients to choose this less \ninvasive, less costly, and effective treatment option. I applaud \nSenator Harkin for taking the lead on this important effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Faircloth, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bond, Mr. Helms, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Allard, Mr. Frist, Mr. Mack, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Hatch, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 2341. A bill to support enhanced drug interdiction efforts in the \nmajor transit countries and support a comprehensive supply eradication \nand crop substitution program in source countries; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations\n\n\n                Western hemisphere drug elimination act\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation proposing a new and comprehensive strategy to deal with one \nof the central challenges facing America's young people--the plague of \nillegal drugs.\n  Recently, President Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich unveiled \nthe latest investment in our war against illegal drug use: a $2 \nbillion-dollar advertising campaign to send our children a hard-hitting \nmessage about the life-destroying dangers of drugs.\n  Anti-drug ad campaigns like this one are important. But we should \nremember that the creative minds on Madison Avenue are not our best or \nonly weapon to get people off drugs. History has proven that a \nsuccessful anti-drug strategy is balanced and comprehensive in three \nkey areas: demand reduction (such as education and treatment); domestic \nlaw enforcement; and international supply reduction.\n  Today, though, we are on the wrong side of history. Our overall drug \nstrategy is neither balanced nor comprehensive. That's because \nWashington has not done its part. It has not carried out its sole \nresponsibility--to reduce the illegal drug imports, either by working \nwith foreign governments, or by seizing drugs or disrupting drug \ntrafficking routes outside our borders.\n  That is why, today, I rise to introduce this legislation. It is a \nbill that will fix our current drug strategy deficit. I, along with \nSenators Coverdell, Graham and 11 other Senators will introduce the \n``Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act''--a bill to support enhanced \ndrug interdiction efforts in the major transit countries, and support a \ncomprehensive supply eradication and crop substitution program in \nsource countries.\n  Mr. President, this is a $2.6 billion authorization initiative over \nthree years for enhanced international eradication, interdiction and \ncrop substitution efforts. Let me mention a few highlights of what this \nbill would accomplish, very specifically.\n  It would improve our aircraft, maritime and radar coverage of both \ndrug-source and drug-transit countries. It would do this by (1) \nauthorizing funds for construction, operation and maintenance of \nadditional U.S. Customs/Defense aircraft, Coast Guard cutters and \npatrol vessels, and Customs/Coast Guard ``go-fast'' boats for drug \ninterdiction efforts; (2) authorizing funds to establish an airbase to \nsupport counter-narcotics operations in the Southern Caribbean, \nNorthern South America, and the Eastern Pacific; and (3) \nauthorizing funds to the Department of Defense to restore, operate, and \nmaintain critical radar coverage in these regions.\n\n  It would enhance drug-eradication and interdiction efforts in source \ncountries--by authorizing funds to the Departments of State and Defense \nto provide necessary resources, equipment, training and other \nassistance needed for the support of eradication and interdiction \nprograms in Bolivia, Colombia, Peru and Mexico.\n  It would enhance the development of alternative crops in drug-source \ncountries, by authorizing funds to the United States Agency for \nInternational Development to support alternative development programs \ndesigned to encourage farmers to substitute for narcotic producing \ncrops in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.\n  It would support international law enforcement training--by (1) \nestablishing three separate international law enforcement academies \noperated by the Department of Justice, to provide training assistance \nin Latin America, Asia, and Africa; (2) establishing a training center \nfor maritime law enforcement instruction, including customs-related \nports management; and (3) authorizing funds for the promotion of law \nenforcement training and support for Caribbean, Central American and \nSouth American countries.\n  It would enhance law enforcement interdiction operations by \nauthorizing funding to the Drug Enforcement Administration, U.S. Coast \nGuard, and Department of Defense for the support of counter-narcotics \noperations and equipment in drug transit and source countries.\n  Mr. President, as you can see, this is a very targeted and specific \ninvestment. And it is necessary. The budget numbers tell an alarming--\nundeniable--story: In 1987, the federal government's drug control \nbudget of $4.79 billion was divided as follows: 29% for demand \nreduction programs; 38% for domestic law enforcement; and 33% for \ninternational supply reduction. This\n\n[[Page S8781]]\n\nfunding breakdown was the norm during the Reagan and Bush \nAdministrations' war on drugs, from 1985-92.\n  During that time, drug interdiction was serious business. President \nBush even tasked the Defense Department to engage in the detection and \nmonitoring of drugs in transit to the U.S. As a member of the House of \nRepresentatives at that time, I can recall very well the major \ncommitment we made to reduce the amount of drugs going into the U.S.\n  After President Clinton took office in 1993, his administration \nimmediately pursued policies that upset the careful balance in drug \nfunding. For example, in 1995, the federal drug control budget of $13.3 \nbillion was divided as follows: 35% was allocated for demand reduction \nprograms; 53% for domestic law enforcement, and 12% for international \nsupply reduction. Think of it--only 12% of our drug control budget was \ndedicated to stop drugs from coming to our country--down from 33% in \n1987. Though the overall drug budget increased threefold from 1987 to \n1995, the piece of the drug budget pie allocated for international and \ninterdiction efforts had decreased.\n\n  Key components of our drug interdiction strategy were slashed. For \nexample, Coast Guard funding for counter-narcotics fell 32% from 1992 \nto 1995. Not surprisingly, Coast Guard drug seizures dropped from \n90,335 lbs in 1991 to 28,585 lbs in 1996. In addition, interdiction no \nlonger remains a priority within the Department of Defense, which \ncurrently ranks counter narcotics dead last in importance in its Global \nMilitary Force Policy.\n  What were the results of these two clearly different approaches? The \nReagan-Bush approach achieved real success. From 1988 to 1991, total \ndrug use was down 13 percent. Cocaine use dropped by 35 percent. \nMarijuana use was reduced by 16 percent.\n  In contrast, under the Clinton approach, since 1992 overall drug use \namong teens aged 12 to 17 rose by 70 percent. Drug-abuse related \narrests more than doubled for minors between 1992 and 1996. Since 1992, \nthere has been an overall 80 percent increase in illicit drug use among \ngraduating high school seniors. Further, in 1995 number of heroin \nrelated emergency room admissions jumped 58% since 1992. And in the \nfirst half of 1995, methamphetamine related emergency room admissions \nwere 321% higher compared to the first half of 1991.\n  The price of drugs also decreased during this time period. For \ninstance, the price of a pure heroin gram in 1992 was $1,647--and in \nFebruary 1996 it was only $966 per gram.\n  These negative effects have sent shockwaves throughout our \ncommunities and our homes.\n  The rise of drug use is not at all surprising. With the Clinton \nadministration's decline in emphasis on drug interdiction, it has \nbecome easier to bring drugs into the U.S. This makes drugs more \navailable and more affordable. The Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy reported that small ``pieces'' or ``rocks'' of crack, which once \nsold for ten to twenty dollars, are now available for three to five \ndollars.\n  No question, continued investments to deal with the ``demand side'' \nof the drug situation are necessary. We have to find ways to persuade \nAmericans, particularly young people, that doing drugs is wrong--that \nit destroys lives, families, schools and communities. As long as there \nis a demand for drugs, education and treatment remain essential long-\nterm components of our anti-drug efforts.\n\n  Casual drug users also are influenced by price, which is why a \nbalanced anti-drug strategy includes fighting drugs beyond our borders. \nThe drug lords in South America are well aware that the U.S. is no \nlonger pursuing a tough interdiction strategy. I have seen Coast Guard \noperations first hand, and while the Coast Guard and other agencies can \ndetect and monitor drug trafficking operations, they usually stand by \nhelpless because they lack necessary equipment to turn detection into \nseizures and arrests. Of the total drug air events in the Bahamas from \nApril 1997 to April 1998, there was only an 8% success rate in stopping \ndrug air flights that have been detected. That means over 92% got away. \nWithout doubt, the drug lords can get a larger flow of drugs into the \nU.S.\n  With additional resources, we can make it more difficult to import \nillegal narcotics, and drive up the cost for the drug cartels to engage \nin this illicit and immoral practice. Interdiction drives up the \nprice--and drives down the purity--of cocaine on the street. Also, \nseizing or destroying a ton of cocaine outside our borders is more cost \neffective than trying to seize the same quantity of drugs at the point \nof sale.\n  Mr. President, that is why I think that this bill is absolutely \nessential. The bill can get us back on the right track. I want to take \nthis opportunity to acknowledge Representative Bill McCollum's tireless \nefforts and dedication to this initiative. He has shown tremendous \nleadership on anti-drug efforts.\n  Mr. President, it is time to reverse the current administration's \npolicy and get right with history. It is time we returned to a \ncomprehensive, balanced drug control strategy that will put us back on \na course toward ridding our schools and communities of illegal and \ndestructive drugs. The evidence clearly shows that with a balanced \nstrategy, we were making great progress. We significantly reduced drug \nuse. For the sake of our children, it is time for us to embrace the \nlessons of history, and stop trying to escape them.\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator DeWine \nand my other colleagues in introducing the Western Hemisphere Drug \nElimination Act of 1998. This bill will provide an additional $2.6 \nbillion over a 3-year period to implement a more comprehensive \neradication, interdiction, and crop substitution strategy for our \nnation's counter-drug efforts.\n  The bill will help the United States meet its goal of reducing the \nflow of cocaine and heroin into the U.S. by 80 percent in three years \nby combining a reduction in availability with demand reduction efforts. \nThis is accomplished by providing more funding to those doing the heavy \nlifting in this fight--the Coast Guard, the Customs Service, the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, and the Department of Defense.\n  The U.S. needs to focus its resources in a comprehensive way to \nprotect the entire southern frontier of the United States from San \nDiego to San Juan. Previously, resources were shifted from one part of \nthe country to another, alternating between those states along the \nSouthwest border and the Caribbean. This created ``gates'' where drug \nsmugglers could move their product without fear of U.S. interdiction. \nThis bill will provide the necessary resources to eliminate the chinks \nfrom the anti-drug fence, so that we do not have to choose between \nstopping drug smuggling in one area of the country or another.\n  On June 22 of this year, I chaired a field hearing in Miami on behalf \nof the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control. The purpose \nwas to examine the flow of drugs into the United States through the \nCaribbean into Florida. I wanted to gain a clearer picture of the \ncurrent patterns of narcotics trafficking from the Southwest border \nback to the Caribbean and South Florida, obtain a better understanding \nfor what the United States needs to do to increase our anti-drug \neffectiveness, and improve our efforts to stem this flow which \nthreatens our youth. We held the hearing on the deck of a U.S. Coast \nGuard Medium Endurance Cutter named the Valiant, which had just \nreturned from a seven week counter-narcotics patrol in the Caribbean.\n  We selected the Coast Guard venue to underscore a number of very \nimportant realities in the United States' current strategy to fight the \ndrug war. One of our principal interdiction forces--the United States \nCoast Guard--is conducting its mission on vessels such as the Valiant, \na ship that is more than 30 years old, with an equally antiquated \nsurface search radar. The Coast Guard needs new ships and newer radars. \nAs I approached the Valiant, I noticed that there were a number of \nweapons systems on board, including two .50 caliber machine guns and a \n25mm chain gun. These weapons reminded me that this effort is indeed a \nwar. Despite the words of some officials who prefer not to characterize \nthe effort as such, it is indeed. We are fighting a well-organized, \nwell-financed, and doggedly determined enemy whose objective is to \ninundate our nation with a chemical weapon that demeans, degrades, and \ndefeats the most precious asset we have--our people. What more do we\n\n[[Page S8782]]\n\nneed to know to energize ourselves to fight back?\n  The individuals who testified at the field hearing painted a very \ndisturbing picture. Consider the following facts:\n  The United States Southern Command cannot maintain adequate radar and \nairborne early warning coverage of the region or sustain the right \nnumber of tracker aircraft to perform its mission to provide counter-\ndrug support to states in South America and the Caribbean.\n  The Joint Interagency Task Force East, located in Key West, Florida, \ndoes not know the extent of drug smuggling in the Eastern Pacific \nbecause the Department of Defense has not provided the necessary assets \nto conduct its Detection & Monitoring mission.\n  The Coast Guard had to end a very successful counter-narcotics \noperation in the Caribbean, OPERATION FRONTIER LANCE, because of a lack \nof funding.\n  The United States Customs Service is limited in its ability to \ncapture drug runners in go-fast boats because of a lack of funds to \nprocure newer and faster boats, as well as a lack of personnel to \nadequately maintain those go-fast boats currently in service due to \nlack of funding.\n  The Drug Enforcement Administration lacks sufficient special agents \nin the Caribbean, as well as accompanying administrative and \nintelligence personnel, because the DEA does not have sufficient funds \nto hire and retain these individuals.\n  The South Florida High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area--responsible \nfor coordinating and integrating federal, state, and local law \nenforcement agencies' counter-drug efforts--is constrained in its \nability to conduct investigations by paying overtime salaries because \nof the lack of funding.\n  If there is a trend underlying all these problems, it is the lack of \nfunds being made available to those agencies responsible for performing \nthe supply reduction component of the drug war. By adding resources to \nthe supply side of the drug war--more planes, helicopters, radars, \npersonnel, and boats--we will eliminate the need to constantly shift \nresources from one area of the country to another. Drug smugglers will \nno longer be able to exploit our weaknesses, such as the lack of Coast \nGuard, Customs, and DEA resources in the Caribbean. South Florida will \nno longer be a gate through which drug smugglers have entry into the \nUnited States.\n  Those responsible for coordinating the national drug control strategy \nsay that reducing our own demand for drugs is tremendously important. I \ncould not agree more. That is why I was an original co-sponsor of the \nDrug Free Communities Act, and why I took steps to create and fund the \nCentral Florida High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. But addressing \nour demand for drugs is only one part of the solution, and that \nreduction will take time. We must take strong steps to interrupt the \nsupply side of the equation as well. And quite frankly, we are not \ndoing as much on the supply side as we should, or as much as we can.\n  I am committed to seeing that more is done, and this legislation goes \na long way towards achieving our goals. By restoring the support we \nprovide to eradication and interdiction, I believe we can make a \ndifference in this war, and the time to make that difference is \nnow.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 2342. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexempt certain facilities from the 3-year transition period under the \nprospective payment system for skilled nursing facilities; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n       the skilled nursing facility payment fairness act of 1998\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation to put more equality into the Medicare payment system for \nskilled nursing facilities (SNFs). The Skilled Nursing Facility Payment \nFairness Act of 1998 will allow certain SNFs--those which will suffer a \nreal cut in Medicare payments--to use a more equitable payment formula \nthat more closely reflects their actual costs.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required HCFA to develop a \nprospective payment system (PPS) for Medicare-covered services provided \nby skilled nursing facilities. Under the PPS, SNFs will be paid a \nsingle federal per diem rate for all routine, ancillary, and capital-\nrelated Part A costs. For SNFs that participated in Medicare before \nOctober 1, 1995, there is a three-year transition period to the PPS. \nDuring this transition period, facilities will be paid a blended rate \nbased on a facility-specific rate and a federal rate. In the first year \nof the transition, the blended rate will be 75% of the facility-\nspecific rate and 25% of the federal rate; in the second year the split \nwill be 50%-50%; and in the third year 25%-75%.\n  For facilities that have had a substantial change in the level of \nservices they provide since 1995, the transitional blended payment rate \nwill have a severe impact. And of those facilities adversely affected, \na significant number are low-utilization SNFs is rural areas. For \nexample, facilities in Montana provide fewer services as measured by \nMedicare patient days than the national average. They are hit in two \nways: first, their utilization levels (length of stay, level of \nacuity), though still low, are higher today than they were in 1995, so \nthe facility-specific rate which is based on 1995 cost reports does not \nreflect today's costs; second, the low-utilization facilities are less \nable to absorb Medicare payment reductions and are more likely to drop \nout of Medicare altogether. As a result, rural communities with few \nproviders may have no post-hospital services. Patients will then have \nto leave their communities to seek services elsewhere or go without \nthese services.\n  The bill I'm introducing today will allow facilities to skip the \ntransition period and go directly to the more equitable federal rate if \n(1) the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that the \nfacility's level of services has changed substantially since 1995, or \n(2) the facility had fewer than 1500 Medicare patient days in its last \ncost reporting period. By receiving payments based on the federal rate, \nwhich is adjusted for case-mix, geographic variations in wages, and \ninflation, facilities will be compensated in an amount closer to their \nactual costs. On the other hand, the facility-specific portion of the \ncurrent blended rate bases costs in part on 1995 expenses, which does \nnot reflect current costs.\n  Rural areas will suffer under the current prospective payment system. \nIn Montana alone, cuts in Medicare payments to skilled nursing \nfacilities are estimated at $5.6 million in the first year of the \nprospective payment system, which began on July 1, 1998. It will result \nin decreased access to care for Medicare patients as fewer services are \noffered and fewer facilities participate in Medicare. This bill \nprovides a straightforward, workable solution and is supported by the \nMontana Health Care Association and the American Health Care \nAssociation. It will correct the unintended negative consequences of \nthe transition to a prospective payment system and restore fairness to \nthe process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 2343. A bill to amend the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act to \nprovide for partial restitution to individuals who worked in uranium \nmines, or transport which provided uranium for the use and benefit of \nthe United States Government, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n            radiation exposure compensation improvement act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks regarding a \nbill I am introducing today, the Radiation Exposure Compensation \nImprovement Act.\n  Mr. President, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act or RECA was \noriginally enacted as a means of compensating thousands of individuals \nwho suffered from exposure to radiation as a result of the federal \ngovernment's nuclear testing program and federal uranium mining \nactivities. While the government can never fully compensate for the \nloss of a life or the reduction in the quality of life, RECA serves as \na cornerstone for the national apology Congress extended in 1990 to the \nvictims of the radiation tragedies. In keeping with the spirit of that \napology, the legislation I introduce today will further correct \nexisting injustices and provide compensation for those whose lives and \nhealth were sacrificed as part of our nation's effort to win the Cold \nWar.\n  In 1990, I was pleased to have been a sponsor of the RECA legislation \nhere in\n\n[[Page S8783]]\n\nthe Senate. I was very optimistic that after years of waiting, some \ndegree of redress would be given to the thousands of miners in my state \nof New Mexico. I chaired the Senate oversight hearing on this issue in \nShiprock, N.M. for the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee in \n1993 and began to hear of changes that were necessary. To that end, I \nworked to facilitate changes in the regulatory and administrative \nareas.\n  Unfortunately, I have heard from many of my constituents that the \nprogram still does not work as intended. I have received compelling \nletters of need from constituents telling me how RECA needs to be \namended. The letters come from widows unable to access the current \ncompensation. Miners and millers tied to oxygen tanks, in respiratory \ndistress or dying from cancer write to tell me how they have been \ndenied compensation under the current act. Family members write of the \npain of fathers who worked in the mills. They recount how their fathers \ncame home covered in the ``yellow cake'' of uranium oxide that was \nfloating in the air of the mills. The story of their father's cancers \nand painful breathing are vivid in these letters and yet the current \nact does not address their needs.\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today will address the issues \nthey raise in their sometimes angry and often tear stained letters. \nTheir points are backed by others as well. In fact, the bill \nincorporates findings by the prestigious Committee on the Biological \nEffects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) which has, since 1990, enlarged \nscientific evidence about radiogenic cancers and the health effects of \nradiation exposures. In other words, because of their good work, \nwe know more now than we did in 1990 and we need to make sure the \ncompensation we provide keeps pace with our medical knowledge.\n\n  Other amendments will, in essence, adopt and incorporate into RECA \nthe recommendations made in October 1995 by the President's Advisory \nCommittee on Human Radiation Experiments. This blue-ribbon committee \ndetermined that U.S. uranium miners were used as subjects of an \nexperiment which had tragic results. It used this language to condemn \nthe ethical outcome of this study:\n\n       The grave injustice that the government did to the uranium \n     miners, by failing to take action to control the hazard and \n     by failing to warn the miners of the hazard, should not be \n     compounded by unreasonable barriers to receiving the \n     compensation the miners deserve for the wrongs and harms \n     inflicted upon them as they served their country.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to cite several of the key provisions in \nthe Radiation Exposure Compensation Improvement Act. Currently RECA \ncovers those exposed to radiation released in underground uranium mines \nthat were providing uranium for the primary use and benefit of the \nnuclear weapons program of the U.S. government. The bill would make all \nuranium workers eligible for compensation including above ground \nminers, millers, and transport workers.\n  RECA currently covers individual termed ``downwinders'' who were in \nthe areas of Nevada, Utah, and Arizona affected by atmospheric nuclear \ntesting in the 1950's. This bill expands the geographical area eligible \nfor compensation to include the Navajo Reservation. In addition, the \nbill expands the compensable diseases for the downwind population by \nadding salivary gland, urinary bladder, brain, colon, and ovarian \ncancers.\n  Currently, the law has disproportionately high levels of radiation \nexposure requirements for miners to qualify for compensation as \ncompared to the ``downwinders.'' My legislation would set a standard of \nproof for uranium workers that is more realistic given the availability \nof mining and mill data. The bill also removes the provision that only \npermits a claim for respiratory disease if the uranium mining occurred \non a reservation. Thus, the bill will allow for further filing of a \nclaim by those miners, millers, and transport workers who did not have \na work history on a reservation. In addition, the bill would change the \ncurrent law so that requirements for written medical documentation is \nupdated to allow for use of high resolution CAT scans and allow for \nwritten diagnoses by physician in either the Department of Veterans \nAffairs or the Indian Health Service to be considered conclusive.\n  In 1990, we joined together in a bipartisan, bicameral effort and \nassured passage of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). Now, \neither years later, I put forward this comprehensive amendment to RECA \nto correct some omissions, make RECA consistent with current medical \nknowledge, and to address what have become administrative horror \nstories for the claimants. I look forward to the debate in the Senate \non this issue and hope that we can move to amend the current statue to \nensure our original intent . . . fair and rapid compensation to those \nwho served so well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the \nRadiation Improvement Compensation Act printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2343\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Agricultural Market Transition Act to \nprovide for the advance payment, in full, of the fiscal year 1999 \npayments otherwise required under production flexibility contracts; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                the emergency farm financial relief act\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the past several years have been \ndevastating for a large number of Georgia farmers. Due to the large \namounts of weather damage and associated agriculture production losses, \nnumerous farmers and agribusinesses are faced with dire financial \nsituations.\n  Farmers from across the state of Georgia are facing their worst crop \ndisaster in many years. Currently, damages are estimated at about $450 \nmillion and rising. The drought in Georgia has already lasted 3 months \nand has caused farmers water supplies to dry up, leaving many without a \nsource of irrigation water. I understand fully that it is not only in \nmy home state where farmers are suffering. It is occuring in many parts \nof the country.\n  To help alleviate farmers' financial difficulties, today I am proud \nto introduce legislation with my esteemed colleagues Majority Leader \nLott, Senator Cochran, Senator Faircloth, Senator Shelby, Senator \nGramm, Senator Lugar and Senator Hutchison, which will help provide \nAmerican farmers with much needed financial relief. The bill--The \nEmergency Farm Financial Relief Act--would allow farmers the option of \nreceiving all of the Agriculture Market Transition Act (AMTA) contract \npayments for FY 1999 immediately after the beginning of the fiscal \nyear. Annual payments can now be made two times a year, in December or \nJanuary and again in September. The legislation we introduce today is a \nSenate companion to House legislation introduced by Representative Bob \nSmith, Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.\n  The bill would make $5.5 billion available much earlier in order to \nhelp farmers cope with the cash shortages they are now experiencing due \nto low prices and poor production. This important initiative leaves the \ndecision to accept early payments or not solely with the farmer. Since \nall of the 1999 AMTA payments occur within the same fiscal year, the \nCongressional Budget Office (CBO) has determined that this proposal \nwould not cost any additional taxpayer funds.\n  While this legislation is not the only answer to helping farmers \nduring their time of economic hardship, it is a much needed overture \nwhich provides farmers with immediate financial relief. Certainly we \nhave other measures to consider, but this is a good first step. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on this proposal \nand urge its speedy consideration.\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise as a co-sponsor of the \nEmergency Farm Financial Relief Act of 1998, which will permit farmers \nto receive their fiscal year 1999 Agriculture Market Transition Act \n(AMTA) payments at the start of the fiscal year in October of 1998 \nrather than the semi-annual payments in December of 1998 and September \nof 1999.\n  This bill thus readies some $5.5 billion to help farmers cope with \ntheir current cash shortage that stems from high debts and low \ncommodity prices.\n  This is a first to address the farm crisis, and it will help some \nfarmers with their cash flow, but there are a lot of other growers in \nrough straits. Therefore, this is just a first step, and we need to \ntake more aggressive steps to open export markets to American \ncommodities.\n  This bill will not solve the farm crisis in North Carolina. In fact, \nbecause we managed to preserve the tobacco and peanut programs in the \n1996 farm bill, the acceleration of AMTA contract payments will be \nlimited, for the most part, to cotton, corn, and wheat growers.\n  The fields of North Carolina, Mr. President, are dry. All the farmers \nare in the same dire situation, and the scope of this bill is limited, \nbut we need to address the tobacco growers.\n  I am concerned that efforts to bring the tobacco program to the \nSenate floor will get torn to shreds, but, certainly, the anti-tobacco \ncrowd needs to rise above politics and realize that this is about farm \nfamilies and family farms.\n  In addition to cash flow assistance, farmers need aggressive \nleadership to boost exports, and President Clinton needs to pay \nattention to farmers and to use the tools we gave him--like the Export \nEnhancement Program--to secure foreign markets for American \nagricultural commodities. Farmers just can't afford this continued \nsilence from President Clinton. Agriculture is our number one export, \nso, clearly, we need the White House to engage on this issue.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I urge my colleagues to join us in \nsupport of the Emergency Farm Financial Relief Act of 1998.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/22/senate-section/article/S8779-2",

Res. 257\n\n       Whereas inhalant abuse is nearing epidemic proportions with \n     over 20 percent of all students admitting to experimenting \n     with inhalants by the time they graduate from high school and \n     only 4 percent of parents suspecting their children of \n     inhalant use;\n       Whereas according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, \n     inhalant use ranks third behind use of alcohol and tobacco \n     for all youths through the eighth grade;\n       Whereas the over 1,000 products that are being inhaled to \n     get high are legal, inexpensive, and found in nearly every \n     home and every corner market;\n       Whereas using inhalants even once can lead to kidney \n     failure, brain damage, and even death;\n       Whereas inhalants are considered a gateway drug, one that \n     leads to the use of harder, more deadly drugs; and\n       Whereas because inhalant use is difficult to detect, the \n     products used are accessible and affordable, and abuse is so \n     common, increased education of young people and their parents \n     regarding the dangers of inhalants is an important step in \n     our battle against drug abuse: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that October 15, 1998, \n     should be designated as ``National Inhalant Abuse Awareness \n     Day'', to be observed with appropriate activities; and\n       (2) the Senate requests that the President issue a \n     proclamation designating October 15, 1998, as ``National \n     Inhalant Abuse Awareness Day''.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/22/senate-section/article/S8787-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8787-S8788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today with 12 of my colleagues, \nincluding our distinguished Majority and Minority Leaders, I submit an \nimportant resolution that affects the health and safety of all of our \nchildren. My resolution would designate October 15th, 1998 as National \nInhalant Abuse Awareness Day.\n  What is inhalant abuse? Many of you may know it as ``sniffing'' \naddiction. At alarmingly high rates, today's young people are using \ncommon household products to get high. In my state of Alaska alone, 22% \nof the high school and 19% of middle school students admit to \nexperimenting with inhalants. 21% of students nationally will have \ntried inhalants by the time they graduate from high school.\n  Inhalant abusers often start in elementary school, as young as 7 \nyears old. In Alaska, there is even a report of a three year old using \ninhalants, having probably been taught to do so from an older sibling. \nInhalant abusers are both male and female and cut across all socio-\neconomic backgrounds. It is a national epidemic which affects all of \nour communities.\n\n[[Page S8788]]\n\n  Inhalant abuse is so prevalent because of the availability and \naffordability of the products. The over 1,000 products being abused \ninclude nail and furniture polish, markers, whip cream aerosols, glue, \ngasoline, and air fresheners. These products are available in every \nhome across the country and are sold for only a few dollars in every \ncorner market. Unlike other substances young people abuse--alcohol, \ncigarettes, and harder drugs like cocaine, marijuana and heroin--these \nare perfectly legal products and harmless if used according to the \ndirections.\n  All of us have these products in our homes and at some point, we have \nall asked our children to follow those directions and polish the living \nroom furniture or fix a broken dish. But how many of us knew these \nitems, which we so casually use, could someday kill our children? \nAccording to a recent study, only four percent of parents suspected \ntheir children of inhaling when in fact, 21% of them have.\n  With the products accessible and cheap, how do we stop the abuse \nwithout more laws? Congress can't just enact another law this time, we \ncan't outlaw furniture polish or gasoline. Instead, I strongly believe \nthe solution lies within our communities and our families. We, as \ncommunity leaders, parents, and grandparents, should make a concerted \neffort to involve young people in other activities--teach them a trade \nor give them a summer job. I suggest that families pray together and \neat their meals together. Children who have loving supportive homes and \nwho are involved in a job or their community are less likely to be \nenticed by drugs, including inhalants.\n  We can also provide information. Inhalant abuse could be reduced if \nparents knew what symptoms they should be looking for. The warning \nsigns for abuse include: unusual breath odor, chemical odor on \nclothing, a drunk or dazed appearance, hand tremors, red or runny nose \nand eyes, spots or sores around the mouth and anxiety and restlessness.\n  A sudden drop in grades and school attendance can also be an \nindication of drug abuse.\n  Most importantly, teenagers and children need to be told over and \nover again that even one try, one sniff, can kill. What they may view \nas simple experimentation can kill them. If they don't die from \ninhalant abuse, they may be left with permanent brain, liver and kidney \ndamage.\n  I hope that on October 15th, my colleagues in the Senate will join me \nin a nationwide conversation about inhalant abuse. Together, as \ncommunity leaders, parents, and concerned citizens, we can educate \nparents and young people while encouraging community and family \noriented solutions to drug abuse. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/22/senate-section/article/S8787-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nDEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED \n                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                SESSIONS (AND HATCH) AMENDMENT NO. 3245\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS (for himself and Mr. Hatch) proposed an amendment to the \nbill (S. 2260) making appropriations for the Department of Commerce, \nJustice, and State, the Judiciary, and related agencies for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 30, line 7, strike ``$100,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$150,000,000''.\n       On page 36, line 20, strike ``$95,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$45,000,000''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 KERREY (AND HAGEL) AMENDMENT NO. 3246\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. KERREY (for himself and Mr. Hagel) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill, S. 2260, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of the bill insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

This subtitle may be cited as the ``Forced \n     Abortion Condemnation Act''.\n       Sec. 9002. Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime \n     against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n       (2) For over 15 years there have been frequent and credible \n     reports of forced abortion and forced sterilization in \n     connection with the population control policies of the \n     People's Republic of China. These reports indicate the \n     following:\n       (A) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of \n     the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization have no role in the population control program, \n     in fact the Communist Chinese Government encourages both \n     forced abortion and forced sterilization through a \n     combination of strictly enforced birth quotas and immunity \n     for local population control officials who engage in \n     coercion. Officials acknowledge that there have been \n     instances of forced abortions and sterilization, and no \n     evidence has been made available to suggest that the \n     perpetrators have been punished.\n       (B) People's Republic of China population control \n     officials, in cooperation with employers and works unit \n     officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles and \n     subject women who conceive without government authorization \n     to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic \n     sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment, \n     and often to physical force.\n       (C) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized \n     children include fines in amounts several times larger than \n     the per capita annual incomes of residents of the People's \n     Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the average fine \n     is estimated to be twice a family's gross annual income. \n     Families which cannot pay the fine may be subject to \n     confiscation and destruction of their homes and personal \n     property.\n       (D) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on \n     those whose resistance is motivated by religion. For example, \n     according to a 1995 Amnesty International report, the \n     Catholic inhabitants of 2 villages in Hebei Province were \n     subjected to population\n\n[[Page S8789]]\n\n     control under the slogan ``better to have more graves than \n     one more child''. Enforcement measures included torture, \n     sexual abuse, and the detention of resisters' relatives as \n     hostages.\n       (E) Forced abortions in Communist China often have taken \n     place in the very late stages of pregnancy.\n       (F) Since 1994 forced abortion and sterilization have been \n     used in Communist China not only to regulate the number of \n     children, but also to eliminate those who are regarded as \n     defective in accordance with the official eugenic policy \n     known as the ``Natal and Health Care Law''.\n       Sec. 9003. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of State may not utilize any funds appropriated \n     or otherwise available for the Department of State for fiscal \n     year 1999 to issue any visa to any national of the People's \n     Republic of China, including any official of the Communist \n     Party or the Government of the People's Republic of China and \n     its regional, local, and village authorities (except the head \n     of state, the head of government, and cabinet level \n     ministers) who the Secretary finds, based on credible \n     information, has been involved in the establishment or \n     enforcement of population control policies resulting in a \n     woman being forced to undergo an abortion against her free \n     choice, or resulting in a man or woman being forced to \n     undergo sterilization against his or her free choice.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Attorney General may not utilize any funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available for the Department of Justice for fiscal \n     year 1999 to admit to the United States any national covered \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n     (a) or (b) with respect to a national of the People's \n     Republic of China if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is in the national interest of the \n     United States to do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to Congress containing a \n     justification for the waiver.\n\n                Subtitle B--Freedom on Religion in China\n\n       Sec. 9011. (a) It is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should make freedom of religion one of the major \n     objectives of United States foreign policy with respect to \n     China.\n       (b) As part of this policy, the Department of State should \n     raise in every relevant bilateral and multilateral forum the \n     issue of individuals imprisoned, detained, confined, or \n     otherwise harassed by the Chinese Government on religious \n     grounds.\n       (c) In its communications with the Chinese Government, the \n     Department of State should provide specific names of \n     individuals of concern and request a complete and timely \n     response from the Chinese Government regarding the \n     individuals' whereabouts and condition, the charges against \n     them, and sentence imposed.\n       (d) The goal of these official communications should be the \n     expeditious release of all religious prisoners in China and \n     Tibet and the end of the Chinese Government's policy and \n     practice of harassing and repressing religious believers.\n       Sec. 9012.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of State may not utilize any funds appropriated \n     or otherwise available for the Department of State for fiscal \n     year 1999 to issue a visa to any national of the People's \n     Republic of China described in section 9012(a)(2) (except the \n     head of state, the head of government, and cabinet level \n     ministers).\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Attorney General may not utilize any funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available for the Department of Justice for fiscal \n     year 1999 to admit to the United States any national covered \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n     (a) or (b) with respect to an individual described in such \n     subsection if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is vital to the national interest to \n     do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to the appropriate \n     congressional committees containing a justification for the \n     waiver.\n       Sec. 9014. In this subtitle, the term ``appropriate \n     congressional committees'' means the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and the Committee on International \n     Relations of the House of Representatives.\n\n         Subtitle C--Monitoring of Human Rights Abuses in China\n\n       Sec. 9021. This subtitle may be cited as the ``Political \n     Freedom in China Act of 1998''.\n       Sec. 9022. Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress concurs in the following conclusions of the \n     United States State Department on human rights in the \n     People's Republic of China in 1996:\n       (A) The People's Republic of China is ``an authoritarian \n     state'' in which ``citizens lack the freedom to peacefully \n     express opposition to the party-led political system and the \n     right to change their national leaders or form of \n     government''.\n       (B) The Government of the People's Republic of China has \n     ``continued to commit widespread and well-documented human \n     rights abuses, in violation of internationally accepted \n     norms, stemming from the authorities' intolerance of dissent, \n     fear of unrest, and the absence or inadequacy of laws \n     protecting basic freedoms''.\n       (C) ``[a]buses include torture and mistreatment of \n     prisoners, forced confessions, and arbitrary and \n     incommunicado detention''.\n       (D) ``[p]rison conditions remained harsh [and] [t]he \n     Government continued severe restrictions on freedom of \n     speech, the press, assembly, association, religion, privacy, \n     and worker rights''.\n       (E) ``[a]lthough the Government denies that it holds \n     political prisoners, the number of persons detained or \n     serving sentences for `counterrevolutionary crimes' or \n     `crimes against the state', or for peaceful political or \n     religious activities are believed to number in the \n     thousands''.\n       (F) ``[n]onapproved religious groups, including Protestant \n     and Catholic groups * * * experienced intensified \n     repression''.\n       (G) ``[s]erious human rights abuses persist in minority \n     areas, including Tibet, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia[, and] \n     [c]ontrols on religion and on other fundamental freedoms in \n     these areas have also intensified''.\n       (H) ``[o]verall in 1996, the authorities stepped up efforts \n     to cut off expressions of protest or criticism. All public \n     dissent against the party and government was effectively \n     silenced by intimidation, exile, the imposition of prison \n     terms, administrative detention, or house arrest. No \n     dissidents were known to be active at year's end.''.\n       (2) In addition to the State Department, credible \n     independent human rights organizations have documented an \n     increase in repression in China during 1995, and effective \n     destruction of the dissident movement through the arrest and \n     sentencing of the few remaining pro-democracy and human \n     rights activists not already in prison or exile.\n       (3) Among those were Li Hai, sentenced to 9 years in prison \n     on December 18, 1996, for gathering information on the \n     victims of the 1989 crackdown, which according to the court's \n     verdict constituted ``state secrets''; Liu Nianchun, an \n     independent labor organizer, sentenced to 3 years of ``re-\n     education through labor'' on July 4, 1996, due to his \n     activities in connection with a petition campaign calling for \n     human rights reforms; and Ngodrup Phuntsog, a Tibetan \n     national, who was arrested in Tibet in 1987 immediately after \n     he returned from a 2-year trip to India, where the Tibetan \n     government in exile is located, and following a secret trial \n     was convicted by the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China of espionage on behalf of the ``Ministry of Security of \n     the Dalai clique''.\n       (4) Many political prisoners are suffering from poor \n     conditions and ill-treatment leading to serious medical and \n     health problems, including--\n       (A) Gao Yu, a journalist sentenced to 6 years in prison in \n     November 1994 and honored by UNESCO in May 1997, has a heart \n     condition; and\n       (B) Chen Longde, a leading human rights advocate now \n     serving a 3-year reeducation through labor sentence imposed \n     without trial in August 1995, has reportedly been subject to \n     repeated beatings and electric shocks at a labor camp for \n     refusing to confess his guilt.\n\n[[Page S8790]]\n\n       (5) The People's Republic of China, as a member of the \n     United Nations, is expected to abide by the provisions of the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n       (6) The People's Republic of China is a party to numerous \n     international human rights conventions, including the \n     Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or \n     Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n       Sec. 9023. (a) The Secretary of State, in all official \n     meetings with the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China, should request the immediate and unconditional release \n     of Ngodrup Phuntsog and other prisoners of conscience in \n     Tibet, as well as in the People's Republic of China.\n       (b) The Secretary of State should seek access for \n     international humanitarian organizations to Drapchi prison \n     and other prisons in Tibet, as well as in the People's \n     Republic of China, to ensure that prisoners are not being \n     mistreated and are receiving necessary medical treatment.\n       (c) The Secretary of State, in all official meetings with \n     the Government of the People's Republic of China, should call \n     on that country to begin serious discussions with the Dalai \n     Lama or his representatives, without preconditions, on the \n     future of Tibet.\n       Sec. 9024. (a) There is authorized to be appropriated for \n     fiscal year 1999, $1,100,000 for support personnel to monitor \n     political repression in the People's Republic of China in the \n     United States Embassies in Beijing and Kathmandu, as well as \n     the American consulates in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenyang, \n     Chengdu, and Hong Kong.\n       (b) Amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of \n     appropriations in subsection (a) are in addition to any other \n     amounts appropriated or otherwise available in fiscal year \n     1999 for the personnel referred to in that subsection.\n       Sec. 9025.

This subtitle may be cited as the ``Forced \n     Abortion Condemnation Act''.\n       Sec. 9002. Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime \n     against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n       (2) For over 15 years there have been frequent and credible \n     reports of forced abortion and forced sterilization in \n     connection with the population control policies of the \n     People's Republic of China. These reports indicate the \n     following:\n       (A) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of \n     the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization have no role in the population control program, \n     in fact the Communist Chinese Government encourages both \n     forced abortion and forced sterilization through a \n     combination of strictly enforced birth quotas and immunity \n     for local population control officials who engage in \n     coercion. Officials acknowledge that there have been \n     instances of forced abortions and sterilization, and no \n     evidence has been made available to suggest that the \n     perpetrators have been punished.\n       (B) People's Republic of China population control \n     officials, in cooperation with employers and works unit \n     officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles and \n     subject women who conceive without government authorization \n     to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic \n     sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment, \n     and often to physical force.\n       (C) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized \n     children include fines in amounts several times larger than \n     the per capita annual incomes of residents of the People's \n     Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the average fine \n     is estimated to be twice a family's gross annual income. \n     Families which cannot pay the fine may be subject to \n     confiscation and destruction of their homes and personal \n     property.\n       (D) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on \n     those whose resistance is motivated by religion. For example, \n     according to a 1995 Amnesty International report, the \n     Catholic inhabitants of 2 villages in Hebei Province were \n     subjected to population control under the slogan ``better to \n     have more graves than one more child''. Enforcement measures \n     included torture, sexual abuse, and the detention of \n     resisters' relatives as hostages.\n       (E) Forced abortions in Communist China often have taken \n     place in the very late stages of pregnancy.\n       (F) Since 1994 forced abortion and sterilization have been \n     used in Communist China not only to regulate the number of \n     children, but also to eliminate those who are regarded as \n     defective in accordance with the official eugenic policy \n     known as the ``Natal and Health Care Law''.\n       Sec. 9003. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of State may not utilize any funds appropriated \n     or otherwise available for the Department of State for fiscal \n     year 1999 to issue any visa to any national of the People's \n     Republic of China, including any official of the Communist \n     Party or the Government of the People's Republic of China and \n     its regional, local, and village authorities (except the head \n     of state, the head of government, and cabinet level \n     ministers) who the Secretary finds, based on credible \n     information, has been involved in the establishment or \n     enforcement of population control policies resulting in a \n     woman being forced to undergo an abortion against her free \n     choice, or resulting in a man or woman being forced to \n     undergo sterilization against his or her free choice.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Attorney General may not utilize any funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available for the Department of Justice for fiscal \n     year 1999 to admit to the United States any national covered \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n     (a) or (b) with respect to a national of the People's \n     Republic of China if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is in the national interest of the \n     United States to do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to Congress containing a \n     justification for the waiver.\n\n                Subtitle B--Freedom on Religion in China\n\n       Sec. 9011. (a) It is the sense of Congress that the \n     President should make freedom of religion one of the major \n     objectives of United States foreign policy with respect to \n     China.\n       (b) As part of this policy, the Department of State should \n     raise in every relevant bilateral and multilateral forum the \n     issue of individuals imprisoned, detained, confined, or \n     otherwise harassed by the Chinese Government on religious \n     grounds.\n       (c) In its communications with the Chinese Government, the \n     Department of State should provide specific names of \n     individuals of concern and request a complete and timely \n     response from the Chinese Government regarding the \n     individuals' whereabouts and condition, the charges against \n     them, and sentence imposed.\n\n[[Page S8791]]\n\n       (d) The goal of these official communications should be the \n     expeditious release of all religious prisoners in China and \n     Tibet and the end of the Chinese Government's policy and \n     practice of harassing and repressing religious believers.\n       Sec. 9012. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     no funds appropriated or otherwise made available for the \n     Department of State for fiscal year 1999 for the United \n     States Information Agency or the United States Agency for \n     International Development may be used for the purpose of \n     providing travel expenses and per diem for the participation \n     in conferences, exchanges, programs, and activities of the \n     following nationals of the People's Republic of China:\n       (1) The head or political secretary of any of the following \n     Chinese Government-created or approved organizations:\n       (A) The Chinese Buddhist Association.\n       (B) The Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association.\n       (C) The National Congress of Catholic Representatives.\n       (D) The Chinese Catholic Bishops' Conference.\n       (E) The Chinese Protestant ``Three Self'' Patriotic \n     Movement.\n       (F) The China Christian Council.\n       (G) The Chinese Taoist Association.\n       (H) The Chinese Islamic Association.\n       (2) Any military or civilian official or employee of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China who carried out \n     or directed the carrying out of any of the following policies \n     or practices:\n       (A) Formulating, drafting, or implementing repressive \n     religious policies.\n       (B) Imprisoning, detaining, or harassing individuals on \n     religious grounds.\n       (C) Promoting or participating in policies or practices \n     which hinder religious activities or the free expression of \n     religious beliefs.\n       (b)(1) Each Federal agency subject to the prohibition in \n     subsection (a) shall certify in writing to the appropriate \n     congressional committees, on a quarterly basis during fiscal \n     year 1999, that it did not pay, either directly or through a \n     contractor or grantee, for travel expenses or per diem of any \n     national of the People's Republic of China described in \n     subsection (a).\n       (2) Each certification under paragraph (1) shall be \n     supported by the following information:\n       (A) The name of each employee of any agency of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China whose travel \n     expenses or per diem were paid by funds of the reporting \n     agency of the United States Government.\n       (B) The procedures employed by the reporting agency of the \n     United States Government to ascertain whether each individual \n     under subparagraph (A) did or did not participate in \n     activities described in subsection (a)(2).\n       (C) The reporting agency's basis for concluding that each \n     individual under subparagraph (A) did not participate in such \n     activities.\n       Sec. 9013. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of State may not utilize any funds appropriated \n     or otherwise available for the Department of State for fiscal \n     year 1999 to issue a visa to any national of the People's \n     Republic of China described in section 9012(a)(2) (except the \n     head of state, the head of government, and cabinet level \n     ministers).\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Attorney General may not utilize any funds appropriated or \n     otherwise available for the Department of Justice for fiscal \n     year 1999 to admit to the United States any national covered \n     by subsection (a).\n       (c) The President may waive the prohibition in subsection \n     (a) or (b) with respect to an individual described in such \n     subsection if the President--\n       (1) determines that it is vital to the national interest to \n     do so; and\n       (2) provides written notification to the appropriate \n     congressional committees containing a justification for the \n     waiver.\n       Sec. 9014.

The Secretary shall \n     provide to each worker who commits to work for the employer \n     the employer's name, address, telephone number, the location \n     where the employer has requested that employees report for \n     employment, and a statement disclosing the terms and \n     conditions of employment.\n       (b) Deadline for Completing Search Process; Referral of \n     Workers.--As expeditiously as possible, but not later than 7 \n     days before the date on which an employer desires work to \n     begin, the Secretary shall complete the search under \n     subsection (a) and shall transmit to the employer a report \n     containing the name, address, and social security account \n     number of each registered worker who has committed to work \n     for the employer on the date needed, together with sufficient \n     information to enable the employer to establish contact with \n     the worker. The identification of such registered workers in \n     a report shall constitute a referral of workers under this \n     section.\n       (c) Notice of Insufficient Workers.--If the report provided \n     to the employer under subsection (b) does not include \n     referral of a sufficient number of registered workers to fill \n     all of the employer's job opportunities in the occupation for \n     which the employer applied under section __04(a), the \n     Secretary shall indicate in the report the number of job \n     opportunities for which registered workers could not be \n     referred, and promptly transmit a copy of the report to the \n     Attorney General and the Secretary of State, by electronic or \n     other means ensuring next day delivery.\n\n     SEC. __06.

Such an application shall \n     include a copy of the employer's application under section \n     __04(a), together with evidence of its timely submission. The \n     Secretary of State may consult with the Secretary of Labor in \n     carrying out this paragraph.\n       (2) Expedited consideration by secretary of state.--The \n     Secretary of State shall, as expeditiously as possible, but \n     not later than 5 days after the employer files an application \n     under paragraph (1), issue visas to, and the Attorney General \n     shall admit, a sufficient number of eligible aliens \n     designated by the employer to fill the job opportunities for \n     which the employer has applied under that paragraph.\n       (c) Redetermination of Need.--\n       (1) Requests for redetermination.--\n       (A) In general.--An employer may file a request for a \n     redetermination by the Secretary of the needs of the employer \n     if--\n       (i) a worker referred from the registry is not at the place \n     of employment on the date of need shown on the application, \n     or the date the work for which the worker is needed has \n     begun, whichever is later;\n       (ii) the worker is not ready, willing, able, or qualified \n     to perform the work required; or\n       (iii) the worker abandons the employment or is terminated \n     for a lawful job-related reason.\n       (B) Additional authorization of admissions.--The Secretary \n     shall expeditiously, but in no case later than 72 hours after \n     a redetermination is requested under subparagraph (A), submit \n     a report to the Secretary of State and the Attorney General \n     providing notice of a need for workers under this subsection.\n       (2) Job-related requirements.--An employer shall not be \n     required to initially employ a worker who fails to meet \n     lawful job-related employment criteria, nor to continue the \n     employment of a worker who fails to meet lawful, job-related \n     standards of conduct and performance, including failure to \n     meet minimum production standards after a 3-day break-in \n     period.\n       (d) Emergency Applications.--Notwithstanding subsections \n     (b) and (c), the Secretary may promptly transmit a report to \n     the Attorney General and Secretary of State providing notice \n     of a need for workers under this subsection for an employer--\n       (1) who has not employed aliens under this title in the \n     occupation in question in the prior year's agricultural \n     season;\n       (2) who faces an unforeseen need for workers (as determined \n     by the Secretary); and\n       (3) with respect to whom the Secretary cannot refer able, \n     willing, and qualified workers from the registry who will \n     commit to be at the employer's place of employment and ready \n     for work within 72 hours or on the date the work for which \n     the worker is needed has begun, whichever is later.\n       (e) Regulations.--The Secretary of State shall prescribe \n     regulations to provide for the designation of aliens under \n     this section.\n\n     SEC. __07. EMPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Required Wages.--\n       (1) In general.--An employer applying under section __04(a) \n     for workers shall offer to pay, and shall pay, all workers in \n     the occupation or occupations for which the employer has \n     applied for workers from the registry, not less (and is not \n     required to pay more) than the greater of the prevailing wage \n     in the occupation in the area of intended employment or the \n     adverse effect wage rate.\n       (2) Payment of prevailing wage determined by a state \n     employment security agency sufficient.--In complying with \n     paragraph (1), an employer may request and obtain a \n     prevailing wage determination from the State employment \n     security agency. If the employer requests such a \n     determination, and pays the wage required by paragraph (1) \n     based upon such a determination, such payment shall be \n     considered sufficient to meet the requirement of paragraph \n     (1).\n       (3) Reliance on wage survey.--In lieu of the procedure of \n     paragraph (2), an employer may rely on other information, \n     such as an employer-generated prevailing wage survey and \n     determination that meets criteria specified by the Secretary.\n       (4) Alternative methods of payment permitted.--\n       (A) In general.--A prevailing wage may be expressed as an \n     hourly wage, a piece rate, a task rate, or other incentive \n     payment method, including a group rate. The requirement to \n     pay at least the prevailing wage in the occupation and area \n     of intended employment does not require an employer to pay by \n     the method of pay in which the prevailing rate is expressed, \n     except that, if the employer adopts a method of pay other \n     than the prevailing rate, the burden of proof is on the \n     employer to demonstrate that the employer's method of pay is \n     designed to produce earnings equivalent to the earnings that \n     would result from payment of the prevailing rate.\n       (B) Compliance when paying an incentive rate.--In the case \n     of an employer that pays a piece rate or task rate or uses \n     any other incentive payment method, including a group rate, \n     the employer shall be considered to be in compliance with any \n     applicable hourly wage requirement if the average of the \n     hourly earnings of the workers, taken as a group, the \n     activity for which a piece rate, task rate, or other \n     incentive payment, including a group rate, is paid, for the \n     pay period, is at least equal to the required hourly wage.\n       (C) Task rate.--For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``task rate'' means an incentive payment method based on a \n     unit of work performed such that the incentive rate varies \n     with the level of effort required to perform individual units \n     of work.\n       (D) Group rate.--For purposes of this paragraph, the term \n     ``group rate'' means an incentive payment method in which the \n     payment is shared among a group of workers working together \n     to perform the task.\n       (b) Requirement To Provide Housing.--\n       (1) In general.--An employer applying under section __04(a) \n     for registered workers shall offer to provide housing at no \n     cost (except for charges permitted by paragraph (5)) to all \n     workers employed in job opportunities to which the employer \n     has applied under that section, and to all other workers in \n     the same occupation at the place of employment, whose \n     permanent place of residence is beyond normal commuting \n     distance.\n\n[[Page S8796]]\n\n       (2) Type of housing.--In complying with paragraph (1), an \n     employer may, at the employer's election, provide housing \n     that meets applicable Federal standards for temporary labor \n     camps or secure housing that meets applicable local standards \n     for rental or public accommodation housing or other \n     substantially similar class of habitation, or, in the absence \n     of applicable local standards, State standards for rental or \n     public accommodation housing or other substantially similar \n     class of habitation.\n       (3) Workers engaged in the range production of livestock.--\n     The Secretary shall issue regulations that address the \n     specific requirements for the provision of housing to workers \n     engaged in the range production of livestock.\n       (4) Limitation.--Nothing in this subsection shall be \n     construed to require an employer to provide or secure housing \n     for persons who were not entitled to such housing under the \n     temporary labor certification regulations in effect on June \n     1, 1986.\n       (5) Charges for housing.--\n       (A) Utilities and maintenance.--An employer who provides \n     housing to a worker pursuant to paragraph (1) may charge an \n     amount equal to the fair market value (but not greater than \n     the employer's actual cost) for maintenance and utilities, or \n     such lesser amount as permitted by law.\n       (B) Security deposit.--An employer who provides housing to \n     workers pursuant to paragraph (1) may require, as a condition \n     for providing such housing, a deposit not to exceed $50 from \n     workers occupying such housing to protect against gross \n     negligence or willful destruction of property.\n       (C) Damages.--An employer who provides housing to workers \n     pursuant to paragraph (1) may require a worker found to have \n     been responsible for damage to such housing which is not the \n     result of normal wear and tear related to habitation to \n     reimburse the employer for the reasonable cost of repair of \n     such damage.\n       (6) Reduced user fee for workers provided housing.--An \n     employer shall receive a credit of 40 percent of the payment \n     otherwise due pursuant to section 218(b) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act on the earnings of alien workers to whom \n     the employer provides housing pursuant to paragraph (1).\n       (7) Housing allowance as alternative.--\n       (A) In general.--In lieu of offering housing pursuant to \n     paragraph (1), subject to subparagraphs (B) through (D), the \n     employer may on a case-by-case basis provide a reasonable \n     housing allowance. An employer who offers a housing allowance \n     to a worker pursuant to this subparagraph shall not be deemed \n     to be a housing provider under section 203 of the Migrant and \n     Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (29 U.S.C. 1823) \n     solely by virtue of providing such housing allowance.\n       (B) Limitation.--At any time after the date that is 3 years \n     after the effective date of this title, the governor of the \n     State may certify to the Secretary that there is not \n     sufficient housing available in an area of intended \n     employment of migrant farm workers or aliens provided status \n     pursuant to this title who are seeking temporary housing \n     while employed at farm work.

No \n     investigation or hearing shall be conducted on a complaint \n     concerning such a failure or misrepresentation unless the \n     complaint was filed not later than 12 months after the date \n     of the failure or misrepresentation, as the case may be. The \n     Secretary shall conduct an investigation under this paragraph \n     if there is reasonable cause to believe that such a failure \n     or misrepresentation has occurred.\n       (B) Statutory construction.--Nothing in this title limits \n     the authority of the Secretary of Labor to conduct any \n     compliance investigation under any other labor law, including \n     any law affecting migrant and seasonal agricultural workers \n     or, in the absence of a complaint under this paragraph, under \n     this title.\n       (2) Written notice of finding and opportunity for appeal.--\n     After an investigation has been conducted, the Secretary \n     shall issue a written determination as to whether or not any \n     violation described in subsection (b) has been committed.

In \n     determining the amount of civil money penalty to be assessed \n     or whether to recommend disqualification of the employer, the \n     Secretary shall consider the seriousness of the violation, \n     the good faith of the employer, the size of the business of \n     the employer being charged, the history of previous \n     violations by the employer, whether the employer obtained a \n     financial gain from the violation, whether the violation was \n     willful, and other relevant factors.\n       (4) Program disqualification.--\n       (A) 3 years for second violation.--Upon a second final \n     determination that an employer has failed to pay the wages \n     required under this title or committed other substantial \n     violations under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall report \n     such determination to the Attorney General and the Attorney \n     General shall disqualify the employer from the employment of \n     aliens described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act for a period of 3 years.\n       (B) Permanent for third violation.--Upon a third final \n     determination that an employer has failed to pay the wages \n     required under this section or committed other substantial \n     violations under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall report \n     such determination to the Attorney General, and the Attorney \n     General shall disqualify the employer from any subsequent \n     employment of aliens described in section \n     101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       (c) Role of Associations.--\n       (1) Violation by a member of an association.--An employer \n     on whose behalf an application is filed by an association \n     acting as its agent is fully responsible for such \n     application, and for complying with the terms and conditions \n     of this title, as though the employer had filed the \n     application itself. If such an employer is determined to have \n     violated a requirement of this section, the penalty for such \n     violation shall be assessed against the employer who \n     committed the violation and not against the association or \n     other members of the association.\n       (2) Violation by an association acting as an employer.--If \n     an association filing an application on its own behalf as an \n     employer is determined to have committed a violation under \n     this subsection which results in disqualification from the \n     program under subsection (b), no individual member of such \n     association may be the beneficiary of the services of an \n     alien described in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act in an occupation in which \n     such alien was employed by the association during the period \n     such disqualification is in effect, unless such member files \n     an application as an individual employer or such application \n     is filed on the employer's behalf by an association with \n     which the employer has an agreement that the employer will \n     comply with the requirements of this title.\n\n     SEC. __09.

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Since the adoption by the Federal Communication \n     Commission of the so-called\n\n[[Page S8801]]\n\n     ``Going Forward Rules'' to relax regulation of cable \n     television rates in 1994, cable television rates have \n     increased by 6.3 percent per year. Since the enactment of the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104), such \n     rates have increased by approximately 8.2 percent per year.\n       (2) The rate of increase in cable television rates has \n     exceeded the rate of increase in inflation by more than 3 \n     times since the enactment of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996. The increase in such rates is faster than when such \n     rates were not regulated between 1986 and 1992. Such rates \n     are rising 50 percent faster than the Commission predicted \n     when it adopted the so-called ``Going Forward Rules''.\n       (3) In 1996, many United States cities experienced \n     increases in cable television rates that exceeded 20 percent. \n     Overall, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, cable \n     television rates increased at an annual pace of 10.4 percent \n     in 1996, compared with 3.5 percent for all consumer goods.\n       (4) The Nation's largest cable television company boosted \n     its rates approximately 13.5 percent in 1996. In Denver \n     alone, it raised rates by 19 percent in the summer of 1996, \n     then another 8 percent in June 1997. The Nation's second \n     largest cable television company increased its average rates \n     12 percent in the New York City area in 1996.\n       (5) The cable television industry continues to hold the \n     dominant position in the market for multichannel video \n     programming distribution (MVPD) with 87 percent of MVPD \n     subscribers receiving service from their local franchised \n     cable television operator.\n       (6) Certain factors place alternatives to cable television \n     at a competitive disadvantage. For example, direct broadcast \n     satellite (DBS) service is widely available and constitutes \n     the most significant alternative to cable television. \n     However, barriers to both the entry and expansion of DBS \n     include--\n       (A) the lack of availability of local broadcast signals;\n       (B) up front equipment and installation costs; and\n       (C) the need to purchase additional equipment to receive \n     service on additional television sets.\n       (7) Telephone company entry into the video programming \n     distribution business has been limited.\n       (8) With the increased concentration of cable television \n     systems at the national level, the percentage of cable \n     television subscribers served by the 4 largest cable \n     television companies rose to 61.4 percent in 1996.\n       (9) Recent agreements in the cable television industry have \n     given TCI and Time Warner/Turner Broadcasting ownership of \n     cable television systems serving approximately one-half of \n     the Nation's cable television subscribers.\n       (10) Financial analysts report that cable television \n     industry revenue for 1995 was $24,898,000,000 and grew 8.9 \n     percent to $27,120,000,000 in 1996. For 1996, revenue per \n     subscriber grew 5.6 percent to reach $431.85 per subscriber. \n     Analysts estimate 1997 year-end-total revenue for the \n     industry was approximately $30,000,000,000, an increase of \n     9.9 percent from 1996 year-end revenue.\n       (b) Report.--(1) Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications Commission \n     shall submit to Congress a report setting forth the \n     assessment of the Commission whether or not the findings \n     under subsection (a) are consistent with the Commission's \n     fulfillment of its responsibilities under the Cable \n     Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992 \n     (Public Law 102-385) and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \n     to promote competition in the cable television industry and \n     ensure reasonable rates for cable television services.\n       (2) If the Commission determines under paragraph (1) that \n     the findings under subsection (a) are consistent with the \n     fulfillment of the responsibilities referred to in that \n     paragraph, the report shall include a detailed justification \n     of that determination.\n       (3) If the Commission determines under paragraph (1) that \n     the findings under subsection (a) are not consistent with the \n     fulfillment of the responsibilities referred to in that \n     paragraph, the report shall include a statement of the \n     actions to be undertaken by the Commission to fulfill the \n     responsibilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  WYDEN (AND SMITH) AMENDMENT NO. 3265\n\n  Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Smith of Oregon) proposed an amendment \nto the bill, S. 2260, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 51, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       Sec. 121.

and\n       (III) in the case of an application for a temporary \n     restraining order or an injunction to prevent a violation of \n     section 1085 of title 18, United States Code, as added by \n     this section, relating to material or activity located within \n     the United States, whether less burdensome, but comparably \n     effective means are available to block access by a customer \n     of the service's system or network to information or activity \n     that violates such section 1085.\n\n       (iii) Findings.--In any order issued by the court under \n     this paragraph, the court shall set forth the reasons for its \n     issuance, shall be specific in its terms, and shall describe \n     in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the complaint \n     or other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained \n     and the general steps to be taken to comply with the order.\n       (D) Expiration.--Any temporary restraining order or \n     preliminary injunction entered pursuant to this paragraph \n     shall expire if, and as soon as, the United States, or the \n     attorney general (or other appropriate State official) of the \n     State, as applicable, notifies the court that issued the \n     injunction that the United States or the State, as \n     applicable, will not seek a permanent injunction.\n       (3) Expedited proceedings.--\n       (A) In general.--In addition to proceedings under paragraph \n     (2), a district court may enter a temporary restraining order \n     against a person alleged to be in violation of section 1085 \n     of title 18, United States Code, as added by this section, \n     upon application of the United States under paragraph (2)(A), \n     or the attorney general (or other appropriate State official) \n     of an affected State under paragraph (2)(B), without notice \n     and the opportunity for a hearing, if the United States or \n     the State, as applicable, demonstrates that there is probable \n     cause to believe that the transmission at issue violates \n     section 1085 of title 18, United States Code, as added by \n     this section.\n       (B) Expiration.--A temporary restraining order entered \n     under this paragraph shall expire on the earlier of--\n       (i) the expiration of the 30-day period beginning on the \n     date on which the order is entered; or\n       (ii) the date on which a preliminary injunction is granted \n     or denied.\n       (C) Hearings.--A hearing requested concerning an order \n     entered under this paragraph shall be held at the earliest \n     practicable time.\n       (4) Rule of construction.--In the absence of fraud or bad \n     faith, no interactive computer service (as defined in section \n     1085(a) of title 18, United States Code, as added by this \n     section) shall be liable for any damages, penalty, or \n     forfeiture, civil or criminal, for a reasonable course of \n     action taken to comply with a court order issued under \n     paragraph (2) or (3) of this subsection.\n       (5) Protection of privacy.--Nothing in this section or the \n     amendments made by this section shall be construed to \n     authorize an affirmative obligation on an interactive \n     computer service--\n       (A) to monitor use of its service; or\n       (B) except as required by an order of a court, to access, \n     remove or disable access to material where such material \n     reveals conduct prohibited by this section and the amendments \n     made by this section.\n       (6) No effect on other remedies.--Nothing in this \n     subsection shall be construed to affect any remedy under \n     section 1084 or 1085 of title 18, United States Code, as \n     amended by this section, or under any other Federal or State \n     law. The availability of relief under this subsection shall \n     not depend on, or be affected by, the initiation or \n     resolution of any action under section 1084 or 1085 of title \n     18, United States Code, as amended by this section, or under \n     any other Federal or State law.\n       (7) Continuous jurisdiction.--The court shall have \n     continuous jurisdiction under this subsection to enforce \n     section 1085 of title 18, United States Code, as added by \n     this section.\n       (e) Report on Enforcement.--Not later than 3 years after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall \n     submit a report to Congress that includes--\n       (1) an analysis of the problems, if any, associated with \n     enforcing section 1085 of title 18, United States Code, as \n     added by this section;\n       (2) recommendations for the best use of the resources of \n     the Department of Justice to enforce that section; and\n       (3) an estimate of the amount of activity and money being \n     used to gamble on the Internet.\n       (f) Report on Costs.--Not later than 3 years after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce shall \n     submit a report to Congress that includes--\n       (1) an analysis of existing and potential methods or \n     technologies for filtering or screening transmissions in \n     violation of section 1085 of title 18, United States Code, as \n     added by this section, that originate outside of the \n     territorial boundaries of any State or the United States;\n       (2) a review of the effect, if any, on interactive computer \n     services of any court ordered temporary restraining orders or \n     injunctions imposed on those services under this section;\n       (3) a calculation of the cost to the economy of illegal \n     gambling on the Internet, and other societal costs of such \n     gambling; and\n       (4) an estimate of the effect, if any, on the Internet \n     caused by any court ordered temporary restraining orders or \n     injunctions imposed under this section.\n       (g) Severability.--If any provision of this section, an \n     amendment made by this section, or the application of such \n     provision or amendment to any person or circumstance is held \n     to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this section, the \n     amendments made by this section, and the application of the \n     provisions of such to any person or circumstance shall not be \n     affected thereby.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        BRYAN AMENDMENT NO. 3267\n\n  Mr. BRYAN proposed an amendment to amendment No. 3266 by Mr. Kyl to \nthe bill, S. 2260, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 3, strike lines 9 through 12, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(iii) a contract of indemnity or guarantee;\n       ``(iv) a contract for life, health, or accident insurance; \n     or\n       ``(v) participation in a game or contest, otherwise lawful \n     under applicable Federal or State law--\n\n       ``(I) that, by its terms or rules, is not dependent on the \n     outcome of any single sporting event, any series or sporting \n     events, any tournament, or the individual performance of 1 or \n     more athletes or teams in a single sporting event;\n       ``(II) in which the outcome is determined by accumulated \n     statistical results of games or contests involving the \n     performances of amateur or professional athletes or teams; \n     and\n       ``(III) in which the winner or winners may receive a prize \n     or award;\n\n     (otherwise know as a `fantasy sport league' or a `rotisserie \n     league') if such participation is without charge to the \n     participant or any charge to a participant is limited to a \n     reasonable administrative fee.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 CRAIG (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3268\n\n  Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Domenici) proposed an \namendment to amendment No. 3266 proposed by Mr. Kyl to the bill, S. \n2260, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 3 of the amendment, strike lines 9 through 12 and \n     insert the following below line 13:\n       ``(iii) a contract of indemnity or guarantee;\n       ``(iv) a contract for life, health, or accident insurance;\n       ``(v) lawful gaming conducted pursuant to the Indian Gaming \n     Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.)--; or''.\n       Beginning on page 13 of the amendment, strike line 4 and \n     all that follows through page 14, line 25, and insert the \n     following:\n       (2) Proceedings.--\n       (A) Institution by federal government.--\n       (i) In general.--The United States may institute \n     proceedings under this paragraph.

Mr. President, I would like to bring to the \nSenate's attention the latest development regarding the Year 2000 (Y2K) \nproblem. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has determined that \na critical mainframe computer system used to monitor air traffic will \ncontinue to function smoothly into the millennium. The FAA, uncertain \nas to how long testing would take, only recently began an intensive \ninvestigation of its mainframe computers. The testing involved the time \nconsuming task of examining more than 40 million lines of software. \nAlthough the technicians determined the date problem could be repaired \nin time, the process underscores the urgent nature of the Y2K issue. \nThe uncertainties of Y2K mean repair work can be as simple as that of \nthe FAA, or more complicated than is possibly imaginable. It is \nimperative that the public and private sectors follow the example of \nthe FAA and begin testing their computer systems immediately. I \ncontinue to hope that it is not too late to properly prepare for the \nyear 2000.\n  I ask that the July 22, 1998 Washington Post article on the FAA be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n          Air Traffic Control Computer System Cleared for 2000\n\n\n                       IBM Warning Prompted Tests\n\n                       (By Rajiv Chandrasekaran)\n\n       Atlantic City, N.J.--Federal Aviation Administration \n     technicians have concluded that a critical mainframe computer \n     system used in the nation's largest air traffic control \n     centers will function properly in the year 2000, despite \n     warnings from the system's manufacturer that the agency \n     should replace the equipment.\n       The determination, reached over the past few weeks by \n     programmers at the FAA's technical center here, has elicited \n     cheers from agency officials who had been castigated by \n     congressional investigators earlier this year for not \n     planning a quick replacement of the systems.\n       ``The examination has revealed that the [system] will \n     transition the millennium in a routine manner,'' FAA \n     Administrator Jan F. Garvey said in an interview yesterday.\n       The mainframe computers at issue, made by International \n     Business Machines Corp., are used at the FAA's 20 air route \n     traffic control centers to track high-altitude aircraft \n     between airports. The computers, IBM's Model 3083 mainframes, \n     receive data from radar systems and integrate that \n     information into a picture for air traffic controllers.\n       Last October, IBM sent a letter to the FAA warning that \n     ``the appropriate skills and tools do not exist to conduct a \n     complete Year 2000 test assessment'' of the 3083 computers, \n     once the mainstay of large corporate data centers. The \n     machines have been mothballed by most users, step IBM urged \n     the FAA to take.\n       Although the FAA plans to replace the mainframes as part of \n     a broader modernization effort, agency officials were unsure \n     they could complete the process by 2000. As a result, they \n     embarked on an aggressive testing program to figure out how \n     the computer system would be affected.\n       Most mainframes use a two-digit dating system that assumes \n     that 1 and 9 are the first two digits of the year. Without \n     specialized reprogramming, it was feared that the IBM 3083s \n     would recognize ``00'' not as 2000 but as 1900, a glitch that \n     could cause them to malfunction. The federal government and \n     private companies are racing to fix other computers to avoid \n     the year 2000 problem.\n       To conduct the testing, the FAA hired two retired IBM \n     programmers and assigned a handful of other agency employees \n     to the project, which involved checking more than 40 million \n     lines of ``microcode''--software that controls the \n     mainframe's most basic functions. Among the initial areas of \n     concern was whether a date problem would affect the operation \n     of the mainframe's cooling pumps. If the computer does not \n     regularly switch from one cooling pump to another, it can \n     overheat and shut down, causing controllers' radar screens to \n     go blank.\n       The technicians, however, found that the microcode doesn't \n     consider the last two digits of the year when processing \n     dates. Instead, it stores the year as a two-digit number \n     between one and 32, assuming that 1975 was year one. As a \n     result, they determined, the system would fail in 2007, but \n     not in 2000.\n       ``Nothing we have found will cause an operational \n     aberration over the new year. It will continue to function as \n     it's supposed to,'' said one FAA technician working on the \n     project. FAA officials recently allowed a reporter to tour \n     the facility here and talk to employees on the condition that \n     they not be named.\n       ``We're dealing with minutes and seconds in air traffic \n     control,'' said another technician. ``The systems don't \n     really care about days and years.''\n       The programmers did find four software modules that need to \n     be repaired to handle the leap year in 2000, but they said \n     the task would be relatively straightforward.\n       While the technicians came to their conclusions a few weeks \n     ago, Garvey only recently was briefed on the findings. The \n     results, sources said, have not yet been shared widely within \n     the Transportation Department or with lawmakers.\n       Agency officials acknowledge their determination will be \n     met with skepticism on Capitol Hill and in the aviation \n     industry. To bolster their case, the technicians said they \n     have compiled reams of computer printouts that back up their \n     conclusions.\n       The findings highlight one of he uncertainties of year 2000 \n     repair work. While some projects can be more costly and time \n     consuming than originally expected, others can be \n     unexpectedly simple.\n       ``It's a welcome surprise,'' Garvey said. ``And we don't \n     get many of them in government.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/22/senate-section/article/S8805-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MICHIGAN ATTORNEY GENERAL FRANK J.

After spanning \nthe administrations of five U.S. Presidents, Attorney General Kelley \ndecided this spring not to seek re-election. Attorney General Kelly \nwill have served for 37 years when he retires at the end of 1998, \nleaving behind a long and distinguished career of service to the State \nof Michigan and its citizens.\n  A native of Detroit, Frank Kelley's career in law began after \nreceiving both his Bachelor of Arts and Juris Doctor degrees from the \nUniversity of Detroit. He practiced law in Alpena, Michigan, where he \nserved as both city attorney and the Alpena County Supervisor. In 1961, \nGovernor John Swainson appointed Kelley Michigan's 50th Attorney \nGeneral. The following year he was elected to his first term and has \nbeen reelected every term since.\n  Recognized as having an enduring commitment to good government, Frank \nKelley has been a champion of consumer causes, fighting to protect \nMichigan citizens from price gouging and fraud, and serving as a \nwatchdog on other consumer issues. Kelley also used his office to fight \nfor school desegregation and equal housing. He has been honored with \nseveral public service awards throughout his career, including the \nWyman Award from the National Association of Attorneys General.\n  In his almost four decades as Attorney General, Frank Kelley has \nearned the respect and admiration of those he worked with and the \nmillions he represented.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nGreater Salem Chamber of Commerce of Salem, Illinois, which will \ncelebrate its 100th anniversary on July 23.\n  A century ago, seven Illinoisans founded the Salem Business Men's \nAssociation, which was later renamed the Greater Salem Chamber of \nCommerce. As they stated in their original charter, its purpose was \n``to promote and encourage the location of manufactories and other \nindustries in our city * * * and to encourage in all proper and lawful \nways the development of our city and its surrounding country.'' It is \nhard to imagine that the seven founders could have foreseen how their \nassociation would grow and flourish into the present.\n  Today, the Chamber supports the community of Salem through numerous \nprojects ranging from economic development to educational support. In\n\n[[Page S8806]]\n\naddition, the Chamber serves as a network for local businesses and a \ncoordinator between them and the government of Salem. The Chamber also \nfosters a general sense of community in Salem, by welcoming new \nresidents and promoting consciousness of Salem's unique heritage.\n  In its role as coordinator, networker, and initiator, the Chamber has \nproven itself to be a crucial player in Salem's recent economic \nexpansion. The city of Salem can boast a net gain of 900 jobs over the \npast five years. These gains are due in no small part to the efforts of \nthe Chamber of Commerce.\n  With a century of success behind it, the Chamber is now working to \nsecure the future prosperity of Salem. The Chamber regularly notifies \nbusinesses of education and training opportunities so that Salem's \nlabor force can continue to adapt to the changing needs of the economy. \nFurther, the Chamber was instrumental in developing the Tech Prep \nprogram, which provides 25 local high school students with internships \nthat prepare them for future careers.\n  Throughout its history, the Chamber has proven itself to be an \nindispensable asset to the city of Salem and the state of Illinois. \nAgain, I would like to extend my congratulations to the Chamber and all \nof its members and hope that their second century is as successful as \ntheir first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/22/senate-section/article/S8805-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           BETHESDA SEVEN/CARD CLUB VISIT TO WASHINGTON, D.C.\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor seven people \nwho visited our Nation's capitol from June 12 to June 15, 1998. Frank \n``The Gin Mill'' Jonna, one of Gin's all time greatest players who \nbegan his career with Detroit Catholic Central and gained further fame \nas a Wayne State Tartar; Judy ``The Wicked Wick'' Jonna, one of \nDetroit's most prominent all around card players who was recently named \none of the 50 best players in Concan history; Joe ``The Professor'' \nSarafa, the legendary, steady utility man who never misses a beat when \nplaced in the lineup on a moment's notice; Mike ``The Dish'' Sarafa, \npossibly the most exalted and prominent card shark of all time, far and \naway the most political player on the tour; Mariann ``MB'' Sarafa, \ninitially named ``All Telcaif'' shopper but has since proven to be \n``All World'' (also known to win a dish or two now and then while \nscreaming ``Ayoooooon Michael''); Suzanne ``The Maoon killer'' Sarafa, \neasily the single greatest hustler in Concan history. She has been \nknown to ask, in the middle of a game . . . ``how many points do you \nneed to go down?'' while cramming money into that silly black wallet of \nhers; and Tony ``The Silent Winner'' Antone, the guy who never boasts, \nbrags, or rubs in his victories (and there are many).\n  Mr. President, it is also worthy to note that while this incredibly \nfun filled weekend was occurring, the Detroit Red Wings were on their \nway to winning their second straight Stanley Cup. The Bethesda Seven \nplayed a critical role in the Game 3 victory at the MCI Center by \nstrategically sitting in different areas of the arena so as to keep the \nthousands of Red Wings fans fired up.\n  Mr. President, I truly thank the Bethesda Seven for their visit. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/22/senate-section/article/S8806-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8806]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GEORGE OSTROM\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr President, I rise today to celebrate a true \nMontanan and a great friend on his 70th birthday.\n  Anyone who has come to know George Ostrom through his radio \nbroadcasts, his photographs, his writing, or who has been fortunate \nenough as I have to spend time personally with him has come away with a \nbetter understanding of the American West and Montana in particular.\n  I've known George for too many years to count. Among other things, he \nand I share a passion for hiking in general and for hiking in Glacier \nNational Park in particular. You see George has spent most of his 70 \nyears in and around the Park. To this day, he hikes with a group that \nhe affectionately calls the ``Over the Hill Gang.'' They hike once a \nweek when the weather permits, usually between 30 and 40 times a year.\n  For years, George has invited me to join his friends for a hike. But \nyou know how it is. Our schedules are busy and somehow I just never got \naround to it. Until last August. During our summer recess last year I \njoined up with George and his Over the Hill Gang. And what a day we \nhad. We told stories (all of them were true, of course), shared water \nbottles and talked about our families, our hopes and our dreams. Mr. \nPresident, it was a day I will not soon forget.\n  Over the years, I had heard all about George's many awards including \nthe honor bestowed on his weekly column ``The Trailwatcher'', which in \n1996 was selected as the best weekly humor column in the United States \nby the National Newspaper Association. And I had seen many of his \nphotographs of the Park in local and national magazines including \nSports Afield, Field and Stream and Sports Illustrated.\n  But on that hike I came to know George Ostrom the man. A funny and \nengaging gentleman who will not quit until he gets where he is going. \nThat spirit is Montana's spirit. An ideal that defines all of us. A \ncommon bond that all Montanans share.\n  Sadly, just a few days later, one of our group, Roger Dokken, fell to \nhis death while hiking a different trail. Because of our time together, \nhe was my friend--automatically. No politics, no agenda. Just two \npeople doing together what they enjoy.\n  Through the triumphs and tragedies of life, George and his Over the \nHill gang continue to hike on. They continue to embody what is good, \nwhat is right about Montana.\n  So Mr. President, as George and his family celebrate his 70th \nbirthday, I send my congratulations confident that George Ostrum is \nstill well shy of being over the hill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/22/senate-section/article/S8806-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8806-S8810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MANAGERS' AMENDMENT TO THE REGULATORY IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today Senator Thompson and I, as \nsponsors of S. 981, the Regulatory Improvement Act of 1998, are putting \ninto the Congressional Record a proposed amendment we will offer when \nS. 981 is brought to the Senate floor for consideration. The amendment \nreflects changes to the bill we have agreed to make in response to a \nnumber of concerns about the bill identified by the Administration and \nMembers of the Governmental Affairs Committee. We are putting it in the \nRecord at this time, to make the language available to the public and \npersons interested in this bill. We are also putting into the Record \ntoday the letter of July 15th from Acting OMB Director Jack Lew, \nstating that the Administration will sign the bill if the changes \nincluded in the Managers' Amendment are made and the bill passes both \nHouses in the same form. We welcome the support of the Administration \nin this effort and hope we can get the bill to the floor as soon as \npossible.\n  OMB stated in their analysis of costs and benefits of federal \nregulations in 1997 that regulation has enormous potential for good and \nharm. ``The only way,'' OMB said, ``we know to distinguish between the \nregulations that do good and those that cause harm is through careful \nassessment and evaluation of their benefits and costs.'' S. 981 would \nbuild that careful evaluation into the regulatory process of all the \nregulatory agencies. OMB estimated that of the significant or major \nregulations currently in effect, we have received approximately $300 \nbillion in benefits at a cost of some $280 billion. We know that \nthrough the appropriate use of cost benefit analysis and risk \nassessment we can improve those figures. In a well-respected analysis \nof 12 major EPA rules and the impact of cost-benefit analysis on those \nrules, the author, Richard Morgenstern, former Associate Assistant \nAdministrator of EPA and a visiting scholar at Resources for the \nFuture, concluded that in each of the 12 rule makings, economic \nanalysis helped reduce the costs of all the rules and at the same time \nhelped increase the benefits of 5 of the rules. Report after report \nacknowledges the importance of good cost-benefit analysis and risk \nassessment for all agencies. It's long past time to get these basic \nrequirements into statute. S. 981 offers us the best opportunity to do \nthat.\n  The Managers' Amendment Senator Thompson and I will be offering to S. \n981 reconfirms our intention that the bill not diminish or affect an \nagency's\n\n[[Page S8807]]\n\nresponsibility to carry out the purposes of the substantive statute \nunder which the agency is regulating. At the same time, the amendment \ndoes nothing to weaken the important requirements of the bill that \nagencies do a thorough and competent analysis of the costs and benefits \nof the major regulations they issue.\n  Mr. President, I believe S. 981 will significantly improve the \nregulatory process. If enacted, it will build confidence in the \nregulatory programs that are so important to this society's well-being, \nand will result in a better, and I believe a less contentious, \nregulatory process. Those of us who believe in the benefits of \nregulation to protect health and safety have a particular \nresponsibility to make sure that regulations are sensible and cost-\neffective. When they aren't, the regulatory programs--which are so \nvital to our health and well being--come under attack. By providing an \nopen regulatory process guided by reasonableness and common sense, we \nare protecting important programs from harmful attacks.\n  Mr. President, I ask that copies of three letters exchanged between \nthe Administration and Senator Thompson and me be printed in the \nRecord.\n  I am also pleased to announce that the Minority Leader, Senator \nDaschle, has been added as a cosponsor to the bill, S. 981.\n  The letters follow:\n\n\n                              Office of Management and Budget,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Fred Thompson,\n     Chairman, Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to provide the \n     Administration's views on S. 981, the Regulatory Improvement \n     Act of 1998. The Administration commends the thoughtful \n     effort by both you and Senator Levin to address numerous \n     concerns raised by the Administration and by others about the \n     bill as introduced.\n       The Administration believes strongly in responsible \n     regulatory reform. President Clinton's issuance of Executive \n     Order No. 12866 was predicated on his belief that government \n     should do a better job of assessing risks and evaluating \n     costs and benefits before issuing major rules. While we have \n     been skeptical of the need for further comprehensive \n     regulatory reform legislation at this time, we have sought to \n     work with the Committee to ensure that any bill advances the \n     President's regulatory reform principles without creating \n     unwarranted costs to taxpayers or needless burdens on \n     agencies acting to protect human health, safety, or the \n     environment.\n       The substitute bill issued earlier this month contains \n     significant improvements over last summer's draft. We very \n     much appreciate this effort. While the substitute is \n     responsive to many of our concerns, there are still serious \n     issues remaining. One of the problems with comprehensive \n     legislation is that so many different kinds of rulemaking are \n     affected. We want to be sure that any new law meets a simple \n     test: that it truly improves the regulatory system, and does \n     not impair--by creating more litigation, more red tape, and \n     more delay--the agencies' ability to do their jobs. We are \n     interested in working with you to see if we can find the \n     common ground.\n       After a full review of the substitute to S. 981, we have \n     concluded that the bill does not yet meet the test we have \n     articulated, and therefore the Administration would oppose \n     the bill if it were to be adopted in its current form. Our \n     concerns are briefly outlined below, and we have developed \n     and enclosed for your consideration a set of modifications to \n     the bill that would remedy these and other concerns while \n     remaining faithful to the sponsors' intent. As you know from \n     our past conversations, many of these are critical to \n     achieving an acceptable result.\n       1. Judicial Review. The Administration remains concerned \n     that the judicial review provisions would promote tactical \n     litigation over errors that were not material to the outcome \n     of a particular rulemaking. We know that this conflicts with \n     the sponsors' intent, as reflected in earlier hearing \n     discussions. To avoid additional litigation over major rules, \n     the troubling ambiguity in the current version of the bill \n     should be eliminated.\n       2. Implicit Supermandate. We have been pleased that the \n     sponsors of S. 981 consistently have agreed with the view \n     that regulatory reform legislation should not alter or modify \n     the substantive reach of particular statutes designed to \n     protect human health, safety, or the environment. We remain \n     concerned that the current language of the bill would be \n     construed to narrow the range of discretion available to \n     agencies under their existing statutory mandates to protect \n     human health, safety, or the environment. The range of \n     discretion available to agencies under current law must be \n     expressly preserved to avoid an implicit supermandate.\n       3. Risk Assessment. The Administration believes that, while \n     there have been improvements in Section 624, this section \n     needs to be revised still further to eliminate the imposition \n     of burdensome requirements where those requirements will not \n     enhance major rules. For example, section 624 includes in its \n     sweep an unbounded category of agency actions that are not \n     rulemakings, as well as major rules where Congress has not \n     predicated regulatory standards on risk assessment. These \n     should be excluded. In addition, the requirement for revision \n     of risk assessments threatens an endless and costly \n     analytical process, reopened with each new study, that would \n     provide additional fodder for protracted litigation. We also \n     remain concerned that certain provisions are too specifically \n     tailored to analysis of cancer risks, and are thus ill-suited \n     to other objectives, such as an evaluation of risks related \n     to environmental and natural resource protection, worker \n     safety, or airworthiness.\n       4. Peer Review. The Administration is very concerned about \n     requiring peer review in contexts where the process would add \n     significantly to costs and delays of the regulatory process \n     without any foreseeable benefit. For example, the requirement \n     that cost-benefit analyses be subject to peer review would \n     add little to the review already performed by the Office of \n     Management and Budget in our regulatory review process. In \n     addition, the requirement that peer review be entirely \n     independent of the regulating agency would displace well-\n     established and credible peer review mechanisms, while making \n     good peer review virtually impossible in highly specialized \n     subject areas (e.g. nuclear safety). We also believe that the \n     statute should require no more than one round of peer review \n     for each major rule.\n       5. Review of Past Regulations. While the Committee \n     responded to many of the Administration's earlier concerns \n     about review of past regulations, the current version of the \n     bill creates two different, uncoordinated and likely \n     duplicative processes for the review of past regulations, \n     imposing a major burden on agencies and needless expense on \n     taxpayers. The second of these should be deleted, and the \n     cycle of review in the first should be set at 10 years.\n       6. Needless Burdens. A number of the bill's requirements \n     would impose substantial costs on agencies where there would \n     be no conceivable benefit to the public or regulated \n     entities. For example, the bill imposes its analytical \n     requirements and review requirements even where the costs of \n     compliance with the regulation have been incurred by the \n     regulated community and no costs can be avoided by selecting \n     a different regulatory option. Our proposed changes address \n     other examples as well.\n       7. Definitions and other issues. There are several \n     definitions and other provisions that need to be added or \n     modified to ensure clarity, to discourage unwarranted \n     litigation that would delay new safeguards, to protect the \n     constitutional prerogatives of the President and the \n     deliberative process within the Executive Branch, and to \n     eliminate unwarranted burdens on agencies. While many of \n     these changes appear minor, it would be difficult to \n     overstate their importance to us in evaluating the cumulative \n     effect of this bill.\n       In developing revisions to the bill that would address our \n     concerns, we have sought to suggest changes that are \n     consistent with our understanding of the sponsors' intent and \n     with the spirit of our very constructive discussions with the \n     Committee staff. We would welcome a further opportunity to \n     work with you before the bill is reported by the Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Franklin D. Raines,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                            Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 1, 1998.\n     Mr. Jack Lew,\n     Director Designate, Office of Management and Budget, \n         Executive Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Lew: In March of this year, Franklin Raines, then \n     Director of OMB, sent us a letter expressing the \n     Administration's views on S. 981, the Regulatory Improvement \n     Act, shortly before its scheduled mark-up in the Governmental \n     Affairs Committee. Mr. Raines stated that while ``the \n     Administration believes strongly in responsible regulatory \n     reform,'' it has ``serious issues remaining'' with respect to \n     S. 981. Mr. Raines then enclosed ``a set of modifications to \n     the bill that would remedy'' these concerns.\n       As you know, the bill was reported by the Committee on a \n     vote of 10 to 5, and now awaits consideration by the full \n     Senate. In the interest of addressing the Administration's \n     concerns so we can join together in support of S. 981, we \n     have enclosed our response to each of the proposed \n     modifications included in the attachment to the March 6th \n     letter from Mr. Raines. Our effort has been undertaken with \n     the objective of seeking to eliminate any cause for confusion \n     or misinterpretation about the specific provisions in the \n     bill while doing no harm to the important remedial and \n     beneficial effects of our legislation. We would be willing to \n     offer a Manager's Amendment on the floor during Senate \n     consideration of S. 981 which would make these changes. \n     Because such an amendment would meet your concerns, we would \n     do so with the understanding that the Administration would \n     then support this important legislation.\n       The path to this point has not been easy. Regulatory reform \n     legislation over the years has engendered a great deal of \n     distrust and friction among the interested parties. Yet we \n     feel deeply that this moderate proposal will bring important \n     analytical tools and openness to the very complex issues \n     involved in\n\n[[Page S8808]]\n\n     federal regulation and will give the American people the \n     effective and efficient protections they deserve. If it's \n     true that nothing worth doing is ever easy, then S. 981 may \n     prove to be one of the most valuable pieces of legislation \n     we'll have enacted in a long time.\n       We welcome your support and look forward to your response.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin,\n       Senior Member.\n     Fred Thompson,\n       Chairman.\n       Enclosure.\n       1.

The adequacy of compliance \n     with the specific requirements of this subchapter shall not \n     otherwise be grounds for remanding or invalidating a rule \n     under this subchapter.

Carl Levin,\n     Committee on Governmental Affairs,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for your letter of July 1, \n     1998, in which you respond to the views on S. 981 that we \n     expressed in former OMB Director Frank Raines' letter of \n     March 6, 1998.\n       President Clinton has been a strong supporter of \n     responsible regulatory reform. In addition to signing into \n     law a number of important pieces of reform legislation, he \n     and Vice President Gore are taking a wide range of \n     administrative steps to improve the regulatory process. For \n     example, under the guidance of Executive Order 12866, \n     agencies are developing flexible performance standards and \n     using market incentives whenever possible; are applying \n     benefit-cost analysis to achieve objectives in the most cost-\n     effective manner; and are reaching out to the affected \n     parties, particularly our State and local partners, to \n     understand better the intended and unintended consequences of \n     a proposed regulatory action. Under the leadership of the \n     Vice President's National Partnership for Reinventing \n     Government, agencies are improving delivery of services, \n     reducing red tape, and reforming practices to focus on \n     customer service. The Administration's goal in these actions \n     is to streamline and reduce the burden of government on its \n     citizens, improve services, and restore the basic trust of \n     public in its government.\n       The debate on comprehensive regulatory reform legislation \n     is one that has sparked great passion and has provoked, as \n     you aptly note in your letter, ``distrust and friction among \n     the interested parties.'' We heartily agree with you that, to \n     say the least, ``[t]he path to this point has not been \n     easy.'' In part, this has been the result of earlier versions \n     of this legislation proposed by others that sought not to \n     improve the nation's regulatory system, but to burden and \n     undermine it. In a variety of ways these bills would have \n     created obstacles and hurdles to the government's ability to \n     function effectively and to protect the health, safety, and \n     environment of its citizens. In particular, these bills would \n     have created a supermandate, undoing the many protections for \n     our citizens that are carefully crafted into specific \n     statutes. In addition, strict judicial review and complex \n     analytic, risk assessment, peer review, and lookback \n     provisions would have hampered rather than helped the \n     government's ability to make reasonable decisions and would \n     have opened the door to new rounds of endless litigation.\n       We appreciate your thoughtful efforts over the past year to \n     respond to issues that we and others have raised. In your \n     latest letter you continue to take seriously our concerns. \n     Indeed, the changes you indicate that you are willing to make \n     would resolve our concerns, and if the bill emerges from the \n     Senate and House as you now propose, with no changes, the \n     President would find it acceptable and sign it.\n       I should note, however, that our experience with past \n     efforts to resolve these differences suggests that good ideas \n     and the resolution of differences can be destroyed during the \n     long process of getting a bill to the President's desk, and \n     the nuances and balance that we have all sought in this \n     legislation could be easily disrupted. Nanny of the terms \n     used carry great meaning, and further modification is likely \n     to renew the concerns that have animated our past opposition \n     to bills of this type. Accordingly, we look forward to \n     working with you to ensure that any bill the Congress passes \n     on this subject is\n\n[[Page S8809]]\n\n     fully consistent with the one on which we have reached \n     agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jacob J. Lew,\n                                                  Acting Director.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to ask my colleagues for their \nhelp to bring much-needed improvements to our federal regulatory \nsystem. In March, the Governmental Affairs Committee favorably reported \nS. 981, the ``Regulatory Improvement Act,'' by a 10-5 vote. At the time \nof the markup, the administration sent a letter to me and Senator Levin \nexpressing a number of concerns with the bill. Over the past few \nmonths, we have worked to resolve those concerns, which largely \ninvolved adding clarifying language to the bill. In addition, some \nsections of the bill were modified, and a couple were dropped. On July \n16, we received a letter from Jack Lew, the Acting OMB Director, on \nbehalf of the administration. The letter says the administration \nsupports the legislation with the proposed changes and will cooperate \nwith us to pass it. These changes are explained in the accompanying \nsummary of the managers' amendment that Senator Levin and I would \nsupport. I am pleased that the President recognizes that we need this \nlegislation to deliver the effective and efficient regulatory system \nthat the American people expect and deserve.\n  Most of us recall the partisan and ultimately destructive debate on \nthis issue in the last Congress. Reforming regulation is an area \nfraught with distrust. It is tempting for opponents of reform to try to \nscore political points by scare tactics. We have to set aside political \nposturing if we're going to get the job done. Just last week, former \nMajority Leader Howard Baker told us, ``it ill behooves America's \nleaders to invent disputes for the sake of political advantage, or to \ninveigh carelessly against the motives and morals of one's political \nadversaries. America expects better of its leaders than this, and \ndeserves better.'' I hope we heed that good advice.\n  There's no doubt that improving the regulatory process is one of the \ntoughest challenges we face. Regulation affects virtually every aspect \nof our lives. There are over 130,000 pages of federal regulations, and \n60 agencies continue to issue new rules at a rate of 4,000 a year. The \ncosts are hundreds of billions of dollars annually, and the public \nexpects better results. As the costs of regulation rise with public \nexpectations of better results, the need is greater than ever for a \nsmarter way of regulating. We have to find ways to do more good while \nreducing the waste in the current system.\n  The evidence is overwhelming that we can achieve greater benefits at \nfar less cost by regulating smarter. Hearings of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee, investigations of the General Accounting Office, the \nwork of other congressional committees, and many scholarly studies show \na striking consensus on this point. Our Committee also has found that \nthe administration's Executive Order 12866 and other initiatives to \nreinvent regulation have not been as effective as was hoped.\n  I want to thank the 19 cosponsors who have joined me and Senator \nLevin to improve the regulatory process. The Regulatory Improvement Act \nwill promote the public's right to know, improve the quality of \ngovernment decisions, and make government more accountable to the \npeople it serves. Ultimately, it will help improve the quality of our \nlives. That is why we have the support of State and local government, \nbusinesses of all sizes, farmers, educational organizations, think \ntanks, scholars, and the administration. We have a rare opportunity to \nreform the regulatory process. Let's pull together and get the job \ndone.\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask that a summary of S. 981 and a \nsummary of the proposed manager's amendment be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n          Summary of Levin-Thompson Regulatory Improvement Act\n\n       The Levin-Thompson regulatory reform bill would put into \n     statute requirements for cost-benefit analysis and risk \n     assessment of major rules and executive oversight of the \n     rulemaking process. It builds on the bipartisan Roth-Glenn \n     bill unanimously reported out of the Governmental Affairs \n     Committee in 1995.\n       It requires agencies to do a cost-benefit analysis when \n     issuing rules that cost $100 million or have other \n     significant impacts. The agency must determine whether the \n     benefits of the rule justify its costs; whether the rule is \n     more cost-effective, or provides greater net benefits, than \n     other regulatory options considered by the agency; and \n     whether the rule adopts a flexible regulatory option. If the \n     agency determines that the rule does not do so, the agency is \n     required to explain the reasons why it selected the rule, \n     including any statutory provision that required the agency to \n     select the rule. If the rule involves a risk to health, \n     safety or the environment, the bill requires the agency to do \n     a quality risk assessment to analyze the benefits of the \n     rule. Risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses for rules \n     costing $500 million would undergo independent peer review.\n       During the cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment, the \n     rulemaking agency is required to consider substitution \n     risks--that is, risks that could be expected to result from \n     the implementation of the regulatory option selected by the \n     agency--and to compare the risk being regulated with other \n     risks with which the public may be familiar.\n       In presenting the cost-benefit analysis and risk \n     assessment, the rulemaking agency is required to present the \n     results of the analysis and assessment in a clear and \n     understandable form, including an executive summary of: the \n     expected benefits and costs of the rule and the agency's \n     cost-benefit determinations; the risk addressed by the rule \n     and the results of any risk assessment; the benefits and \n     costs of the other regulatory options considered by the \n     agency; and the key assumptions and scientific or economic \n     information upon which the agency relied.\n       The cost-benefit analysis, cost-benefit determinations, and \n     risk assessment are required to be included in the rulemaking \n     record and to be considered by the court, to the extent \n     relevant, only in determining whether the final rule is \n     arbitrary and capricious. In addition, if the agency fails to \n     perform the cost-benefit analysis, risk assessment or peer \n     review, the court may remand or invalidate the rule, giving \n     due regard to prejudicial error, and in any event shall order \n     the agency to perform it.\n       The bill codifies the review procedure now conducted by the \n     Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) and \n     requires public disclosure of OIRA's review process.\n       Finally, the bill requires the Director of OMB to contract \n     for a study on the comparison of risks to human health, \n     safety and the environment and a study to develop a common \n     basis for risk communication with respect to carcinogens and \n     noncarcinogens and the incorporation of risk assessments into \n     cost-benefit analyses.\n\n           Summary of Proposed Managers' Amendment to S. 981\n\n       Senator Levin and Senator Thompson plan to offer a \n     Managers' Amendment when S. 981 is brought to the floor for \n     Senate consideration. The Amendment would include the \n     following:\n\n\n                           1. Judicial Review\n\n       The bill as reported requires a court to consider the cost-\n     benefit analysis, cost-benefit determinations, and risk \n     assessment in determining whether the final rule is arbitrary \n     and capricious. The bill as reported also requires a court to \n     remand or invalidate a rule if the agency fails to perform \n     the cost-benefit analysis, cost-benefit determinations or \n     risk assessment, or to provide for peer review as required by \n     S. 981. The Managers' Amendment modifies that requirement by \n     giving the court the discretion to remand or invalidate the \n     rule. The Managers' Amendment also adds a specific clarifying \n     sentence that the adequacy of compliance with the specific \n     requirements for performing the cost-benefit analysis, risk \n     assessment, and peer review is not otherwise independent \n     grounds for remanding or invalidating a rule. The Managers' \n     Amendment also requires a court to order an agency to perform \n     the cost-benefit analysis, cost-benefit determinations, risk \n     assessment, or peer review whenever the agency fails to do \n     so, even if the court allows the rule to take effect.\n\n\n                   2. Relationship to Other Statutes\n\n       The Managers' Amendment adds two additional provisions to \n     the savings clause in order to reiterate that S. 981 does not \n     contain a ``supermandate'' that would override or alter the \n     substantive standards of the statute under which the rule is \n     being issued. The Managers' Amendment confirms that S. 981 \n     does not alter the range of regulatory options the agency has \n     authority to adopt under the statute authorizing the agency \n     to promulgate the rule or the deference otherwise accorded by \n     the courts to the agency in construing such statute pursuant \n     to the Chevron decision.\n\n\n                           3. Review of Rules\n\n       The bill as reported contained two provisions for the \n     review of existing rules: one for major rules and one for \n     rules affecting small businesses and small governments. The \n     Managers' Amendment strikes both review of rules provisions. \n     S. 981 will impose new and important responsibilities on \n     federal agencies to conduct their rulemakings with greater \n     care and thoroughness. In order to direct the resources of \n     the agencies to fully carrying out these requirements, the \n     provisions for the review of existing rules were stuck. Of \n     course, agencies remain free to review existing rules under \n     the Regulatory Flexibility Act on their own initiative, at \n     the request of an interested party, or pursuant to \n     Presidential directive.\n\n\n                           4. Risk Assessment\n\n       The bill as reported requires a quality risk assessment to \n     be performed for each major\n\n[[Page S8810]]\n\n     rule with a primary purpose to address risks to health, \n     safety or the environment, as well as for risk assessments \n     that are not the basis for a rulemaking and that the OMB \n     Director determines may have a substantial impact on public \n     policy or the economy. The Managers' Amendment narrows the \n     coverage of the bill with respect to risk assessments that \n     are not the basis of a rulemaking to those risk assessments \n     that the Director anticipates are likely to have an annual \n     effect on the economy of $100 millon or more.\n\n\n                             5. Peer review\n\n       The bill as reported requires independent peer review of \n     the cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment for each major \n     rule. The Managers' Amendment would modify the application of \n     peer review of the cost-benefit analysis to only those rules \n     that the agency or OMB Director reasonably anticipates are \n     likely to have an annual effect on the economy of $500 \n     million or more.\n       The Managers' Amendment clarifies that members of agency \n     advisory boards required by statute and persons who serve as \n     contractors or grantees to the agency conducting the peer \n     review are not precluded from serving as peer reviewers \n     solely because of the requirement that the peer reviewers be \n     ``independent of the agency.'' The Managers' Amendment also \n     claifies that only one peer review of a risk assessment and \n     cost-benefit analysis is required by S. 981.\n\n\n                            6. Net benefits\n\n       The Managers' Amendment clarifies that application of a net \n     benefits analysis under S. 981 is not intended to be limited \n     to only quantifiable benefits; S. 981 requires the net \n     benefits analysis to include consideration of nonquantifiable \n     as well as quantifiable benefits.\n\n\n                          7. Substitution risk\n\n       The Managers' Amendment, in an effort to clarify the scope \n     of responsibility required of an agency in assessing \n     applicable substitution risks, incorporates the language in \n     the bill used to define costs and benefits. Thus, \n     substitution risk is defined in the Managers' Amendment as \n     ``a reasonably identifiable significant increased risk to \n     health, safety or the environment expected to result from a \n     regulatory option.'' The definition also makes it clear that \n     substitution risk does not include ``risks attributable to \n     the effect of an option on the income of individuals.''\n\n\n                             8. Exemptions\n\n       The bill as reported exempts from coverage of the \n     legislation ``a rule or agency action that authorizes the \n     introduction into commerce, or recognizes the marketable \n     status of, a product.'' The Managers' Amendment both expands \n     and limits this exemption. It expands it by adding \n     ``removal'' of a product as well as ``introduction;'' it \n     limits this exemption by applying it only to rules ``under \n     the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.''\n\n\n                                9. Other\n\n       The Managers' Amendment would make a number of other \n     technical or minor changes to the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/22/senate-section/article/S8806-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nJOHN D. ODEGARD, RECIPIENT OF THE FAA 1998 EXCELLENCE IN AVIATION AWARD\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nJohn D. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences at the University of North \nDakota, and its dean and founder, John Odegard who have been selected \nby the Federal Aviation Administration to receive its 1998 Excellence \nin Aviation award. In addition to being one of North Dakota's most \noutstanding entrepreneurs, John is also a personal friend of mine and I \ncan attest to the fact that this honor is truly deserved. It accurately \nreflects the contributions that John and the college have made to \naviation education and research to make flying safer in our country.\n  Announcing the award, FAA Administrator Jane Garvey noted,\n\n       The FAA formally recognizes significant aviation research \n     accomplishments each year through the Excellence in Aviation \n     award. This research plays a prominent role in ensuring that \n     the nation's airspace system remains the safest in the world.\n       ``Aviation weather research conducted at the John D. \n     Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences contributed to the \n     development of the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar, which is \n     used to detect wind shear near airports. The aerospace \n     school, which has conducted aviation research, education and \n     training programs for over 30 years, participates in a FAA-\n     sponsored research project to chart wind conditions at the \n     Juneau, Alaska, airport.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I join my colleague, Senator Dorgan, in congratulating \nDean Odegard on this exceptional and well deserved honor from the FAA.\n  Dean Odegard and the Odegard School, which this year was named in his \nhonor by a grateful state, are true national assets. John's work \nbuilding the School at the University of North Dakota is one of the \ngreat accomplishments in North Dakota in my lifetime. His vision and \nability to make his dreams a reality sets him apart in all of higher \neducation and aviation. He began his career in 1968 with two small \nplanes and a dozen students and transformed this fledgling operation \ninto the premier aerospace training facility in the world with 1400 \nstudents, a fleet of 85 aircraft and 16 flight simulators.\n  The contributions of John Odegard and his staff and faculty to \naviation safety in the development of new pilot training programs is a \nmajor achievement. His leadership in the creation of university-based \nair traffic controller training is providing our country with superior \nnew young controllers that our country's air space system desperately \nneeds. As the Administrator noted in her citation, UND's work in FAA-\nsponsored atmospheric research has resulted in the Terminal Doppler \nWeather Radar that is now making air travel even safer in the United \nStates.\n  It is also important to note that the contributions made by the \nOdegard School to improvements in national aviation safety are a direct \nproduct of the investment the Federal government made almost 20 years \nago. It was the FAA's Airway Science Program, begun in the early \n1980's, that helped build the Odegard School's facilities on the \nUniversity of North Dakota campus. Those investments, of which we are \nvery proud, are paying dividends today in lives saved. That's what the \nFAA award recognizes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Within our state, John's achievements are well \nrecognized. The North Dakota State Board of Higher Education has \nhonored John by placing his name on the aviation college at the \nUniversity of North Dakota. The Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences is \none of our state's flagship programs and draws students from every \nstate in the nation as well as many foreign countries. Airlines from \naround the world send its pilots to be trained at UND. Its size and \nnumber of employees means it is also a significant economic asset and \nhas served to help draw the aerospace industry to North Dakota.\n  Again, I want to offer my congratulations to John and all his faculty \nand staff at the Odegard School. We look forward to their continued \ncontributions to the aerospace industry, not only in North Dakota but \nthroughout the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/22/senate-section/article/S8810-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8810-S8811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RETIREMENT FROM CONGRESS OF REPRESENTATIVE THOMAS J. MANTON\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, yesterday, a dear friend and \ncolleague, Representative Thomas J. Manton, announced his intention to \nretire at the end of the 105th Congress, saying, ``I have worked for \nthe citizens of this Nation, New York City, and Queens for most of my \nadult life.'' Indeed he has. Fourteen years as a Member of Congress. \nFifteen years before that as a member of the New York City Council. \nFive years as an officer in the New York City Police Department. And \ntwo years as a Marine Corps flight navigator on active duty during \nKorea.\n  His departure is bittersweet for me. I take solace from the fact that \nhe will continue to chair the Queens County Democratic Organization, a \npost he has held with honor and distinction for the past twelve years. \nAnd I am happy that he and his wife Diane will have more time ``to \nenjoy life and travel,'' as he put it; to enjoy his four children and--\nas of July 5th--his four grandchildren. But we here will miss his calm \nand steady demeanor, and his unwavering commitment to ``moderate \ngovernment,'' which is, as Alexander Hamilton observed, the font of \nreal liberty.\n  For the most part, I will leave it to others to recite his \nlegislative accomplishments, which are legion. But I would highlight \nhis service as co-chairman of the Congressional Ad-Hoc Committee on \nIrish Affairs. The bi-partisan Ad-Hoc Committee was established in 1977 \nto promote peace and justice in Northern Ireland. His interest is \nnatural, for both his parents were Irish immigrants. The task, of \ncourse, enormous. But under Tom's steady leadership, the Ad-Hoc \nCommittee made possible implementation of the McBride Principles. And \nthe Ad-Hoc Committee had a huge role in this year's Good Friday Irish \nPeace Accord. Few men or women have had such positive effect in such a \ndevastated and forlorn part of the world.\n  Horace remarked that ``We rarely find anyone . . . who, content with \nhis\n\n[[Page S8811]]\n\n life, can retire from the world like a satisfied guest.'' Tom Manton \nis the rare individual who can retire from Congress like a ``satisfied \nguest.''

Mr. President, I would like to call the \nattention of my colleagues to a national health epidemic that kills \n40,000 American men every year and strikes hundreds of thousands more \neach year--prostate cancer. I am concerned about this disease and its \nimpact on American men, particularly its disproportionate impact on \nAfrican-American men.\n  For too long prostate cancer has been a silent killer. Too little has \nbeen known about it. Too little was said about it. Too little has been \ndone about it. Fortunately, in recent years many prominent national \nfigures like Senator Bob Dole, General Norman Schwarzkopf, Arnold \nPalmer, Sidney Poitier, Andy Grove, and Harry Belafonte have come \nforward to discuss their personal battles with prostate cancer. The \nadmirable leadership of these men and others has helped educate the \ncountry about the importance of screening and early diagnosis of \nprostate cancer, and the need for all of us to do more to fight this \ndisease.\n  Mr. President, prostate cancer is the most commonly occurring non-\nskin cancer in the United States. In 1997, more than 200,000 men were \ndiagnosed with prostate cancer and 41,800 died of the disease. Every \nthree minutes a new case of prostate cancer is diagnosed and every 13 \nminutes someone dies from the disease. While it is often thought to be \nan older man's disease, younger men are increasingly diagnosed with \nprostate cancer. In fact, about 20 percent of prostate cancers are now \noccurring in men between the ages of 40 and 60.\n  Although prostate cancer accounts for approximately 20 percent of all \nnew non-skin cancers, it receives less than four percent of federal \ncancer research funding. In 1996, approximately the same number of \nlives were lost due to prostate cancer breast cancer and AIDS. In 1997, \nhowever, while prostate cancer deaths continued to rise, deaths due to \nbreast cancer and AIDS declined. Nevertheless, the federal commitment \nto prostate cancer research has not even kept pace with these other \npriorities.\n  Clearly, I am not advocating reduced funding for breast cancer or \nAIDS research programs. I have been one of the major champions of \nbreast cancer and AIDS research funding. Rather, I use these \ncomparisons to make the point that much more must be done to address \nthe prostate cancer epidemic as well. How can we face the hundreds of \nthousands of men and their families who are daily affected by prostate \ncancer knowing, for instance, that more money was spent to make the \nmovie Titanic--more than $200 million--than was spent in 1997 by the \nfederal government for prostate cancer research--only $120 million.\n  The possibility and the fear of developing prostate cancer is common \nto all men. One in five American men will develop prostate cancer \nduring his lifetime. As frightening as that statistic may be for the \ngeneral population, it is even more pointed in the African-American \ncommunity. African-American men have a prostate cancer incidence more \nthan 30 percent higher than for any other ethnic groups in this country \nand the highest in the world.\n  The prostate cancer mortality rate for African-American men is more \nthan twice that of white American men. Researchers do not yet know why \nthis is true and do not yet have answers to these and the many other \nquestions about prostate cancer. For example, it is not clear which \nprostate cancer patients will benefit from traditional treatments, like \nsurgery or radiation. The economic status of many African-American men, \nand limited access to medical counseling further complicated treatment \ndecisions.\n  Those who are devoted to relieving the burden of prostate cancer in \nthe African-American community, including scientists, health care \nproviders, national organizations, community leaders, and survivors \nalike, are united in their desire to find answers to these questions. I \nam particularly pleased with the leadership of many national \norganizations in informing the country about the impact of prostate \ncancer in the African-American community. In November of last year, the \nAmerican Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, and the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention sponsored A Leadership Council on \nProstate Cancer in the African-American Community. In cooperation with \nthe Intercultural Cancer Council, the National Black Leadership \nInitiative on Cancer, the National Prostate Cancer Coalition and the \n100 Black Men of America, the Leadership Conference proposed a \nblueprint for action that aims to solve the problem of prostate cancer \nin the African-American community.\n  These private organizations--and many others--are working very hard \nat the community and national levels to see that the prostate cancer \nepidemic is addressed. That a letter that 29 organizations representing \nthe African-American community sent to Congress in May laying out a \nresearch funding agenda to attack this problem be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                     May 20, 1998.\n       Dear Member of Congress: We have come together as \n     organizations representing the African American community to \n     develop a united response to one of the most significant \n     medical and social challenges facing our country today--the \n     severe burden of prostate cancer in African American men. \n     Together, our organizations represent millions of Americans. \n     We strongly urge you to support significant increases in \n     federal funding for prostate cancer research.\n       African American men have the highest rate of prostate \n     cancer mortality in the world. In 1994, the prostate cancer \n     mortality rate for African American men was at least two \n     times higher than rates for all other racial and ethnic \n     groups in the U.S. Overall, prostate cancer is the most \n     commonly diagnosed cancer in America, excluding skin cancer, \n     and it is the second leading cause of cancer death among men. \n     Last year, 41,800 men died from prostate cancer and 209,000 \n     were diagnosed with the disease.\n       Federal funding for prostate cancer research has been \n     woefully inadequate, particularly given the devastating \n     impact of the disease. We therefore strongly urge you to \n     support increased appropriations for FY 1999 prostate cancer \n     research programs, including the following.\n       Department of Defense (DOD)--The DOD conducts highly \n     successful peer reviewed research programs that are renowned \n     for their innovative and efficient use of resources. We call \n     on Congress to fund this innovative program at $175 million \n     for FY 1999--a level which is in the middle range of other \n     Congressionally-directed medical research programs at DOD.\n       National Institutes of Health (NIH)--Prostate cancer \n     research at NIH has not reflected the incidence and mortality \n     rates of the disease. We believe prostate cancer research \n     funding at NIH must be substantially increased to a level \n     commensurate with the impact prostate cancer has on the \n     American population.\n       Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)--The CDC \n     supports the development and communication of health messages \n     about prostate cancer screening and early detection, \n     particularly focusing on African American men and their \n     families. We believe the CDC appropriation for prostate \n     cancer must be doubled--to $10 million--so that it can engage \n     in aggressive outreach and education and health \n     communications research, particularly for high risk groups.\n       We believe that the research programs of the National \n     Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, and the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offer great \n     promise in the fight against prostate cancer in the African \n     American community. We urge you to support our request by \n     increasing funding for these critically important programs.\n           Sincerely,\n       David S.

Porterfield, Chairman and CEO, Us Too \n     International.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. The compelling case this letter makes for dramatic \nincreases in funding for prostate cancer research brings me to the last \npoint I want to make. This Congress, this country, must do better. We \nmust do more in the fight to bring a cure for prostate cancer.\n  Just last year alone, the National Prostate Cancer Coalition \nidentified more than $250 million of worthwhile prostate cancer \nresearch that was not conducted due to lack of funding. This inadequacy \nin funding is an unconscionable neglect of men with prostate cancer and \ntheir families. There needs to be an increased commitment to prostate \ncancer research.\n  In June, President Clinton announced the release of $60 million for \nprostate cancer research grants in a promising new Department of \nDefense program modeled after the very successful DoD breast cancer \nprogram. Yet, the House has proposed to cut 75 percent of the funding \nfor this important cancer research program. The House position will \nvirtually kill a program that is critical to finding breakthroughs and \na potential cure. The current Senate position also shrinks research \nfunding for this program to $40 million. Instead, we should increase \nthe funding to at least $80 million in order to maintain this ground \nbreaking research program.\n  While it is also important to increase the amount of prostate cancer \nresearch conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the Congress \nmust not neglect the Department of Defense prostate cancer research \nprogram. We must not dash the hopes of prostate cancer patients, their \nfamilies, and their supporters. As is the case with the DoD's breast \ncancer efforts, this program supports targeted research that \ncomplements the work of the NCI and is a necessary component of an \noverall national effort to find effective treatments for this disease.\n  Mr. President, to do anything less would send a devastating message \nto the men living and dying from this disease, to their families, and \nto the scientific community that is working to find a cure. I call on \nthis Congress to equip researchers with the tools they badly need to \nend this epidemic. For the one million Americans currently diagnosed \nwith prostate cancer and their families, increased research funding is \ndesperately needed now. Each day, more and more people will be \naffected. We cannot turn a deaf ear to their cries for help. It is time \nfor the country and the Congress to make a commitment to equity in \nfunding for prostate cancer research. It is time for us to give the \nresearchers the resources they need to eradicate this silent \nkiller.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/22/senate-section/article/S8811-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JULY 23, 1998\n\n  Mr. GREGG.
