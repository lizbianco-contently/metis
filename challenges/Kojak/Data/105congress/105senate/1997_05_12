We \nlive in a time in which there are suspicion and cynicism about politics \nand politicians. Today, we claim the primary etymology of politics as \nthe science of government and not the denigrated definition of \nmanipulated maneuvering. We praise You for the women and men of this \nSenate who have accepted politics as a high calling from You and use \npolitical process as a way to solve the perplexities of our time and \nensure the full potential of Your plan for our beloved Nation. Help \nthem to envision and enable Your very best for the spiritual and moral \ncharacter of the United States. We believe that character does count. \nMay the Nation be able to turn to this Senate for an example of God-\ncentered character. With the same intentionality help the Senators to \nconfront the soul-sized issues that hold progress at bay. Grant them \ncourage and power for the facing of this hour. May they lead a movement \nand not just preserve a bureaucracy. We turn to You for Your wisdom to \ntackle perplexities great and small. Help us to do that with a sense of \nmission and conviction that politics is a ministry ordained by You. In \nthe name of our Lord and Saviour.

Mr. President, it is a delight to be able to come here \non the day following Mother's Day to talk about the very best present \nfor Mother's Day that the U.S. Senate could possibly give to the \nfamilies of America.\n  I am talking about the need for families to be able to spend time \ntogether, and that need is reflected in the fact that families are \ncomposed differently than they used to be, that instead of having just \none family member earning the living for the family, many family \nmembers work. As we have an increase in the number of family members \nthat are in the work force, it becomes more and more important for us \nto have the capacity for those family members to adjust and arrange \ntheir schedules in ways that allow for the right kind of time that \nparents can spend with their children.\n  This is extremely important, because I think all of us know that the \nsuccess of America depends far more on America's families and what \nhappens there than depends on America's Government. The job of \nGovernment is to make it possible for families to do the job of \nfamilies. And when people in families can do their jobs well, the jobs \nof those of us in Government will be much easier.\n  Who among us really does not think that the crime problem is in many \nrespects a family problem? Who among us does not really understand that \nthe welfare problem is really in many respects a family problem? Who \namong us does not understand that if we would really have and maximize \nand increase and enhance the capacity of families to work together as \nfamilies that we would not elevate substantially the way in which we \nlive in the United States?\n  That is why the Family Friendly Workplace Act, Senate bill 4, S. 4, \nis on the top of our agenda. That is why it is\n\n[[Page S4292]]\n\none of our priority measures. That is why we debated the bill \nsubstantially in the last several weeks. That is why on Friday we spent \ntime talking about S. 4. And that is why S. 4 will be the topic of our \ndebate tomorrow morning when we return to the bill.\n  It is an understanding that we need strong families and that the \nworkplace competes with the home place. We need to make sure that the \nlaws of this country do not keep people from spending the kind of high-\nquality time they need to spend with each other and their children.\n  It is a really big problem for families, now that two breadwinners \nare in the average family. But think of how much more important \nflexible working arrangements are when there is only one adult in the \nfamily? To be able to trade an hour on Friday afternoon or work an \nextra hour on Friday so you can take an hour off on Monday to see your \nchild get an award at the school or to watch your daughter play in a \nsoccer game or your son play in a football game in the afternoon during \nworking times normally is a tremendous asset if we could just give \npeople that kind of flexibility. And, you know, so many more of our \nchildren's activities are now in the afternoons.\n  Arlyce Robinson, one of the individuals who testified before our \ncommittee, said she had four grandchildren and many of their activities \nare now scheduled, in the Washington, DC, area, in the afternoon \nbecause it is much safer to have activities during daylight hours. She \ncannot see them. She wants to see them. She wants to support them. She \nwants to reinforce their positive behavior. She needs to be able to \nhave the flexible working arrangements to do it.\n\n  The family has changed. This chart shows just how things have almost \ntotally flipped. Back in 1938, when we developed our labor laws--1938--\nonly 2 out of every dozen--only 2 out of 12--women with school-aged \nchildren were working outside the home. Now only three such women are \ninside the home. So that instead of having two outside the home, we \nhave nine outside the home. So we have had a real change. This has been \na sea change. And the stresses that have come to families have really \nbeen substantial.\n  Let us take a look at how times have changed. Only 2 out of 12 women \nworked outside the home with school-aged children; today, 9 out of 12 \nwomen with school-aged children work outside the home.\n  Families are stressed. A recent poll taken in the week before \nMother's Day: 91 percent of the mothers said flexible working \narrangements would be very important to them. They understand, \nbasically, on a close to 10-to-1 ratio, how important it would be.\n  Interestingly enough, Federal workers have flextime. Federal workers, \nthe ratio of their response to a study conducted about flextime in the \nFederal Government, at a 10-to-1 rate, they said this is a good thing. \nFederal workers have had this since 1978.\n  As a matter of fact, it is the hourly workers of America that do not \nhave this. The guys in the walnut boardroom, you know, the guys who \ntake time off to play golf on Friday afternoon, they have flexible \nworking arrangements, believe me. They do not get their pay docked \nevery time they need to do something or want to do something. Neither \ndoes the president, the CEO, the treasurer or the manager or the \nsupervisor. They are salaried employees, and all salaried employees \nhave flexibility in this country.\n  Of course, all of the Government workers, even the Government workers \nfor the Federal Government who work by the hour, they have flextime and \nflexible working arrangements.\n  State government workers all have comptime, as was granted to them by \nthe U.S. Congress, the ability to say instead of taking overtime pay, \nwhen we want to, we should have the option to take some time off.\n  We have left the hard-working, laboring people of the United States \nas a group of second-class citizens who do not have the capacity for \nflextime and comptime. They ought to have it. They are in a minority. \nThey are the only ones left. And, frankly, it is not fair, because they \nhave the responsibilities of being at home. Their families are \nstressed, just like other families are stressed. Federal workers \nalready have it. It is time that the stressed families of hourly paid \nworkers have it as well.\n  We enacted laws making it illegal to add an hour to one week in \nreturn for taking an hour off the next week in 1938. The Fair Labor \nStandards Act was a great step forward for protecting workers. However, \nthat protection now has become a real hindrance. As a matter of fact, \nit has been more difficult in recent times for families to meet their \nown needs. They are endorsing the idea of flexibility in work schedules \nin overwhelming numbers.\n  Now, there are some things that we do in order to give people the \nability to accommodate their families. We have, for most hourly \nworkers, this ability to take what is called family and medical leave. \nThat came from the Family and Medical Leave Act, referred to as FMLA. \nIt is the ability to take time off for a sick child, but you have to do \nthat without pay, so that when you take time off you have a pay cut.\n  Now, most people find that to be very discomforting. They are working \nand taking time away from their families because they need the money to \nsupport their families. They have a lot of tension financially which \ndrives them into the work force. That elevates the tension socially. \nAnd yet in order to accommodate this social tension, when your family \nhas a need, the current law says you have to take a pay cut. That means \nyou help resolve one tension but you increase another tension. It is \nlike jumping out of the proverbial frying pan into the fire.\n  What flextime, what the Family Friendly Workplace Act would do, \nbasically it would say if you worked a few extra hours from time to \ntime that you and your employer agreed on, you could put those in a \nbank, in an account of hours, so that if you needed to take time off \nyou would not have to have your paycheck cut for taking time off. If \nyour child gets sick, you can say, ``OK, I have an hour in the savings \nbank,'' and instead of being stressed financially by helping your \nchild, you can take the time off without taking a pay cut. I think when \nwe have an opportunity to do that, we ought to make that available. \nSomeone might say, well, that is pretty risky, tampering with the laws \nof the 1930's. The truth of the matter is we would not impose this on \nanyone. We would give people this opportunity to ask for this and to \nchoose this.\n  Second, if you put the hours in the bank and later decided you wanted \nthe money under the law, you could ask for the money and the employer \nwould have to give you the money.\n  Third, Federal employees have had this for the last 19 years. We know \nhow this system works. It works extremely well to meet the needs of \nfamilies. When interviewed by the General Accounting Office--which is \nnot a political arm of Government; it is a bunch of accountants--they \nsaid, ``How do you like this?'' At a rate of better than 10 to 1, the \nFederal employees said, ``This is great, the best thing since sliced \nbread. This works.'' It is something that the boardroom folks have, the \nboss has, the managers have it, the supervisors have, all the \nGovernment workers in Federal Government have, all the State workers \nhave comptime provisions in their legal framework, but it is against \nthe law to give hourly working people that kind of benefit. That is a \nlaw that, really, is against the hourly working people, not for them. \nWe need to make sure we have the right safeguards in the law to make \nsure employers do not abuse that. We have done that. We have doubled \nthe penalties for normal overtime violations so that if there are \ncoercive activities--either direct or indirect--as specified in the \nbill, then serious penalties are occasioned.\n  I believe this bill, which we will be back discussing and debating, \nwill be the official agenda of the Senate. We will be on the bill \ntomorrow morning. It is a bill in favor of the American people. It is a \nbill that is in favor of the 59 million hourly wage people in the \ncountry. We have about 130 million employees in the country, and a \nmajority of them, the vast majority of them, have the capacity for \nflextime. It is that hourly wage group that does not. It is time they \nhad the same kind of flexibility. Their families are just as important \nto the future of America as the families of the boardroom folks are, as \nthe families of the managers, the owners, as families of Government \nworkers. It is time we allowed them to do that.\n\n[[Page S4293]]\n\n  I believe we will provide a bill that the President will want to \nsign. The President of the United States campaigned on flextime. He \nunderstands this need. Mrs. Clinton has spoken clearly on the need for \nflextime and the importance of having time with children. The President \nmentioned it in his State of the Union Message, specifically calling \nfor flextime, the ability to have flexible working arrangements and \nschedules. The President, when he found that there was a narrow niche, \na narrow sliver, a small group of Federal employees that did not have \nit when he took the Office of President, he extended it by Executive \norder. So there is no question in my mind that he really knows the \nvalue, the Clinton family understands the need of other families in \nthis situation. Although the President does know that the only \norganized opposition, really, the only opposition to this whole \nproposal, has been through labor leaders of organized labor. I do not \nsay organized labor generally, because so many working people want \nthis. If you talk to the working mothers, it is almost a 10 to 1 ratio \nin favor of this. I believe we will have an opportunity to send to the \nPresident of the United States a bill which he will want to sign.\n\n  My question is whether or not somehow his sense of indebtedness to \nthe labor leaders in Washington, DC, organized labor leaders, will in \nsome measure inhibit his capacity to sign something that would be good \nfor the American people. I hope it will not. He should understand, and \nI think he does, there are 28.9 million hourly paid working women in \nAmerica. They need the relief of flexible working arrangements so they \ncan spend time with their families, as well as accommodate the demand \nof the workplace.\n  I close with this point. One of the reasons we have prosperity in \nAmerica, the standard of living we enjoy, is so many women are working \nand doing such a great job. I do not think there is a culture anywhere \nin the world that can match the United States in terms of the \ncontribution that working women make to the way we live and the way we \nwant to live, the way we aspire to live. We need these women to be \nproductive and contributors to the marketplace as we are competing \nagainst the rest of the world, but while we need them, we owe them, and \nwe owe them the opportunity to spend time with their family. That could \nbe achieved if we had a reasonable approach to directing work \narrangements and allowing them to make choices.\n  Never in this bill is there an opportunity for an employer to impose \nupon a worker the requirement to work in return for time off, instead \nof working in return for pay. Whenever a person says, ``I would like to \nwork for comptime,'' that means they will be able to take time off and \nstill get pay, and if they decide they want to take time off and still \nget pay and before they take the time off they change their mind and \nthey want the time-and-a-half pay, they get the time-and-a-half pay. \nThis is a measure that is designed to give workers choice and to give \nthem the opportunity to do what we need for them to do the most, which \nis to be the kind of parents they ought to be.\n  It is not like the Family and Medical Leave Act, which says when you \ntake time off it is without pay. This is the capacity of Americans to \nbe good parents and not take a pay cut. We should not, as a Government, \nsay to people that in order to be a good parent you have to take a pay \ncut. We should develop a capacity for flexible working arrangements in \nthis country which allows parents to be what they need to be and what \nwe need them to be, and that is good parents, and to do so in the \ncontext of providing for their families.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on this beautiful Monday morning when \nthere is absolutely nothing going on in the Senate or in the entire \nCongress, it is an ideal time to remind the Members of Congress and the \nAmerican people that 125 years ago this past Saturday, Ulysses Grant, \nwho was President of the United States, signed a bill called the mining \nlaw of 1872. This is now my ninth year of trying to get this law \nrepealed. It is probably the biggest single scam that continues in \neffect in America today.\n  In the past several years I have brought up numerous amendments to \ntry to modify or repeal the mining law. Each time some of my \ncolleagues, who do not have any hard-rock mining in their State, voted \nwith western Senators to oppose my amendment. The western Senators \nalways argue the reason they do not want to require the mining \ncompanies to pay a royalty for mining on public land and the reason \nthey want the mining companies to buy this land for $2.50 an acre is \nbecause it creates jobs. That is absurd Mr. President. We do not \ntolerate that in the private sector. We do not tolerate it anyplace \nelse in the public sector. We should not tolerate it here.\n  Let me just refresh people's memory on how the mining law works. \nUnder the law that Ulysses Grant signed, which was designed primarily \nto encourage people to move west, anybody who wanted to could go out on \nFederal lands and drive four stakes in the ground and claim 20 acres \nfor the purpose of extracting hard-rock minerals.\n  I never will forget when I described what an outrage this was to one \nof my former colleagues. I was trying to get him to cosponsor the bill \nwith me. When I got through explaining it to him, I said, ``Well, will \nyou help me with this?'' He said, ``No, I am going out west and start \nstaking claims. I didn't know you could do that.''\n  If you drive four stakes in the ground you own 20 acres of minerals \nas long as you want to hold that claim. And you can file as many of \nthem as you want. If at some point you find that there is gold, silver, \nplatinum, palladium, copper--you name it, under that 20 acres, you go \nto the Department of the Interior, to the BLM.\n  Let's say you have 100 acres, five claims, and you want to mine it \nbecause you think it has gold under it. If you can convince BLM that, \nyes, indeed, there is gold under it, they are obligated by law, and \nhave been for 125 years, to give you a deed to that 100 acres for $250 \nor $500. Some claims go for $2.50 per acre and others go for $5.00 an \nacre. I will come back to that in a moment.\n  The big mining companies usually approach these people that have \nstaked claims and they say, ``You know, we think this is a good claim. \nWe will buy that claim from you and we will give you a royalty.'' So \nthe farmer in Arizona or Wyoming or Idaho or Montana says, ``Here, take \nit.'' The mining companies will usually pay him a substantial royalty. \nWhat do they pay the United States, who gave it to him for $5 or for \n$2.50 an acre? Absolutely nothing.\n  Nothing has changed since 1872. The United States has not collected \none dime of royalty on the more than 3 million acres that it has deeded \naway for either $2.50 an acre or $5 an acre.\n  Mr. President, I cannot believe I am standing here for the ninth year \ntrying to educate my colleagues on this. But I will say this. The news \nmagazines, from ``60 Minutes'' to ``Prime Time Live'' to ``20/20'', \nthey have all done it. And NBC just as recently as 2 months ago, did a \nsegment on this.\n  Is it not strange that we have no compunction about cutting $55 \nbillion out of welfare, $16 billion out of Medicaid for the poorest \nchildren's health care in America and $115 billion from Medicare--you \ncan say you are going to take it out of providers. If you take it out \nof providers, the beneficiaries are going to suffer. An assault, \nliterally, on the most vulnerable people in America--the elderly, the \npoor, and the children--and allow the biggest mining companies on Earth \nto buy Federal land with billions of dollars worth of gold under it for \n$2.50 an acre. The Mineral Policy Center estimates that over the past \n125 years we have\n\n[[Page S4294]]\n\ndeeded land containing $243 billion worth of minerals for which we \nreceived not one red cent.\n  Anybody who thinks this is all conjured up, just check the facts, \ncheck with anybody you want to. I have heard every argument under the \nshining Sun to keep from doing something about this. So, we now have \n600 patent applications pending. I have had some partial success in the \nlast 3 years in my efforts to do something about this. We have put a \nmoratorium on the issuance of any additional patents. But we have been \ndoing it on a yearly basis. We first imposed the moratorium in 1995. \nThis moratorium has been renewed the last 2 years. George Miller and I \nhave a bill pending in both the House and Senate that would make that \npermanent--no more giveaway of the public domain.\n  There is not a Senator in this body who has not gone home and told \nthe chamber of commerce and the Rotary Club what a magnificent steward \nhe is of their money, their tax money. And when they run, what do they \nsay? ``I'll treat your money like it was my own.'' Really? Do they?\n  You know, Barrick Resources, which is the biggest gold company in the \nworld pays private landowners substantial royalties. But suggest they \npay poor old Uncle Sam, who literally gave them the minerals in the \nland, suggest they pay him cent farthing, and they come unglued.\n  No, we can't do that.\n  How about the State of Nevada? Do you pay them anything?\n  Oh, yes, we pay Nevada. We pay a severance tax. But Uncle Sugar? Just \ncan't do it. It will cost jobs.\n  You think about 260 million people in this country who own those \nminerals and Congress insisting that they be kept in the dark about \nwhat has been going on. Of the 600 patents now pending, we have \nliterally stopped 235 of those. There may be no way legally that we can \nstop the others. Sooner or later those patents will probably be \nissued--hopefully for not a lot of gold. If my and George Miller's bill \npasses this year, there will be no more patents without royalties and \nreclamation fees mining companies will no longer be able to take a \ndepletion allowance deduction on their tax returns.\n  You think about these people getting depletion allowances. The very \nnature of depletion is to recover your cost of a depleting mineral. \nYour cost? They do not have any cost. They did not pay anything for it. \nHow can you deplete something you did not pay for? So George Miller and \nI say, yes, in the future we are going to take this depletion allowance \naway from you.\n  Mr. President, think about this, as we have gone home and told the \npeople, ``My No. 1 priority is to balance the budget. I will spend your \nmoney like it was my own.'' On December 1, 1995, ASARCO received a deed \nto 349 acres in Arizona.\n  Did you know Bruce Babbitt has no choice? It is not up to him. This \nis the law. He has to comply with the law. So he gives ASARCO a deed, \nfor $1,745--$1,745, that is about how much a Senator makes in a week. \nFor 349 acres they pay $1,745. Do you know the rest of the story? \nUnderneath that 347 acres is $3 billion worth of copper and silver. Do \nyou know what the United States will get in royalties, reclamation \nfees? Zip, zero, not a dime.\n  And then on September 6, 1995, Faxe Kalk, a Danish corporation--\nincidentally, many of the biggest mining companies including Barrick \nare foreign. I do not have any objection to that. Barrick is a Canadian \ncompany. How would you like to be a miner and go up to Canada and say, \n``I want to buy a couple of acres of land with billions of dollars \nworth of minerals. I will give you $10,000 for it.'' They would \nprobably put you in jail for being insane. And yet that is what we do. \nAnd here is a Danish corporation called Faxe Kalk. They only wanted 110 \nacres. And Bruce Babbitt had no choice. The law required him to give \nthis Danish corporation a deed for that land for $275, about 1 day's \npay for a U.S. Senator. And what do you think it had under it? One \nbillion dollars worth of travertine. So for $275 we gave them $1 \nbillion, and what did we get in return in for the $1 billion? Zip, \nzero, nothing.\n  On May 10, 1994, American Barrick, as I said the biggest gold mining \noperation probably in the world, received 1,800 acres of land in \nNevada. They paid $9,000--$5 an acre--for that 1,800 acres and they got \n$11 billion worth of gold.\n  The Stillwater Mining Co. in Montana has not received a full patent \nyet. They have what is called a first half certificate, but they are \none of the companies that had to be grandfathered in the moratorium, \nand Stillwater wants about 2,000 acres in Montana.\n  But Stillwater Mining Co.--and this is in their prospectus. These are \nnot my figures. This is what they say-- for 2,000 acres, for which they \nwill pay $10,000--$5 an acre--they get $38 billion worth of palladium \nand platinum--their figures--and the U.S. taxpayer gets nothing.\n  Mr. President, these things are literally unbelievable. I have made \nthis speech here for 9 years, and I must say that while for a long, \nlong time it fell on deaf ears, it is now getting to the point where \nSenators--and I do not want to make this a partisan issue, but Senators \non that side of the aisle with the exception of six or seven have stood \nfast to continue this, and the time is coming because of all these news \nmagazine stories where you are going to see 30-second spots next fall \non how people voted to give away the public domain. I can see a spot \nnow saying, did you know so and so voted to continue the giveaway of \ngold and minerals? Did you know we have given away $243 billion worth \nof gold, silver, platinum, and so on, in the past 125 years, and he \nvotes to continue that. They haul out all the votes that we have had on \namendments that I have offered on this floor just in the last 3 years. \nThe Mineral Policy Center said of the $243 billion worth of gold, \nsilver, et cetera, that we have given away in the past 125 years, if we \nhad the kind of royalty which George Miller and I have in our bill the \ntaxpayers would have received $12 billion.\n  Mr. President, I would like to summarize the legislation that I and \nCongressman Miller have introduced. Mining companies would have to pay \na 5-percent net smelter return royalty for operations on public land. \nNow, this is another dimension that I have not mentioned, and that is a \nlot of people in this country are mining claims on Federal lands that \nhave not been patented. Once you patent it, they give you a deed for it \nand it is yours. But there are a lot of minerals being mined in this \ncountry on unpatented lands though they are Federal lands. They do not \npay any royalty either. So that net smelter return is on unpatented \nlands and it is predicted to save $175 million over the next 5 years.\n  A second part of the legislation is a claim maintenance fee. Until \nabout 5 years ago, when you filed a claim, you had to submit some proof \nto BLM that you had done some work on it. You could go out there with a \npick and shovel and work for about an hour, and then you sent it into \nthe BLM and said I worked hard on my claim and I still haven't found \nanything. That was enough to renew it.\n  About 4 years ago I finally got this body and the Congress to put a \n$100 annual fee on these claims, 20-acre claims. That is $5 an acre a \nyear to hold the claim. We had 800,000 claims at that time. We now have \n330,000, which shows you that people were just willy-nilly filing \nclaims hoping that Barrick or some other big gold mining company would \ncome by and make an offer for it. Isn't it interesting that very seldom \ndoes a major mining company ever find this stuff. They buy the claim \nfrom some old nester who has had it for 50 or 100 years. They do not go \nout and explore for it until after they buy the claim. Now, they have a \npretty good idea of what is there, but what they do is they buy claims \nfrom a guy who has owned it for the last 20 to 50 years and give him a \nroyalty and yet they say they cannot give us one.\n\n  But in any event, our bill continues the $100 annual fee on existing \nclaims, and we make it $125 on new claims. So if anybody goes out and \nfiles a claim under this bill for 20 acres, the new fee will be $125. \nAnd that is only on unpatented lands, of course. Then we have a \nreclamation fee that ranges on a sliding scale from 2 percent to 5 \npercent of net income depending on the profitability of the company. \nMr. President, you cannot charge a royalty to somebody who already owns \nthe land even though we gave it to them. You take American Barrick that \njust in 1994 got $11 billion worth of gold. It is theirs. You cannot \ncharge somebody for mining on their own property. But\n\n[[Page S4295]]\n\nyou can charge a reclamation fee, and we calculate that is worth $750 \nmillion over the next 5 years. Do we need a reclamation fee? The Bureau \nof Mines says there are 250,000--listen to this--sites on BLM land that \nhave been abandoned and need to be reclaimed, 2,000 claims in national \nparks, if you can believe it--abandoned, and the Mineral Policy Center \nsays there are 557,000 mines that have been abandoned in this country \non both public and private lands--557,000 mine sites that need to be \ncleaned up. Do you know what they estimate the cost of cleaning them up \nto be? Somewhere between $32.7 billion and $71.5 billion.\n  So here we have given away 3 million acres that had $243 billion \nworth of gold, silver, platinum, and palladium under it, and what have \nwe gotten in return? We have gotten 250,000 sites that we have to clean \nup on BLM sites and 2,000 in the national parks. Sometimes I have a \nhard time believing my own words. If I did not do so much research on \nthis all the time, I would not believe it. So why not charge a \nreclamation fee and say we are at least going to start cleaning up \nthese sites.\n  Now, these people not only get the land for $2.50 per acre, they not \nonly get $1 billion worth of gold for which they pay the U.S. \nGovernment not one cent, they also leave an unmitigated environmental \ndisaster. Listen to this; 59 of the sites on the Superfund National \nPriority List are directly related to hardrock mining. Who could argue \nthat we need to charge a reclamation fee to help reclaim the hundreds \nof thousands of acres that have been abandoned by the mining companies.\n  And finally, Mr. President, I have already alluded to the fact that \nour bill contains a fourth provision and that is a depletion allowance \nrepeal. I forget exactly what it is. I think it is 15 percent for gold, \nfor silver and copper, and 22 percent for palladium and platinum. We \nhave always allowed depletion on oil because it was a depleting \nresource, gas because it was a depleting resource, and, yes, a \ndepletion allowance on private land would make some sense. But to allow \npeople to get land from the U.S. Government for virtually nothing, \nleave us an unmitigated disaster to clean up, and then get a 15 to 22 \npercent depletion allowance to deplete a resource that they paid \nnothing for. That is absurd.\n  Congressman Miller and I will be working very hard to pass this bill \nthis year. I would like to think that the time has come when Senators \ndid not feel they could just accommodate their good friends. They are \nmy good friends, too. Some of the people I debate this with--and the \ndebate could get very loud and raucous--are my best friends. It is kind \nof like trial lawyers. Trial lawyers fight all day long and go out to \ndinner together. I have done that, too. This is not aimed at anybody \nindividually. This is aimed at trying to bring some fundamental \nfairness to what simply is so intolerable it cannot be tolerated any \nlonger.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/12/senate-section/article/S4293-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jim \nDowning, a fellow with the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, and \nMark Hall, a fellow with the leader's office, be accorded privilege of \nthe floor during Senate consideration of the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, S. 717.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today is a special occasion for me and I \nam proud to be with my distinguished colleagues to consider S. 717, the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997.\n  I was there in the beginning, in 1975, Congress faced with a \npatchwork of court decisions, first took the historic step in assuring \neducational opportunities for some of the most vulnerable in our \nsociety, children with disabilities.\n  In 1975, the Education of All Handicapped Children Act, or Public Law \n94-142, was enacted to assist States in meeting the goal of providing a \nfree appropriate public education and offering an equal educational \nopportunity to all children.\n  Public Law 94-142 has done much to meet the educational needs of \nchildren with disabilities.\n  Over the life of this historic legislation we have seen many advances \ntoward the attainment of these goals--advances in educational \ntechnique, advances in technology, advances in opportunity, and \nadvances in our expectations. Children with disabilities are now being \neducated alongside their peers in unprecedented numbers. Children with \ndisabilities are now achieving beyond our wildest dreams.\n  Before Public Law 94-142, society placed little value on the lives of \nchildren with disabilities. Millions of children with disabilities were \ndenied access to education, and we invested few resources in anything \nmore than simple caretaking. We have now learned that investment in the \neducation of children with disabilities from birth throughout their \nschool years has rewards and benefits, not only for children with \ndisabilities and their families, but for our whole society.\n  We have proven that investment in educational opportunity for all of \nour kids enriches society. We have proven that promoting educational \nopportunity for our children with disabilities directly impacts their \nopportunity to live independent lives as contributing members to \nsociety. Most importantly, we have learned to value all of America's \nchildren.\n  Public Law 94-142 was written in different times to address basic \nconcerns. Concerns that have evolved into expectations. With this \nevolution in expectations has come an evolution in other concerns that \nits drafters could never have anticipated. Concerns that must be \naddressed if we are to continue in the advancement and development of \neducational programs that have done so much for America's children, our \nchildren.\n  This year, Mr. President, I have worked hand in hand with majority \nleader Trent Lott and Chairman Goodling in the development of this \nagreement. We have also worked hand in hand with Senators Kennedy and \nHarkin here in the Senate. A bicameral, bipartisan agreement has been \nreached.\n  The process in itself is historic, one in which Democrats, \nRepublicans, the\n\n[[Page S4296]]\n\nHouse and Senate, worked together alongside the administration in \ncrafting this consensus bill.\n  We held weekly townhall-type meetings that enabled varying \nstakeholders to provide their input. These stakeholders included \nparents of the children with disabilities, school administrators, \nspecial educators, general educators, and children with disabilities \nthemselves.\n  The principal members of the working group were Senator Coats, \nSenator Harkin, Senator Kennedy, and their staffs; Members of the House \nof Representatives, Mr. Riggs, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Scott, and their \nstaffs; the Assistant Secretary of the Department of Education, Judith \nHeumann, and the Director of Special Education, Tom Hehir. I would like \nto thank each and every one of them for their efforts. It was an \nincredible effort.\n  We owe much to Senator Frist, who laid the groundwork last year upon \nwhich we were able to build this consensus agreement, and for his \nunwavering support in our efforts this year. We were further aided in \nour efforts this year by Senator Gregg and Senator Ashcroft and their \nstaffs.\n  I would like to thank the following organizations for their \nparticipation, guidance and support during our efforts this year. Their \nsupport for the final passage of S. 717 is crucial to the overall \nsuccess of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act Amendments \nof 1997. I wish to commend them for this support.\n  The National Parent Network on Disabilities, the Learning \nDisabilities Association, the ARC, the National Easter Seal Society, \nthe American Association of School Administrators, the National \nEducation Association, the Autism Society of America, the National \nAssociation of the Deaf, the National Down's Syndrome Society, the \nEpilepsy Foundation of America, the American Academy of Child and \nAdolescent Psychiatry, the American Association of University \nAffiliated Programs, the American Foundation for the Blind, the \nAmerican Physical Therapy Association, the American Speech-Language-\nHearing Association, the Association for Education and Rehabilitation \nof the Blind and Visually Impaired, the National Association of \nDevelopmental Disabilities Councils, the National Association of State \nDirectors of Special Education, the National Coalition of Deaf-\nBlindness, the National Mental Health Association, the National \nTherapeutic Recreation Society, the United Cerebral Palsy Associations, \nthe Council of Great City Schools, Children and Adults with Attention \nDeficit Disorders [CHADD], the Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive \nTechnology Society of North America, the National Association School \nPsychologist, the Higher Education Consortium for Special Education, \nthe Council for Exceptional Children, the National Association of \nElementary School Principals, Federal Advocacy for California Education \n[FACE], and the American Federation of Teachers.\n  I would like to take my colleagues through the steps we took to \nstrengthen and improve IDEA. These steps were not taken lightly. They \nbuilt upon the procedural protections expressed and the flexibility \ninherent in current law. I anticipate that when parents and educators \nhave a full and accurate understanding of what we have done, they will \nembrace this law and these amendments as tools for making the future \nwhat it could be, what it should be, for the over 5 million children \nwith disabilities.\n  First, we invested in the principle of prevention. No child should \nhave to fail in order to be helped. No child should need a label of \ndisability in order to be helped. We reauthorized the early \nintervention program for infants and toddlers with disabilities. This \nvery successful program, originally authorized in 1986, gives parents \ndirect support and infants and toddlers appropriate services from the \nmoment a disability is known. Over the years, and recently by Rob \nReiner, Americans have been told of the consequences of investing and \nnot investing in the earliest years of a child's life. By assisting \nfamilies with infants and toddlers through IDEA's early intervention \nprogram in the last 11 years, we have brought quality of life \nopportunities to these children and their families that they would not \nhave had. We have mitigated or reduced the effects of disabilities, so \nthat later in life, the children are more successful and less in need \nof special education and related services. In S. 717 we retain this \nvital program, and add provisions to encourage States to identify and \nassist, to the extent they are not doing so now, infants and toddlers \nwho are at risk of developing developmental delays. Such children are \nthose whose special needs are not easily detected in the earliest \nyears, but who clearly do not develop at the same rate or degree as \ntheir same age peers in terms of physical, cognitive, emotional, and \nsocial development. We also add a provision encouraging States to \nprovide early intervention services to infants and toddlers in natural \nenvironments where such children are typically found--the home and with \nother children of the same age.\n  We invested in prevention in other ways as well. S. 717 gives States \nand local school districts the option of referring to children, \neligible for services, as developmentally delayed if they are between \nthe ages of 3 through 9. I believe this simple step will move us a way \nfrom investing resources in confirming a specific disability and \nstamping a specific disability label on a child, and move us toward \nconcentrating our resources on what we can do to help a child succeed \nin school.\n  For the first time, we authorize school-based improvement plans to \nencourage educators and parents at the school building level to work \ntogether to set goals to help children, with and without known \ndisabilities succeed. For the first time, we authorize State \nimprovement plans to be developed in collaboration with State and local \neducators, parents, and others interested in improving educational \nopportunities and results for children with disabilities. The emphasis \nin such plans is to ensure better trained and equipped personnel, \nespecially regular education personnel. If teachers are prepared to \ndetect and address a child's problem when it first appears, and make \nappropriate adjustments in the child's instructional program, the child \nis less likely to experience failure, and less likely to need special \neducation and related services.\n\n  The focus we bring to prevention in S. 717, means increased \nflexibility and cost savings for school districts. But more \nimportantly, this focus creates new opportunities for partnerships \nbetween parents and educators, and more opportunities for children, all \nchildren, to experience a greater degree of success while in school and \nlater in life as well.\n  Second, the bill reflects the principle that procedures and paperwork \nshould be driven by common sense, a need to know, and accountability \nfor results that matter. Should parents participate in establishing \ntheir child's eligibility for special education and related services? \nShould parents influence what goes into their child's IEP? Should \nparents influence the selection of the educational placement of their \nchild? Should a child's regular education teacher influence what goes \ninto a child's IEP? S. 717 dictates that the answer be yes, but so does \ncommon sense.\n  Should educators and parents share information, including evaluation \ninformation, with each other in a timely manner? Should parents know \nwhat the rights and protections that IDEA guarantees their child as \nearly as possible, in language that they can understand? S. 717 \ndictates that the answer be yes, but so does common sense.\n  Should educators have an opportunity to offer a free appropriate \npublic education to a child with a disability, before the child's \nparents place the child in a private school and send the school \ndistrict the bill? Should educators have a timely, clear, and specific \nindication that parents intend to request a due process hearing, before \nthey actually do it? S. 717 dictates that the answer be yes, but so \ndoes common sense.\n  Should educators have the opportunity to explain the benefits of \nmediation to parents before proceeding to due process? Should educators \nbe responsible for reporting on a child's progress to the child's \nparents? Along with other children, to the community? To the State? S. \n717 dictates that the answer be yes, but so does common sense.\n\n[[Page S4297]]\n\n  The third principle that influenced this legislation was that \neducators and parents need, in fact desperately deserve, the \ncodification of all Federal policy governing how and when a child with \na disability could be disciplined by removal from his or her current \neducational placement. Right now, parts of that policy are in IDEA, \nparts are in informal policy guidance prepared by the U.S. Department \nof Education, and still other parts are found in case law. The effects \nof this have been both unfair and unfortunate. Many educators, unaware \nof or unsure of their range of discretion when a child with a \ndisability breaks a school rule, do little or nothing. Many parents, \nunaware or unsure of the protections IDEA affords their child, allow \ntheir child to go without educational services. We could not let the \ncurrent situation stand. S. 717 attempts to correct it, through a \nbalanced approach, an approach which recognizes both the need to \nmaintain safe schools and the need to preserve the civil rights of \nchildren with disabilities.\n\n  When a child with a disability violates school rules or codes of \nconduct through possession of weapons, drugs, or demonstration of \nbehavior that is substantially likely to result in injury to the child \nor others in the school, the bill provides clear and simple guidance \nabout educators' areas of discretion, the parents' role, and procedural \nprotections for the child.\n  If we adopt this legislation, dangerous children can be removed from \ntheir current educational placements. Specific standards must be met to \nsustain any removal. If a behavior that is subject to school discipline \nis not a manifestation of a child's disability, the child may be \ndisciplined as children without disabilities. If parents do not agree \nwith the removal of their child from his or her current educational \nplacement, they can request an expedited due process hearing. If \neducators believe that a removal of a child from his or her educational \nplacement must be extended, they can ask for an extension in a \nexpedited due process hearing.\n  If S. 717 is enacted, under no circumstances would educational \nservices to a child with a disability cease. If a child with a \ndisability violates a school rule, and the child's behavior is not a \nmanifestation of the child's disability, the local educational agency, \nin which the child attends school, must continue educational services \nto the child. If the policy of the local educational agency, in which \nthe child attends school, prevents it from doing so, the State must \nassume the responsibility to continue the child's education. This \nobligation under section 612(a)(1) should not be construed to prevent \nschools from suspending children with disabilities for up to 10 days, \nconsistent with the provisions in section 615(k)(1)(A)(i).\n  The fourth principle which influenced our efforts was that local \nschool districts need options for fiscal relief. Over the life of IDEA \nthey have borne the lion's share of the costs. While retaining a single \nline of authority, we direct governors to devise ways for \nnoneducational agencies, which could or should bear costs of certain \nspecial educational and related services to children with disabilities, \nto assume responsibility for these costs. We clarify State and local \nmaintenance of effort requirements. States must maintain the State \nlevel of dollars spent on special education and related services. Local \nschool districts must maintain local dollars spent on special education \nand related services. In addition, once IDEA funding reaches $4.1 \nbillion, local school districts may treat as local dollars 20 percent \nof IDEA dollars that represent an increase from their previous year \nIDEA allotment.\n  The amendments we are considering today, in so many ways, are not \nonly based on common sense, but common practice, on best practice. We \ndo not and would not impose on educators or parents the specific means \nby which they should respond to these amendments. Their responses will \nbe shaped by local resources and relationships. Such responses, \nwhatever form they actually take in communities across this Nation, \nwill have positive consequences. And that leads me to my fifth, and \nlast point.\n  Most children with disabilities are being educated and are succeeding \nbecause of IDEA. Less than 1 percent of these children and their \nfamilies are experiencing disagreements with educators about whether a \nchild has a disability, how a child should be educated, or where a \nchild should be educated, because of the child's disability. However, \nincreasingly, actual disagreements and the likelihood of disagreements \nare shaping how parents and educators view each other and each other's \nmotivations and actions. This trend is not healthy for the children \ninvolved, nor their families, nor their teachers, nor their principals. \nWe must create an atmosphere in which the event of designing a child's \neducation is premised on constructive dialog, common goals, and the \nchild, not premised on the avoidance of a lawsuit.\n  In S. 717 we require States to offer voluntary mediation to parents. \nWe attach specific consequences for educators and parents, who fail to \nshare or disclose information that, if provided, may lessen \ndisagreements and legal disputes. We retain provisions added in 1986 to \nIDEA, that put limits on the conditions under which prevailing parents \nmay receive reimbursement of attorneys' fees. We add other provisions \nthat reflect current policy and legislative history with regard to the \nuse and reimbursement of parents for attorneys' time spent in IEP \nmeetings or mediation.\n  I would like to thank the staff members also: Pat Morrissey and Jim \nDowning, from my staff, Townsend Lange and Bobby Silverstein, Danica \nPetroshius, Sally Lovejoy, Todd Jones, Bob Bacon, Alex Nock, Theresa \nThompson, and most importantly, Dave Hoppe, for without his hard work \nwe could not have achieved our goal.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, and ask unanimous consent that \nmy full statement be included in the Record as if read.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues.\n  I yield to my colleague from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Tom \nIrvin, a detailee from the Department of Education to the Labor \nCommittee staff, be accorded privileges during debate and amendments on \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 717, the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997.\n  On February 20, 1997, a bipartisan, bicameral working group was \nestablished to develop a bill reauthorizing the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act [IDEA]. The working group included a \nrepresentative from the Department of Education, Judy Heumann, \nAssistant Secretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, \nand congressional staff representing Senators Jeffords, Kennedy, Coats, \nHarkin, Frist, and Dodd; and Representatives Goodling, Martinez, Riggs, \nMiller, Castle, and Scott. The facilitator of the group was David \nHoppe, the majority leader's chief of staff.\n  The mission of the working group was to review, strengthen, and \nimprove IDEA to better educate children with disabilities, and enable \nthem to receive a quality education. With this mission in mind, the \ngroup agreed to start with current law and build on the actions, \nexperiences, information, and research gathered over the life of the \nlaw, particularly over the past 3 years. The group further agreed that \nit must distinguish between problems of implementation and problems \nwith the law, and respond appropriately, according to the issue raised.\n  After 10 weeks of marathon negotiations, an agreement was reached on \nall outstanding issues. S. 717 is the outcome of this effort.\n  Mr. President, IDEA is a powerful civil rights law with a long and \nsuccessful history. More than 20 years ago, Congress passed Public Law \n94-142, a law that gave new promises, and new guarantees, to disabled \nchildren and their parents under part B of the Education of the \nHandicapped Act, now known as IDEA.\n  Prior to the enactment of Public Law 94-142, 1 million children with \ndisabilities were excluded entirely from the public school system, and \nmore than half of all disabled children in the United States did not \nreceive appropriate educational services that would\n\n[[Page S4298]]\n\nenable them to enjoy full equality of opportunity.\n  On that day in 1975, when Public Law 94-142 was enacted, we lit a \nbeacon of hope for millions of children with disabilities and their \nfamilies, we exclaimed that the days of exclusion, segregation, and \ndenial of educational opportunity were over in this country.\n  We recognized that the right of disabled children to a free \nappropriate public education is a constitutional right established in \nthe early 1970's by two landmark Federal district court cases--\nPennsylvania Association for Retarded Children versus Commonwealth in \n1971 and Mills versus Board of Education of the District of Columbia in \n1972.\n\n  Thus, IDEA was enacted for two reasons: First, to establish a \nconsistent policy of what constitutes compliance with the equal \nprotection clause so that there would be no need to continue pursuing \nseparate court challenges around the country. Second, to help States \nmeet their constitutional obligations.\n  IDEA is landmark legislation that has literally changed the lives of \nmillions of children with disabilities and their families.\n  IDEA has been a very successful law that has made significant \nprogress in addressing the problems that existed in 1975. Today, every \nState in the Nation has laws in effect assuring the provision of a free \nappropriate public education for all children with disabilities. Over \n5,000,000 children with disabilities are now receiving special \neducation and related services.\n  The number of young adults enrolled in postsecondary education has \ntripled, and the unemployment rate for individuals with disabilities in \ntheir twenties is almost half that of their older counterparts.\n  And, because of a promise made in 1986, all States now provide early \nintervention services to infants and toddlers with disabilities and \ntheir families.\n  For many parents who have disabled children, IDEA is a lifeline of \nhope. As one parent recently told me:\n\n       Thank God for IDEA. IDEA gives us the strength to face the \n     challenges of bringing up a child with a disability. It has \n     kept our family together. Because of IDEA our child is \n     achieving academic success. He is also treated by his \n     nondisabled peers as ``one of the guys.'' I am now confident \n     that he will graduate high school prepared to hold down a job \n     and lead an independent life.''\n\n  IDEA helps preserve and strengthen the family unit. Because of IDEA, \ndisabled children will grow up with their siblings and parents, and \nworship and play with neighbors and friends.\n  IDEA teaches personal responsibility by tailoring education to meet \neach child's unique needs.\n  IDEA empowers disabled children to grow up to lead productive lives \nin the mainstream of society.\n  Because of IDEA, we hear less anger and frustration from parents than \nin the past. We now hear a greater sense of optimism, as I heard from a \nparent in Iowa writing about her 7-year-old daughter with autism. She \nsaid, ``I have no doubt that my daughter will live nearly independently \nas an adult, will work, and will be a very positive contributor to \nsociety. That is very much her dream, and it is my dream for her. IDEA \nhas made this dream capable of becoming a reality.''\n  Mr. President, these are not isolated statements from a few parents \nin Iowa. They are reflective of the general feeling about the law \nacross the country.\n  But despite the tremendous progress that has been made since 1975, we \nknow that our work is not over, and significant challenges still \nremain. The unfortunate truth is that, for far too many disabled \nchildren, the promise of IDEA is not yet a reality.\n  For example, too many students with disabilities are still failing \ncourses and dropping out of school. Almost twice as many disabled \nstudents drop out of school, as compared to nondisabled students. And \nwhen disabled students drop out, they are less likely to ever return to \nschool and are more likely to be unemployed or have problems with the \nlaw.\n  Enrollment of disabled students in postsecondary education is still \ntoo low. And too many of these students are leaving school ill-prepared \nfor employment and independent living.\n  Of further concern is the continued inappropriate placement of \nchildren from minority backgrounds and children with limited English \nproficiency in special education classrooms with low expectation for \nthese children. In addition, school officials and others complain that \ncurrent law is unclear and focuses too much on paperwork and process \nrather than on improving results for children.\n  And it is distressing to observe that the law is not being \nconsistently implemented across the Nation, or even within individual \nStates. Why is it that in one school district, the number of \nsuspensions and drop outs is very high, whereas in a neighboring \ndistrict within the same State, these problems do not exist? \nUnfortunately, this is not an isolated situation.\n  In February, just after the working group began its effort to improve \nIDEA, I received a copy of a letter to David Hoppe from the Disability \nRights Education and Defense Fund relating to implementation problems \nwith IDEA in the city of Los Angeles. The letter states, ``We implore \nyou to read the enclosed report prepared by well qualified, unbiased, \nindependent consultants hired by the Los Angeles Unified School \nDistrict in California and parents of children with disabilities in \ntheir efforts to resolve a lawsuit in Los Angeles for violations of \nIDEA.'' The letter adds:\n\n       The findings of the consultants/experts are astounding. \n     Twenty years after the passage of IDEA, the consultants were \n     ``compelled to conclude that the District suffers from a \n     pervasive, substantial, and systematic inability to deliver \n     special education and related services in compliance with \n     special education laws.''. . . The harm suffered by children \n     with disabilities, their parents and their communities is \n     incalculable, tragic and unacceptable.\n\n  As a result of IDEA, most children are now in school. But it is clear \nthat we must ensure that IDEA is fully and consistently implemented. \nAnd we need to place greater emphasis on improving educational results \nfor these children. Careful strengthening and refocusing of the law is \nnecessary in order to build upon 20 years of success while ensuring \nresolution of existing problems.\n  In addressing these challenges, the bipartisan, bicameral working \ngroup established a set of principles to guide its efforts, including \nadopting the following three goals:\n  The first goal was to review, strengthen, and improve IDEA to better \neducate children with disabilities and enable them to receive a quality \neducation by:\n  First, ensuring access to the general education curriculum and \nreforms;\n  Second, strengthening the role of parents;\n  Third, focusing on teaching and learning while reducing unnecessary \npaperwork requirements;\n  Fourth, giving increased attention to racial, ethnic, and linguistic \ndiversity to prevent inappropriate identification and mislabeling;\n  Fifth, ensuring that schools are safe and conducive to learning;\n  Sixth, encouraging parents and educators to work out their \ndifferences by using nonadversarial means; and\n  Seventh, assisting educational agencies in addressing the costs of \nimproving special education and related services to children with \ndisabilities.\n  The second goal was to encourage exemplary practices that lead to \nimproved teaching and learning experiences, and which in turn result in \nproductive independent adult lives.\n  The third goal was to assist States in the implementation of early \nintervention services for infants and toddlers with disabilities and \ntheir families and support the smooth and effective transition of these \nyoung children to preschool.\n  The bill that we are considering today, S. 717--the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997--has been developed with \nthese three goals in mind.\n  A basic framework used by the working group was developed by the \nClinton administration during the 104th Congress. Without this \nframework provided by the administration, we would not have been able \nto achieve such a successful outcome. I was proud to have introduced, \nalong with Senator Kennedy, the administration's proposed amendments to \nimprove IDEA (S. 1075). In submitting the bill to Congress, Secretary \nRiley said:\n\n       The IDEA has helped millions of disabled Americans to \n     finish school, get a job, and make their civic contribution \n     like other working americans. These amendments build on two \n     decades of research and experience to\n\n[[Page S4299]]\n\n     meet the needs of the classrooms of today. They aim to ensure \n     that students with disabilities are offered challenging \n     materials in classrooms with well-prepared teachers. We want \n     the focus of the IDEA today to be on better teaching and \n     learning--and not on unnecessary paperwork.\n\n  Much of the work of the administration in proposing improvements to \nIDEA has been because of the vision and leadership Judy Heumann, the \nAssistant Secretary of the Office of Special Education and \nRehabilitative Services. Ms. Heumann testified at the January 29, 1997, \nhearing on IDEA conducted by the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources. In her testimony, she explained how important this \nlegislation is to children with disabilities and their families:\n\n       Through IDEA programs, millions of children with \n     disabilities have received the education they need to become \n     fully participating, fully contributing members of our \n     society. The IDEA is not just a law on paper. To most \n     families with disabled children, it is the bedrock foundation \n     upon which the future of their children depend . . . Disabled \n     students and their families do not want to be shut away from \n     the rest of society or given a watered-down curriculum; they \n     want an opportunity to study and to work so that they can \n     contribute to society. The IDEA has changed the role of \n     government from one of caretaker of dependent individuals to \n     one that opens the door to education and empowers people with \n     disabilities to fully participate in their community.\n\n  This IDEA reauthorization bill that we are considering today has \nenjoyed strong bipartisan support. Last Wednesday, May 7, 1997, the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources unanimously approved the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997 as an \noriginal bill. And the House Committee on Education and the Workforce \nvoted out an identical bill. On the next day, S. 717 was formally \nintroduced by Senator Jeffords and Senator Harkin, along with Senators \nLott, Kennedy, Coats, Dodd, Gregg, Mikulski, Frist, DeWine, Enzi, \nHutchinson, Murray, Collins, Warner, McConnell and Reed.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to learn that this bill has the \nendorsement of 25 national disability groups. And the major \norganizations representing general education have also endorsed the \nbill. I ask unanimous consent that a list of these groups be printed in \nthe Record.\n  I am particularly pleased that I recently received a letter from \nJustin Dart, a friend and leader in the disability community, endorsing \nthe bill:\n\n       Colleagues, the agreement is the result of valiant efforts \n     of disability advocates across the country. It maintains the \n     fundamental right to a free appropriate public education for \n     all children with disabilities. Without agreement, many of \n     the fundamental protections for children and families \n     afforded under the IDEA would have been dramatically weakened \n     or even eliminated. Please join me in voicing your support \n     for this legislation--and the principles of equality, \n     inclusion, and education for all, on which we all agree. Let \n     us unite, each of us communicating our common goal according \n     to his or her own conscience. Together, we shall overcome.\n\n  I am also pleased that the bill retains all of the basic rights and \nprotections available under current law, while providing needed \nimprovements. Based on 20 years of experience and research in the \neducation of children with disabilities, we have learned many new \nthings that are important if we are to ensure an equal educational \nopportunity for all children with disabilities.\n  Consistent with the basic principles adopted by the working group in \nFebruary, I would like to briefly describe some of the major changes to \ncurrent law that are proposed in S. 717:\n\n\n                IMPROVING RESULTS FOR DISABLED CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. President, the single most important principle addressed in S. \n717 is improving results for disabled children--by ensuring their \naccess to the general curriculum and general educational reforms. All \nof the other principles support this overarching goal.\n  The bill includes a number of provisions to address this goal. For \nexample, it enhances the participation of disabled children in the \ngeneral curriculum through improvements to the IEP--by relating a \nchild's education to what nondisabled children are receiving; providing \nfor the participation of regular education teachers in developing, \nreviewing, and revising the IEP; and requiring that the IEP team \nconsider the specific needs of each child, as appropriate, such as the \nneed for behavior interventions, and assistive technology.\n  The bill also requires that schools report to parents on the progress \nof their disabled child as often as such reports are provided to \nnondisabled children; and it also provides for transition planning for \ndisabled students beginning at age 14. In addition, the bill makes \nprocedures for evaluating disabled children more instructionally \nrelevant. It also provides for the inclusion of disabled children in \nState and district assessments, and requires the development of State \nperformance goals for children with disabilities, and regular reports \nto the public on progress toward meeting the goals.\n\n\n                   STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF PARENTS\n\n  In order to achieve better outcomes for disabled children, it is \ncritical to strengthen the role of parents. S. 717 includes specific \nprovisions related to this goal. For example, it provides that public \nagencies must ensure that parents are included in any group that makes \nplacement decisions about their child. And it requires that, at a \nminimum, parents be offered mediation as a voluntary option whenever a \nhearing is requested to resolve a dispute between the parents and the \nagency about any matters specified in the bill.\n  The bill also requires that parents receive regular reports on their \nchild's progress, by such means as report cards, as often as reports \nare provided to parents of nondsabled children; and it supports parent \ntraining and information centers in every State to assist parents to \nbetter understand the nature of their child's disability and \neducational needs, and to enable them to participate effectively in \ndeveloping their child's IEP. In addition, because some parents feel \nthreatened by attending IEP meetings with school staff, the bill \nretains the longstanding policy of allowing parents to bring other \nindividuals to the meeting who they deem necessary to be effective \npartners.\n\n\n            REDUCING UNNECESSARY PAPERWORK AND OTHER BURDENS\n\n  S. 717 includes several provisions that reduce unnecessary paperwork, \nand directs resources to teaching and learning. For example, the bill \npermits initial evaluations and reevaluations to be based on existing \nevaluation data and reports, and does not require that eligibility be \nreestablished when the triennial evaluation is conducted if the team \nagrees that the child continues to have a disability. The bill \neliminates unnecessary paperwork requirements that discourage the use \nof IDEA funds for teachers who work in regular classrooms, while \nensuring the needs of students with disabilities are met.\n\n  In addition, the bill permits States and local educational agencies \nand lead agencies for the Infants and Toddlers Program to establish \neligibility only once. Thereafter, only amendments to the State or \nlocal application necessitated by compliance problems or changes in the \nlaw would be required.\n\n\n PREVENTING INAPPROPRIATE IDENTIFICATION AND MISLABELING OF MINORITIES\n\n  There is general agreement today at all levels of government that \nState and local educational agencies must be responsive to the \nincreasing racial, ethnic, and linguistic diversity that prevails in \nthe Nation's public schools today. This is especially true in cases \ninvolving overrepresentation of minorities. S. 717 addresses this goal \nby codifying the nondiscriminatory testing procedures from the current \npart B regulations; and by requiring States to collect and examine data \nto determine if significant disproportionality based on race is \noccurring with respect to particular disability categories or types of \neducational settings, and if it is occurring, to take appropriate \ncorrective action. The bill also requires States to determine if there \nis a disproportionate number of long-term suspension and expulsions of \ndisabled children, and if so, to ensure that the agency's policies are \nconsistent with the act.\n\n\n        ENSURING THAT SCHOOLS ARE SAFE AND CONDUCIVE TO LEARNING\n\n  Mr. President, one of the most emotional issues in the process of \nreauthorizing IDEA related to discipline policies and procedures of \ndisabled children. There is a critical need to ensure that our schools \nare safe and conducive to learning for all children. S. 717 includes \nseveral specific provisions related to this goal, while retaining the \nfundamental protections of IDEA:\n  For example, the bill retains the stay put provision, and includes \ntwo limited\n\n[[Page S4300]]\n\nexceptions. First, the bill allows school personnel to move a child \nwith disabilities to an interim alternative educational setting for the \nsame amount of time that a child without a disability would be subject \nto discipline but for not more than 45 days, if that student has \nbrought a weapon to school or a school function, or knowingly possesses \nor uses illegal drugs or sells or solicits the sale of a controlled \nsubstance while at school or a school function. Second, local \nauthorities can secure authority to remove a child from his or her \ncurrent educational setting for up to 45 days from a hearing officer, \nif they can demonstrate by substantial evidence--that is, beyond a \npreponderance of the evidence--that maintaining the child in the \ncurrent placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the \nchild or others. Further, the bill makes clear that services may not \ncease for any IDEA-eligible child.\n  The interim alternative educational setting must enable the child to \nparticipate in the general curriculum and continue to receive those \nservices and modifications, including those described in the child's \ncurrent IEP, so that the child will meet he goals set out in that IEP. \nIn addition, the child must receive services and modifications in the \ninterim alternative educational setting designed to address the child's \nbehavior that was subject to disciplinary action so that the behavior \ndoes not recur.\n\n\n           FOSTERING PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN PARENTS AND SCHOOLS\n\n  If the parents of disabled children and school staff can work \ntogether in a constructive manner, this will help significantly to meet \nthe goal of improving results for these children. S. 717 includes \nseveral provisions aimed at accomplishing this and specifically in \nencouraging parents and educators to work out their difference through \nnonadversarial means.\n  For example, the bill promotes the involvement of parents in their \nchild's education by including them in placement decisions and \nproviding them with regular reports on their child's progress.\n  It also ensures that a voluntary mediation process is available to \nall parents and school districts. Mediation is a low-cost, effective \nmeans for resolving many of the disputes between parents and school \ndistricts. In cases where parents do not choose to participate in \nmediation, the bill authorizes school districts to require parents to \nmeet with representatives from the Parent Training Centers or other \ndispute resolution people to explain the benefits of and encourage the \nuse of mediation before going to due process.\n\n\n ASSISTING EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WITH THE COST OF SPECIAL EDUCATION AND \n                            RELATED SERVICES\n\n  The Federal contribution to the education of children with \ndisabilities, notwithstanding the authorization level of 40 percent, \nhas been relatively constant but low, approximately 7 to 8 percent of \nthe cost. In order to provide additional help for LEA's in their \nefforts to provide for the education of these children, the bill \nincludes several provisions related to providing financial assistance:\n  Authorization levels: The bill includes significant increases in the \nauthorization levels for the preschool program--$500 million, compared \nto a current appropriation of $360--and for the early intervention \nprogram under part H--$400 million compared to a current appropriation \nof $315.\n  Noneducational agencies paying their fair share: The bill requires \nnoneducational State agencies to pay or reimburse local educational \nagencies for the cost of services such agencies would normally cover.\n  Although data regarding potential savings to LEA's on a national \nbasis are not available, in States that have voluntarily provided \ninteragency supports, cost savings to LEA's have been significant. For \ninstance, the Chicago public schools receives $40 million in support \nfor medically related services for students with disabilities, which \nhas enabled the district to contain costs for related services and \nincreased the access of poor children with disabilities to \ncomprehensive health care services.\n\n  State maintenance of effort: The bill adds a State maintenance of \neffort provision, to ensure that increases in Federal appropriations \nare not offset by State decreases.\n  Estimated savings for triennial evaluations. The bill reduces the \nneed to conduct unnecessary assessments in relationship to the \ntriennial evaluation. Although no national data are available, the \nEducation Department estimates that the projected savings to LEA's \nunder this provision, based on data prepared by the State of Michigan, \nwould be nearly $765 million.\n  Children enrolled by their parents in private schools. The bill \nincludes several critical provisions relating to the extent to which \nIDEA applies to children who are enrolled in private schools by their \nparents. These provisions and clarifications are very important because \nof the number of conflicting court rulings that have been issued within \nthe last few years.\n  For example, the bill clarifies that public agencies are required to \nspend a proportionate amount of IDEA funds on special education and \nrelated services for disabled children enrolled in private and \nparochial, for example, 10 percent if 10 out of 100 disabled children \nattend parochial schools, and that services may be provided on the \npremises of the private or parochial school, to the extent consistent \nwith State law.\n  In addition, the bill reiterates current policy that a public agency \nis not required to pay for special education and related services at a \nprivate school if that agency made a free appropriate public education \navailable to the child.\n  State set-aside. Currently, a State may retain 25 percent of the \nState allocation, 5 percent for administrative purposes, and the \nremainder for monitoring, technical assistance, personnel development, \nand other direct and support services. Some States retain the full 25 \npercent set-aside while others pass through a large amount to local \nschool districts.\n  The bill continues to authorize that States may retain a portion of \ntheir State allotments with certain changes effective for fiscal year \n1998. First the 5 percent for administrative purposes is capped at the \n1997 level, with future annual increases limited to the lesser of the \nrate of inflation or the rate of Federal appropriation increases. The \nremaining 20 percent of the State's share of its part B allotment is \ncapped in the same manner. Any excess above inflation in any year goes \ninto a new 1-year fund that must be distributed that year through \ngrants to LEA's for local systemic improvement activities or for \nspecific direct services. In the next year, the amounts expended for \nsuch activities must be distributed to LEA's based on the part B \nformula.\n\n  Local maintenance of effort. The bill codifies the local maintenance \nof effort provision from the current regulations, except makes it \napplicable only to local funds, and includes additional exemptions for \nwhen a local school district need not maintain effort, for example, a \nteacher at the high end of the pay scale retires and is replaced by a \nrecent graduate.\n  In addition, the bill also provides some relief to LEA's by allowing \nLEA's to replace local funds with a portion of new Federal dollars. \nOnce the appropriation for the program reaches $4.1 billion LEA's would \nbe allowed to replace local funds with up to 20 percent of the increase \nin their Federal funds over the prior year. However, SEA's could \nprevent LEA's from doing this in cases in which the SEA determined it \nwas necessary to ensure compliance with the IDEA.\n\n\n   ENCOURAGING EXEMPLARY PRACTICES THROUGH THE DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS\n\n  The bill consolidates 14 authorities under current law down to 6. The \nchanges promotes the improvement of educational results for disabled \nchildren and early intervention services for disabled infants and \ntoddlers by supporting system change activities carried out by State \neducational agencies in partnership with LEA's and others, through a \nState improvement plan, coordinated research and personnel preparation, \nand coordinated technical assistance, dissemination, and support and \ntechnology development and media services. The bill retains the \nseparate program supporting parent training and information centers.\n  Mr. President, I have a brother who is deaf; and so, I am \nparticularly pleased to learn that the loan program for the deaf is \npreserved by S. 717.\n\n[[Page S4301]]\n\n          ASSISTING STATES WITH THE INFANT AND TODDLER PROGRAM\n\n  The bill includes improvements in the early intervention program for \ninfants and toddlers with disabilities, including clarifying that these \nchildren should receive services in natural environments where \nappropriate, for example, in their home; and providing improved \nrequirements designed to ensure a smooth and effective transition from \nthe early intervention program under part C, part H under current law. \nThe bill also significantly increases the authorization level for this \nprogram from $315 to $400 million.\n\n\n               STRENGTHENING ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n  Mr. President, I have set out the major improvements that have been \nadded by this bill. However, another critical addition to IDEA that is \nadded by this bill relates to strengthening the enforcement \nresponsibilities of the Department of Education and each of the State \neducational agencies in ensuring full and consistent implementation of \nIDEA. As I mentioned earlier in my statement, 22 years after the basic \nprovisions of IDEA were passed the law is not being implemented \nconsistently across the Nation, or even within individual States. S. \n717 adds additional enforcement teeth to the bill:\n  The bill provides the Secretary of Education with greater authority \nto enforce the law, for example, authority to withhold all or some \nfunds, including funding for administrative salaries when violations \nare found and refer the matter to the Department of Justice for \nappropriate enforcement action, including the failure to comply with \nthe terms of any agreement to achieve compliance within the timelines \nspecified in the agreement. Authority to withhold in whole or in part \nis also provided to SEA's. In addition, the bill requires that the \npublic be notified when enforcement action is contemplated. Further, \nthe local school district must make available to parents of disabled \nchildren and the general public all documents relating to the \neligibility of the agency.\n  I am pleased that these enforcement provisions are in the bill.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to quote Ms. Melanie Seivert \nof Sibley, IA, who is the parent of Susan, a child with Downs Syndrome. \nShe states:\n\n       Our ultimate goal for Susan is to be educated academically, \n     vocationally, [and] in life-skills and community living so as \n     an adult she can get a job and live her life with a minimum \n     of management from outside help. Through the things IDEA \n     provides . . . we will be able to reach our goals.\n       Does it not make sense to give all children the best \n     education possible? Our children need IDEA for a future.\n\n  Mr. President, IDEA is the shining light of educational opportunity. \nAnd we, in the Congress, must make sure that the light continues to \nburn bright.\n  We still have promises to keep.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 717 the IDEA \nAmendments of 1997.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 240\n\n (Purpose: To modify the provisions relating to the limitation on the \n   provision of a free appropriate public education to children with \n                             disabilities)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have a managers' amendment at the desk \nwhich has been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n       The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 65, strike line 25 and all that follows \n     through page 66, line 4 and insert the following: ``part be \n     provided to children with disabilities who, in the \n     educational placement prior to their incarceration in an \n     adult correctional facility--\n       ``(I) were not actually identified as being a child with a \n     disability under section 602(3); or\n       ``(II) did not have an individualized education program \n     under this part.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this amendment clarifies that the \nobligation to make a free appropriate education to children with \ndisabilities does not apply with respect to children age 19 through 21 \nto the extent that State law does not require special education-related \nservices under part B of IDEA.\n  We provided for children with disabilities who, in the educational \nplacement prior to incarceration in an adult correctional facility \nfirst, were not actually identified as a child with a disability under \nsection 6023 or did not have an individualized educational program.\n  This is a technical amendment to clarify for which children a State \ndoes or does not have an obligation to provide special education-\nrelated services relative to incarcerated individuals. The same \ntechnical amendment is to be incorporated as a technical amendment when \nit is to be considered by the full House when it considers its \ncompanion bill tomorrow.\n  This is agreed to by both Houses, as well as by both sides in this.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 64, strike lines 19 and 20, and insert the \n     following: ``there are authorized to be appropriated to the \n     Secretary not less than $4,107,522,000 for fiscal year 1998, \n     not less than $5,607,522,000 for fiscal year 1999, not less \n     than $7,107,522,000 for fiscal year 2000, not less than \n     $8,607,522,000 for fiscal year 2001, not less than \n     $10,107,522,000 for fiscal year 2002, not less than \n     $11,607,522,000 for fiscal year 2003, not less than \n     $13,107,522,000 for fiscal year 2004, and such sums as may be \n     necessary for each succeeding fiscal year.''.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, let me begin by speaking a little \nbit about the underlying bill and congratulating the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Jeffords, and the Presiding Officer for their \nextraordinary work in developing this bill. The Senator from Tennessee, \nthe Senator from Vermont, and the Senator from Iowa, of course, have \nbeen involved in this issue for years and years and have worked very \nhard together, as have a number of Members of the Senate and House.\n  It has been acknowledged that Senator Lott, through his excellent \nrepresentation and his chief of staff, David Hoppe, has done an \nextraordinary amount of lifting to make sure that this process has come \nto closure. It was not an easy one. Meetings went on for dramatic \nlengths of time. There were complications, controversial issues which \npeople had vested interests in which were very deep and intensely felt. \nThe fact that a final product was reached, and an agreement has been \nbrought before the Senate, reflects the genuine effort of a lot of very \ngood people. It is a product which will benefit many children in this \ncountry as it goes forward and represents a new day for special \neducation. It is really not a reauthorization of the special education \nbill but basically a new bill, a new approach, in many ways. It should \nbe looked on as such.\n  I got involved in special education a long time ago, in fact, before \nI was even able to vote. I was working at a center called the Crotched \nMountain Rehabilitation Center, which began as a center to care for \nchildren who have polio, and when that disease was, fortunately, \nbeaten, it moved on to care for children who had problems with hearing, \ndeaf children, specifically, and then when that issue was resolved in \nmany ways relative to needing special schools and those children could \nfind their way into the mainstream, it moved on to dealing with \nchildren with very complex physical disabilities, sometimes emotional \ndisabilities. It is and continues to be the premier facility, or one of \nthe premier facilities, in the country for caring and educating--\n\n[[Page S4302]]\n\nthat is the basic goal of the Crotched Mountain Rehabilitation Center--\nchildren with disabilities, and does it in a variety of ways.\n  When 94-142 came along, we saw it as a great step forward because it \nmeant the school systems would begin to have to be involved in \neducating children who we felt should have remained in school systems, \nbut because school systems were not able to do it, ended up at Crotched \nMountain. It gave us the opportunity to move kids back into education \nin the much more comfortable environment of their home and community, \nwho should have been in their home and their community being educated. \nWe continue to work with those who really needed some special \nattention.\n  So the issue of special education is something I have had a lot of \npersonal involvement with. I think that 94-142 is a bill with really \nstrong decisions made by this legislature over the years in the area of \neducation. But as part of that concept, there was an element of sharing \nof the effort. Originally, when it was passed, 40 percent of the cost \nof special education was going to be borne by the Federal Government, \nthe balance being borne by the local communities and the State. This \nwas a reasonable cost-sharing concept.\n  Unfortunately, over the years, although the bill itself continues to \nwork and kids are getting educated, the cost sharing has not occurred. \nThe Federal Government's participation in helping to bear the burden of \neducating children who have special needs has dropped to about 7 \npercent, or did drop to about 7 percent a year and a half ago. That \nmeant that the local communities and the States have had to step in and \npick up the Federal share of the cost.\n  What has this done? Unfortunately, it has perverted the process. The \npractical effect of this is not only that the Federal Government has \nnot come up with the dollars that have been owed the local communities, \nthe practical effect has been in two ways extraordinarily detrimental. \nFirst, it has meant that the special-needs child and their parents have \nfound themselves in a constant confrontation--almost, in many \ninstances, an actual confrontation, but certainly a tension with the \nparents of children who are not special-needs children and with the \nschool boards, because the demand to educate and the cost to educate \nthe special-needs child is in many instances so high.\n  I know of a number of instances in New Hampshire where special-needs-\nchildren costs have been upward to $100,000. It is certainly not \nunusual for it to be in the $10,000 to $20,000 range. That has meant \nthat resources which parents of children who are not special-needs \nchildren felt was available to them, in many instances, because of the \nneed to pick up the Federal cost, have had to go to benefit the \nspecial-needs child, because we are dealing, in many instances, with a \npie that could not be expanded, and therefore the slicing of the pie \nended up with the special-needs child obtaining, appropriately, a \nsignificant support level. But because the Federal Government was not \ncoming in and paying its fair share, the support level for other \nchildren in the school systems dropped off or was less--maybe not \ndropped off, but was less than what was, many people thought, needed.\n\n  So this tension occurred and it does occur and it still exists out \nthere. I know in my own school systems in New Hampshire it still \nexists, and it is difficult on the parents. It is hard enough on the \nparents to have a special-needs child. It is more difficult when you \nput them in the position of being faced with this controversy over how \nthe funds are being allocated in the school system. So that was one of \nthe detriments of this failure of the Federal Government to live up to \nwhat it said it would do.\n  The second detriment of the Federal Government's failure to living up \nto what it said it would do, it perverted the tax base of many \ncommunities. I know in my State and throughout New England, and it may \nbe true in other parts of the country, real estate taxes pay a \ntremendous percentage of the costs of education. What happens when the \nFederal Government fails to come forward with its full share of the \nspecial-education need, then that means that cost falls back on the \nproperty tax owner, the homeowner in the community, who is already \nunder significant stress with the tax burden. This, again, creates \ntension, an inappropriate tension, between the homeowners and the \ncommunities, and property taxpayers in the communities who maybe do not \nhave schoolchildren, and particularly special needs children, and the \nschool system itself, which sees needs that it feels it has to pay for, \nbut it does not feel it can go back to the property tax owner or to the \nState tax treasury for. In many States, that may be the effect. You \nhave an intense confrontation in many areas, and the intensity of it is \nundermining the confidence in the school systems and the quality of the \nschool systems and, unfortunately, the character of the school systems \nas a positive environment which the community has supported in many \nareas.\n  So, that, again, is almost a direct function of the Federal \nGovernment's failure to pay its fair share. Why do I say that? Because \nin New Hampshire, in the average school district in New Hampshire, 20 \npercent of the costs of the school districts go to special education--\n20 percent--and New Hampshire may be low compared to other States. I \nthink in Massachusetts it is somewhere around 30 percent. However, what \nyou can see when the Federal Government fails to come forward and pay \nits fair share of that cost, of that 20 percent, is that has a \ndisproportionate impact on the community, on the students, and on the \ntax base.\n  So what we have here is the Federal Government having created an \nobligation--and an inappropriate obligation--on the communities and \nStates, having said it would fund that obligation at the level of 40 \npercent, but only funding it at the level of 7 percent, 2 years. We are \ngetting that amount up a little bit because of efforts made by the \nleader, Senator Lott, but not up enough.\n  So we have probably the single largest unfunded mandate of the \nFederal system outside of the environmental area in this area of \nspecial education. One of the primary commitments of the Republican \nCongress was that we would stop unfunded mandates. So as an effort to \ndo that, we passed as a Congress--and I think it was passed almost \nunanimously, so we had bipartisan support--a bill that was authored by \nSenator Kempthorne from Idaho, was passed during the last session, and \nthat bill said there would be no more unfunded mandates, or if there \nwere unfunded mandates, it would take a supermajority to pass, in most \ninstances, or at least we have to have full disclosure.\n  Well, I think that should apply to reauthorizations, and especially \nreauthorizations which are essentially a creation of a new approach, in \nmany ways, to the law.\n  On the balance of what we have already done as a Congress, clearly, \nwe have an obligation to live up to the 40 percent, but more \nimportantly, we have an obligation to live up to it because it is \nneeded, it is appropriate, and it is the right thing to do.\n  I have offered this amendment, which I brought forward today, which \nessentially will get us to the 40 percent. While it does not get us \nthere immediately, it gets us there, I believe, by the year 2004. It is \na scaling up, and I believe with some of the incentives for a little \nmore efficiency which this bill puts in place, especially in reducing, \nhopefully, some of the attorney's fees and consultant fees, that we \nwill be able to reduce some costs in special education and, at the same \ntime, be increasing the Federal share. I believe that, as a result of \nthose two functions, we will get to the 40 percent level, which is the \ngoal we should attempt to obtain here.\n\n  Let me tell you a little bit of the history of the funding of this \nissue. Last year, we considered this to be so important that as we \ncompleted the omnibus appropriations bill, Senator Lott, to his \ncredit--and he never got much credit for it, which I thought was \nironic--insisted that as part of the settlement with the White House, \nwe would put an additional $780 million into special education. That \nbrought the special education total to about $3 billion. That was a \nmajor step forward. That meant significant, new, or additional dollars \nin special education. But it only meant that we essentially went from 6 \nor 7 percent up to about 8, 8.5 percent of the funding levels of the \nspecial ed cost for the country. So we are\n\n[[Page S4303]]\n\nstill well below the 40 percent we should be at. But at least we put \nour dollars where our talk was and we showed that we were willing to \nmake that decision as a Republican Congress. We were willing to put \ndollars on the table in support of special education. We didn't get any \ncredit for it. In fact, during the election, in many instances, we were \nrather vilified by our position on education by some of our opposition. \nBut the fact is that we have been there with dollars and commitment.\n  Now, as this Congress began, I thought the President would want to \njoin us in this effort. I regret to say that he has not. He has put \nforward a lot of funding initiatives in education. He has talked about \nthem everywhere. Obviously, he has made education a priority. But for \nsome reason, in doing that, he has overlooked, ignored, what is the \nprimary Federal education obligation today in the elementary and \nsecondary school system, which is special education funding. As he has \ncreated all these new programs for educational funding, he has failed \nto, in any significant way, go back and fulfill our obligation of the \n40 percent. In fact, his budget proposed only an additional $141 \nmillion. That is a lot of money, but in the context of what we are \ntalking about relative to the cost of special education, it is really a \nvery, very, very insignificant commitment, especially when you consider \nthe fact that he is talking multiple billions--somebody said it was $30 \nbillion--of new funding for education and discretionary accounts over \nthe term of the next budget cycle. That may be high, but we know it is \na very big number. It hasn't been settled, but it is a huge number.\n  So it didn't surprise me, really, that he failed to put this on his \nlist of issues that should be addressed, because this is an obligation \nthe Federal Government presently had. So it is my belief that before we \nstart--most of these educational issues are new initiatives--before we \nstart creating a new obligation for the Federal Government in education \nthat we are going to do this, this and that for the public, we ought to \nfulfill the obligation we made back in 1976, which was that we would \nfund 40 percent of the special ed need, an obligation which not only \nshould we fulfill because we said we would by law, but because it is \nthe right thing to do and because it works. Special needs kids who go \nthrough the system learn and they participate in the mainstreaming of \neducation, and they have an opportunity to have a better lifestyle.\n  So if you want to help education, this is a great way to do it. Not \nonly would it help a special needs child, but, equally important, if we \nfully fund the 40 percent of special education accounts, we will, in \nfact, be helping education at the elementary and secondary school level \ndramatically because we will be infusing a significant amount of funds \ninto a system that is under strain right now, according to the \nPresident, and I believe it is, also.\n  Those funds will give the local school systems new flexibility in \norder to address other needs of the school system because, under this \nbill, one of the positive aspects of this bill is after we get to a \ncertain funding level, which we haven't quite reached yet, local \ncommunities will have a chance to take a percentage of the special \nneeds dollars and apply them for other educational activity, which is \nthe way it should be, because, right now what is happening is that the \nlocal dollars are being used to fund the Federal share. When the \nFederal Government starts to fund its share, the local dollars should \nbe freed up to fund other educational initiatives, those which are \nimportant in the community. That is the concept of this bill, in part. \nSo this attempt to fully fund the special needs program is critical, \nnot only to help the special needs child but also to free up the funds \nand give the local school system some flexibility as to how they \naddress the coming years of cost and expense and education of our \nchildren.\n  So this amendment that I am offering today, which has broad \nbipartisan support, is a statement of our belief as an authorizing \ncommittee that we shall pay the obligations of the special ed bill as \nit was originally intended. We don't get there immediately. We propose \nabout a $1 billion increase this year, followed by a billion and a half \nor so each year thereafter until we get to approximately the 40 percent \nlevel. We need this authorization, obviously, in order to give \nthe appropriating committees the directions that will allow them to \nmake the proper allocation for the new education dollars that are going \nto be flowing. If the appropriating committee does not see from the \nauthorizing committee that we consider this to be a priority, then the \nappropriating committee may want to put the money somewhere else. But, \nobviously, this is a priority for us.\n\n  This has been a key piece of legislation. The chairman has worked on \nthis and has been committed to this for years. The Senator from Iowa \nhas an equal commitment, as do the members of the committee. Of course, \nthe majority leader, through actions last year and through the \ninvolvement of his chief of staff this year, has shown his tremendous \ncommitment.\n  I should mention one other item relative to commitment from the \nRepublican side. The Republican Congress and the Senate listed the top \n10 issues that we intend to pass in this session. The No. 1 bill that \nwe put forward, S. 1, was a bill that called for funding for special \neducation exactly in line with this amendment. So this amendment is \nessentially an assertion of what is the Republican senatorial \nconference's position relative to funding special education and has \nbeen rated the No. 1 priority of this Republican Congress by its \ndesignation as Senate bill 1.\n  So let me conclude there. But first let me make a couple of points. I \nwant to, again, note what the chairman noted, which is that the Senator \noccupying the chair now, the Senator from Tennessee, was the energizer \nof this effort. He put thousands of hours, I suspect, or hundreds \nanyway, into this effort last year and did an extraordinary job of \ngetting us almost to the finish line--close enough so that it was able \nto be crossed this year. Second, I thank the chairman for his excellent \neffort in this area. He has been a committed individual in the area of \neducation and all of the aspects of education, as we know, for many \nyears. This is another in the long list of successes he has had.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor his amendment, although I will have to oppose it for reasons \nunrelated to its value. The situation is this, and I want to bring to \nthe attention of my colleagues the situation we face with respect to \nany amendments. As I earlier expressed and took some time to disclose \nthe tremendous difficulty we have had in getting a consensus--and the \nPresiding Officer knows how difficult it was because he worked long and \nhard to obtain a consensus last year, and we thought we had a \nconsensus. At the last moment, it dissolved, it disappeared. Why? \nBecause some people went out and really distorted the great work that \nhad been done--this is such an emotional issue with educators and \nparents of the disabled--and the whole thing unraveled.\n  This year, we started where Senator Frist's efforts stopped and built \non that, and not only that, but in the leadership's office with the \ndata, we went the furthest mile possible to make sure everybody \nunderstood exactly what was in the bill. It was argued and debated. It \nwas from one part of the country to another. Finally, it was agreed \nthat we would all hold hands and work until the last hour of the time \npossible to make sure that we had every amendment that could be agreed \nupon done. We finished that effort earlier. However, the situation is \nthis. The House has passed the bill. We will pass that bill on the \nsuspension calendar with the little amendment we had this morning. Once \nthat is done, then it will come over to us and we intend to pass ours. \nIf they are identical, there is no chance of this falling apart. \nHowever, if there is an amendment that is of significance, even though \nI agree with the intent of the Senator from New Hampshire, the thing \nwill fall apart. There is a chance that it won't, but having gone \nthrough that\n\n[[Page S4304]]\n\nexperience last year, I don't want to go through it again.\n\n  Let me explain, also, why the Gregg amendment is not necessary. First \nof all, there are no set authorization levels in the bill, nor have \nthere been in previous legislation. It says such sums as are \nappropriated and defined. So there is no limit. There is no limit down; \nthere is no limit up. So everything that the Senator from New Hampshire \nwants to accomplish can be accomplished without his amendment.\n  I want to reassure everyone that if the Appropriations Committee \ndecides that it will follow, as it did last year, to add the additional \nbillion dollars, that will be done. On the other hand, if we don't, if \nwe can't agree, we could really have an impasse here. I want to commend \nthe Senator from New Hampshire because I was present in the leadership \noffice when we were discussing these matters at the end of last year \nwhen we were trying to reach agreement on the total amount of money \nthat would be spent. He was the one that brought to the attention of \nSenator Lott the great need--and I backed him up on that--that if we \nwanted to help the local school districts in this country and really \nimprove the ability to improve education, what we had to do was live up \nto our commitment to the 40 percent. I was on the conference committee \nthat made that commitment we should provide 40 percent.\n  I also want to explain, though a little differently than the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, that, in my mind, this is not a Federal mandate. \nThere were 26 State cases where it was determined there was a \nconstitutional right for an appropriate education. That right included \nmainstreaming. As a result of that difficulty created throughout the \ncountry, the Congress decided that what had to happen was for the \nCongress to step in and establish those principles that would comply \nwith the constitutional mandate of an appropriate education containing \nmainstreaming. So that is why, in 1975, we spent many days putting \ntogether the legislation which has finally resulted in being here \ntoday.\n  The mandate is on the States to provide an appropriate education. We \ndevised 94-142 in this law in order to ensure that there were a sense \nof generally agreed upon principles as well as specific approaches on \nhow to put a bill together that would ensure that the States comply \nwith a constitutional mandate, and everyone would agree upon that.\n  So I understand the call for mandate. But I wanted to give that \nhistory because I think that is important.\n  Also, under the leadership of Senator Gregg some time ago--back about \n3 years ago--he came forward with an amendment that we agreed to work \non, one that we could pass. I think all of my colleagues should \nremember this.\n  Hopefully, we will remind you today and tomorrow that Senator Gregg \nand I passed an amendment that said as soon as reasonably possible we \nwill fully fund IDEA. In my mind, that time is here. It is reasonably \npossible. The money is there. We just have to do it.\n  So we don't need another amendment because we voted 93 to 0 in this \nbody to say as soon as reasonably possible we will fully fund it. So we \ndon't need the Gregg amendment. But we need to bring it out of the \nAppropriations Committee in order to bring that to a reality. As has \nbeen pointed out, that is part of the majority view on what should \nhappen this year with respect to the budget.\n  We should get ourselves on a path to fully fund this over a \nreasonable length of time. We can't do it all in 1 year. We know that. \nBut if we go forward and use the guidelines set out in the Gregg \namendment we could get there.\n  But we don't need this amendment to do that, it has already been \ndone. This amendment raises this issue once again. I praise the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire for doing that. It makes it apparent to all of us \nwhat needs to be done. It lays the groundwork.\n  So at the appropriate time I will ask hopefully that this amendment \nbe withdrawn, or some other way taken to make sure that we do not add \nthe amendment to the bill.\n  So I want to again thank the Senator from New Hampshire who has been \ntireless in his efforts to make sure that we do adequately and \nappropriately fund 94-142.\n  I would also like to point out what the bill does in that regard \nbecause I think it is important to know.\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, the greatest burden \nhas been placed not where it should be on the States but on the local \ncommunities. What we want to do--I agree with him on that--is try to \nmake sure that any additional funds that are placed in the \nappropriations process must be passed through to the town. That is \nextremely important. That is in this bill. This bill say to the States \nthat, if we give them more money, they can't just reduce their share. \nWe say they have to maintain their share. Not only that, they have to \nflow that money through to the local governments where the greatest \npressure problems are.\n  So this bill I think accomplishes our goals already without this \namendment, everything that the Senator from New Hampshire wants to \naccomplish. It has the flowthrough to make sure, as he wants to see and \nI want to see, that the local governments have adequate funding, and \nthat the States can't hog it or reduce their own share.\n  So I, unfortunately, must oppose the amendment. But, again, I praise \nthe Senator from New Hampshire for bringing it before us.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to join with our committee Chair, \nSenator Jeffords, in reluctantly perhaps opposing the amendment offered \nby the Senator from New Hampshire. As I said in my opening remarks, \nSenator Gregg has been a leader on the issue ensuring that we had \nadequate funding to help the States and local school districts meet \ntheir constitutional obligations.\n\n  However, again, as Chairman Jeffords said, this bill was a compromise \nworked out after long negotiations, and certainly there is nothing in \nthe bill that would restrict us in any way from reaching the levels \nthat Senator Gregg wants to reach in the future. So that the door is \nopen.\n  Hopefully we will find those resources that would enable us to help \nthe States meet their obligations. So I join with the chairman in \nopposing the amendment.\n  Mr. President, there was something else that was said. Again, my \ncolleague, Senator Jeffords, responded adequately to it. But I would \nlike to just add my remarks to buttress what Senator Jeffords said \nregarding the statement made by my friend, Senator Gregg, about this \nbeing some kind of unfunded mandate and falling under the unfunded \nmandate law of the Congress. Quite frankly, Mr. President, many people \nstill have this concept that IDEA is an unfunded mandate. It is simply \nnot correct. Again I want to set the record straight. Part B of IDEA is \nnot an unfunded mandate.\n  The notion that Congress imposed a mandate on the States and school \ndistricts to educate children with disabilities and then refused to pay \nfor it is simply not the case.\n  The truth is that the right of children with disabilities for free \nappropriate public education is a constitutional right. It is not \nsomething that we mandated here in Congress. It was established in the \nearly 1970's, as I said earlier, by two landmark court cases--\nPennsylvania Association for Retarded Children versus Commonwealth, in \n1971, and Mills versus Board of Education of the District of Columbia, \nin 1972.\n  Again, these established the right. Basically, in my own view, what \nthey said is, ``Look, if a State guarantees to its children a free \npublic education, it can then not discriminate against other children \nbecause of disabilities.''\n  Again, the Constitution certainly wouldn't allow a State to say we \nare going to provide free public education to all children but only if \nthey are caucasian. Obviously, the Supreme Court would strike that down \nin a minute; or, we are going to provide a free public education to all \nmales but not females. They will strike that down in a minute, too. You \ncan think of all kinds of scenarios.\n\n[[Page S4305]]\n\n  What has been happening in the past is we were providing a free \npublic education to kids but not to kids with disabilities. And the \ncourts said, ``Wait a minute. That falls under the same equal \nprotection clause of the 14th amendment of the Constitution.'' So the \ncourts struck it down. They said if the States provide that public \neducation it can then not discriminate on the basis of disability.\n  So it is not a mandate of Congress. It is a constitutional mandate. \nWhat Congress said was OK in 1974. Senator Jeffords was the leader at \nthat time on the bill. But the Congress said it is OK. We understand \nthat local school districts have a responsibility to provide a free and \nappropriate public education to disabled children. The Federal \nGovernment should help States meet their constitutional responsibility. \nAnd we set up the basic provisions of part B to make sure that the \nStates meet the court judgments.\n  As the Senate report stated, passage of the act, ``It is the intent \nof the Committee to establish and protect the right to education for \nall handicapped children and to provide assistance to the States in \ncarrying out their responsibilities under State law and the \nConstitution of the United States to provide equal protection under the \nlaw.''\n  So again there is not an unfunded mandate of the Federal Government. \nOf course, again when the law was passed it was stated that the goal \nwas for the Federal Government to eventually fund 40 percent of the \ncost. We are still down around 7 percent. So we have a long way to go \nto get to 40 percent.\n  But again, that was never a requirement in law. It was a goal we set \nup. Again, I agree with Senator Gregg. It is a goal that we ought to be \nworking toward. The Federal Government ought to provide greater \nassistance to local school districts to help them meet their \nconstitutional responsibilities. We have a national goal. We have a \nnational commitment to this. We ought to help solve that problem on a \nnational basis.\n  So, while I agree with Senator Gregg and his comments regarding \ntrying to get the Federal role up, I do not agree with him that this is \nan unfunded mandate at all. The law and the record is clear on that.\n  Also, IDEA is a program exempted from coverage under the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act of 1995. That was also introduced I believe by \nSenator Gregg. That would fall under that act that we passed a couple \nof years ago.\n  The Congressional Budget Office explicitly recognized this fact in \nthe House and Senate report accompanying the bill.\n  I will read this. This is from page 45 of the report.\n\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: Section 4 of \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act excludes from consideration \n     under that Act any bill that would ``establish or enforce \n     statutory rights that prohibit discrimination on the basis of \n     . . . handicap, or disability.'' S. 717 fits within that \n     exclusion because it would ensure that the rights of children \n     with disabilities are protected in the public education \n     system.\n\n  So clearly it does not fall under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of \n1995.\n  So, again, Mr. President, it is a good goal. There is nothing in this \nbill that prohibits us from meeting that goal. Hopefully those on the \nAppropriations Committee, of which I am one, will in the coming years \nensure that the Federal Government meets more of the needs out there. I \nwill not say ``obligation'' but ``meet'' more of the needs of what the \nFederal Government ought to be providing the States and local \ngovernments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in support of the passage of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of 1997, \ncommonly known as IDEA.\n  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act is a civil rights law \nthat ensures that children with disabilities have access to a free \nappropriate public education. The 22-year-old law has been a tremendous \nsuccess.\n  During the 104th Congress I had the opportunity--in fact, the \nprivilege--to serve as chairman of the Subcommittee on Disability \nPolicy. In that capacity, I worked on a bipartisan basis, especially \nwith my friend Senator Harkin, in establishing a commonsense approach \nto the reauthorization of this vital critical law. Unfortunately, as \nyou heard earlier on the floor, time ran out before we could fully \nachieve the broad widespread consensus that we set out for, and, thus, \nIDEA is before the Senate today.\n  Throughout the last Congress we elected to keep the high ground and \nuse our efforts to work together on a bipartisan basis to establish the \nconsensus that we have achieved today. Yet, I am pleased to say it has \nbecome the foundation of the bill that is on the floor. I am glad to \nsee that all of those efforts on behalf of so many people over the last \nCongress are reaching fruition.\n  I especially want to thank Senator Harkin for the leadership that he \nshowed and has shown on this issue through this Congress, through the \npast Congress, and throughout his tenure in the U.S. Congress.\n  I also want to thank his staff, Bobby Silerstien and Tom Irvin. I \nrecognize and thank my former staff director of the Subcommittee on \nDisability Policy, Dr. Patricia Morrissey, and the staff of this \nsubcommittee, which at that time included David Egnor, Sue Swenson, and \nDr. Robert Stodden, for their tireless efforts really day and night \nduring the 104th Congress.\n  I also want to thank David Larson, who worked diligently on the \nSubcommittee on Disability Policy in the last Congress and has remained \non my staff to advise me on disability policy issues.\n  We have heard, and will continue to hear over the course of today and \ntomorrow, about the efforts that have gone on in this Congress--really \nhistoric efforts--to achieve a bipartisan consensus working with the \nHouse and the Senate to put together and to fashion a bill that is on \nthe floor today. I know from experience over the last Congress how \ndifficult and how hard it is to achieve this commonsense consensus \napproach. And, thus, I think we will hear both today and tomorrow that \nthere will be amendments that come to the floor that we very much \nsupport in substance, in spirit, but which may be just enough to set \noff the very delicate balance that we have in the bill that has been \nbrought forward.\n  I want to salute all of the members and the staffs who have spent the \ndays and nights reaching this agreement: David Hoppe has been mentioned \nrepeatedly for his wisdom, for his judgment, and for his commonsense \napproach, and, on top of all that, his courage and patience in this \neffort. I also want to thank my colleagues, Senators Lott, Jeffords, \nCoats, Kennedy, and Harkin once again for their efforts in this \nprocess, and, of course, Senator Jeffords who worked on the original \npassage over 22 years ago. And it is really fitting that the chairman \nof the Labor and Human Resources Committee be present and providing the \nkey leadership in amending it 22 years later.\n  These amendments reflect the reality, the recognition that our \nNation's schools are moving past that initial challenge of providing \naccess to educate children with disabilities to a new step in that \nprocess to educate children with disabilities so that they can become \nproductive and independent citizens. The IDEA amendments of 1997 will \nhelp the Nation's schools succeed in that effort.\n  Twenty-two years ago, before IDEA, a newborn with a disability had \nlittle hope of receiving help during the critical early years of \ndevelopment; children with disabilities who went to school were \nsegregated in buildings away from their siblings and peers, and many \nyoung people with disabilities were destined to spend their lives in \ninstitutions. Young people with less-obvious disabilities, like \nlearning disabilities and attention deficit disorder, were denied \naccess to public education because they were considered too disruptive \nor unruly. These children tended to grow up on the streets and at home \nwith no consistent access to an appropriate education.\n  Today, infants and toddlers with disabilities receive early \nintervention services; many children with disabilities attend school \ntogether with children without disabilities, and many young people with \ndisabilities learn study skills, life skills, and work skills that will \nallow them to be more independent and productive adults.\n\n[[Page S4306]]\n\n  Children without disabilities are learning first-hand that disability \nis a natural part of the human experience, and they are benefiting from \nindividualized education techniques and strategies developed by the \nNation's special educators.\n  Children with disabilities are now much more likely to be valued \nmembers of school communities, and the Nation can look forward to a day \nwhen the children with disabilities currently in school will be \nproductive members of our community. As a nation, we have come to see \nour citizens with disabilities as contributing members of society, not \nas victims to be pitied. As a nation, we have begun to see that those \nof us who happen to have disabilities also have gifts to share, and are \nactive participants in American society who must have opportunities to \nlearn.\n  While there is no doubt that the Nation is accomplishing its goals to \nprovide a free, appropriate public education to children with \ndisabilities, many, many challenges remain. We have made an effort to \ndeal with them in the amendments, the IDEA Amendments of 1997 that we \nnow have before us.\n  IDEA was originally enacted by that 94th Congress as a set of \nconsistent rules to help States provide equal access to a free, \nappropriate public education to children with disabilities. But, over \nthe years, that initial need to provide those consistent guidelines to \nStates has sometimes become misinterpreted as a license to write \nburdensome compliance requirements. In addition, it has become clear \nthat new guidelines on procedural safeguards are needed.\n  The IDEA Amendments of 1997 address these issues. These amendments \ngive educators the flexibility and the tools they need to achieve \nresults and ease the paperwork burden that has kept teachers from \nspending the maximum amount of time teaching. By shifting the emphasis \nof IDEA from simply providing access to schools to helping schools help \nchildren with disabilities achieve true educational results, we are \nable to reduce many of the burdensome administrative requirements \ncurrently imposed on States and local school districts. The amendments \ndo that.\n  The IDEA Amendments of 1997 streamline planning and implementation \nrequirements for local school districts as well as States. In \nassessment and classification, these amendments would allow schools to \nshift emphasis from generating data, data dictated by bureaucratic \nneeds, to gathering relevant information that is really needed to teach \na child. These amendments also give schools and school boards more \ncontrol over how they use special purpose funds to provide training and \nresearch and information dissemination. We want to encourage every \nschool in America to create programs that best serve the needs of all \nof their students, with and without disabilities.\n  The IDEA Amendments of 1997 clarify that the general education \ncurriculum and standards, the standards associated with that \ncurriculum, should be used to teach children with disabilities and to \nassess their educational process. Educators at the local and State \nlevels will use indicators of student progress that allow them to focus \non quality of educational programming and track the progress of \nchildren with disabilities in meaningful ways along with the progress \nof other children.\n  In an effort to reduce confrontation and costly litigation, the IDEA \nAmendments of 1997 require States to offer a system of voluntary \nschools mediation to parents who have a dispute over children's \neducation.\n  The amendments also address the serious issue of disciplining \nchildren with disabilities who break school rules that apply to all \nchildren. By providing fair and balanced guidelines to help schools \ndiscipline students with disabilities, the IDEA amendments will ensure \nthat all children in our public schools are given the opportunity to \nlearn in a safe environment.\n  By preserving the right of children with disabilities to a free, \nappropriate public education and by providing school districts with new \ndegrees of procedural, fiscal, and administrative flexibility, and by \npromoting the consideration of children with disabilities in actions to \nreform schools and make them accountable for student progress, IDEA \nwill remain a viable, useful law that will provide guidance well into \nthe next century.\n  In closing, we must remember that, no matter how careful we are in \nthis Chamber to adopt good Federal policy, no matter how diligent each \ndoctor and teacher and parent is across out Nation, the world is and \nalways will be unpredictable. Children with disabilities will always be \nborn. Children will develop disabilities through injury or disease. \nTheir disabilities will almost always take their families completely by \nsurprise. We may be certain that our own families and our own friends \nwill be touched by disability, through we will not know when or how.\n  The great power of IDEA, reinforced and preserved by these \namendments, is that it brings people with disabilities into the heart \nof our communities and our schools, where we learn that disability does \nnot divide us, but binds us to each other.\n  When we take the time to know children with disabilities and their \nneeds, we learn a great deal. From families who have children with \ndisabilities, we learn that even though everyday life may pose great \nchallenges, nothing interferes with the love a parent feels for a \nchild. From the excellent teachers who work with children with \ndisabilities, we learn that even though teaching such a child may \nstretch one's abilities, it can be the most rewarding experience in a \nteacher's career, often renewing their faith in their own skills and in \nthe system that supports them. From the children who attend school \ntogether, we learn that children with disabilities can be valued \nfriends whose hopes and dreams are respected and nurtured on an equal \nbasis with those of their peers.\n  As I mentioned earlier, and as we have heard in the Chamber, the bill \nas it stands is built on a very delicate consensus achieved over the \ncourse of more than 2 years of hard work, culminating in what I feel \nwill be a historic effort in the next several days in Congress. We all \nknow how difficult consensus agreements are and how difficult they are \nto maintain over time. There is always a group that is going to be a \nbit unhappy, a bit dissatisfied with what they had to give up to reach \nthis consensus, while at the same time those groups tend to forget a \nlittle bit what they received in exchange, and they begin to feel maybe \nthey can push a little bit harder and get a little bit more. They \nforget that the other side also is not entirely satisfied.\n  To my colleagues who have not yet decided which way to vote on this \nbill or as amendments come to the floor, I ask all of you simply to \nlook at what really does hang in the balance: the first real changes in \nIDEA in more than 22 years; substantial new relief for schools; new \ntools for teachers; and a new focus on achieving results for children \nwith disabilities. I hope all of my colleagues will step beyond the \nlast-minute clamor for changes or adding additional amendments and even \nto really look beyond what may be the unhappiness of a few people that \nI am sure will arise over the next day or so. Instead, we need to look \nto those goals and to the needs of the Nation. And I ask my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this very important package of amendments and \nbring this important law into the next century.\n  Mr. President, before stepping down, let me simply comment briefly on \nthe amendment which was just introduced by my colleague, Senator Gregg. \nI think he and the subsequent Senators who came to the floor to speak \nhave outlined the history behind funding for IDEA, and therefore I will \nnot recount that. The funding today is currently at about $4 billion \nfor fiscal year 1997, which, as has been pointed out, is an increase of \nabout $700 million from the previous year. And again, I extend my \nthanks and my appreciation to my colleagues, including Senator Lott and \nSenator Gregg, who were so instrumental in seeing that that $780 \nmillion was added.\n  As has been pointed out, when IDEA was originally enacted, \nessentially a promise--I guess we can debate whether or not it is \ncalled a mandate or not, but a promise was made that the Federal \nGovernment would pay 40 percent of the cost of IDEA, and at that time \n40 percent, I believe, was the estimate it would cost to provide \nservices for a child with disabilities as opposed to a regular \neducation student, and again, as we have heard, currently instead of\n\n[[Page S4307]]\n\npaying 40 percent of the cost of IDEA, we, the Federal Government, the \nU.S. Congress, is paying about 8 percent--not 40 percent, 8 percent. \nThus, we have fallen far short on our promises to the States.\n  Senator Gregg worked through last year, the last Congress, and he \ncontinues today working very hard on this important issue. It is an \nissue that I think all of us can gather around, this increased funding, \nfunding which was promised to assure a free, appropriate public \neducation for individuals with disabilities. Senator Gregg, along with \n20 other of our colleagues, including myself, sent a letter to \nPresident Clinton this past February requesting that the President work \nwith us to increase funding for IDEA. I would love for some of the $35 \nbillion that the President wishes to spend and has put forward as part \nof the current budget proposal be directed to this obligation--I would \ncall it an obligation or a promise--that we made to our States in terms \nof funding IDEA. We have fallen far short.\n  Senator Gregg is absolutely correct on the issue, and I look forward \nto working with him again on whatever vehicle possible to increasing \nfunding for IDEA. I was, in fact, disappointed that this amendment--\nafter all of our consensus working group effort, bringing people \ntogether in a bipartisan and a bicameral way, I would love to have seen \nthis amendment as part of the final agreement, yet it was not part of \nthat final agreement, and therefore I will support those who have \nspoken over the last few minutes who will end up opposing this \namendment on this vehicle. I hope Senator Gregg will consider \nwithdrawing the amendment, again recognizing that all of us support the \nsubstance and the intent of the amendment, but just that we are very, \nvery concerned, after working together, establishing the bipartisan \nand, in effect, bicameral bill, this may upset that balance just enough \nwhere we would lose the entire bill.\n  Again, I thank Senator Gregg for persistently and tenaciously \naddressing this underfunding by the Federal Government in promises it \nhas previously made.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. FRIST assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I want to share with my colleagues \nsome concerns and views on this very important piece of legislation, S. \n717, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Amendments of \n1997. I express my appreciation to the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee for the good work he and the ranking member and the entire \ncommittee have done on this bill.\n  We all know that since the enactment of the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act in 1975, tremendous improvements have been \nmade in the lives of millions of children with disabilities, providing \nthem with a full array of outstanding educational services to meet \ntheir individual needs.\n  Mr. President, going back about a year before that, in the State of \nMissouri, when I was Governor, we passed our Special Education Act in \n1974, one of the first major pieces of legislation adopted during my \nfirst term as Governor. House bill 474 was an effort at the State level \nto assure that children with disabilities received educational \nopportunities and received educational services that were designed to \nmeet their abilities and to compensate for any difficulties or \ndeficiencies they might have.\n  I think it is clear that we have come a long way. Clearly, there was \nmuch that needed to be done, and many of those children, with grave \nneeds, were not being taken care of, they were not being served, and \ncertainly they have a right to be served.\n  I think as we move through this bill, preserving the rights of \nspecial-needs children to a free appropriate public education so that \nthey can become productive and responsible citizens is an absolutely \nessential goal that we must keep in mind.\n  I have had the opportunity to hear from many, many groups in Missouri \nwho are concerned about how this bill is being carried out, how IDEA is \nbeing implemented. Without dissent, there is unanimous agreement that \nthe goals are worthy, the objectives are right, the need is there, more \nneeds to be done. Unfortunately, because of the way the law has been \ncarried out, the way it has been interpreted, there are disruptions to \nclassrooms, there is needless danger to other students and to teachers \nin the classroom, and there is also a shortage of funds to carry out \nthe worthwhile objectives of this act.\n  As I traveled throughout Missouri over the last couple of weekends \nwhen I was home, I talked with school superintendents, principals, \nschool board members, special education directors, parents and others \nwho are concerned, and the two top concerns that were mentioned just \nabout every place I went was safety and discipline for all students in \nthe public school system.\n  The number of instances where there have been serious disruption and \nviolent acts on students was hair raising. There was a lot of interest \nand focus in the St. Louis area on a tragic murder that occurred in one \nof the schools. A young woman was brutally beaten to death. It turns \nout that the young man who commited the crime was a young man with \ndisabilities. He had transferred into that school district from another \nschool district where he had been cited many times for bad behavior. \nThe receiving school district did not know anything about his past \nactivities because they did not know about his behavioral problems. So \nthe first thing they requested was that they get information on a \nstudent's past activities, if there has been discipline, what the \ndiscipline had been and why the discipline was administered.\n  Second, they told me some hair-raising stories about children with \ndisabilities who committed violent acts. In one classroom, in a \ncommercial art class, a young man picked up a knife and stabbed a \nfellow student several times and told the school administrators that \nsince he qualified under a certain specific section of the act, they \ncouldn't do anything to him, that they could only take him out of the \nclassroom for 10 days, and then he would be back in there.\n  They told me about another student, one of two students, who had been \napprehended for selling drugs. The one student who did not have a \ndisability was expelled for 175 days. The other student, a year later, \nwas still in the classroom. His parents had retained an attorney, which \nthe school district was paying for, and they carried on the process. A \nyear later, that student who sold the drugs was still in the classroom.\n\n  Earlier, I introduced legislation, the School Security Improvement \nAct of 1997, which is designed to do a couple of things: No. 1 is to \ncreate a safe learning environment for all children. We have to \ncontinue to provide support and assistance for disabled students, but \nwhere there is a clear-cut example of behavior that is incompatible \nwith a decent learning environment, the schools have to be able to take \nsome action. One principal told us, ``You cannot learn in chaos. A \nchild cannot learn in chaos. A teacher cannot teach in chaos.''\n  When they have students with disabilities whose violent acts have \nbeen judged to be a manifestation of their disability and they have to \ncome back into the classroom after 10 days, other students live in \nfear, teachers are apprehensive about the impact on their class and, \naccording to the teachers, the administrators, the parents, the job of \neducation comes to a halt.\n  The measure that I introduced, the School Security Improvement Act of \n1997, will eliminate the double standard that currently exists between \nspecial education and general education children. All children, \ndisabled or not, should receive the same discipline for the same \nbehavior. I believe this is appropriate wherein the behavior of the \nchild is not related to the disability. Children must learn that there \nare consequences for violating the rules. Good education means \ndiscipline and standards of conduct. If there is a violent act that is \na manifestation of the disability, if it is a dangerous act, if it is a \nviolent act, then that child ought to be put in a learning situation \nwhere there\n\n[[Page S4308]]\n\nwill not be a danger to fellow students of committing a similar act.\n  In addition, this measure would require schools to include in the \nrecord of a child with a disability a statement of any disciplinary \naction taken against the student, and that should be available for a \nstudent transferring within a State or from State to State, so that the \nreceiving school will know if there are problems with the student who \nhas come to them.\n  The record issue, as I indicated previously, has been brought to the \nforefront because of the tragic murder of a young woman in north St. \nLouis County.\n  This measure that I have proposed will enable the school \nadministrators to remove dangerous children with disabilities who pose \na threat to the safety of others from the classroom and make temporary \nalternative placements to ensure that the safety of all students is \nsecure until a more appropriate placement is determined.\n  In addition, the current IDEA provision requiring local school \ndistricts to reimburse attorneys fees incurred by parents who elect to \ninitiate litigation has had what, unfortunately, is a predictable \nresult of encouraging litigation and of driving up special education \ncosts. It appears that the dispute-resolution procedures have become \nextremely adversarial and costly. Studies have found that the amount of \nspecial education litigation has dramatically increased in recent \nyears. Too often, the litigation can be used as a fishing expedition to \nthreaten districts with protracted litigation.\n  The practice serves to reduce district funds available to meet the \nneeds of students with disabilities, and we clearly need reforms of the \ndispute-resolution process to ensure that scarce educational funds are \nused for educational services for the children for whom they were \nintended. But because of the explosion of litigation in this area, \neducational services for students are put at risk.\n  Under the measure I introduced, local school districts would be \npermitted to provide alternative education placements to children who \nthreaten the safety of others. For some children, it is absolutely \nappropriate to remove them swiftly and permanently from the regular \nclassroom setting. And under the law that I proposed, school officials \nwould be permitted, on their own authority, to discipline dangerous and \nunruly students.\n  Again, the measure I introduced would give the school districts the \nauthority and flexibility to ensure that the students and the personnel \nare provided educational and working environments that are safe and \norderly.\n  Finally, I point out that when the Federal Government enacted IDEA, \nit promised to fund 40 percent of the national average per-pupil \nexpenditure. Today, the Federal Government funds only 7 percent. That \nis why I am very pleased today to join with my colleague from New \nHampshire, Senator Gregg, to provide in this legislation explicit \ndirection to Congress to fund fully IDEA.\n  I congratulate the committee and its leadership for having made so \nmany necessary reforms in the reauthorization of the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act. I hope we can take the next very important \nstep and assure the funding. Congress only recently has come up with 7 \npercent of the funding rather than 40 percent.\n  Last week, a major network news story featured a story on a school in \nmy home State in Maryville, MO. The Maryville R-II School District did \nnot have the revenue to repair its deteriorating classrooms. After six \nunsuccessful attempts to pass local bond issues, the district was able \nto pass a bond issue to renovate the schools.\n  The Maryville school district spends approximately $434,800 on \nspecial education, of which $68,200 is Federal funds, all of which is \nspent on mandates. If the district were not bound by the paperwork \nrequirements and other costly mandates of the law, they would have more \nmoney to improve their facilities and their classrooms.\n  The skyrocketing costs of our special-needs children being served by \nIDEA places local school districts in a bind with little assistance \nfrom the Federal Government.\n  An Economic Policy Institute study on school funding found that new \nmoney for education went disproportionately to fund deficits in special \neducation funding caused by increasing requirements for services \ncoupled with the Federal failure to meet its promised commitment.\n  We have been in this body in an effort sometimes called devolution, \nsometimes called enhanced federalism, more often, in my view, called \nthe commonsense approach of letting the level of Government which \ndelivers the service make the decisions.\n  Over the last few years, it says we ought to be allowing the school \ndistrict if it is an educational decision, or the water district if it \nis a water-related problem, or the justice system if it is a justice \nproblem make the decisions of how it works.\n  We need to be providing more resources and less good ideas to local \ngovernments. That is particularly important in this field with the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act. I can tell you that the \ngoals and the objectives are understood, they are strongly felt by the \npeople who serve in the school system and who support the school \nsystem, but they have too many requirements that prevent them from \ngetting the job done. That is why I think we need to provide some \nflexibility for local school districts. We need to reestablish and \nrestore to local school districts, to school administrators, and others \nthe ability to use common sense in maintaining discipline and order and \nsafety in the classroom.\n  We also in this body need to step up to the plate and make sure that \nwe come through with the funding that is needed to carry out these \nmandates.\n  When I talked with the school principals, administrators, and \nteachers, I said, ``After what you have told me, we need to give you \nsome freedom to do these things.'' They said, ``Well, how about a \nlittle money to help us with the burdens you put on us?'' I said, \n``That makes sense.'' They said, ``Look, to handle these children with \ndisabilities who are violent, we need to have the resources to provide \nthem the alternative education which is appropriate for them and which \nwill not subject their fellow students to risks.'' It is going to be \nmore expensive, and there is not the money there yet.\n  I am hoping that if we can increase the funding that is needed for \nthese services, we are going to see not only order and discipline and \nconduct restored in the normal classrooms but a much higher quality of \neducational services delivered to the children with disabilities.\n  Again, I commend and thank the committee for making the many reforms \nit has done in this bill. And I say that the School Improvement \nSecurity Act of 1997, which I described briefly, most of which is very \nsignificantly incorporated in this measure--I have been advised that \nthe following organizations strongly support the provisions of it: The \nMissouri School Boards Association, the Missouri Association of \nElementary School Principals, the Missouri Association of Secondary \nPrincipals, the Missouri State Teachers Association, the Missouri \nFederation of Teachers & School Related Personnel, the Fort Zumwalt \nSchool District.\n  I think, I say to the chairman, that we could get a list a half-mile \nlong of organizations in my State that are behind you in the efforts to \nreform and reauthorize this measure. I know they are going to be behind \nSenator Gregg's and my efforts to get more funding.\n  So I congratulate you on the measure. We look forward to working with \nyou. We want to see if there is a way that we can provide the funding \nthat is so badly needed for this very important service and for the \nwell-being of the entire educational system in our country.\n  I thank the Chair and thank the distinguished managers of the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank wholeheartedly the Senator from Missouri for \nhis comments. I also want to thank him for his introduction of the \nlegislation last year which we found immensely helpful in being able to \namend the present law and used to make sure that we did a better job in \nhandling the very difficult situations which the Senator from Missouri \nreferred to. He has been a tireless worker in many areas. This is one \nof those where he has demonstrated his keen ability to be of assistance \nin very difficult areas. I thank the Senator very much for his \nstatement.\n\n[[Page S4309]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do want to thank my colleague from Missouri for his \nlong efforts to make sure that the law works and works well, not only \non behalf of disabled students, but on behalf of all students. \nCertainly there is always room for discussion, debate, and trying to \nget a meeting of the minds and get people together on this. That is \nwhat I think we have done in this bill.\n  As my friend from Missouri pointed out at the closure of his remarks, \nthis does have a broad base of support, from the National School Boards \nAssociation, Parent-Teacher Association, school officers, disability \nrights groups. It has a broad base of support, cutting across all these \nlines, which I think indicates we have, indeed, through the leadership \nof Senator Jeffords, met our obligation to ensure that our \nconstitutional requirements are fulfilled and at the same time to \nensure that our schools are safe and conducive to learning for all \nstudents.\n  I might just say to my friend from Missouri, about the case of which \nhe spoke, about the tragic case of the young woman who was murdered, we \nhad looked into that case in great detail. The American Law Division of \nthe Congressional Research Service looked into the facts of the case \nwhether IDEA had any relevance at all to the case.\n  I will, just for the record, read the last paragraph of their \nanalysis of the tragic death of Christine Smetzer. It said:\n\n       Although IDEA's provisions did not appear to be directly \n     implicated by the factual pattern involved in Christine \n     Smetzer's death, questions were raised concerning other laws, \n     namely those involving the confidentiality of juvenile \n     records. The youth charged in the case apparently had a \n     juvenile police record which was unavailable to the school \n     officials. This situation apparently led to the amendment \n     of state statutes regarding juvenile crime. The new \n     statute provides in part that the juvenile court can give \n     school administrators information about past histories of \n     delinquents upon request, and schools may suspend a \n     student who has been charged or convicted of a felony in \n     adult court.\n\n  Just for my friend's knowledge, in our bill we address that. We said \nhere--I want to read for the Record, and I am told Senator Ashcroft was \nresponsible on our committee for putting this on the committee level. \nIt says:\n\n       Disciplinary Information.\n\n  This is right on the point with this case I think.\n\n       The State may require that a local educational agency \n     include in the records of a child with a disability a \n     statement of any current or previous disciplinary action that \n     has been taken against the child and transmit such statement \n     to the same extent that such disciplinary information is \n     included in, and transmitted with, the student records of \n     nondisabled children. The statement may include a description \n     of any behavior engaged in by the child that required \n     disciplinary action, a description of the disciplinary action \n     taken, and any other information that is relevant to the \n     safety of the child and other individuals involved with the \n     child. If the State adopts such a policy, and the child \n     transfers from one school to another, the transmission of any \n     of the child's records must include [must include] both the \n     child's current individualized education program and any such \n     statement of current or previous disciplinary action that has \n     been taken against the child.\n\n  So I hope that reaches this tragic case. I hope that would settle it.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague from Iowa.\n  As I hope I indicated in this case, the Christine Smetzer tragedy was \nnot a case where a student was kept in the classroom as a result of \nIDEA. I think I attempted to point out that the past disciplinary \nrecords of the student had not been transferred.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. BOND. The school district and the parents and everybody \nassociated with it are still in great shock. They feel that they may \nhave had a much better opportunity to prevent that had they been \nadvised. That is why I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa and \nthe chairman of the committee, particularly my colleague, Senator \nAshcroft, for getting that records provision in there.\n  The teachers who have been on the front line, some stated to me, and, \nfrankly, with fear in their eyes, ``If a child is coming in who has a \nrecord of violent behavior, at least let us know, at least let us \nknow.'' To me, that is just--I mean, that is an unanswerable, that is \nan unanswerable position. There is no reason why we should not let them \nknow.\n  The State of Missouri has made significant changes in the policy for \ntransfers within the State. Our State has the tremendous distinction of \nbordering on eight other States, including Senator Harkin's State of \nIowa. About everything in the Midwest, we border on them. When a \nstudent comes in from another State, or when a student from our State \ngoes to another State, it is only fair that the teachers and the \nadministrators know if there is a problem. Frankly, it probably is a \nhelp for the students who have no problem because they are not treated \nwith suspicion. If a student is without problems, it is a help to know \nthat as well.\n  But I do commend the committee and the occupant of the chair, who has \ntaken an active role in this, particularly my colleague from Missouri, \nSenator Ashcroft, on crafting a bill that deals with these provisions.\n  I hope that you will be able to take and accommodate the provisions \nfor funding that Senator Gregg and I support.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my colleague from Missouri. I know he has been on \nthis issue for some time.\n  I remember last year when we were working on the bill, it came to \nlight, after we finished working on the bill at the committee level but \nbefore we went to the floor. I was informed by my staff that this \namendment was part of the managers' amendment. We just did not get the \nbill up last year. I know the occupant of the chair was the leader of \nour subcommittee, and we had the bill ready to go last year. He worked \nhis heart out to get the darned thing through, but for whatever reason \nit did not happen.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri for his long-time interest in this \narea and for working with us. I know sometimes the bills seem to get \nthrough exceedingly slow, but we finally got it accomplished, and \nhopefully it will be through in a couple of days.\n  I also wanted to respond--and this is something I always like to \npoint out when we talk about the high cost of educating kids with \ndisabilities--I know it seems like it is a high cost, but then you have \nto look at the other side of the ledger. What is happening to these \nkids later on, what is society spending or saving later on during the \nlifetime of these young people as they go through school?\n  I have some data here showing in 1974, the year before enactment of \nthe 94-142, there were 70,655 children and youth with disabilities \nliving in State institutions. By 1994, 20 years later, as a result of \nIDEA, the number had fallen to 4,001, less than 6 percent of what it \nwas 20 years earlier. In 1994, the average State institution cost was \n$82,256 per person in an institution, with 66,654 fewer children \ninstitutionalized than in 1974. Because the States were footing the \nbill, the savings to the States is $5.46 billion per year that the \nStates do not have to come up with for institutionalized care. The \nsavings do not include the savings in welfare, social services and \nother costs for people with disabilities who are now able to live \nindependently and be employed and pay taxes as a result of the special \neducation they have received.\n  A young friend of mine, Danny Piper, from Iowa, who I have followed \nfor years, came and testified once before our Disabilities Policy \nSubcommittee. He is 26 years old, with an IQ of 39. When he was born, \nhis parents were told to institutionalize him. They did not do it. They \nput him through school with IDEA, and he went through regular high \nschool. He acted in a school play. He was a manager of the football \nteam.\n  To make a long story short, since graduating he has become a \ntaxpayer. He has recently moved into his own apartment. He takes his \nown bus to work and is paying his own way.\n  We figured out once with his folks what the total cost to taxpayers \nfor his special education over this 18-year period was. He received \nearly intervention, special education. The best they could come up with \nwas a total additional cost of $63,000 for him for special education. \nThe cost to taxpayers if he had been institutionalized would have been \n$5 million over his lifetime.\n\n[[Page S4310]]\n\n  Again, I know people think, gosh, it costs a lot of money, but we \nhave to think where we were before and how much we were spending before \nfor institutionalization, for a lot of people that did not need to be \nin institutions. Certainly Danny is one. He is out working and buying \ncolor TV's and things like that.\n  I wanted to make that point because I know it is an expense and we \nhave to think of the other side of the ledger.\n  Since I talked about Danny Piper, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record an article recently from the Des Moines Register \nabout Danny entitled ``Shooting for Independence.'' This is the whole \nstory about Danny Piper and what he is doing, including competing in \nthe Special Olympics. It talks about the medals he has received for \nbasketball, track, bowling, and golf, competing in the Special \nOlympics. It is a story about one young man and what he has been able \nto accomplish because he got that kind of education.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Des Moines Register, Mar. 22, 1997]\n\n                       Shooting for Independence\n\n\n       Be it a medal or a friend, Dan Piper pushes limits to win\n\n                           (By Jeff Eckhoff)\n\n       The bedroom walls of Dan Piper's Ankeny apartment are \n     covered with his trophies:\n       Photos of Piper with Sen. Tom Harkin at a rally promoting \n     the Americans with Disabilities Act. A photo of a grinning \n     Piper sporting slicked-back hair and a leather jacket for his \n     high school production of ``Grease.'' Framed newspaper \n     articles and letters.\n       And the medals. Four of them. Gold and silver dangling from \n     shiny blue ribbon. For basketball and track and bowling and \n     golf. There are more in the closet, along with ribbons from \n     scores of other events in scores of different Special \n     Olympics competitions spread over the 26 years of Dan Piper's \n     life.\n       But it's the medals that seem most important to Piper. \n     Because he wants another one.\n       The state Special Olympics basketball competition is \n     scheduled to start at 1:30 p.m. today in the University of \n     Iowa Field House in Iowa City. And Piper, who hit 49 out of \n     50 free throws at a regional event last month, is expected to \n     do well.\n       For his part, Piper is certainly expecting to do well.\n       ``He's very competitive,'' explains a laughing Sylvia \n     Piper, Dan's mother. ``He's not a good sport at all . . . . \n     Dear God, if he doesn't get a blue ribbon, we're all going to \n     be tortured unbelievably.''\n       Not that ribbons are all that's on Dan Piper's mind these \n     days. Leaning over a table in the back room of Ankeny's Osco \n     Drug last week, he talked about his job, about his friends \n     there and about the relative merits of Rocky Balboa movies.\n       But mostly he talked of his friend, Melissa Berry--and of a \n     dance that was scheduled to take place at an Iowa City hotel \n     Friday night.\n       ``My Mom's going to dance with my Dad,'' Piper explained. \n     ``Me, I've got to dance with my woman.''\n       He was born Oct. 2, 1970, the son of a communications \n     engineer and a woman whose sole prior knowledge of mental \n     disabilities had been a field trip to a state hospital when \n     she was in junior high school.\n       The doctors didn't call it Down's syndrome then. They were \n     far less politically correct. And they were unswerving in \n     their belief that Gary and Sylvia Piper should \n     institutionalize their new retarded son.\n       Instead, the Pipers took Dan home--and set about making \n     sure he had every possible chance to succeed.\n       They fought to keep 8-year-old Dan in a ``normal'' \n     classroom when they discovered he performed better there than \n     at the ``special'' schools. Eight years later, they and other \n     parents threatened legal action in order to get the Ankeny \n     school district to start its first special-education classes.\n       ``Dan is the teacher and we've been the students,'' Sylvia \n     said. ``That holds until this day. I have learned never to \n     say `Never' to him.''\n       In 1993, the school district, the Heartland Area Education \n     Agency and a group of Ankeny families that included the \n     Pipers helped form Creative Community Options, an agency \n     designed to help the mentally disabled live with as much \n     independence as possible.\n       The agency now serves 21 individuals living in Ankeny and \n     Des Moines, said its director, Marci Davis. Thanks to special \n     training from the agency, thirteen of those people hold \n     regular jobs in the Ankeny area.\n       Eleven of the 21 receive visits from agency workers who \n     help them with things such as making dinner and going \n     shopping. Six of those 11, including Piper, live in their own \n     apartments.\n       The goal of all of this, Davis said, is to prove that \n     people with mental disabilities can live in society, do real \n     work and pay real taxes--they don't have to be shunted into \n     special occupations or homes.\n       ``There's this balance (we seek from employers) between \n     charity and providing a real job,'' Davis said. ``What we're \n     looking for is a real job with the understanding that this \n     person may take a little longer to do it.''\n       Piper gets to Osco Drug at 8:30 every morning, gets his \n     list from his boss and sets to work on the day's chores. For \n     three hours a day, he cleans the store, stocks shelves, and \n     handles all the returned cans and bottles.\n       In between, he makes a lot of friends. That, say store \n     officials, is probably his only fault.\n       ``He does his three or four things very well,'' said Osco \n     general manager Tom Rotherham. ``He doesn't always come back \n     for more things to do, but that's OK. Sometimes, we'll find \n     him in the aisles talking to people. . . . The customers seem \n     to like him.''\n       Piper is easy to talk to but difficult to follow. The words \n     sometimes get caught in feedback loops, cycling endlessly \n     around a thought that never quite makes it out of his mouth. \n     But his enthusiasm is contagious.\n       On a recent tour of the Osco back room, he pointed with \n     pride at the restrooms he cleans. Out front, he pointed out \n     the frozen pizza, the Coke and the bottled water ``that you \n     have to pay for.''\n       He lingered longer over the video rack. Piper is legendary \n     among friends for his adoration of Darth Vader, the Jackson \n     Five and all movies involving a certain Philadelphia boxer \n     who, no matter what obstacles are set in front of him, \n     refuses to give up.\n       ``That guy was in Rocky IV,'' Piper said pointing to a \n     Dolph Lungren flick. ``He's a great fighter.''\n       He has always liked sports. Just as he has always liked \n     Melissa Berry, another Creative Community Options client. The \n     two were inseparable in high school, friends say. It was \n     Melissa whom Dan first thought of when it came time to make \n     plans for this weekend's trip.\n       They don't see enough of each other Piper thinks. The \n     reasons why have to do both with parental concerns and the \n     practical considerations of two people who are not quite \n     independent.\n       Ed Berry, Melissa's father, said she ``is the same as any \n     other child. I'm not certain when anyone can say it's time to \n     open the magic door up and say, `She's ready (to be on her \n     own).' But I'm not sure you can say that with any child.''\n       After several weeks of Piper's persistence, he, Melissa and \n     several other agency clients were scheduled to leave for Iowa \n     City in their own van Friday afternoon.\n       His parents decided to make the trek to Iowa City this \n     morning--that way he could enjoy Friday's dance without them \n     there.\n       ``Dan thinks there's something strange about dancing with \n     your parents,'' explained Tina Fessler, a Creative Community \n     Options worker who helps Piper with lunch, shopping and \n     getting around town each weekday. ``He has a real hard time \n     with that.''\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Lastly, Mr. President, we just had a report from the \nCensus Bureau which did a study that showed the employment population \nratio for persons with severe disabilities increased from 23.3 percent \nin 1991, when ADA went into effect, to 26.1 in 1994, meaning there are \n800,000 more severely disabled working in 1994 than in 1991, which is a \n27-percent increase.\n  So, again, I think what this Congress did with Public Law 94-142 in \n1975, with the addition of part H in 1986, and then capped with the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act in 1990, have not only made us a more \ndecent and caring society, a more inclusive society, but in the long \nrun it will save us money because we are putting the money in at the \nfront end, getting these kids early intervention programs, good \neducation, integrating them with people they will live with all their \nlives.\n  I remember some years ago when my daughter was in public school, \ncoming home and talking about how they had a couple of kids with \ndisabilities in the classrooms, just like it was normal. They are there \nevery day. These are people we live with all our lives. Rather than \nsegregating them out, we bring them in and include them.\n  Even though it may cost some upfront, the savings, if you look in \nhard economic terms, the savings are tremendous later on. Of course, \nthat is not counting the quality of life, the independence, the ability \nof people to have a better life for themselves even though they may \nhave disabilities.\n  All in all, it is a great bill, and the reauthorization and the \namendments we have added, I believe, meet a lot of the concerns people \nhave, legitimate concerns. I hope and trust this will provide for a \nmore cooperative framework for parents, teachers, school \nadministrators, and local law enforcement officials to work together in \na very cooperative spirit to ensure that all kids with disabilities \nhave that right to a free and appropriate public education.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4311]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment No. 241, \nwhich has been offered to S. 717.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Washington \ndesires to speak shortly.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to explain where \nwe are. We have one amendment pending, the Gregg amendment, which has \nbeen offered and which we all would love to do. Again, I want to \nexplain to my colleagues why we are in a position where it is \ndifficult, if not impossible, for us to accept any amendments, \nnotwithstanding how much we would like to do so.\n  The House will be passing in the morning the same bill, identical. We \nhope to pass here the same bill. The reason for that is one that is \nhard to explain because I don't like to have this kind of a situation. \nBut as I explained this morning to my colleagues, last year, we came \nvery close to passing the bill which was almost identical to what we \nhave, but we have made some changes to reconcile some of the problems \nthat were raised. At the time, we tried to do that, the word got out \nand erroneous statements were made about it. This is such a volatile \narea, where you are dealing with young people with disabilities and \neducational settings and the concept of mainstreaming and all these \nthings. It is a very emotional subject. The whole thing fell apart.\n  What we have done this year with the leadership in the Senate pulling \ntogether, with David Hoppe and the groups from all over the country, we \nfinally reached, the other night, the final, final agreement. Everybody \nis holding hands. Notwithstanding that, there are people today \nspreading incorrect information around the country that certain things \nhave happened and people are getting concerned. We are trying to make \nsure we don't have any opportunity for this bill to fall apart. It is \nso important, so emotional, and so difficult, so we are trying to do \nthat. At times, I will have to speak against things that I agree with. \nWe have the Gregg amendment pending right now. It is a concept I think \neverybody in the Senate agrees with. In fact, they voted 93 to 0 to do \nwhat he wants to do some time ago on the Goals 2000 bill. To do that \nagain would create a problem. I have already announced my support for \nus to reach the goal of 40 percent to fund the total cost of problems \nwith disabilities in this bill.\n  We started off when we passed it back in 1975 with funding at 12 \npercent. It went down as low as about 5 percent. We are now back up to \nabout 8 percent, around the efforts of Senator Gregg, primarily, last \nyear. I hope we will get that kind of a commitment. I agree with \neverything Senator Gregg is doing, but I have to oppose it because it \nwould create a problem we don't want to create. With that piece of \nknowledge, as soon as the Senator from Washington is ready, he can \nspeak; he has an amendment. I wanted to lay out what I will do when he \nis finished.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I stand before you and my colleagues here \nin the Senate today in a situation for which I can remember no parallel \nduring the course of my career. It is a position with which I have \nstruggled considerably, not just as we worked toward the scheduling of \nthis bill, but for the course of more than the last 2 years.\n\n  I have an amendment to this bill, which I will introduce later on \nthis afternoon, which I suspect, given the nature of this debate, has \nvery little chance of acceptance. I will oppose this bill as one that I \nconsider imposes not only an unfunded but an unwarranted mandate \nliterally on every school district, every school director, every school \nadministrator, every teacher in the public school systems of the United \nStates.\n  At the same time, Mr. President, I want to pay heartfelt tribute to \nthe distinguished Senator from Vermont, who is managing the bill, to \nthe distinguished junior Senator from Tennessee, who has perhaps spent \nmore time on it during his 2-plus years in the U.S. Senate than he has \non any other issue and, probably, than any other Senator has in that \ntime. From their perspective--and it is a valid perspective--this bill \nrepresents a substantial step in the right direction from the current \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA.\n  It represents a careful balancing on their part of the many, the \nstrong, the articulate lobbies on each side of the disability issues \nthat surround this bill. In fact, it represents an exquisite compromise \ndealing effectively with at least some of the interests of every group \ninvolved in public education, except for the students and the quality \nof education that they are provided in our public schools.\n  Education may be the single issue with the highest degree of \nprominence that will be discussed during the course of this Congress. \nThe President has made both some real progress and far more rhetorical \nprogress in bringing the quality of education provided for our students \ntoday, as they move into their lives in the 21st century, than he has \non any other issue. This bill, however, has not played a significant \npart in that rhetoric. And almost nothing in the drafting or the debate \nover this bill has concerned itself with the overall quality of \neducation that will be provided to the great mass of our young people \nas they move into an increasingly competitive world and increasingly \ncompetitive environment.\n  No, Mr. President, this bill is aimed, as is its predecessor, at a \nrelatively small, though growing--and I will speak to the nature of \nthat growth a little later--element in our population who are subject \nto a number of disabilities. Like so many of our other statutes in many \nother fields, its focus is so narrow that it avoids entirely, or \ninterferes with, the overall quality of education provided to all of \nour young people, together with the rights of those who are closest to \nthose young people--their parents, their teachers, their school \nadministrators, their elected school board members--to make judgments \nabout how best to provide the best possible education for the largest \nnumber of students. We hear soaring rhetoric about the need for higher \neducational standards as we move into the 21st century. But, Mr. \nPresident, I regret to say that this bill will not help us in any way \nin providing those higher standards. In fact, it will increasingly \ninterfere with and frustrate their attainment. And yet, I must return \nto the very real tribute and credit that ought to be paid to those on \nthe committee of jurisdiction who have drafted this, not on a blank \nslate, but on the slate that has been inscribed with the current IDEA.\n  Some of the remarks that I will make during the course of this \ndebate, coming from individual parents or\n\n[[Page S4312]]\n\nschool districts, will of course relate to the enforcement of the law \nas it exists at the present time. But I believe, very much to my \nregret, that they will apply with equal force and merit to the bill \nthat is before us, should it become law.\n  The fundamental flaw with this bill, and with the present law, Mr. \nPresident, is that it imposes on every school district in the United \nStates a double standard with respect to school discipline, with \nrespect to order in the classroom, with respect to priorities in \nconnection with the financial, the fiscal investment in our children's \neducation. It is overwhelmingly an unfunded mandate of exactly the type \nthe last Congress, at least so far as the future was concerned, tried \nto avoid. It is, however, an unfunded mandate in another sense. There \nis hardly a Member of this body, Republican or Democrat, who does not \ngive eloquent lip service to the proposition of local control and local \ninfluence over our schools, particularly in their day-to-day \noperations, and even when we feel that certain national levels of \nachievement ought to be set--perhaps not imposed, but at least set \nagainst which to measure attainment.\n\n  Yet, I pick up this bill, S. 717, and I note that it is 327 pages \nlong, every page of which imposes a detailed mandate on the system of \nschools in New York City, NY, on the system of schools in the smallest \nand most rural district in the State of Kansas, or in the State of \nWashington--rules which cannot possibly be set in a universal fashion \napplicable to every student in every situation in every school district \nin a world which truly values education and truly believes that so much \nof education results from the dynamics of an individual teacher and an \nindividual student.\n  I had intended literally to read some of these requirements to you \nhere, and I must confess that unless I wished to engage in a \nfilibuster, I do not have time to do so. But in this bill, beginning on \npage 141, there are detailed procedural safeguards on behalf of any \nindividual who claims a disability and who claims that that disability \nhas not been dealt with precisely according to the rules in the other \n300-plus pages of the statute. Those procedural requirements begin on \npage 141 and end on--well, I have not gotten to the end yet. I am at \npage 156 and working through this set of requirements--20, 30 or more \npages simply of procedural requirements applicable to each disabled \nstudent, applicable to each school district, applicable to each \nindividual determination. The only thing missing in those procedural \nrequirements is the slightest expression of concern for any of the \ngreat majority of students who are not disabled, of the problems of \nindividual teachers and individual classrooms or of the overall quality \nof education that will be provided by school districts subjected to the \nmandates included in this statute.\n  The amendment that is before the body now proposed by the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] would raise from about 7 percent the \ncurrent level of support from the Federal Government to defray the \nmandates imposed by this bill to somewhere closer to 40 percent that \nthe original Individuals With Disabilities Education Act purported to \nmandate or at least to authorize.\n  The Senator from Vermont has said that he has great sympathy with the \nGregg amendment but that he must oppose it, and it will undoubtedly be \ndefeated. We can afford to make the requirements but we cannot afford \nto pay for them. Why? Perhaps the Senator from Vermont will correct me \non this. Because if we were to do so, if we were to pay entirely for \nthe requirements we lay out in this statute, we would not have any \nmoney left over for any other educational purpose from K through 12. \nNone of the wonderful promises of the President or of a multitude of \nMembers of this body.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I will be blunt. If the Congress were forced \nto pay all of the costs that it imposes by this bill or by its \npredecessor on individual school districts, there is not the remotest \nchance that the statute would ever have been passed in the first place \nor be passed here today. It would simply be too expensive. We can, \nhowever, please certain interest groups by making these requirements \nand by requiring someone else to pay for them.\n  I suspect that you, Mr. President, and the Senator from Vermont and I \nall remember that magnificent motion picture about World War II, \n``Bridge on the River Kwai.'' I think that is what this bill is. The \nsponsors or their predecessors who wrote the first bill have built a \nmagnificent bridge that is a tremendous engineering feat, the net \nresult of which is to lower the quality of education in the United \nStates. We are looking at the bridge and not at the results of building \nthat bridge.\n  I spoke a little earlier about double standards. Overwhelmingly, the \ndouble standards in this bill have to do with rules of discipline. \nPerhaps the most fundamental authority in a local school district or of \na State educational authority is setting rules of discipline designed \nfor two purposes: one, to ensure to the maximum possible extent the \nphysical safety of schools and teachers in schools and in an \neducational situation, and, second, to see to it that the atmosphere in \nthose schools is one that is as conducive to learning as it can \npossibly be. And for the entire history of the Republic until the \npassing of the predecessor to this bill that authority, subject only to \nthe Constitution, was delegated entirely to individual school \ndistricts.\n  This bill, as its predecessor, sets up a dramatic double standard. \nFor a nondisabled student, there is no change. For a disabled student, \nthere is a tremendous change. Disciplinary procedures are greatly \nlimited, are subjected to all of the procedural requirements that--I \nwas going to say outlined--the details of which I described earlier, in \nsuch fashion that the slowest student cannot possibly escape as a part \nof his or her learning process if there is one rule for you and a very, \nvery different rule for me, one that you can't get away with that I can \nget away with--not a very good set of lessons for impressionable young \npeople on their way to becoming productive citizens.\n\n  Now, what does this double standard do? Well, the proponents of the \nbill say, accurately, it prevents discrimination against students with \ndisabilities, a wholesome and a valuable goal--a goal, I may say, \nincidentally, I think most school districts believe in and would \nreasonably enforce without any interference by the Federal Government, \na goal on which most States have statutes themselves, here preempted by \nwhat we do.\n  But there are other consequences of this double standard. The first \nis an overwhelming incentive for parents and for lawyers and for \ncertain students to act in such a fashion that they can receive the \ndesignation that they are disabled because once you find yourself so \ndesignated, most disciplinary rules fly out the window or are greatly \nlimited. You are likely to be entitled to a personal education plan, \nthe cost of which is absolutely unlimited in present law or this bill. \nYou are likely, in a controversy with your school district, to be \nentitled to a lawyer who will end up being paid for by the school \ndistrict, that is to say, by the taxpayers, by the other students. And \nas I have said, whatever the average per student expenditure is in a \nschool district is out the window. The administrative procedure, \nincluding a Federal district court, complete with lawyers and \nattorney's fees, can order any educational setting, any educational \nexpenditure that it deems warranted, looking only at the disabled \nstudent, not viewing in any respect whatsoever the impact of those \ncosts on the ability of the school district to provide an education for \nothers.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GORTON. Is it any wonder that every year, in school district \nafter school district, more and more students find themselves \ndenominated disabled? The incentives to do so are extremely \nsignificant. It is reported by the Advisory Council on \nIntergovernmental Relations that this current bill, of all Federal \nregulatory statutes, ranks fourth in the amount of litigation that it \ncreates. That is a pretty good record. Of all of the regulatory \nstatutes in the United States, this ranks fourth in the amount of \nlitigation it creates.\n  I note another element in that connection. We recently had a decision \nby the Supreme Court of the United States on a particular form of \nenvironmental litigation in which the successful challengers to a \nparticular statute\n\n[[Page S4313]]\n\nreceived their attorney's fees. In this bill, however, attorney's fees \nare a one-way street. If the representative of the individual student \nclaiming discrimination under the statute prevails, that student or \nthat student's family is awarded his or her attorney's fees. If the \nschool district prevails, no attorney's fees can be awarded against the \nlosing party. What does this do? Of course, it encourages litigation. \nThe litigation is free. It also overwhelmingly encourages settlements \nwhich many school districts may regard as very, very unwise, simply \nbecause the potential downside is so great--again adding immensely to \ncosts imposed on school districts.\n  We tend to say ``school districts,'' but obviously in every case, \nevery dollar paid out in attorney's fees, every disproportionate dollar \npaid out as a result of litigation or determinations pursuant to the \nstatute, comes out of the finite pool of money that provides education \nfor other students. A marvelous example of the way this works in the \nreal world has taken place right here in the District of Columbia. \nRecently, the Washington Post highlighted the law firm that makes easy \nmoney by bringing administrative complaints and lawsuits over the \nshortcomings of the District of Columbia's schools' special education \nsystem. One of the lawyers quoted in the argument said, ``Winning those \ncases is like taking candy from a baby.''\n  I am not here to defend the quality of education in the District of \nColumbia. I think it is a magnificent paradox that it may spend more \nmoney per student than any other school district in the United States, \nor very close to that, and has pretty close to the worst results, but \nat least a modest portion of that has to be covered because of the \nfishing expeditions encouraged by this law that makes winning these \ncases ``like taking candy from a baby.'' In my own State of Washington, \nwith which I am more familiar than others, lawyers' costs range from \n$60,000 a year, $90,000 a year, $300,000 a year, all coming out of the \npool of money that would otherwise be used for educating particular \nchildren.\n  However, I spoke a little earlier about the impact of this \nlegislation on other, nondisabled schoolchildren. On that subject we \nreceived a letter from a concerned mother in California. She was \nworking as a parent volunteer in her 5-year-old son's kindergarten \nclassroom. In doing so she observed a student disrupting the classroom \nwith loud outburst, running, kicking, screaming, hitting the teacher \nand aides. The child was in the class because of what is called, in \nthis law, a full inclusion order. The net result was that my \ncorrespondent's 5-year-old child suffered from headaches every day the \ndisruptive child was present in the classroom, was one of the victims \nof the child's outbursts, was punched by the child. The parent of the \ndisabled child rejected the use of any normal method to control her \nchild. The mother, who wrote me, writes that finally she had no choice \nbut to remove her child from the school. She wrote,\n\n       Fearing for my son's physical and emotional well-being, I \n     finally removed my child from the kindergarten system. This \n     occurred after the Federal court ordered the school district \n     to readmit the special education student in spite of all the \n     documented behavior aberrations.\n\n  The statute did not protect that volunteer's child in school. It did \nnot provide for her education. It did not guarantee her constitutional \nright to an adequate public education, because that child, together \nwith the vast majority of other schoolchildren in all of the school \nsystems in the United States, are nonpersons for the purpose of this \nstatute. They do not count. Their safety does not count. The ability to \nlearn in an orderly atmosphere for them does not count because the \nCongress of the United States has told them that it does not. All that \ncan be considered in these cases is the situation surrounding plaintiff \nchild, the child with a disability.\n  One of my own favorite superintendents, who only recently retired, \nL.E. Scarr, superintendent of the Lake Washington school district, a \nlarge suburban district east of Seattle, put it a little differently \nwhen he wrote this to me.\n\n       A process which is supposed to result in an education \n     program agreed to by parents and school personnel at times \n     becomes a battleground on which procedures become more \n     important than educational results.\n\n  Teacher after teacher, school district after school district say that \nthis process depreciates, worsens the educational standards that they \nare able to impose. Dedicated schoolteachers give up their careers \nbecause of their frustration at being able to operate in what they \nconsider to be an appropriate educational manner. We simply have not \ncreated a situation here in which there can be any balance. Even if it \nis appropriate for the Congress of the United States to pass \nlegislation on this subject, even if it is appropriate to pass a 327-\npage bill setting out all of these requirements, is it not appropriate \nto give to each school district some method by which to determine the \nbest educational outcome for the majority of its students? Isn't there \nsome way to say there is some limitation on the amount of limited \nschool district assets that have to be spent on any individual? Isn't \nthere some limitation on the amount of litigation and the amount of \nattorney's fees that can be imposed on our educational system? Isn't it \nappropriate that some consideration be given to the safety and \neducational environment in which the vast majority of our young people \nare educated? But we do not see that here in this bill.\n\n  I must return one more time to the proposition that, yes, it is an \nimprovement over the present situation. My friend from Vermont, in a \nless public conversation, said I was not giving him enough credit when \nI said it was minimal or modest. It was substantial. I may be willing \nto stand corrected on that and say that there are an additional number \nof factors relating to immediate physical safety which will authorize \nat least some discipline against a dangerous but disabled student. And \nthat is a step forward. That is why I, along with many of my \ncolleagues, are, to a certain degree, on the horns of a dilemma when we \ndeal with this bill.\n  It would be easy to vote ``no'' if there were ``no'' Federal \nlegislation on the subject at all. It is much more difficult when you \nmust admit that, for all the criticisms you can make about the regime \nwhich this 327 pages creates, it is still something that is viewed with \nrelief by the National Association of School Boards and the principals' \nand most of the teachers' organizations. But, it seems to me, that \nshows not how good this bill is, but how bad the current legislation \nis: the degree of desperation on the part of our school authorities, \nwho have been willing to sign up for this proposal. I sympathize with \nthem. I think, were I in their position, I would probably have done \nexactly the same thing, because the consequences of not agreeing were \nthe continuation of the status quo.\n  But, here we are, 100 of us in this peaceful but highly artificial \nset of surroundings, pretending that we are wiser than all of the \nschool board members in the United States of America, pretending that \nwe know more about their business than they do, making frequent \nspeeches about the genius of local school systems and of local school \nboards but acting in a way that is totally inconsistent with that lip \nservice.\n  One of the features I have had in my service in the U.S. Senate in \nthe last 8 years is to create advisory committees in every one of the \n39 counties in the State of Washington. I meet with each one of them at \nleast once a year, several of them more than once a year. I have made a \nconscious attempt in every one of these advisory committees to have at \nleast one member, and sometimes more, who is a teacher, a school \nadministrator, a school board member, in many cases recently a student, \nso I can hear, each time I meet with one of these groups, about their \nconcerns with respect to the Federal involvement in public education.\n  Madam President, I can say--and I am probably understating it--that \nin the course of the last 2 years, at least three-quarters of the \ncomments that I have received from these people from education has been \nwith respect to this law and the frustrations and the disruptions \nattendant upon its implementation.\n  And so, I must say with some regret that I will feel constrained to \nvote against this bill for the reasons that I have stated. In preparing \nfor this debate, I agreed with the sponsors that\n\n[[Page S4314]]\n\nwe can probably focus on one, not more than two, particular amendments \nto set out the differences that we have, and the proponents asked me to \ncome to the floor this afternoon, both to engage in a discussion that \nis almost complete and to offer an amendment.\n  I must say, through the Chair, to the chairman, while my first and \nperhaps my only amendment is relatively simple, I don't have it in form \nto offer at this moment, because I didn't like the form in which it \narrived in my office from legislative drafting service.\n  Unlike the 327-page bill, however, it will take up less than 1 page. \nIt will simply state that notwithstanding any other provision in this \nstatute, each local school authority shall have the right to set rules \nrespective of the safety and educational atmosphere for students in \nthat school system. I hope that I will have the final form of the \namendment before this afternoon is up, but we do have another amendment \npending at the present time, the funding amendment of the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  So at this point, I simply want to say that the amendment that I will \npresent and probably will not need to explain to the length I have \nexplained my general position over the course of the last half-hour, \nthe amendment that I will present goes to one element of the heart of \nthis legislation, and that is, who makes decisions with respect to the \nsafety of students in a given school system, who makes decisions with \nrespect to the educational environment in which those students are \neducated? It does not go to the problem of attorney's fees or elaborate \nhearings or costs or the like, matters that I think are important but, \nperhaps, not quite so central to this legislation.\n  I will explain it. We will vote on it. I believe that while in our \nheart of hearts perhaps a majority of the Members of this body agree \nwith me in theory, I am not going to hold my breath until the \namendment, or that matter the amendment of the Senator from New \nHampshire, is adopted. But it is healthy, I think vital, that we debate \nthese fundamental concepts when we are talking about the education of \nour most priceless resource: our young people.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Washington \nfor a very detailed and very well-done discussion of the bill that we \nare considering, IDEA. However, I have to differ and would like to \nexplain some of the areas where I think there may be confusion, if it \nis not explained.\n  First of all, I reiterate the situation that we have with respect to \nthe requirements of States to provide an education to children with \ndisabilities. This matter was brought up in the late sixties, early \nseventies in some 26 courts. Two decisions finally were utilized to \ndefine what was required.\n  First of all, there is no constitutional requirement to provide an \neducation by a State. However, if a State does provide a free education \nto students, it cannot discriminate, and, therefore, it must provide an \nappropriate--and that is the keyword the courts used--an appropriate \neducation for a child with disabilities.\n  Because this was nationwide in its decision, and since the States all \nprovided a free education, it became necessary to define, in a sense, \nwhat was appropriate, and the courts labored to do that. In the \nconsensus decree developed by the parties involved, those kinds of \nrequirements and specificities were defined in that court decree.\n  As a result of that, the Congress decided that since this affected \nall the States, that it be wise if they assisted the States in being \nable to meet the mandates of the court regarding the requirements of \nthe States to provide an appropriate education. We did that, taking the \nwords from the courts' decisions which defined appropriate education \nmust also, when appropriate, have a mainstreaming component and, thus, \nwe have set out in the early version, 94-142, what was to be done to \nreach the courts' mandates, not the Congress' mandates but the courts' \nmandates of constitutional law.\n  The Senator from Washington brings up a problem of which we should \nall be aware, and that is there are limited funds available for our \nschool systems to utilize, and any time that the courts mandate that \ncertain things must be done, that necessarily is going to utilize those \nadditional resources to handle those that are being discriminated \nagainst in order to give them an appropriate education.\n  That was done. Whether it affects the other young people by having \nresources not appropriately assigned to the various groups, that is a \nquestion which is of interest and of importance for us to take a look \nat. I personally feel strongly that right now in our country, we have \nto look at all of the young people and determine that question \nourselves.\n  I would say that the results of those that are noncollege bound and \nthose that are not under the law with disabilities may have an argument \nthat they are not getting a qualified education, because when we \ngraduate 51 percent of those young people--frankly, all of the young \npeople in that forgotten half group who are graduating from high school \nfunctionally illiterate don't have the standards necessary to meet the \nneeds, as the Senator from Washington pointed out, of our society for \nthe next century and may have an argument. That is another case. We are \nhere looking at how to protect children with disabilities in \nconformance with the courts' mandates regarding States which offer free \neducation.\n  Also, he grossly overstated the cost of this in the public school \nsystems. If you take a look at what the costs are, I think the total \ncost for all of special education is over $30 billion--$38 billion. \nThat is nowhere near what we spend totally on education in this \ncountry; certainly nowhere near what perhaps one would think we spend. \nI do not know what the total is we spend, but it is far in excess of \nthat.\n  He also got into the question of uniformity, that there is a double \nstandard. He thinks the States should decide, that they don't need the \nFederal Government to give them any uniformity. I think that would have \nbeen totally disruptive to the system. I think the courts were \nappropriate to bring the consensus decision they did, and I think the \nFederal Government appropriately stepped in with this law to say let's \nhave uniformity, let's establish what the standards are that must be \nmet to take care of those children with disabilities.\n  A great deal of time was spent on lawyer's fees. I am not going to \nspend much time on that. I could read the requirements. First of all, \nthere is no requirement for any attorney's fees. There is nothing in \nthe law that says you have to pay. It says the courts may order--they \nmay order--attorney's fees under certain circumstances. If you look at \nthose circumstances, you will see they are all very reasonable ones. It \nis all may, may, may. There is no requirement that any attorney's fees \nbe paid. I don't want to spend much time on that one.\n  I just have to comment on District of Columbia because I love this \ncity, but they do have terrible problems all the way down, it is not \njust in special education. They have terrible problems up and down. We \nare trying to correct those. Actions have been taken. But as far as the \namount of litigation, there were only 100 cases brought in 1993. We \ndon't have the figures since then. That is hardly any. You have 110,000 \nschools. There has been a court case in a tenth of 1 percent of the \nschools. It is not a huge problem in that respect.\n  I am personally appreciative of the effort of the Senator from \nWashington at explaining his position. I think it helps elevate the \nunderstanding of the people as to what is in this law. But I disagree \nwith most of the comments made. We do represent--I know from going \naround--the feelings and opinions of a number of people, and it is \nappropriate, therefore, for us to discuss, as best we can, these \nconcerns and to alleviate these concerns. I think we have done an \nexcellent job with respect to trying to take care of the problems.\n  The final thing I will mention is with respect to discipline and a \nchild that may be dangerous in a school room. I think as has been \npointed out, there is a very substantial change to protect the children \nin a disrupted classroom. A child may be removed now and may be removed \ncontinuously, following appropriate procedures, until such time as that \nchild really settles down and is no longer dangerous.\n  So it is not the kind of a situation we had before this bill which \nleft, in many cases, the school system pretty helpless when dealing \nwith a disruptive\n\n[[Page S4315]]\n\nchild. I believe we have done an excellent job of taking care of that \nand, hopefully, my colleagues will read those provisions and agree with \nme that we have made a great step forward in undoing what has happened \nin so many of the classrooms in some areas where a child is dangerous \nand disrupted the school setting. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Madam President. I congratulate the majority \nleader, Senator Lott, for helping bring this matter to a place where it \ncan be debated and where this reform in the IDEA law can, in fact, be \nimplemented.\n  I want to thank a number of individuals who worked on this: Senator \nJeffords, Senator Harkin, a wide variety of others; my colleague from \nthe State of Missouri, Senator Bond has been active in working to make \nsure we had the right components.\n  I am grateful that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \nAmendments of 1997, S. 717, is before us, and that we will have a \nchance to vote on it. I believe its passage would result in a \nsubstantial improvement in the ability to deal with disruptive \nindividuals. The committee chairman was speaking about that just a few \nmoments ago. Last year, I objected to the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act, commonly known as IDEA, passing into law because I \nbelieved there were problems regarding discipline and discipline \nrecords of students that needed to be remedied. We worked those out at \nthe close of the session last year in some rather arduous \nnegotiations. This year I continued to work with the IDEA working group \nto get improvements in this regard that will make it possible for us to \nhave safer school districts, safer school rooms, and safer environments \nin which students can learn and teachers can teach.\n\n  Schools need to provide a safe learning environment. Fear is not an \nemotion that is consistent with a learning environment. We need, \nregardless of whether a student was disabled or not, to be able to have \nappropriate disciplinary measures that would enable us to have learning \nenvironments which would be effective.\n  One of the problems that really had troubled me about our previous \nsituation and will trouble me until it is corrected by this reform or \nsome other, is the problem that discipline records frequently did not \ntransfer with students from one school to the next. When a student \narrives at a new campus without the discipline record, the following \nresults can be disastrous.\n  There is a case in Missouri where those results were fatal.\n  My own interest in this particular area of the law was occasioned by \nan outrageous incident which I think shocked the conscience of \nvirtually everyone who was aware of it. Two years ago, in my home State \nof Missouri, a 15-year-old young woman was at her high school. She had \ngone to the girl's restroom when a student with a learning disability \nand behavior disorder followed her into the restroom, and that was the \nbeginning of a series of events which eventually led to her losing her \nlife, after other unspeakable things were done.\n  This incident occurred on the disabled student's second day at the \nschool where the incident occurred. He had been transferred from \nanother school in accordance with IDEA procedures, but when this \nincident occurred the officials at the school where the assault took \nplace say they were not aware of the prior disciplinary history.\n  The chronology of events leading up to this horrific incident are \nvery troubling.\n  In September 1994, the disabled student was enrolled as a ninth grade \nstudent at one high school.\n  In October 1994, the disabled student exhibited uncooperative \nbehavior in class. He was the prime suspect of vandalism in the \nclassroom. He was suspected of urinating on objects in the classroom.\n  Later that same month, the 15-year-old student was suspended pending \na psychological evaluation by the district psychologist after being \nfound in the girl's restroom. This is obviously not behavior which was \nunrelated to what eventually happened.\n  You go through a wide variety of other chronological events which \nfinally find the student being transferred to another school, the \nschool at which the death of the young woman occurred, at his hands and \nin another restroom. But the school officials did not have the \ninformation of the previous disciplinary incidents as a part of the \ntransfer.\n  I felt it essential--I felt it would be totally inappropriate for us \nto allow a so-called reform to go into effect and allow students to \nprecede their disciplinary records. The incident in Missouri \ndemonstrates dramatically that if you precede your record by as much as \n2 days it may be long enough for another student to lose his or her \nlife.\n  When the officials at the second school said that they did not know \nabout the disabled student's disciplinary past, they were pointing to a \ntremendous, gaping hole in the framework for safety that we ought to \nprovide in IDEA legislation.\n  Together with Senator Bond's and Senator Harkin's help, we have been \nable to address this concern. I want to thank them both and the \ncommittee chairman. I am grateful. To me, it seems that this is not the \nkind of thing that ought to divide us; this is the kind of thing that \nought to unite us.\n  Whenever any of the child's records are transmitted to another \nschool, the student's discipline record and the individual education \nprogram must be included in the transmission, so that school officials \nand teachers will know. They will know the past disciplinary records of \na disabled student on his first day in the school. They will know in \ntime to take corrective action. They will know in time to do what they \ncan.\n\n  This will not make all of our schools perfectly safe, but it will \nelevate our capacity to do what we can do and ought to do by giving us \ntimely information.\n  Moreover, when the school or school district reports a crime to law \nenforcement or juvenile justice authorities, copies of the student's \ndisciplinary records must be transmitted for consideration to that \nauthority.\n  In those circumstances where the public agency initiates disciplinary \nprocedures against a student, the agency must ensure that the \ndisciplinary records of the child with a disability are transmitted for \nconsideration by the person or persons making the final determination.\n  We have had a disconnect between our schools and our justice system. \nFrankly, it is time, when serious, dangerous behavior that literally \nthreatens the life and safety of other individuals, we do not have an \nartificial barrier that keeps the education agencies from talking to \nthe criminal justice agencies or the juvenile justice agencies. This \nlaw now provides that school officials may report incidents to proper \nauthorities.\n  Not long ago, in Tennessee, a student with a disability kicked a \nwater pipe in the school lavatory until it burst, resulting in $1,000 \nworth of water damage.\n  When the school officials filed the petition against the child, a \nhearing officer ordered the school district to dismiss its juvenile \ncourt petition, a decision which was upheld by the Sixth Circuit Court \nof Appeals. The court faulted the school for not holding a \nmultidisciplinary meeting before initiating a juvenile court petition.\n  I think it is clear that if students commit crimes that are worthy of \nprosecution, the school should be able to file or cause to be filed a \ncase against the students. The practical effect of the court's ruling \nis that schools as a matter of law cannot unilaterally refer disabled \nstudents to juvenile court for committing acts of violence unless the \nstudent consents to such referrals. So prior to filing the case, you \nwould have to get the consent of the parents of the disabled child or a \ncourt order. Otherwise, it would not happen. It is important that we \nsay to students: Your disabilities will not be a license for you to \nviolate the law or threaten the health and safety and security of \nothers.\n  This bill moves toward abolishing a double standard for individuals \nwho claim disabilities as a shield for potentially life threatening \nbehavior.\n  Regular education students are subject to a range of disciplinary \nactions. Disabled students, on the other hand, even those who are \nviolent or seriously disruptive, can stay put at their current \neducational environment, even if the actions are criminal. This is a \ndouble standard, and has been, and it is\n\n[[Page S4316]]\n\nwrong. While we want to protect disabled students from discrimination, \nwe also have a duty to protect other children from harm.\n  Senate bill 717 now gives greater flexibility to school officials to \nremove dangerous students from the current school. If the child carries \na weapon to school or to a school function or if the child knowingly \npossesses or uses illegal drugs, the bill allows school officials to \nmove the child to an alternative interim setting for the same amount of \ntime that a regular education student would be subject to discipline, \nbut not for more than 45 days.\n  Moving away from this double standard which had existed is a step in \nthe right direction on the part of this bill.\n  A trend developed recently under the bill, the law which we now \nhave--which needs the reform which this bill would provide --that \nstudents would not be known as ``disabled'' or even claim disability \nuntil after they had committed some serious wrong; and after they had \ncommitted some serious wrong, to avoid penalties, they would shout: \nWell, I'm disabled in one way or another, either that I don't read well \nor that I have a kind of nervousness or even some kind of other \nsubjective claim of disability.\n\n  This measure, for which I am grateful, basically provides remedies \nthat are fundamental to improving the environment for learning in the \nschool.\n  It requires that the student's disciplinary records accompany the \nstudent's individualized education program when the student transfers \nto another school, so no student goes to a new school without the \nofficials at the school learning about their prior discipline history, \na major achievement.\n  Second, it holds children with violent or other bad behavior to the \nsame disciplinary standards of other students when the behavior is \nunrelated to their disabilities. You cannot claim you are a slow reader \nand, as a result of being a slow reader, you have the right to assault \nanother student. That simply will not cut it anymore.\n  Third, it will allow school officials to report crimes committed by \ndisabled students to police and juvenile authorities before meeting \nwith the Individualized Education Program team, a special team that \nagrees on an education program for disabled students.\n  It seems to me, especially since that committee is composed of \nindividuals like family members of the student and others who would not \nallow the crime to be reported, that we need to give schools clear \nauthority to make the communication with law enforcement officials when \neven disabled students have committed what is clearly a criminal \nactivity.\n  I opposed the bill last year because it did not have these \nsafeguards.\n  I want to commend the committee chairman, Senator Jeffords. I want to \ncommend Bill Frist, the Senator from Tennessee, who has worked so hard \non this. I want to thank my colleague Senator Bond, and Senator Harkin \nfrom our neighboring State of Iowa, for their work in this respect.\n  I believe the bill is a substantial improvement, and when it is \nenacted, the young people of the United States will be safer. We have \nnot sacrificed the rights of students with disabilities to be educated, \nbut we have enhanced the capacity of students generally to get the kind \nof education they deserve.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I want to thank the Senator from Missouri for a very \narticulate explanation of the most difficult area that we faced, and \nthat is how to handle disruptive children in the school. That has been \na very, very troubling problem for schools to handle. It has been one \nwhich has led to considerable concern about the effectiveness of \nspecial education.\n  The Senator's help in producing this amendment and in these things, I \nthink, has done more to get this bill quickly in shape where I think it \nwill have close to unanimous passage. I deeply appreciate all the help \nthe Senator has given.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I have just a brief supplement to the \nremarks that I made earlier.\n  I referred in general terms to the cost of the mandates under this \nbill and under the current IDEA legislation. I have checked it, and, at \nthe present time, the current funding level is just over $3 billion.\n  The amendment proposed by the Senator from New Hampshire, [Mr. \nGregg], would, over roughly a 7-year period, reach the authorized level \nof having us here in Congress pay for 40 percent of the cost of IDEA \nand would reach, I am told, something like $13 billion or $13.5 \nbillion. It seems to me that is a little short. My own figures are, if \nwe were to fund it at 40 percent for next year, for 1998, the cost to \nthe Congress, to the Federal Government, would be just over $14 \nbillion. Now, that is 40 percent.\n\n  My grade school arithmetic tells me that if the cost were $14 billion \nat 40 percent, the cost of 100 percent funding would be $35 billion. So \nwe have created and will continue to impose a $35 billion cost on the \nschool districts of the United States for the implementation of the \nrequirements that are set out in the statute.\n  Madam President, I went into the Cloakroom and checked how much we \nput into title I, which is, I believe, the single most expensive of all \nof our Federal aid to education in specific bills for all the \ndisadvantaged children.\n  The basic grants for the current year for title I are a little over \n$6 billion. When you add all of the special categories under title I, \nyou get almost to $8 billion.\n  I am told, without having checked every single one of these, that the \nsecond most expensive are the drug-free schools programs, which is \nroughly $4 billion.\n  Now, if I am correct in these, Madam President, I simply go back to \nthe proposition that here we are creating a set of mandates far more \nexpensive than all, I think, of the programs of direct aid for \neducation from kindergarten through the 12th grade.\n  I guess I have to ask the manager of the bill, the chairman of the \ncommittee, if, in fact, we had to come up with $35 million right now \nfor 1998 to pay all of the costs of this bill, and if, in fact, we had \nto work within the balanced budget agreement that has been entered into \nbetween the President and the leadership in the Congress, and if, in \nfact, paying for this bill caused us to either repeal or substantially \nwipe out a huge range of other programs of education assistance, would \nwe be imposing this mandate?\n  Now, I ask that question rhetorically. I know the answer. Of course \nwe would not be. It is real easy to do it, Madam President, when \nsomebody else has to pay the bill. But the Senator from Vermont is \ngoing to oppose even Senator Gregg's amendment, which allows us 7 years \nto get to 40 percent.\n  Now, it is wonderful for us to say our educational theory is this or \nour educational theory is that. We think this is the way schools ought \nto be managed or we think that is the way schools ought to be managed. \nThere are two objections to it. First, we do not know as much about the \nsubject as educators do; and, second, I think we have a requirement to \nput our money where our mouth is. We are not putting our money where \nour mouth is in this bill. We never have, as long as this predecessor \nhas been the law.\n  How do we get to the point at which we tell everybody else in the \nUnited States how to run their businesses, but do not pay for it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Just to get back to the Gregg amendment very quickly, \nthere is no limit as to what we can appropriate by any authorization \nlevel that we could set. We could go for 40 percent tomorrow. There is \nno requirement.\n  Even Senator Gorton voted back in 1994 when the vote was 93 to 0--I \nhave not checked the seven absences, but I do not think the Senator was \nabsent--that as soon as reasonably possible, we ought to fund IDEA.\n  There is no necessity for the Gregg amendment. We can do that now. It \ndoes set out for my colleagues a very reasoned way to do it, which is \nin S. 1, a commitment that the Republicans here--that we do it. I think \nthat is important to keep in mind.\n  What the Senator from Washington has talked about, well, that would \nskew things. But look where the money would go. That money would go to \nthe\n\n[[Page S4317]]\n\nlocal school districts. That is where it goes. In the bill, right now, \nas this is written, if we went up to full funding, that money would all \nflow to local school districts that have any children at all with \ndisabilities. That is where it would go. The States have to keep their \nlevels. So we would help the local school districts so they could use \nthe money and spend it on people you are concerned about that do not \nhave adequate resources.\n  This is an excellent way of pushing money to your local school \ndistricts. You ought to be yelling and shouting for it. It is exactly \nwhat you have always said, that we have to help the local school \ndistricts have more flexibility. This gives great flexibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. GORTON. I spoke to the Senator recently, Madam President. I have \none more modest redraft on my amendment and then we will be able to \nsubmit it during the course of the afternoon, I hope in the course of \nthe next hour. I gather there is an attempt to see to it that there is \nsome overall reasonable limitation of debate on the amendments and on \nthe bill to which this Senator is certainly in accord.\n  So, we will have that here so Members can read it so the Senator can \ncritique it, as he will, in a relatively short period of time.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The assistant \nlegislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I have the privilege today to be here on \nthe floor to support S. 717, the Individuals With Disabilities \nEducation Act.\n  First of all, I find it important to congratulate Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Coats, and Senator Lott, who have worked hard to reach a \ncompromise that I believe this legislation supports. It is an important \ncompromise because this is necessary and important legislation.\n  As my colleagues have stated so well here today on the floor, IDEA is \nour Nation's core special education statute for children with \ndisabilities. In 1975, when the original IDEA passed, Congress accepted \nresponsibility in this area. Now it is our turn to live up to this \ncommitment.\n  I happen to have a son-in-law who is a fifth grade schoolteacher. He \nspeaks to me about the difficulties in the classroom when there are not \nenough resources to be able to handle children who find themselves with \nthese difficulties and the average child who is there in the classroom \nto learn. He finds himself dividing his time up among these, and \nsometimes in an inappropriate way, and not offering to all of the \nchildren the kind of time that their teacher and their instructor ought \nto give.\n  In the bill before the Senate today we have a balanced approach which \ntakes into account the needs and rights of the local school boards, \nteachers, parents and, most important, the students. Among its chief \nprovisions is the flexibility it affords local school officials in \nmaking alternative interim placement of children with disabilities who \nbring weapons or drugs to school. This was an area of heated debate, \nand I am pleased to see the final bill includes an arrangement we can \nall work with.\n  Likewise, I am pleased with the progress the committee has made on \nother controversial issues such as the recovery of attorney's fees and \nsuccession of services. While no parties involved will receive all that \nthey hoped for, this balanced approach is fair, and, I think, it is \nsound public policy.\n  There is, however, some work left to be done. Though perhaps not \ntoday, this Congress will, in the very near future, have to take up the \nissue of full funding for IDEA. There is a role for the Federal \nGovernment to play in education, and while those of us who believe in \nthe right of the State and, most important, the right of the local \nschool district to have the primary responsibility, the area of funding \nof targeted needs and special needs has been something the Federal \nGovernment has done well over the last good number of years, and IDEA, \nin my opinion, is one of those.\n  When the law was originally passed in 1975, Congress promised to \nprovide appropriations equal to 40 percent of the national average per \npupil expenditure for education. Since S. 717 makes progress toward \nthat important goal, I remained committed to seeing us reach the full \nfunding level. I am confident, however, that this issue will be \naddressed during our consideration of the budget. Accordingly, I do not \nsee the need for amending S. 717 at this time.\n  Again, Madam President, I state my thanks for the work that has been \ndone by all of those involved in the lengthy but successful process of \nbringing S. 717 to the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, what is the order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Gregg amendment, \nNo. 241.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the bill itself \nrather than the amendment. I believe that is appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nreauthorization of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, or \nIDEA, as it is commonly referred to. This legislation has had a long \nand difficult journey. The coalitions supporting this bill do not all \nagree on all of its points. In fact, there are a few things in this \nlegislation that I would have preferred to have seen strengthened. \nHowever, as the great Kentucky statesman Henry Clay once said, \n``compromise is mutual sacrifice.''\n  It is my understanding that modifications to this legislation will \ndoom the bill to failure. While I have a few reservations, I am certain \nthat this reauthorization is better than not reauthorizing the current \nstatute. Therefore, this Senator will not vote for any amendment that \nwill prevent this legislation from being signed into law. Let me repeat \nthat. This Senator will not vote for any amendment that will prevent \nthis legislation from being signed into law, and I hope others will \nfollow that lead. We simply cannot fail to reauthorize this important \nstatute. Our disabled children and our educators have waited long \nenough.\n  A few years back, I read a journalist's observation that ``We are \ndefined by who we have lost.'' It wasn't until this time last year, Mr. \nPresident, when I got word of the death of a young woman from Berea, \nKY, that I really understood the journalist's words. Twenty-three years \nago, when I was Governor of Kentucky, Susy Riffe was just a child with \nDown's syndrome. But she became a symbol of great potential and great \npromise as she sat on my lap and helped me sign a bill guaranteeing \npublic education for disabled children in Kentucky.\n  Susy went on to lead a full and productive life, completing her \neducation and giving back a great deal to the community as a volunteer, \nan employee, and a dear friend. Her life came to define the potential \nthat exists for all Americans when the greater community provides them \nwith the tools they need to succeed. They say that 250 people came to \nSusy Riffe's memorial service. But that number represents only a small \nfraction of the children and families she touched and the world of \npossibilities she helped define.\n  Just 1 year after I signed that law onto the books in Kentucky, the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Act was passed into law here in \nWashington, helping millions of children across this great land of \nours. We must always remember that the mission of this law is that the \nright to a free and appropriate public education is the right of all \nAmerican children. While IDEA provides critical education assistance \nfrom the Federal Government to the State and local education agencies, \nit\n\n[[Page S4318]]\n\nis the guarantee of disabled children's rights to an education that \nmakes this statute great.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues, the floor \nmanagers, members of the Labor Committee, the majority leader, and \ntheir staffs for their efforts in bringing this reauthorization to the \nSenate floor today. It is a herculean task that has not gone unnoticed \nby this Senator.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my name be added \nas a cosponsor to this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleagues in \nboth the House and Senate, from both sides of the aisle, for their \ndiligent work on S. 717, the IDEA Improvement Act of 1997: Their \ncommitment to ensuring that children with disabilities have continued \naccess to the opportunities and resources essential to becoming \nindependent and contributing members of society.\n  Since Congress first enacted legislation to ensure that students with \ndisabilities were no longer denied educational services, few changes \nhave been made. Today, the world is a very different place, and \nCongress needs to address the issues currently facing both students and \neducators. These include changes to ensure States have flexibility in \nusing Federal funds; the ability for schools to effectively discipline \ndisruptive children; and provisions to encourage alternative dispute \nresolution procedures to ensure timely and cost-effective responses to \nthe needs and concerns of parents and administrators. S. 717 \naccomplishes these important goals.\n  Discipline of special education students has been a matter of \ncontention for several years. Currently, except in cases involving \nfirearms, schools are hindered from removing a disabled child from \ntheir current educational setting unless the parents of the child agree \nwith the removal decision. Under S. 717, schools can discipline a \ndisabled child just as they would on a nondisabled child if the \nbehavior is determined not to be a manifestation of the child's \ndisability. A hearing officer would then be able to remove the child \nfrom his or her current educational placement. This is an important \nchange because, currently, a court injunction is required to remove a \ndangerous child.\n  S. 717 also prohibits States from ceasing to provide services to a \nchild whose behavior warrants expulsion from school. In cases such as \nthis, States would be required to educate the child in an alternative \nsetting, which is a continuation of the guarantee of a free, \nappropriate, public education.\n  This bill ensures parents have continued access to due process by \nrequiring States to offer voluntary mediation services to parents and \nschools. Currently, 39 States offer mediation to parents in an effort \nto resolve disputes concerning their children. Florida is one of these \nStates, and its mediation program has been an overwhelming success \nsince it was instituted in 1992. A majority of all mediation cases in \nFlorida are reconciled, reducing the need for more costly litigation.\n  Mr. President, this bill will aid in the education of the 319,012 \ndisabled students in Florida. I am pleased that Members of Congress and \nthe administration have been able to come together to reach a consensus \non this bill. It will shift current policy from a focus on bureaucracy \nand paperwork to educating our students. I want to commend Chairmen \nJeffords and Goodling, Senator Lott, as well as Senators Frist and \nCoats for the leadership they have shown on this important issue. I \nalso want to commend State of Florida officials who have already \nenacted many of the changes contained in this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was proud to serve on the committee \nthat passed the original Individuals With Disabilities Education Act in \n1975, and I am proud to support the current reauthorization.\n  I commend Chairman Jeffords, Senator Coats, Senator Frist, and \nSenator Harkin for their leadership in negotiating this needed \nlegislation to reauthorize IDEA. I commend the House Members who worked \nclosely with us--Representative Goodling, Representative Riggs, \nRepresentative Castle, Representative Graham, Representative Martinez, \nRepresentative Scott, Representative Miller, and Representative Clay. I \nalso especially commend our distinguished Senate majority leader, \nSenator Lott, for his effective leadership in bringing all sides \ntogether and making this needed compromise possible.\n  For 22 years, IDEA has held out hope to young persons with \ndisabilities that they too can learn, and that their learning will \nenable them to become independent and productive citizens, and live \nfulfilling lives. For millions of children with disabilities, IDEA has \nmeant the difference between dependence and independence, between lost \npotential and productive careers.\n  In 1975, 4 million handicapped children did not receive the help they \nneeded to be successful in school. Few disabled preschoolers received \nservices, and 1 million children with disabilities were excluded from \npublic school. Now, IDEA serves 5.4 million children with disabilities \nfrom birth through age 21. Every State in the Nation offers public \neducation and early intervention services to children with \ndisabilities.\n  Fewer than 6,000 children with disabilities are living in \ninstitutional settings away from their families today, compared to \n95,000 children in 1969. This transformation represents a major \naccomplishment in keeping families together, and it also reflects a \nsignificant reduction in the cost to the Government and taxpayers of \npaying for institutional care, which averages $50,000 a year for each \nchild.\n  Students with disabilities are making great progress. The number of \nstudents with disabilities completing high school with a diploma or \ncertificate increased from 55 percent in 1984 to 64 percent in 1992.\n  Some 44 percent of all people with disabilities have some college \neducation today, compared to only 29 percent in 1986. This dramatic \nincrease demonstrates the success of the equal access provisions of \nIDEA; 47 percent of people without disabilities have some college \neducation, so the gap has almost closed.\n  For young people with disabilities, as for so many others, education \nleads to economic success; 57 percent of people with disabilities are \ncompetitively employed within 5 years of leaving school today, compared \nto an employment rate of only 33 percent for older people with \ndisabilities who have not benefited from IDEA. With this \nreauthorization, we are taking needed additional steps to see that \ndisabled children can grow up with the skills they need to get a job \nand live independently.\n\n  This bill will direct the attention of teachers and schools away from \npaperwork and toward the academic progress of students with \ndisabilities. The bill changes the Federal formula from one based on \nchild counts to one based on census and poverty data. This revised \nformula in no way changes the commitment and obligation of education \nagencies to identify and serve children with disabilities. Changes in \nthe Federal formula and in other areas of the bill are intended to help \nschools and school districts improve the quality of services the \nchildren receive.\n  The bill strengthens the individualized education plan, by tying a \nchild's education to the general curriculum and ensuring accountability \nfor results. It also urges schools to see that students are not being \nreferred to special education when their needs can be better met in \nregular classes.\n  We also address another serious problem--the disproportional \nrepresentation of minority students in special education. This bill \nmakes States responsible for monitoring the impact of policies on \nidentification and placement of minority students. Through the \ndevelopment of coordinated service systems in schools, prereferral \nintervention programs, including behavior management and academic skill \ndevelopment, will be more available to academically challenged students \nand help reduce the number of minority students wrongly referred to \nspecial education. It also gives parents better information about these \nissues so they can be more effective in helping their children.\n  In addition, the bill continues and strengthens early intervention \nand preschool programs for disabled infants\n\n[[Page S4319]]\n\nand toddlers. By establishing better relationships with other public \nand private programs, early childhood programs under IDEA can be a \nresource for young children with disabilities as well as for children \nat risk of disability. It will make it easier for schools and districts \nto collect funds from other agencies, without allowing schools to \nabdicate their responsibility for making sure that disabled students \nget the services they need.\n  It also requires States to offer mediation, but makes it voluntary \nfor both parties to determine whether they want to participate. In \naddition, the bill authorizes school districts to require parents to \nmeet with representatives from parent training centers or other \nalternative dispute resolution experts to explain the benefits of \nmediation.\n  Schools have asked for additional leeway to discipline students with \ndisabilities to help guarantee a safe learning environment for all \nstudents. This bill gives schools more discretion in disciplining \nstudents with disabilities, while still protecting those students. The \nbill provides the authority for school personnel to remove children \nwith disabilities from their current placement into an interim \nalternative educational setting for up to 45 days in two specific \ncases: First, if the child carries a weapon or knowingly possesses, \nuses, or sells illegal drugs of controlled substances; or second, if \nthe school obtains such authority from a hearing officer after \ndemonstrating that maintaining a child in the current placement is \nsubstantially likely to result in injury to the child or others.\n\n  Although the bill provides more flexibility for schools to discipline \nstudents, discipline should never be used as an excuse to exclude or \nsegregate children with disabilities because of the failure to design \nbehavioral management plans, or the failure to provide support services \nand staff training. It is critical that schools use the new discretion \nwith utmost care. Research tells us that suspension and expulsion are \nineffective in changing the behavior of students in special education. \nWhen students with disabilities are suspended or expelled and their \neducation is disrupted, they are likely to fall farther behind, become \nmore frustrated, and drop out of school altogether.\n  Children who leave school become a burden on society. Dropouts are \nthree times more likely to be unemployed than high school graduates. \nNearly half of the heads of households on welfare and half of the \nprison population did not finish high school.\n  We have also made changes to see that the provisions of IDEA are more \nvigorously enforced by giving the U.S. Secretary of Education and State \neducation agencies greater power to enforce the law, including greater \ndiscretion to withhold funds when violations are found and explicit \nstatutory authority to refer cases of noncompliance to the Department \nof Justice for enforcement action. We expect the Department of Justice \nto act on such referrals in a timely and appropriate manner. This \nreferral authority is particularly critical for instances when a State \nfails to implement corrective action within the time specified in the \nState monitoring plan. We expect the Secretary to use enforcement \nauthorities when applicable to ensure that failure to comply with the \nlaw will not go without remedy.\n  In addition, the Department of Education is expected to report \nannually on the status of State monitoring and compliance. We also \nexpect the Department of Education to include parents more actively in \nthe State and local monitoring process.\n  We must never go back to the days when large numbers of school-age \nchildren with disabilities were excluded from public school, when few \nif any pre-school children with disabilities received services, and \nwhen most children in school did not get the help they deserve. The \ngoal of public education is to give all children the opportunity to \npursue their dreams. We must be committed to every child--even the ones \nwho aren't easy to teach.\n\n  I commend all the students, parents, teachers, and administrators who \nhave left an indelible mark on this legislation. Their commitment to \nthis law and their willingness to put aside the divisions of the past \nand find constructive compromises will improve the education of \nstudents with disabilities, and enable schools to implement the law as \neffectively as possible.\n  I also commend and thank all the staff members of the working group \nfor their skillful assistance in making this process successful: Pat \nMorrissey and Jim Downing of Senator Jeffords' staff; Townsend Lange of \nSenator Coats staff; Bobby Silverstein and Tom Irvin of Senator \nHarkin's staff; David Hoppe and Mark Hall of Senator Lott's staff; and \nKate Powers, Connie Garner, and Danica Petroshius of my own staff. I \nalso commend the hard work of the House staff on the working group, \nincluding Sally Lovejoy and Todd Jones of the House committee majority \nstaff; Alex Nock of the House committee minority staff, Theresa \nThompson of Representative Scott's staff, and Charlie Barone of \nRepresentative Miller's staff.\n  This bill deserves the support of every Member of Congress. It means \na new day of hope and opportunity for children with disabilities.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmake certain changes to hospice care under the Medicare Program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n            THE MEDICARE HOSPICE BENEFIT AMENDMENTS OF 1997\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I introduce legislation to make \ntechnical changes to the Medicare hospice benefit which will ensure \nthat high-quality hospice services will be available to all terminally \nill Medicare beneficiaries. This legislation is identical to H.R. 521, \nintroduced by Representative Cardin.\n  Hospices care for and comfort terminally ill patients at home or in \nhome-like settings. There are 2,800 hospice programs in all 50 States \nand in 1995 they cared for more than 390,000 patients. One out of every \nthree people who died from cancer or AIDS were cared for by hospice.\n  Services provided under the Medicare hospice benefit include \nphysician services, nursing care, drugs for symptom management, pain \nrelief, short term inpatient and respite care, and counseling both for \nthe terminally ill and their families. But terminally ill patients who \nelect hospice care opt out of most other Medicare services related to \ntheir terminal illness.\n  Hospice services permit terminally ill people to die with dignity, \nusually in the comforting surroundings of their own homes with their \nloved ones nearby. Hospice is also a cost-effective form of care. At a \ntime when Medicare is pushing to enroll more beneficiaries in managed \ncare plans, hospice is already managed. Hospices provide patients with \nwhatever palliative services are needed to manage their terminal \nillness, and they are reimbursed a standard per diem rate, based on the \nintensity of care needed and the location of the provision of care.\n  With 28 percent of all Medicare costs now going toward the care of \npeople in their last year of life, and almost 50 percent of those costs \nspent during the last 2 months of life, cost-effective alternatives are \nneeded. Studies show hospices reduce Medicare spending. A 1995 Lewin \nstudy showed that for every dollar Medicare spent on hospice, it saved \n$1.52 in Medicare part A and part B expenditures. Similarly, a 1989 \nstudy commissioned by the Health Care Financing Administration showed \nsavings of $1.26 for every Medicare dollar spent on hospice.\n  Since 1982, when the hospice benefit was added to the Medicare \nstatute, more and more Americans have chosen to spend their final \nmonths of life in this humane and cost-effective setting. Yet in recent \nyears, it has become clear that certain technical changes are needed in \nthe Medicare hospice benefit to protect beneficiaries and ensure that a \nfull range of cost-effective hospice services continue to be available. \nThe bill I am introducing today makes these necessary technical \nchanges.\n\n  First, the Medicare Hospice Benefits Amendments of 1997 restructure \nthe hospice benefit periods. The basic eligibility criteria do not \nchange. Under this bill, as in current law, a person is eligible for \nthe Medicare hospice benefit only if two physicians have certified that \nthe patient is terminally ill with a life expectancy of six months or \nless. Patients who elect to receive hospice benefits give up most other \nMedicare benefits unless and until they withdraw from the hospice \nprogram.\n  While this bill does not change hospice eligibility criteria, it does \nchange how the benefit periods are structured. Currently, the Medicare \nbenefit consists of four benefit periods. At the end of each of the \nfirst three periods, the patient must be recertified as being \nterminally ill. The fourth benefit period is of unlimited duration. \nHowever, a patient who withdraws from hospice during the fourth hospice \nperiod forfeits his ability to elect hospice services in the future. \nThus, patients who go into remission, and are thus no longer eligible \nfor hospice because their life expectancy exceeds 6 months, cannot \nreturn to hospice when their condition worsens.\n  This bill restructures the hospice benefit periods to eliminate the \nexisting open-ended fourth benefit period and to provide that after the \nfirst two 90-day periods, patients are reevaluated every 60 days to \nensure they still qualify for hospice services. This restructuring \nensures that those receiving Medicare benefits are able to receive \nhospice services at the time they need them and can be discharged from \nhospice care with no penalty if their prognosis changes.\n  Second, the bill clarifies that ambulance services, diagnostic tests, \nradiation, and chemotherapy are covered under the hospice benefit when \nthey are included in the patient's plan of care. No separate payment \nwill be made for these services, but hospices will have to provide them \nwhen they are found to be necessary as a palliative measure. This \nchange conforms the statute to current Medicare regulatory policy and \ndoes not cost Medicare any additional money because payments are \ncovered by the current per-diem payments.\n  Third, the bill also permits hospices to have independent contractor \nrelationships with physicians. Under current law, hospices must \ndirectly employ their medical directors and other staff physicians. \nThis creates a legal problem in some States which prohibit the \ncorporate practice of medicine, and the requirement has made it \nincreasingly difficult to recruit part-time hospice physicians.\n  Fourth, the bill creates a mechanism to allow waiver of certain \nstaffing requirements for rural hospices, which often have difficulty \nbecoming Medicare-certified because of shortages of certain health \nprofessionals. Currently, about 80 percent of hospices are Medicare-\ncertified or pending certification.\n  Finally, this bill provides some administrative flexibility regarding \ncertification of terminal illness. Currently, the statute requires that \npaperwork documenting physician certification of a patient's terminal \nillness be completed within a certain number of days of the patient's \nadmission to hospice. This bill will eliminate the strict statutory \nrequirements. It gives the Health Care Financing Administration the \ndiscretion, as it currently has with home health certifications, to \nrequire hospice certifications to be on file before a Medicare claim is \nsubmitted.\n  The Medicare Hospice Benefit Amendments of 1997 are noncontroversial \nand should not affect Medicare spending, but they will make important \nand necessary changes to the Medicare hospice benefit, to enable \nhospices to provide high-quality, cost-effective care to the terminally \nill, and to protect beneficiaries who depend on these services.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 734\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to restore the \nDepartment of Defense loan guarantee program for small and medium-sized \nbusiness concerns that are economically dependent on defense \nexpenditures; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\nthe small business administration defense loan and technical assistance \n                       loan extension act of 1997\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that will \nextend the Small Business Administration Defense Loan and Technical \nAssistance [DELTA] Loan Program. There are many areas in the country \nstill in the process of trying to transition from defense into \ncommercial product lines. The proposed legislation would extend the \nprogram to September 30, 1999, and broadens the eligibility to include \ncompanies that derived at least 25 percent of its sales from defense-\nrelated contracts in any 1 of 7 prior years and increases the loan \nguarantee to 90 percent. Since the funds have already been appropriated \nno additional funds are required.\n  Presently under the current DELTA Program, a company must have 25 \npercent of its sales coming from defense contracts in the prior year \nand guarantees 75 percent of the loan. The current DELTA Program has a \nsunset clause which goes into effect at the end of fiscal year 1998.\n  Without this legislation, the DELTA Program expires before companies \nhave been given ample opportunity to make this very difficult \ntransition. We have an obligation to provide extended support for small \nbusinesses in areas that have been hard hit by defense downsizing.\n  If the DELTA Program is allowed to expire, all the undedicated monies \nwould revert back to the General Treasury. Of the $30 million \nappropriated, only slightly more than $3 million has been utilized.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \njoin me in cosponsoring this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the \nbill be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 735\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud of the many distinguished people, \nplaces, and enterprises in my great State of Connecticut. One of them \nis a company in which innovative spirit, entrepreneurial zest, and good \nwill combine to create products that truly make our lives better. I am \nspeaking of HelpMate Robotics of Danbury, CT.\n  HelpMate invented and manufactures the first hospital care robot. The \nrobot performs tasks such as delivering food, medicine, and lab \nsamples, so that nurses and orderlies can concentrate on what they do \nbest: caring for patients. Many hospitals are relying on HelpMate's \nhospital robot to cut costs while improving patient care.\n  HelpMate's success is due largely to the vision of its founder, Dr. \nJoseph Engleberger. Dr. Engleberger is widely known as the father of \nthe industrial robot. After building a successful company around the \nhospital robot, he and HelpMate are now developing an elder-care robot \nthat would help older or infirmed people live at home independently.\n  Mr. President, I speak about this company and its products today not \njust to share a home State success story, but to make the larger point \nthat research in one sector often leads to applications in several \nothers. Such cost-effective investments of Federal research dollars \nought to be encouraged. The HelpMate hospital robot and anticipated \nelder-care robot exemplify such a process. The technology they use was \ninitially born out of research for space robotics funded by a NASA \nSmall Business Innovative Research award, and this same technology will \nultimately help drive down health care costs.\n  I urge my colleagues to read more about this company and their \nremarkable work in the March 3, 1997, Business Week article that I now \nsubmit for the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                   [From Business Week, Mar. 3, 1997]\n\n                         Invasion of the Robots\n\n                             (By Otis Port)\n\n       At age 71, Joseph F. Engelberger knows time is running out \n     on his lifelong ambition. He is already acclaimed around the \n     world as the father of the industrial robot. But the \n     workaholic chairman of the HelpMate Robotics Inc. in Danbury, \n     Conn., would rather be remembered as the father of the home \n     robot. ``Common sense tells you it's got to end up a bigger \n     market than factory robots,'' he says.\n       Don't expect the Smiths and Joneses to turn their \n     housekeeping chores over to a robot soon. The first model--\n     which Engelberger has promised to his wife, Margaret, even \n     though she's not crazy about the idea--won't roll off an \n     assembly line until 30 months after Engelberger amasses at \n     least $5 million to finish development. ``The clock starts \n     ticking when I get the money,'' he says.\n       People who know Engelberger figure he'll pull it off. ``Joe \n     is a very charismatic guy,'' says Brian R. Carlisle, \n     president of robot maker Adept Technology Inc. in San Jose, \n     Calif. ``He's really able to make you believe in his \n     visions.'' Just ask his kids. Daughter Gay, age 41, is \n     HelpMate's marketing director, and son Jeff, 38, is an \n     engineer at Adept Technology. ``When you grow up with someone \n     like him,'' Gay says, ``how could you not want to get into \n     this business?'' Investors also are under Engelberger's \n     spell. In January, 1996, HelpMate's initial public offering \n     was a sellout, even though the company had an accumulated \n     deficit of more than $13 million.\n       Why are so many people rooting for Engelberger? Because \n     without him, Detroit auto workers might still be welding and \n     painting cars by hand. Today's robot industry stems from a \n     1956 cocktail party in Westport, Conn., where science-fiction \n     fan Engelberger met inventor George Devol. When Devol \n     mentioned he had applied for a patent on a punch-card-\n     controlled mechanical arm for doing repetitive jobs in \n     factories, Engelberger was hooked.\n       He persuaded his employer, Consolidated Controls Co., to \n     buy Devol's patent. The first prototype dubbed Unimate, was \n     finished in 1959 and went to work unloading a die-casting \n     machine in a General Motors Corp. factory. But two years \n     later, Consolidated lost interest and told Engleberger to \n     close his shop. ``I went to Barnes & Noble and bought six \n     books on finance--and earned my MBA over the weekend,'' he \n     quips. On Monday, he proposed a spin-off and was given four \n     months to find a backer. He did, and Unimation Inc. was born.\n       Sputtering. During the 1960s, Engleberger fought an uphill \n     battle to persuade skeptical U.S. manufacturers to employ his \n     programmable arms. He got a warmer reception in Japan--and \n     Japanese robot makers quickly rose to world domination. Among \n     Japanese managers, Engelberger is ``a legendary figure,'' \n     says Shikgeaki Yanai, a researcher at the Japan Robot Assn.\n       Unimation held its own against the Japanese, but in 1983 \n     its cash-strapped owner, Condec Corp., sold the company to \n     Westinghouse Electric Corp. for $107 million. ``They picked a \n     great time to sell,'' notes Engleberger. America's U.S. robot \n     business soon sputtered, after dozens of companies jumped \n     into the market and sold some systems that didn't live up to \n     promises. Sales peaked in 1984 at $484 million, then headed \n     south.\n       Engleberger had hoped Westinghouse would see an opportunity \n     in home robots. When it didn't, he quit and bought a 62-foot, \n     $800,000 sailboat with part of his $3 million take from \n     Unimation's sale. He planned to enjoy life as a gentleman of \n     leisure. That lasted for two months. ``I got bored pretty \n     quick,'' he admits. In late 1984, he formed HelpMate, \n     initially called Transitions Research Corp.\n       To pave the way for home robots, Engelberger decided to use \n     hospitals as a test bed. In 1988, he sold his first medical \n     unit to Danbury Hospital, which now has two. They roam the \n     hallways running errands--delivering medications, meals, X-\n     rays, and patients' records. Handing these chores to machines \n     frees more time for nurses and orderlies to concentrate on \n     caring for patients, says HelpMate President Thomas K. \n     Sweeny.\n       Word of HelpMate's robots is spreading. Baylor University \n     Medical Center in Dallas has 4 machines, with 11 more on \n     order. All told, 144 have been hired by 85 hospitals in the \n     U.S. Canada, 18 in Japan, and 10 in Europe. Purchased \n     outright, the robots cost $110,000, so most are rented for $4 \n     to $6 an hour.\n       Outwardly, the 4-foot-6-inch robots resemble the box-on-\n     wheels systems that carry the mail in some offices. But \n     there's a crucial difference: A HelpMate doesn't follow a \n     fixed track, such as a wire in the floor. Instead, its \n     electronic memory contains a floor map of the hospital. When \n     summoned by radio or pointed to a location on a built-in \n     video screen, the robot's microprocessor brain calculates the \n     quickest way to get there. En route, the robot uses infrared \n     and ultraviolet beams to dodge people, food carts, and \n     gurneys in busy corridors, and it summons elevators and opens \n     doors with radio signals.\n       Sweeny says large hospitals can economically justify one \n     HelpMate for every 100 beds,\n\n[[Page S4324]]\n\n     so ``our total potential market in the U.S. is 10,000 \n     robots.'' But that number would leap if the robots had arms. \n     Then they could make beds, help patients out of bathtubs, and \n     relieve nurses of other menial tasks. These expanded \n     capabilities would also be needed in home robots, which is \n     why HelpMate with arms are next on Engelberger's list. Once \n     HelpMates have been fitted and arms, they could be programmed \n     for such household chores as cooking, washing dishes, and \n     sweeping. Considering the precision factory jobs that \n     Unimation's arms still perform using yesterday's technology, \n     Engelberger foresees no major hurdles in creating household \n     robots. And his chances of attracting a backer are looking \n     up.\n       In 1992, the U.S. robot business finally turned around. \n     Lately, sales of industrial robots have been posting \n     successive all-time highs (chart). In 1995, American industry \n     found jobs for 10,198 steel-collar workers worth $898 \n     million, according to the Robotic Industries Assn.\n       Now that industrial robots have recovered their sparkle and \n     HelpMate has moved into bigger quarters--Unimation's former \n     home--Engelberger is eager to launch an elder-care robots. \n     Most old folks who enter nursing homes are mentally alert and \n     healthy, Engelberger notes. ``They just aren't nimble enough \n     to care for themselves.'' All the technology developed for \n     patient care would be useful for elder-care robots. Adding \n     certain repetitive household jobs, such as loading the \n     dishwater or microwave oven, would be fairly easy. Others, \n     including meal preparation, might involve special-purpose \n     attachments. And for finding packaged foods, the robot could \n     have a built-in bar-code reader.\n       Even a $100,000 home robot would soon pay for itself by \n     enabling people to stay out of nursing homes. With the \n     population quickly aging, demand could surge, bringing down \n     costs to ``something more in line with the cost of a car,'' \n     says Sweeny.\n       Guess who Engelberger thinks should market them? ``If the \n     auto makers want to diversify, they need a product that sells \n     at roughly the same price point and in the same volume,'' he \n     says. Next, the father of the industrial robot hopes to \n     become the proud papa of Chevybots. Hondabots, and \n     Volvobots.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/12/senate-section/article/S4323-2", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FORTY YEARS OF NOVAK\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to record and to celebrate Robert \nD. Novak's 40 years of Washington journalism, as he himself records \nthis morning in a Washington Post column ``What a Change 40 Years \nMakes.'' Forty years in journalism, as he writes, ``an association with \nCongress that continues today.'' An association of rare civility and, \ntoo often alas, of deadly accuracy. His access, energy, good spirits, \nand rage for the truth are equaled only by his lifelong friend and \npartner Rowland Evans. Top Drawer and Front Page, there has never been \nthe like of them, and I choose to think never will be, for there are \nsome national treasures that truly are unique.\n  Senators will note Mr. Novak's observation that ``The capital city of \n1957 was at once shabbier and far better governed than today's \nglittering but pothole-scarred Washington.'' A concise way to make the \npoint that as American Government has reached for beyond its grasp on \nso many social issues, it has accepted an appalling decline in the \nfundaments of good government, such as street paving. He notes that in \n1957 Congress itself ``was vastly less imperial. Admission to the \nCapitol and office buildings was open, without the need for photo ID \ncards and security checks.'' One might add our buildings were not \nsurrounded by concrete barriers and guardposts. One could even go so \nfar as to note that one could even drive down Pennsylvania Avenue in \nfront of the White House. That thoroughfare having now been blocked \noff. Albeit, ever alert to the need for austerity it has, in its \neastern reaches at 15th Street, been turned into a parking lot complete \nwith parking meters.\n  I came to Washington in 1961 with the Kennedy administration. Bob \nNovak was a force for government openness even then. Irresistible as a \nfriend and devastating as an analyst. Why only last week he revealed to \nan unwary world that the proposal for a more accurate cost of living \nadjustment in Federal finances was the ``culmination of Senator Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan's masterful campaign to perpetuate big government * * \n* ''\n  No matter, just so long as his concern over big Government serves to \nperpetuate Bob Novak. Let us agree for at least a half century. Let \nhope, as indeed we may, that his beloved Geraldine will see to this.\n  He fought for his nation as a lieutenant during the Korean war and \nhas been fighting for it ever since.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Mr. Novak's column from today's Washington \nPost be printed in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 12, 1997]\n\n                      What a Change 40 Years Makes\n\n                          (By Robert D. Novak)\n\n       On May 13, 1957, I reported to the Associated Press bureau \n     in Washington as a reporter transferred from Indianapolis. I \n     was immediately dispatched to Capitol Hill for Midwestern \n     regional coverage. Within a week, I was detailed to help \n     report the uproarious hearings of the Senate Rackets \n     Committee, which was engaged in a bipartisan assault on Jimmy \n     Hoffa.\n       That put me in personal contact with John F. Kennedy, Bobby \n     Kennedy, Barry Goldwater, Edward Bennett Williams and Pierre \n     Salinger--heady stuff for a 26-year-old. So began my 40 years \n     in Washington and association with Congress that continues \n     today. The transformation of the city and the institution \n     over four decades has been breathtaking.\n       The capital city of 1957 was at once shabbier and far \n     better governed than today's glittering but pothole-scarred \n     Washington. Neither chic restaurants nor huge lawyer-lobbyist \n     firms had yet appeared (Bob Strauss's arrival was years in \n     the future). The city was a little more Southern and far less \n     New Yorkish than today. The smell of money was not yet \n     redolent. Nobody came to Washington then seeking the \n     equivalent of a 1997 seven-figure income, but they sure do \n     today.\n       Congress was not yet consumed with fund raising and was \n     vastly less imperial. Admission to the Capitol and office \n     buildings was open, without the need for photo ID cards and \n     security checks. Members of Congress had not yet adopted \n     Japanese-style boutonnieres, and few employed a press \n     secretary. Nearly all readily responded to telephone calls \n     from a low-level AP reporter without an aide asking what he \n     wanted.\n       Accessibility stemmed in part from many fewer staffers on \n     Capitol Hill--4,500 then, compared with 16,000 now (filling \n     three additional big office buildings). In 1957, $117 million \n     was appropriated to run Congress, but only $67 million ($386 \n     million adjusted for inflation) was spent. That compares with \n     $2.2 billion in 1997.\n       With fewer staffers, lawmakers did much of their own work. \n     At night on his portable typewriter, Sen. Everett McKinley \n     Dirksen wrote summaries of every bill reported by every \n     Senate committee. Unlike today, floor leaders--including the \n     imperious Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson--actually spent hours on the \n     floor.\n       Floor debate was spirited--sometimes mean-spirited. It was \n     the summer of 1957 when Democratic Sen. Robert S. Kerr called \n     Republican Sen. Homer Capehart, to his face, ``a rancid \n     tub of ignorance.'' But issues were not polarized along \n     party lines, with a bipartisan conservative coalition \n     often in control. Both congressional parties shared the \n     conviction that the less government the better--an \n     attitude assailed as ``extreme'' today.\n       ``Ike Fights to Save Budget,'' said an eight-column front-\n     page Post headline my first week in Washington, referring to \n     a nationally televised plea by President Dwight D. Eisenhower \n     for public support against congressional budget-cutting. \n     Eisenhower the previous November had become the first \n     Republican president reelected since 1900 and promptly faced \n     the Democratic-controlled Congress seeking to reduce his \n     $71.8 billion budget substantially--about $449.9 billion in \n     1997 money (less than one-third of President Clinton's $1.7 \n     trillion budget).\n       The government then was taxing 17.8 percent and spending 17 \n     percent of gross domestic product; the comparable figures for \n     1997 are 19.2 percent and 20.8 percent. In 1957, it ran a \n     budget surplus at 0.8 percent of GDP, compared with today's \n     hoped-for deficit of 1.8 percent.\n       The government had not grown since New Deal days and would \n     not until Lyndon Johnson's Great Society eight years in the \n     future. In 1957, regulation was but a glimmer of what it \n     would become.\n       There was no Education Department, no Energy Department, no \n     Environmental Protection Agency, no Legal Services Corp., no \n     National Endowment for the Arts, no Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting, no Women, Infants and Children food program. \n     Nor, except for factions on the left in both parties, was \n     there demand for all this.\n       Libertarians such as Charles Murray would like to peel back \n     to 1957, but it is hard to find any member of Congress who \n     agrees. Rather, Republicans now acquiesce in Clinton's \n     insistence on still greater expansion of government. \n     Americans unquestionably are less free than they were in \n     1957. Whether, on balance, they in return have been blessed \n     with a better life is doubtful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/05/12/senate-section/article/S4324-1", "month": "05", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4324-S4325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MAY 13, 1997\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.
