Under the previous \norder, the Senate will now resume consideration of S. 830, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 830) to amend the Federal Food, Drug and \n     Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act to improve the \n     regulation of foods, drugs, devices and biological products, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nhours of debate to be equally divided between the chairman and the \nranking member.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is, hopefully, the final moments of \ndebate on the FDA reform bill. There is no Senator who has been of more \nhelp and assistance, not only to the committee but to her constituents, \nthan the Senator from Maryland. Thus, I am pleased that the one who \nwill be opening the debate today is that Senator. So I yield her such \ntime as she may consume; and may she consume a lot of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, thank you.\n  Mr. President, in a few hours we will be voting on the final passage \nof the FDA Modernization and Accountability Act.\n  I am so pleased that this day has finally arrived. I thank the \nchairman of the Labor Committee, Mr. Jeffords, for all of his \nincredible patience, persistence, dedication, and attention to really \nlead the mission to move FDA into the 21st century. I thank him for his \nheartfelt devotion to accomplishing this mission and for never giving \nup. I also want to thank his staff for their hard work and for the \nbipartisan, nonpartisan way in which they worked.\n  Let me also acknowledge the tremendous contribution of the ranking \nmember, Senator Kennedy. There is no doubt that this is a better bill \nand FDA will be in better shape because of his efforts.\n  Mr. President, I have worked on FDA reform for a number of years. \nWhen I was a Member of the House of Representatives, we embarked, on a \nbipartisan basis, to ensure consumer protection, to prevent dumping of \ndrugs that did not meet our standards into Third World countries.\n  Then coming to the Senate, I joined with my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and with the Senator from Utah, Mr. \nHatch, in fashioning something called the Prescription Drug User Fee \nAct, otherwise nicknamed PDUFA. What PDUFA did is provide, through a \nuser fee mechanism, the ability to hire 600 more people at FDA to \nanalyze the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals to move them to the \nmarketplace.\n  Because of PDUFA and the great legislative idea of Kennedy-Hatch, FDA \nwas able to hire more people to examine products that were being \npresented for evaluation and get them to clinical practice more \nquickly.\n\n  The leadership of Kennedy-Hatch on PDUFA has not only stood the test \nof time, but it has shown that we can expedite the drug approval \nprocess while maintaining safety and efficacy.\n\n[[Page S9812]]\n\n  But while PDUFA made a huge difference, it became clear that PDUFA \nwas not enough. More staff operating in an outdated regulatory \nframework without a clear legislative framework was deficient.\n  That is when we began to consult with experts in the field of public \nhealth, particularly those involved in drugs and biologics on where we \nneeded to go. While we were considering this, the world of science was \nchanging. We were experiencing a tremendous revolution in biology. We \nwent from basic discoveries in science, particularly in the field of \nchemistry and physics, to a whole new explosion in biology and genetics \nand biologic materials. We also went from a smokestack economy to a \ncyberspace economy in which the very tools of information technology \ncould enable us to improve our productivity.\n  It became clear that we needed an FDA with a new legislative \nframework and a new culture and a continued commitment to the \ntraditional values of safety and efficacy. This is when we began to put \ntogether what we called the sensible center on FDA reform. One often \nhears about partisan bickering. One often hears about prickly \nrelationships between the two parties. But I tell you, thanks to the \nleadership of Senator Kassebaum, who initially chaired this initiative, \nwe, Republicans and Democrats, worked together because we never wanted \nto play politics with the lives of the American people. What we wanted \nto do is to make sure the American medical community and the world \nmedical community had the best clinical tools at their disposal to help \nsave lives.\n  We saw the reform of FDA accomplishing two important policy goals--\nsaving lives and at the same time generating jobs in our own American \neconomy in the fields of pharmaceuticals, biologics, and medical \ndevices.\n  Senator Kassebaum took important steps forward. Senator Jeffords \nassumed that mantle and brought us to this point today.\n  What will this bill do? Why is it so important? It gives, first of \nall, a clear statement on what is the mission and purpose of FDA--to \nsave lives with pharmaceutical and biologic products and to maintain \nthe safety of our food supply. This bill does not deal with the food \nsafety issue, but it sure does focus on those things that normally \nwould take place in clinical practice.\n  Why is it so important? It streamlines the regulatory process, it \nreauthorizes that very highly successful PDUFA, to make sure we have \nadequate staff, and it creates an FDA that rewards significant science \nwhile protecting public health.\n  It means that new lifesaving drugs and devices will get into clinical \npractice more quickly. It will enable us to produce products that we \ncan sell around the world saving lives and generating jobs.\n  What is so great about pharmaceuticals, biologics, and medical \ndevices is that they are translingual, they are transcultural. When you \nneed a new drug and it is approved by FDA, whether you live in \nBaltimore or whether you live in London or whether you live in \nBangladesh, you need it. If you then use a medical device, you know if \nit is safe in Maryland, it will be safe in Moscow or Malaysia. This is \nwhy this will offer us a whole new opportunity in exports.\n  I am really proud of FDA. I am proud of all the people who work at \nFDA, and under very Spartan resources. Why? Because it is known as the \ngold standard around the world for product approval. We want to \nmaintain that high standard, and at the same time we want to make sure \nthat the FDA is ready to enter the 21st century.\n  This legislation will be the bridge to the future, maintaining the \nevaluation of safety and efficacy with the new tools to be able to \nparticipate in a 21st century science environment and a 21st century \neconomy. This bill sets up a new legislative and regulatory framework \nwhich reflects the latest scientific advancements. That framework \ncontinues the FDA's strong mission to public health and safety, but it \nsets a new goal for FDA--enhancing public health by not impeding \ninnovation or product liability through unnecessary red tape that only \ndelays approval.\n\n  There is an urgency about reauthorizing PDUFA. Its authority expires \nat the end of this month. PDUFA has enabled FDA to hire 600 new \nreviewers, and to cut review times from 29 to 17 months over the last 5 \nyears. If we fail to act now, it means the people who have been working \non behalf of the American people and the world will get RIF notices. We \ncannot let them down, because we do not want them to let the American \npeople or the world down. We risk losing talented employees and slowing \ndown the approval process.\n  Delay will hurt dedicated employees, but more importantly it will \nhurt patients. Patients benefit the most from this legislation. Safe \nand effective new medical tools will be helping patients live longer \nlives or get better quicker.\n  We are not just extending PDUFA. We are improving it. Currently, \nPDUFA only addresses something called the review phase of the approval \nprocess. Our bill extends PDUFA to streamline the early drug \ndevelopment phase as well.\n  What does this mean? New innovations. We are going to be able to \nallow for electronic submissions. We want to improve productivity. \nInstead of carloads of paper, stacks and stacks of material not being \nable to be utilized in an efficient way being deposited at FDA, \ncompanies will be able to make those electronic submissions. This \nreduces not only paperwork but actually provides a more agile way for \nscientific reviewers to get through the data in a way that improves \nefficiency while they are analyzing efficacy.\n  Updating the approval process for biotechnology is another critical \ncomponent of this bill. Biotechnology is one of the fastest growing \nindustries in our country. In my own State of Maryland, there are 143 \nof these companies. They are working on everything from AIDS to \nAlzheimer's to Parkinson's disease, to breast and ovarian cancer, as \nwell as new immunizations for children.\n  These are absolutely vital areas of endeavor. We want to be able to \nhelp them develop these new areas, go through a submission at FDA to \nmake sure they are safe, and get new products out there doing their job \nof improving people's health.\n  The job of FDA is to make sure that safe and effective products get \nto our patients. Our job, as Members of Congress, is to fund scientific \nresearch through NIH and other Federal laboratories and extramural \nresearch at great institutions like the University of Maryland and \nJohns Hopkins and at the same time to provide FDA the regulatory and \nlegislative framework to evaluate new products to make them available \nto doctors and to patients.\n  That is why I am fighting for this. There have been many issues \nraised in this debate. Some have been very robust. Some have even been \nprickly. But I tell you, I want to absolutely say that I am on the side \nof FDA. I am absolutely on the side of safety. I am absolutely on the \nside of efficacy. I believe this is what this bill does.\n  This legislation should not be a battle of wills, it should not be a \nbattle over this line item or that line item. It should be really a \nbattle over what is the best way to make sure the American people have \nfrom their physicians and other clinical practitioners the best devices \nand products to be able to save their lives.\n  Mr. President, my dear father died of Alzheimer's. He was in the \nfinal stages when I became a U.S. Senator. He was so ill that he could \nnot come to that marvelous night in my life when I won the general \nelection and knew I would be the first Democratic woman ever elected in \nher own right. I spoke to my father that election night, via TV because \nhe could not be there, to thank him for what he did for me and my \nsisters. With Alzheimer's, I watched my father die one brain cell at a \ntime. It did not matter that I was a U.S. Senator, it did not matter \nthat I was helping fund research at NIH, my father was dying.\n  My father was a modest man. He didn't want a fancy tombstone or a lot \nof other things, but I vowed, I promised, in my heart of hearts I would \ndo all I could to find a cure for Alzheimer's. I would do all I could \nfor those people who have Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia or \nother mind diseases. While I did that, I promised also that I would do \nall I could to make sure those tools moved to the clinical practice as \nfast as they could.\n  Every one of us has faced some type of tragedy in our lives where we \nlook\n\n[[Page S9813]]\n\nto the American medical, pharmaceutical, biological, and device \ncommunities to help us. I have done that so many times. I am grateful \nto the medical communities in the United States of America.\n  When my own mother had one of her last horrible heart attacks that \nwas rapidly leading to a stroke there was a new drug that was so \nsophisticated that if it was administered quickly could help her avoid \nhaving a stroke. It required informed consent, because even though it \nwas approved it was so dramatic in the way it thins the blood, almost \nto a hemophilia level, that you needed consent on the scene.\n  I heard all of the medical pros and cons of that. I was advised by a \ngreat clinician at Mercy Hospital and I gave that approval because my \nmother was not conscious and not able to do that. And guess what? That \nnew drug approved by FDA, developed in San Francisco, got my mother \nthrough her critical medical crisis with the hands-on care of the \nSisters of Mercy at Mercy Hospital. My mother did not have a stroke \nbecause we avoided the clotting with the help of this new dramatic \ndrug.\n  I give praise and thanksgiving to God for that and the ingenuity of \nthe American medical community that enabled my mother to stay with us \n100 more days so she could be back at home, have conversations with us, \nher grandchildren, and so she could, even in her final days, continue a \ntelephone ministry that she had. She was a member of a parish group \ncalled the Cheer Up Club where other shut-ins called each other. Let me \ntell you, the best ``Cheer Up Club'' I can belong to is right here in \nthe U.S. Senate when we pass FDA reform to make sure that when a \nphysician works with a patient or a family they are cheered because \nthey have these new tools.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time given to me to speak today. \nIf I seem a little emotional, you bet. I love my family, as so many of \nus do, and this is why I so rely upon the American medical community \nand FDA to make sure that the best pharmaceutical, biological, and \nmedical devices are available to the American people and also to the \npeople of the world.\n  I look forward to voting for final passage and having a conference \nreport to bring back.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator from Maryland for a most eloquent \nand moving personalized statement, as well as her efforts that have \ngone on to improve the FDA for all of us.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I also join in expressing great \nappreciation to the Senator from Maryland in terms of the FDA reform.\n  She speaks very eloquently, passionately, and emotionally about the \nfamily's personal experience with the breakthroughs of modern medicine \nand what it can mean to those afflicted by the scourge of so many of \nthese diseases.\n  I must say I join with Senator Jeffords in saying that no one on the \ncommittee has been as tireless in pursuit of FDA reform as the Senator \nfrom Maryland. As a tireless advocate for FDA, she has brought great \nknowledge and understanding to achieve the goals that she has outlined \nhere and I think all of us pay tribute to her.\n\n  I want to thank her, as well, for commenting positively on the work \nof the people at the agency. There are many individuals at FDA who \ncould, at the drop of a hat, go to the private sector and other areas \nand be better off financially. But who, because of their commitment to \nthe public, are trying to do a job they believe in and are willing to \nserve the public.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senators from Massachusetts and Vermont for \ntheir very kind comments.\n  I also thank you for the cooperation of your staff, and wish to \nacknowledge the role of Lynne Lawrence and Roberta Haeberle.\n  But let's get FDA the right staff that they need.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, before yielding to the Senator from New \nHampshire I would like to say he has spent as much or more time than \nanyone on this legislation and has had the very difficult chore of \nworking in this very controversial area of uniformity. It is so \nessential that this Nation have uniformity so that when they buy a \nproduct they can know with the assurance of the FDA that the product \nthey are getting is one that will be safe and helpful. Many, many hours \nthe Senator has spent working on this issue, as well as the bill \ngenerally. I praise and thank him.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield such time as the Senator from New Hampshire \ndesires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I wish to join with others in stating my admiration for \nthe chairman's efforts here in getting this bill forward. He \nunderstates his role if he thinks somebody has worked harder than he. \nHe is clearly the person who has put the most time in this and \ndeveloped an excellent bill.\n  That is the point. The bill reported out of the committee came out of \nthe committee with a huge vote, 14-4, a very definitive statement by \nthe committee which has a fair number of experts, one of whom you just \nheard, Senator Mikulski from Maryland, on various parts of this bill, a \nfair number of experts who understand the importance of bringing the \nFDA into the 21st century.\n  Why is it important? I think the statement has been made over and \nover again here in the last few days, but I think it needs to be made \nagain. The fact is this involves people's lives. We have spent a lot of \ntime on this bill and we have had a lot of votes on this bill. We had \nan 89-5 cloture vote on September 5; a 94-4 cloture vote on September \n17; and yesterday, a 98-2 vote in favor of the bill. At some point, \npeople should be willing to say enough is enough. It was inappropriate \nto delay this bill as much as it has been delayed.\n  This is about people's lives. The capacity to get these drugs out, to \nget these devices out, to give people the ability to use these various \npharmaceutical treatments and various device treatments which are in \nmany instances going to save lives and in almost all instances going to \nimprove lives, is critical.\n  I have a situation in New Hampshire. An attorney named John Hanson \nwrote to me about a friend of his who, regrettably, has ALS, or Lou \nGehrig's disease. This is a horrible disease. It is a disease that eats \naway at your capacity as an individual to function. Although your mind \nstays sharp, the rest of your body fails. Every day that goes by is a \ncritical day to this individual, every day that goes by.\n  Now, the FDA had a product before it called myotropin which is \nwaiting for approval. The people who have ALS are very interested in \ngetting this drug, but they can't get it because the FDA has taken the \nposition that it is not yet available on the market.\n  Why is that? It is because of this long lead time of bureaucratic \nactivity that is the wrap-up period for the approval of drugs. \nRegrettably, as a result of that long lead time, which can be years and \nyears and years, many people are unable to get these drugs which are so \nimportant to them. In a case like ALS, of course, it really is the \nindividual who should have some option in being able to choose whether \nor not to use a drug. That individual has a pretty stark choice before \nthem--die as a result of the disease you have; or maybe have a chance \nof surviving as a result of taking a drug which maybe has not had years \nof review but has only had a few years of review.\n\n  So the issue is how do we get the FDA to approve these drugs, approve \nthese devices in a prompter manner, in a manner which doesn't give up \nany of the need for making sure that the drugs are safe and that they \nwork, making sure that the devices are safe and that they work, but \ndoes give up the bureaucracy which has for so long and so often stifled \na prompt review process.\n  So this bill which the Senator from Vermont has brought forward today \nreally does attempt to overcome what you might call the culture of \novercautiousness which has become, regrettably, the culture of the FDA. \nIt is an attempt to say to the FDA in a very definitive way, listen, we \nunderstand the importance of what you do, we understand that you are \nsincere and committed individuals. But we also understand there is \nanother part of this formula that is called getting the drugs to the \npatients, getting the devices to the patients.\n\n[[Page S9814]]\n\n  So, let's start working as a team to get these things out quickly. To \naccomplish that, a number of proposals were put forward to make the FDA \nwork more effectively and make the drugs and devices which are \ndistributed across this country more understandable in their usage and \nalso more readily available when they work.\n  We have heard a lot of discussion, of course, about section 404. I \nnote that the Senator from Massachusetts has another group of lists up \nthere on section 404 of people involved in this issue. One thing that \nhas been mentioned is that this new section 404 may in some way be tied \ninto the fen/phen issue. Well, it is not. Section 404 is a device \nsection. It is not a drug section and does not apply to drugs or drug \nmanufacturers. Using that as an example, which just recently occurred, \nis truly a red herring. The purpose of section 404 obviously is to try \nand get these devices out in a more prompt and efficient manner.\n  Now this language was put together after a lot of work and a lot of \nnegotiation, a lot of discussion, with all the different parties \ninvolved. I know the Senator from Vermont was actively involved, the \nSenator from Indiana was aggressively involved. My sense is that \neverybody who had a legitimate concern about section 404 had a fair \nhearing before the committee, and the committee decided that the \ncompromise language which was put in the bill--and believe me, it was \ncompromise language--on section 404 was the most effective and \nappropriate way to go. The committee decided it by a 14-4 vote.\n  I hope this Congress and this Senate specifically would give \nconsiderable respect to the efforts that were made at the committee \nlevel on this specific issue. I do think in this instance the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts is just plain wrong. His position is not consistent, \nin my opinion, because he has brought in debate over drugs with the \nmedical device issue, but more importantly, it is not the position \nwhich was adopted by a vast majority of the members of the committee, \nbecause we understood the importance as a majority in the committee, 14 \npeople who voted for this, of getting out some major reform in the FDA \nlaws which would allow for a prompter approval process without giving \nup any of the issues of safety or effectiveness of the drugs or the \ndevices that are being involved here.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Vermont again for moving forward. It \nappears we may actually be getting to the end of the day on this bill \nrelative to passage. I hope we would not see any more of this delay \ntactic as we move down the road because every day that gets delayed \npotentially costs a life, and certainly causes people who need these \ndrugs, need these devices, a tremendous amount of anxiety on top of a \nsituation which in almost every instance is already filled with \nextraordinary anxiety because of the type of disease or problem they \nhave. So let's get on with doing the business of the Senate and pass \nthis bill.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank the \nSenator from New Hampshire again for the incredible amount of work he \nhas done, and I hope we heed his advice.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield as much time as he needs to the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nand I wish to speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bingaman pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1210 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are moving on in the consideration of \nFDA reform. I would like to review where we are, where we have come \nfrom, and where I believe we ought to go on this important issue that \nis intimately tied to the public health and safety of the American \npeople.\n  I would just like to remind our colleagues and others about the \nimportance of this agency. We will be debating about section 404 of the \nFDA legislation that is before us. It might sound like a small, narrow \nprovision in a complicated piece of legislation, but its implications \nare profound in terms of potential impacts on the health and safety of \nmillions of American people.\n  Senator Reed, myself, and others have attempted to make the case that \nwe are unnecessarily risking the health of the American people. We are \ndoing this because we are effectively permitting false and misleading \ninformation to be placed on the labels of medical devices that are \nsubmitted to the FDA for review. We are doing this and at the same \ntime, tying the hands of the FDA to look behind those labels and into \nthe real purpose of the medical device. We are creating a loophole that \nwill allow companies to submit their products under a protocol they \nknow will allow for quick approval, but whose clear intention is to \nmarket the device for uses that are different from those they listed \nwhen they went through the approval process.\n  Over the last few days, we have reviewed the most prominent example \nof this issue when we talked about the biopsy needle of U.S. Surgical \nCo. We discussed how they were able to get approval for the device by \ntelling FDA that it was substantially equivalent to a device they \nalready had on the market. But, in reality, the biopsy needle that was \non the market excised an amount of tissue that was less than the size \nof the lead in a pencil, and the new device they submitted to FDA \nremoves a piece of tumor that is 50 times larger than would be removed \nwith the existing needle biopsy device.\n  It is quite clear from the evidence that we are able to advance on \nthe floor of the Senate, both the correspondence we received from \ndoctors about marketing practices and a promotional videotape, that \nthis device was being promoted for an entirely different purpose than \nthe one U.S. Surgical listed on the label it submitted to FDA. Due to \nthis maneuvering, we did not have the proper kind of safety information \navailable to the principal agency of Government that is charged with \nprotecting the safety and health of the American people.\n  I cannot understand why we, by way of this legislation, are denying \nthat Federal agency the opportunity to adequately protect the American \npeople. And it isn't just me, 35 other Members of the Senate, more than \na third of the Senate, indicated a similar position with their votes \nyesterday. Virtually all of the consumer groups are with us as well.\n  I have illustrated on this chart some of the organizations that are \nworking to protect patients, that listen to patients, and that \nunderstand the need of patients, and that stand with us on this issue. \nThey are virtually unanimous in their concern about this particular \nprovision.\n  I have in my hand articles about the FDA which have been published \nover the period of the last 2 days. This is an agency that is on the \ncutting edge of many health-related issues. It is charged with many \ndifferent responsibilities that have enormous impacts on the lives and \nwell-being of American people.\n  Here we have on September 22 a major article: ``Doctors want approval \nto inject themselves with live virus''--HIV. This will be a decision \nthe group will seek approval. From whom? From the FDA.\n  Here is another--``FDA sets rules on supplemental labels.'' The FDA \npublished final rules yesterday aimed at making * * * manufacturers put \nmore information on labels.\n  Why are they doing that? To protect the American public. They have \nresponsibilities for that.\n\n       FDA acts to get more women in drug studies. That is very \n     appropriate and very important to do.\n       FDA moved [yesterday] to force drug companies to stop \n     excluding young women from studies of promising new medicines \n     out of fear they will get pregnant, curbing the research.\n\n  And, again:\n\n       FDA told the drug companies to include women in all stages \n     of drug tests.\n\n  Then it goes on about the importance of having women represented in \ndrug trials so we can understand how they will affect women. That can't \nbe learned from studying the effects on men because of the metabolic \nand other differences between men and women.\n  Here is another example of FDA looking out after public health \nissues, and the impact of pharmaceuticals on our population.\n\n[[Page S9815]]\n\n  On September 23 here is the long story in the New York Times.\n\n       Thirty-seven years later, a second chance for thalidomide. \n     Officials at the agency announced today they intend to \n     approve thalidomide for use in leprosy patients, as long as \n     the New Jersey . . . company seeking market approval adheres \n     to conditions, including elaborate restrictions intended to \n     keep the drugs away from women who might be pregnant.\n\n  Here is the FDA looking after what? Looking after a possible cure for \nleprosy and making sure that women who are expecting are protected from \nthalidomide.\n  What is the role of the agency? Looking after the women and \nchildren--looking at trying to find some cure for leprosy.\n  What is another role of the FDA? Trying to make sure that all members \nof our population are included in the review of various \npharmaceuticals.\n  Here is a story on E. coli bacteria. We remember the stories across \nthe country a little over a year ago and the dangers that were posed in \nterms of the health of the American people. This has no direct \nconnection with the issue surrounding FDA reform except that it, too, \ncomes against a background of years of determination, --the ``meat \nindustry and anti-regulatory forces to block long overdue improvements \nin the way the Government monitors the meat safety.''\n\n  Here is an example of an editorial advising us to be cautious in our \nrush to regulatory reform. Let's not override safety.\n  That is what this editorial is about--the same message we are \ndelivering today--in our rush to reach these thoughtful and important \nreforms, let's not override safety.\n  This editorial involved a different issue--E. coli and meat products. \nIt may be E. coli today, but it may be an unsafe medical device \ntomorrow.\n  Again, on the 23d, FDA. The approval of thalidomide, lawsuits filed \nagainst the fen/phen, and many other articles. The FDA published a rule \non the 23d--from the Washington Post:\n\n       Final rules aimed at making supplemental manufacturers put \n     more information on the labels. The rules restrict the use of \n     the term ``high potency,'' requiring products such as \n     vitamins, minerals, herbs, and amino acids to be labeled as \n     dietary supplements and labeled also to provide information \n     about serving size.\n\n  What is the agency doing in each of these cases that made the \nnewspapers over the past few days? Protecting the American public. In \neach and every example that we have cited FDA is trying to protect the \nAmerican public on a wide variety of issues.\n  We are talking today about doing the same thing with regard to \nmedical devices, protecting the public from false and misleading \nlabels. That is the issue. It is not the only issue, but the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, the Senator from Rhode Island, for the patient \nadvocacy and consumer groups, it's the primary issue. There hasn't been \na single patient advocacy group that has been advanced by those that \nare opposed to our position here during the course of this debate. Not \none. Why? Because they cannot find any. Why? Because this provision is \na direct threat to the health and safety of the American consumers. And \nvirtually every group that has studied it, that has reviewed it, \nunderstands that.\n  That is where we are. We want to let the American people know the \nimportance of the FDA. Let them know how it is out there trying to \nprovide protection for the American people. That is what we believe \nshould be the case on the provisions that we have been discussing here, \nwith section 404.\n  Because of the Senate vote yesterday tabling the Reed amendment, the \nFDA reform bill still includes the provision that seriously threatens \nthe public health--the provision that must be removed before this \nlegislation becomes law. This provision encourages device manufacturers \nto lie to the FDA and forces FDA to approve medical devices that have \nnot been adequately tested to assure that they are safe and effective. \nWeeks ago, the Secretary of HHS identified this provision as one that \nwould lead her to recommend a veto if it were not removed. Despite what \nsome of my colleagues say, this is not a new issue. The Secretary \nidentified it last June, identified it again in July, and identified it \nagain in September as one of the administration's principal concerns.\n  It is virtually the only technological issue that remains to be \nresolved on this bill. Every major public health and consumer \norganization that has taken a position on this provision strongly \nopposes it.\n  While the Reed amendment was defeated yesterday, I anticipate the \nbill itself will be adopted by the Senate today. This is not the end of \nthe story. There are many procedural steps that must be taken before \nthe bill becomes law, including action by the House, reconciliation of \nthe bills passed by the House and Senate, and the signature of the \nPresident. There will be many more opportunities for debate before this \nbill can even go to conference. I believe that in the end the public \ninterest will prevail.\n  I intend to discuss this provision during the course of today's \ndebate on the bill. I would like to begin by reviewing the reasons we \nembarked on an FDA reform bill in the first place and how much we have \nbeen able to improve the original bill.\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, there are few more important agencies of the \nFederal Government than the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA is \nresponsible for assuring that the Nation's food supply is pure and \nhealthy. The FDA provides a guarantee that the drugs and devices we \nrely on to cure or treat diseases are safe and effective. It wasn't \nalways that way. Medical device legislation was adopted in the mid-\n1970's.\n  If it does its job well, the FDA can speed medical miracles from the \nlab bench to the patient's bedside. And if the agency does its job \npoorly, it can expose millions of Americans to unsafe or ineffective \nmedical products and jeopardize the safety of our food.\n  The record of the FDA in moving these various medical devices through \nthe process and moving them from the manufacturer onto the market is \nimproving. We have seen significant and dramatic improvement over the \nperiod of the last 3 years. In the premarket notification process known \nas 510(k), which about 95 percent of all the medical devices come \nthrough, the median review times have dropped from 199 days to 93 to 85 \ndays, meeting the standard of 95 percent of all of those submitted. \nThat is extraordinary progress. And for the more complicated, newer \ndevices, the breakthrough kinds of devices, which account for only 5 \npercent of submissions, review times have been reduced to about 40 \npercent of the time between 1993 and 1996.\n  This is the record. That is why there is within the medical device \nindustry, general support for the steps taken by the agency.\n  Here is the Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry magazine of this \nyear.\n\n       With improvements in FDA product review performance, \n     despite a more challenging domestic market, device companies \n     are more optimistic than ever. Company executives report a \n     substantial improvement in FDA performance, particularly in \n     510(k) product approval times.\n\n  This is the Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry magazine \ncommenting on the performance of the FDA in terms of its approval \nratings.\n\n       This year's survey of medical device manufacturers marks \n     the highest business climate ratings ever.\n\n  Here we have the industry magazine talking about how effective the \nFDA is in moving these devices through the process expeditiously. And \nnow, even with this information, we are undermining the ability of that \nagency to provide adequate protections for public health and safety.\n  (Mr. COATS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the agency was not doing a good job, if we were \nseeing these bureaucratic delays denying patients products, at least \nthere would be an arguable position. But what we are talking about here \nis the industry's own assessment about the effectiveness of the agency. \nThey are pointing out how hopeful and optimistic they are about the \nrecent performance of the agency in quickly approving devices.\n  Not only have they made progress in moving them expeditiously, but \nnow a number of the medical manufacturers want to diminish the existing \npower of the FDA to assure proper safety. The American people must ask \nwhy. We do not have the kind of problems that we had years ago with the \nDalkon shield and the Shiley heart valve. We do not have the kinds of \nproblems that we had\n\n[[Page S9816]]\n\nwith earlier medical device tragedies. What we have now is an excellent \nrecord of safety and effectiveness with devices, and it is against that \nbackground we find some in the medical device industry want to make it \neven more profitable for themselves, and to do so at the risk of the \npublic.\n  Continuing along with the survey:\n\n       The overall results of the survey indicate widespread \n     satisfaction with the medical device business climate. A \n     substantial majority of the survey respondents characterized \n     business conditions for the device industry as good to \n     excellent. One important cause of this year's improved \n     outlook is perceived improvement in relationships with the \n     FDA. The declining complaints about the agency mirror the \n     increase in positive business outlooks. Much of this \n     improvement is no doubt due to the dramatic decrease in the \n     last 2 years of 510(k) product approval times which the FDA \n     has made a lead focus of its internal reforms.\n       Ray Larkin, President and CEO, Nelcor, Purett & Bennett, \n     Pleasanton, CA, underlines the extent of the improvement of \n     the FDA: ``As critical as I may have been a year ago, I think \n     they have made significant improvements in the product \n     approval and the compliance side. The whole regulatory \n     environment is improving.''\n\n  This is what industry itself is saying about the FDA. This is not \njust those of us who are opposed to this particular provision. This is \nthe industry itself. How many times have we heard, ``If it is not \nbroke, why fix it.'' And here we have the wide approval by the \nregulated industry itself. And yet some here in this body want to \nderide this progress and put the American public at risk by denying the \nagency the ability to review important information about safety and \neffectiveness when the information on the label is false and \nmisleading.\n  And here is Medical Economics of this year.\n\n       The demand for devices has created a worldwide market of \n     $120 billion including $50 billion in the U.S.\n\n  That's growing by 8 percent annually.\n  A healthy industry, thank goodness, because I think all of us know \nthe importance of these medical devices when they are safe and \neffective. But we have to make sure they are safe and effective. We do \nnot want to compromise the current superb safety record.\n  An extensive study was conducted by the Medical Device Diagnostic \nIndustry magazine this year that showed that the executive rating of \ndevice industry business is at an all-time high--58 percent favorable, \n11 percent unfavorable. ``Expectations of the medical device business \nconditions.'' The best that it has been in any time in recent years. \nAll the measures indicating that the medical device industry is doing \nwell, that the public is being served, safety is being addressed.\n  Even with regulatory protections for safety, the speed with which \nthese devices are being approved has been improved, nonetheless we are \nbeing asked to alter those conditions. We are being asked to handcuff \nthe FDA from being able to look at that medical device that may meet \nthe safety standard substantial equivalence but it clearly intended to \nbe used and marketed for another purpose. A purpose for which safety \nand effectiveness data have not been gathered or evaluated.\n  Let's get back to the fundamentals. The main purpose of the FDA \nreform bill was to reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of \n1992 known as PDUFA. PDUFA is one of the most effective regulatory \nreform programs ever enacted. Under PDUFA, the pharmaceutical industry \npays the user fees that cover part of the cost of FDA's drug approval \nand regulatory functions. And with these additional resources the FDA \nhas been able to hire additional personnel so that drugs can be \nreviewed more promptly. As important as these additional resources \nwere, equally important were the specific performance targets for \nspeedier drug review negotiated between the industry and the FDA as \npart of the PDUFA agreement.\n  This is where the industry, working with the agency, said, well, if \nwe give support for this and it becomes law and they get the additional \nresources to hire the personnel, can we reach these target timeframes \nfor approval, and the agency agreed to that. And we had extraordinary \naccountability. We found a 90 to 95 percent compliance with those \ngoals. The industry establishing the support for the PDUFA fee resulted \nin important and dramatic progress made. The combination of performance \ntargets, additional resources, and the leadership of Dr. Kessler, the \nformer FDA Commissioner, has created a regulatory revolution at the \nFDA.\n  Listening to some of the speeches we have heard during the course of \nthis debate, you would think the FDA was a regulatory dinosaur mired in \nthe past, cumbersome and bureaucratic, imposing unnecessary and costly \nregulatory burdens on industry and denying patients speedy access to \nlifesaving drugs.\n  That is a myth that those who want to destroy the FDA in the interest \nof an extreme ideological agenda or in the interest of higher profits \nand at the expense of the patients, would love you to believe. It is \nnot true. The FDA's regulatory record is the envy of the world, and it \nsets the gold standard for protection of patient health and safety.\n  Over the last few years, in partnership with Congress and the \nadministration, the FDA has responded to growing criticisms of delays \nin approving new products by taking impressive steps to improve its \nperformance. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 was one of the \nmost effective regulatory reform programs ever enacted. The bill \nestablished a new partnership between the industry and the agency. The \nindustry agreed to provide the additional resources. The agency agreed \nto a measurable performance standard to speed the review of products, \nand every goal set by the legislation has not only been met but been \nexceeded.\n  So today the FDA is unequaled in the world for its record in getting \nnew drugs to market quickly, without sacrificing patient protection. In \nfact, last year average review times in the United States were twice as \nfast as in Europe. Fifteen new drugs were approved in both the European \nUnion and the United States. In 80 percent of the cases, the United \nStates approved the new drugs either first or at the same time as the \nEuropean Union. More companies chose the United States for the \nintroduction of breakthrough drugs than any other country.\n  That is the current record. In addition to speeding the review times, \nthe FDA has taken far-reaching steps to reduce unnecessary burdens on \nindustry and modernize its regulatory processes. More needs to be done, \nbut these steps have added up to a quiet revolution in the way FDA \nfulfills its critical mission. When the prescription drug user fee was \noriginally passed, the device industry refused to agree to the user \nfees that would give the FDA additional resources and performance \nstandards that have contributed so much to the agency's outstanding \nrecord on drugs and biologics. But even in the device area, the recent \nFDA achievements have been impressive.\n  I think it is fair to say that following passage of PDUFA, the \nprimary priority of the FDA was to implement that commitment and \ncontract with the pharmaceutical industry. And I do think that the \nagency gave that a higher priority than it did moving ahead in terms of \nthe medical devices.\n\n  I think that is probably a fair criticism. But once PDUFA had been \neffectuated, the priorities shifted to the medical device industry.\n  I remember the debate on PDUFA quite clearly. I welcomed the \nopportunity to join with my colleague, Senator Hatch, and others in the \nadoption of PDUFA, and I remember the efforts we made in the area of \nthe medical device industry to do exactly the same thing. But we were \nunable to get the device industry to agree to that. I think it is \nunfortunate. Any fair evaluation in terms of the FDA in looking over \nthe period of the time since the passage of the PDUFA, the changes in \nthe way that the agency worked in advancing and accelerating the \nconsideration of pharmaceuticals and biologics would understand that \nthey get the priority. It has been only in recent years that the device \nindustry has received attention, with the results which I mentioned \njust a few moments ago.\n  The so-called 510(k) application devices, which are approved on the \nbasis of substantial equivalence to a device already on the market, \naccount for 95 percent of the device submissions. The FDA has virtually \neliminated its backlog. Last year it reviewed 94 percent of these \ndevices within the statutory timeframe compared to 40 percent just 4 \nyears ago--dramatic improvement. And we haven't compromised safety in \nthe process. Why are we now attempting to undermine the health and the\n\n[[Page S9817]]\n\nsafety of the American public? Why are we risking it?\n  Mr. President, even in the area of class III devices, which is where \nmost problems remain, the FDA has improved its performance \nsubstantially. According to a study by the GAO, median review times \ndropped 60 percent between 1991 and 1996. A recent survey of device \nindustry executives reported that the business climate for the industry \nis the best in a 5-year history of the survey. The sponsor of the \nsurvey attributes the favorable response in large measure to the \nimprovements at FDA and concludes:\n\n       The agency has not only reduced the product approval delays \n     that slowed new product introductions, but, perhaps more \n     importantly, has also greatly reduced both executives' and \n     investors' uncertainty about the timeliness of future product \n     introductions.\n\n  That is the conclusion of the General Accounting Office. That is not \nthe conclusion of those of us who are trying to say look, the system is \nworking, the devices that are getting into the FDA are being approved \nin record time, they are getting out to benefit the people and we have \na solid safety record.\n  We are being asked here to walk away from that safety record. We are \nbeing asked here, for the first time since we passed serious medical \ndevice legislation 25 years ago, to take steps backward in the area of \nprotecting the American public.\n  In a recent FDA report, the agency sets new targets for even quicker \nreview of the class III devices while still giving assurances that we \nare going to continue to protect the public. The agency is doing a good \njob now. It will be doing an even better job in the future. There is no \njustification for weakening the FDA power to protect the public--not \nbased on the myth that it is denying patients prompt access to needed \nnew products.\n  If you listened to this debate for the past days, the other side's \ndescription of the FDA may have been accurate 5 years ago or 10 years \nago, but does not reflect where the FDA is today. And that is not just \nmy opinion, but it is what we hear from the General Accounting Office, \nand what we have the industry itself saying.\n  The most important aspect of this bill is the reauthorization of \nPDUFA. The new PDUFA program was negotiated between the FDA and the \nindustry. It expands existing programs by setting additional \nperformance standards and puts special emphasis on expanding early \ncooperation between the FDA and industry so the drug development \nprocess, not just the regulatory process, can be stepped up. The agency \nhas been creative in anticipating the possibility of major new drug \nbreakthroughs. They have been working with the industry in new ways to \nhelp shape and formulate the way the industry effects its application \nso it can be approved in more expeditious manner. This is because we \nare not just interested in drug approvals but also development times.\n  We had a long debate about how we were going to reduce the number of \ndays: 180, 360, 120, or 90 days--for the approval on these various \nissues. That was taking our eye off the ball. What is important is \ndevelopment time. In our own review of FDA, what makes the most \ndifference reducing total approval time is reducing development time. \nThe agency has been doing really excellent work. In addition to PDUFA, \nthere are a number of other provisions changing the way the agency does \nbusiness, particularly in the area of medical devices. As originally \nintroduced, the bill included many extreme provisions that posed \nsignificant threats to public health. It was important that these \nprovisions be modified before the legislation could be allowed to move \nforward. I compliment Senator Jeffords and the other members of the \ncommittee, Republicans and Democrats alike, on their willingness to \ncompromise on these unacceptable proposals over the months we worked on \nthe bill. I would like to review a number of these provisions for the \nMembers of the Senate so they understand the changes this legislation \nmakes and the pitfalls that have been avoided. These compromises must \nnot be undone as the bill moves further through the legislative \nprocess. I am proud the progress that has been made. We have reached \nconstructive compromises on more than 20 items.\n  I have here the letter that was sent to the chairman by the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services in June, June 11, as the committee was \nconsidering the FDA reform. In this, the Secretary mentions, \n``Unfortunately, the Chairman's substitute to S. 830, also includes a \nnumber of provisions which as drafted do not reflect consensus and \nabout which I have very significant concerns.''\n  I will not take the time of the Senate now to review those. But \nbasically they include some 20 different provisions. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have those printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                       Secretary of Health and Human Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1997.\n     Hon. James M. Jeffords,\n     Chairman, Committee on Labor and Human Resources,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Jeffords: For the past several months the \n     Administration has been working with the Senate Labor and \n     Human Resources Committee on legislation to improve the \n     performance and accountability of the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA or the Agency), while preserving and \n     enhancing the Agency's ability to protect and promote the \n     public health. I appreciate the efforts that you, Senator \n     Kennedy, and the other members of the Committee have made in \n     this regard and believe that considerable progress has been \n     made toward these goals.\n       The Food and Drug Administration Modernization and \n     Accountability Act of 1997, S. 830, includes approximately 20 \n     provisions that represent significant consensus reforms. \n     Among the provisions that we all agree on are those that set \n     forth the Agency's mission, codify reforms to the regulations \n     of biotechnology products, provide expedited authority for \n     the adoption of third party performance standards for device \n     review and for the classification of devices, and streamline \n     submission requirements for manufacturing changes and \n     marketing applications for drugs and biologics.\n       I must emphasize that these provisions represent very \n     significant reform, on which all parties have worked hard to \n     reach consensus, and which I hope will not be jeopardized by \n     insistence on other provisions on which we have not reached \n     agreement.\n       Unfortunately, the Chairman's substitute to S. 830, also \n     includes a number of provisions which as drafted do not \n     reflect consensus and about which I have very significant \n     concerns. Also, the current version is not ``balanced'' in \n     that it does not take advantage of significant opportunities \n     to strengthen current law so FDA can more effectively protect \n     the public health. The most significant of the non-consensus \n     provisions, summarized on the enclosed list, would undermine \n     the public health protections that the American people now \n     enjoy, by: (1) lowering the review standard for marketing \n     approval; (2) allowing distribution of experimental therapies \n     without adequate safeguards to assure patient safety or \n     completion of research on efficacy; (3) allowing health \n     claims for foods and economic claims for drugs and biologic \n     products without adequate scientific proof; (4) requiring \n     third party review even for devices that require clinical \n     data; and (5) burdening the Agency with extensive new \n     regulatory requirements that will detract resources from \n     critical Agency functions without commensurate enhancement of \n     the public health. Another significant nonconsensus item is \n     the set of adjustment provisions in sections 703 and 704, \n     which together require significant increases in FDA's \n     appropriations levels over FY 1998 through 2002 (almost $100 \n     million above the FY 1998 Budget with levels rising \n     thereafter). We recognize that the ability of the FDA to \n     commit to specific performance goals under PDUFA depends on \n     the resources it will have available. We would support a user \n     fee proposal that is consistent with our FY 1998 Budget \n     proposal, but we are concerned that the proposal to collect \n     user fees in this legislation imposes additional pressure on \n     the fixed level of the discretionary resources agreed to \n     under the Bipartisan Budget Agreement.\n       We note the inclusion of the provision on pediatric \n     labeling in the most recent version of the Committee mark. We \n     believe it should be revised to assure a more appropriate \n     system for testing drugs for pediatric use before they are \n     prescribed for children.\n       I want to commend you and members of the Committee on both \n     sides of the aisle on the progress we have made together to \n     develop a package of sensible, consensus reform provisions \n     that are ready for consideration with reauthorization of the \n     Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). We are interested and \n     prepared to continue working with the Committee to reach \n     consensus on additional issues--and have proposed acceptable \n     alternative approaches to many of the objectionable \n     provisions. My concern is the time for reauthorization of \n     PDUFA is running perilously short. As I indicated in my \n     recent letter to you, I am concerned that the inclusion of \n     non-consensus issues in the Committee's bill will result in a \n     protracted and contentious debate. This would not serve our \n     mutual goal of timely reauthorization of PDUFA and passage of \n     constructive, consensus bipartisan FDA reform.\n\n[[Page S9818]]\n\n       A copy of this letter is also being sent to the ranking \n     Minority member, Senator Kennedy, and the other members of \n     the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donna E. Shalala.\n       Enclosure.\n\n\n                     s. 830 (Chairman's Substitute)\n\n     A. Major Concerns:\n       1. Cumulative Regulatory Burdens/No Provisions to Promote \n     Public Health.--Many new regulatory burdens are being imposed \n     on FDA (list enclosed) and little that can be advanced as \n     promoting public health.\n       2. Third Party Review of Devices (Sec. 204).--Expansion of \n     FDA's existing pilot project for review of medical devices \n     (includes devices that require clinical data) by \n     organizations accredited by FDA.\n       3. Approval Standard for Drugs/Biologics/Devices (Secs. \n     404/409/609/610/611/619).--Effectiveness standard for drugs \n     and biologics needs further clarification; for supplements \n     (applications for new uses) lowers standard such that they \n     might not ever require a single investigation; limits FDA \n     authority to evaluate clinical outcomes for devices; and \n     lowers approval standard for radiopharmaceuticals, including \n     PET drugs.\n       4. Health Claims For Foods (Sec. 617).--Health claims not \n     approved by the FDA but consisting of information published \n     by authoritative government scientific bodies (e.g., NAS or \n     NCI) would be permitted for use by companies in the labeling \n     of food products, even if it is very preliminary.\n       5. Expanded Access to Investigational Therapies (Sec. \n     102).--Would allow drug and device companies to sell an \n     investigational product for any serious disease or condition \n     without FDA approval and without appropriate protections for \n     clinical investigations.\n       6. Device Modifications (Sec. 601).--Would allow companies \n     to make manufacturing changes that affect a device's safety \n     and effectiveness without FDA agreement.\n       7. Health Economic Claims (Sec. 612).--Would allow industry \n     to discuss health economic claims given to managed care \n     organizations under a lower evidentiary standard and without \n     FDA review, even if the claim compared the safety or efficacy \n     of two drugs.\n       8. Pediatric Labeling.--Would provide an incentive of six \n     months of market exclusivity to encourage pharmaceutical \n     companies to conduct necessary clinical trials for FDA \n     approval of their products for children; doesn't assure that \n     necessary labeling for children will be included; and might \n     undercut FDA's ability to use other means such as \n     regulations.\n     B. Other Significant Concerns:\n       1. Expanded Humanitarian Use of Devices (Sec. 103).\n       2. Device Collaborative Determinations/Review (Secs. 301/\n     302).\n       3. Limitations on Initial Classification Determinations \n     (Sec. 407).\n       4. Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation (Sec. \n     604).\n       5. PMS (Sec. 606).\n     C. Currently In The Bill--No Language Provided Yet:\n       1. Off-Label Use of Drugs (floor amendment expected).\n       2. Drug Compounding (amendment expected).\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. They are listed here. There are 20 items, major concerns \nabout the cumulative aspect of the regulatory burdens, the various \nkinds of advisory committees, the advisory committees and the \nregulatory burdens that would have added to the complexity, and even \nthe process of considering new drugs. The basic concerns the \nadministration had on features of the third-party review, the approval \nstandard for some of the drug and biologic devices, limits that were \nput on the FDA to evaluate some of the clinical outcomes for devices, \nand the lower approval standards that were included in some radio-\npharmaceuticals.\n  They had some concerns about the health claims for foods and expanded \naccess to investigational therapies, which allow drug or devices \ncompanies to sell investigational products for any serious disease \nwithout FDA approval and without appropriate protections for clinical \ninvestigators. The device modification allowed the companies to make \nmanufacturing changes that affected devices' safety and effectiveness \nwithout ever notifying the FDA; the health economic claims that would \nallow industry to discuss health economic claims given to managed care \norganizations under a low evidentiary standard and without FDA review.\n  There was pediatric labeling, and the whole question on the \nhumanitarian use of devices and collaborative determinations. There \nwere also some concerns about off-label use of drugs, drug compounding.\n  If you look at the improvements in the bill and the compromises \nworked out here, 19 of the 20 have been worked out to the satisfaction \nof HHS and the FDA. There may be some groups that do not feel that \ncertain provisions are worked out adequately. But I am prepared to \ndefend those compromises. There is only one that remains. That is the \nprovision that we are addressing here. Whether we are going to permit \nfalse and misleading labeling on a particular product and deny the FDA \nthe right to look behind that label in order to protect the safety of \nthe families of America. There were 19 accepted, only one remains--but \nit is an important one.\n  Why is it, if we are able to work out 19 of the 20, can't work out \nthis one? The Senator from Rhode Island offered an excellent amendment \nyesterday saying, ``OK, we will go along with the existing language \nthat is in the bill. But we will also add the language that nothing in \nthe label will be false and misleading.'' False and misleading; that \nwas defeated. Those Member who voted against it, I expect, will have to \nexplain to their constituents why they would resist an amendment that \nsaid we should not permit the medical manufacturer to submit something \nfalse and misleading.\n  Members are saying that this has been a long process that has taken a \ngood deal of time. This measure was considered in the last Congress and \nnow again in this Congress. We could have acted on these measures. We \ncould have acted before June 11 and not dealt with any of the \noutstanding health and safety issues. But the fact of the matter is, we \ntook the time, we listened to the arguments of the FDA and the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, the people who are charged \nwith protecting the American people. We worked out the 19 of the 20. \nEveryone gave a little, took a little, but 19 of those 20 have been \nworked out. Not this particular provision. It took time to work out \nthose compromises. I think the time spent was well worth it. This is a \nmuch better bill than would have come out of that committee or on the \nfloor in June or July or August, or even the early part of September.\n  What were those steps that we took? First of all, we preserved the \nStates' oversight of the safety of cosmetics. This compromise assures \nthat the States will be able to continue to regulate the safety of \ncosmetics. The Gregg proposal in the underlying bill would have barred \nthe States from any regulation whatsoever of cosmetics, even though the \nFDA has neither the authority nor the staff to regulate these products. \nThe compromise allowed the States to continue their regulation unless a \nspecific inconsistent regulation has been issued by the FDA in a \nparticular area. We went through that debate. We found the examples, \nparticularly with regard to the State of California, how they were able \nto protect their consumers. In some cases there were carcinogens in the \nproducts and the manufacturing company changed the formula and were \nable to get right back out there and produce the product and have \nrecord sales.\n\n  The toluene that was in lipstick, which is related to another \ncarcinogen that was related to some birth defects with children was \naltered and changed.\n  We have had important studies that have been done up in Seattle, WA, \nat the University of Washington and other medical centers, about some \nof the potential dangers of use of talcum powder on small infants and \nits relationship to ovarian cancer.\n  These were studies, scientific studies that were done by the States, \nthat are directly related to protecting health and safety. The FDA does \nnot provide for that kind of protection. Nonetheless, there was an \neffort to preempt States from protecting health and safety. We were \nable to defeat that. I think that was important. I believe the \nconsumers in those States think so.\n  Second, the safeguard for off-label use of drugs. This important \ncompromise will allow companies to circulate reputable journal articles \nabout off-label use of drugs but will ultimately enhance the public's \nhealth and safety because the FDA will be given the opportunity to \nreview, comment on, and approve articles which the companies circulate. \nThe compromise also requires the companies to undertake studies on the \nsafety of their drugs for the specific off-label use and submit \napplications to the FDA for approval for their drugs for these uses \nwithin 3 years. That was not in the legislation prior to this \ncompromise. We saw the steps that were taken to meet the safety \nstandards.\n\n[[Page S9819]]\n\n  Currently, companies are circulating articles without reviewing them \nfor off-label use, without seeking review or approval by the FDA, and \nwithout conducting the studies which would lead to an ultimate FDA \napproval or disapproval of the drug.\n  We wanted to make sure that the companies were going to conduct the \nsafety standards for the use of those particular drugs. We were able to \nwork that out. Again, to protect the American public.\n  Expanding access to drugs for patients and fast track approval. The \nfast track approval--this is one of the most important new initiatives \nin the legislation--will provide the same streamlined availability for \ndrug treatments for patients with any life-threatening disease now \navailable to patients with cancer or AIDS. It is a major breakthrough \nfor patients who have life-threatening diseases.\n  We were moving through the measures in the bill and pointing out in \nJune of last year that the Secretary of HHS identified 20 major areas \nthat we ought to review and work through in trying to accommodate some \nof the health and safety concerns.\n  Effectively, we have resolved 19 of those. The only unresolved \nmatter, according to the letter from the HHS, is the provision on \nsection 404.\n  What I was trying to do is to point out a number of these areas where \nwe have made important progress and to mention the safety provisions \nthat had been worked out and included in a bipartisan way.\n  I was mentioning the expanded access to drugs for patients on the \nfast-track approval. We have had more than 17 different pharmaceuticals \nor drugs that have been identified for fast-track procedure. We are \ntaking what has been the practice of the FDA and actually demonstrating \nby legislation, the importance of this particular procedure. We are \ntrying to make the progress available to all those that have life-\nthreatening diseases by giving authority to those researchers who \nbelieve the opportunities for fast-tracking these various \npharmaceuticals will benefit the American public.\n  That has been successful for AIDS and cancer, and now we are \nencouraging its use for other life-threatenting conditions.\n  We have also expanded access for drugs under investigation for \npatients who have no other alternative. So an individual who might not \notherwise qualify for various clinical trial protocols can get access \nto a drug if they have no other alternative. If this is the last gasp, \nthe last hope that they will be able to have access to some of the \nmodalities that might not have been particularly identified for this \nparticular illness or sickness but their medical professionals believe \nthey should have access, and we are moving in that direction. I think \nthat gives a degree of hope to many of those who really wonder if they \nhave any hope at all in trying to get some of the modern kinds of \nbreakthrough drugs\n  We have accepted the Snowe-Feinstein piece of legislation that will \ngive individuals who have a particular life-threatening illness or \nsickness the opportunity to tap into the NIH database to find out what \nclinical trials are taking place. This is a very, very important \nadditional provision, and I commend our Senators who are not on the \ncommittee but who have been interested and involved in this. That is \nvery, very important.\n\n  Mr. President, another area that we reviewed is the streamlining of \nthe FDA procedures. The concern initially was in the areas of \ncontracting out of various functions of the FDA. We talk about not only \ntimeliness but also about the importance of preserving quality. We have \nto make sure that we are not only interested in timeliness, but we are \nalso concerned about the quality.\n  We have also, in this streamlining of the FDA procedures, worked out \nhow we were going to try to review third-party review. That was worked \nout in a way which I think has virtual broad support. It permits 70 \npercent of all the devices that would be eligible to be reviewed. But \nin the areas that are the very significant higher level of class II--a \nlimited number of class II and class III will remain outside of that \nparticular protocol so that we will have a chance to review the results \nof the research that will be done. We have accelerated the time for \nthat review, so the information will come back in quicker and we will \nbe able to evaluate the results of that particular process.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. It is a real pleasure for me to take a few moments and \nreflect on my interpretation of where we are today and the significance \nof the bill that is before us.\n  It was 1938, not that long ago, that Congress passed the Food, Drug \nand Cosmetic Act. And at that time the primary mission was defined \nfairly clearly to be to protect the public health by safeguarding \nAmericans from unsafe and ineffective products.\n  Over the past 60 years, the FDA has truly done an excellent job on \nthe whole in fulfilling this mission to make sure that food is safe and \nwholesome and that drugs and medical devices are safe and effective for \ntreating disabilities and the diseases that have plagued us over the \nyears.\n  You can look back and cite numerous, numerous examples that recall \nthe FDA's important role, their vigilance in protecting the American \npublic from unsafe drugs. Think back to Thalidomide. We think back to \nthe FDA's quick response to the Tylenol tampering case as evidence of \nthe effectiveness that that very important Government entity plays that \naffects each of our lives in ways that many of us do not realize.\n  But during this same period of time, the United States has been the \nmost innovative nation in the world, particularly in the arena of \nmedical research. I think back to my dad, who is 86 years of age, who \npracticed medicine for 55 years. I remember when I was a very young boy \ntraveling with him as he would make house calls, and now to think how \nmuch things have changed over that period of time in terms of \nantibiotics, antiviral agents, vaccines, treatments for diseases that \nwhen I was a child were devastating to large populations. You look at \nhepatitis B, chicken pox, polio, many forms of cancer, the list goes on \nof what we can treat today.\n  We have developed important new surgical procedures. As a surgeon who \nhas been in the medical field for the past 20 years, I have had the \nreal privilege to watch fields unfold that were nonexistent even when I \nwas in medical school. I think of certain types of tissue transplants, \nlung transplants, which I was doing routinely before coming to the \nSenate, that 15 years ago were not done at all.\n  I think of the new medical device implants like little stents we can \nnow place in the coronary arteries which feed the heart, which were \nnonexistent 10 years ago; the artificial joints, the hips, the knees.\n  Thanks to the new biomedical drugs and products, we have new \nprotocols for treating everything from AIDS, where we demonstrated \ntremendous success in the last year, to the treatment of other diseases \nlike cystic fibrosis.\n  However, in recent decades the FDA, which has never had in writing a \nclear mission statement to guide its hand, has become too bureaucratic, \ntoo top heavy, with excessive regulation. I say this again out of \ntremendous respect for the FDA, having seen firsthand the tremendous \nsuccesses of that agency.\n  To address this problem the FDA, to its credit, has been very \naggressive in undertaking a number of reforms internally that have \nreduced the regulatory burden on industry and have improved patient \naccess to new therapies.\n  However, it is clear that much, much more needs to be done. In the \npast, medical discoveries typically reached the patient in a relatively \nshort period of time. Again, when my father first started the practice \nof medicine, it took an average of anywhere from 7 to 8 years for a new \ndrug, a new pharmaceutical agent to pass through the entire discovery \nand approval process. Now, although in certain areas there has been \ntremendous improvement, it takes anywhere from 10 to 15 years to go \nthrough that discovery process and through that approval or disapproval \nprocess. Everybody agrees that is too long. Everybody agrees that you \ncan have the same or improved standards if we streamline, if we \ncoordinate, if we modernize the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n[[Page S9820]]\n\n  That is what this bill is about, not a lowering of standards, not \nputting devices or pharmaceutical agents out on the market that have \nnot gone through that eye of the needle of disciplined, very high \nstandards that we all expect of the Food and Drug Administration.\n  Unfortunately, up-to-the-minute advances in medical science, advances \nthat are occurring at increasing speed, are not making it to our \nmarketplace as quickly as they should. Many times these advances are \ngoing overseas.\n  Too often you see that a drug that is in this long pipeline, and we \nknow it is a potential benefit, all of a sudden moves overseas. It \nmoves overseas for trials, for ultimate approval too often. Many times \nthe manufacturing of that drug or of that device also follows it \noverseas.\n  I think the FDA regulatory structure simply has not kept pace with \nthe rapid rate at which scientific discovery is being made. In too many \ncases, which I personally hear among investigators in the academic \ncommunity and the private sector, the FDA has become a barrier, a \nbarrier instead of a partner, to innovation and to access to medical \ntherapies. It is that concept of dropping down the barrier and \nfacilitating that partnership with very high standards that this bill \nachieves.\n  I mentioned U.S. biomedical research moving overseas. The \nimplications are significant. It is very hard to put a price tag on \nthis in the short term. But if we drive our very best biomedical \nscience, our very best biomedical research off our shores to other \ncountries, over the long term it is to the detriment of our health \ncare, to our quality of life, and to our economy. Our once almost \nimpenetrable edge in a U.S. dominated market can be lost forever if we \ndo not act responsibly now.\n  I find my fellow doctors often travel to Europe to train, to study, \nto see, not the general foundation of medical knowledge of which we \nhave the best in the world, evident by people from all over the world \ncoming here to study medicine, but for innovative, breakthrough \ntherapies. Too often today the therapies, the technologies, the \nresearch is moving overseas, and, therefore, even my colleagues go \noverseas to learn something that they should be learning right here in \nthis country.\n  In the future, as medical science moves away from the contemporary \npractice of just treating overt symptoms when somebody comes in with a \ncomplaint, an organ failure, to a medical field where we begin to \nfabricate organs, where we do transplants, where we diagnose and treat \ndisease at the molecular level, at the genetic level, playing off the \ntremendous success we have seen in the human genome project, a project \nthat I might add as an aside is coming in under budget and much quicker \nthan we would have ever anticipated even 6 years ago, the possibilities \nfor new drugs, new devices, new methods of patient treatment are \nvirtually limitless.\n  Thus, we need a structure to address these great breakthroughs, this \ngreat innovation, that is up to date, that is modernized, that is well \norganized, that is disciplined, that is coordinated. That is what this \nbill achieves. With the explosive growth in technology, the FDA needs \nto better use the considerable genius and talent of non-Government \nscientists and researchers.\n  There is always a great fear when we approach this issue of so-called \ncontracting out because people can paint the picture that only \nGovernment people, only Government scientists have the ethics, have the \nhonesty, have the integrity to be able to make decisions, to be able to \nlook at clinical data and say what is best, what is dangerous, what is \na benefit to the patient.\n  That is just not right. We have many good people in the private \nsector. In truth, because science is moving so fast and is so \ncomplicated, so intricate, it is almost absurd for us to expect that we \ncan hire in the Federal Government all of the research scientists \nnecessary to be able to conduct studies, look at studies, interpret \ndata from the studies. Almost by necessity, because of the speed with \nwhich science is developing, we need to reach out and access many very, \nvery good experts that are in the private sector.\n\n  One of the greatest complaints against the FDA that I hear is a \nfeeling that the FDA has not been willing to collaborate and partner \nwith others in the private sector, it might be industry, might by \nacademia, it might be the academies, it might be individual scientists. \nPeople come in and say, ``You know, I sat down with the FDA,'' but \nthere is a real feeling of an adversarial relationship rather than a \ncollegial relationship.\n  We need to make fundamental changes in this regard at the FDA. We \nneed to build upon the successes in protecting the American public by \nreenergizing the process. We need to revitalize the process of product \napproval, speeding approval where appropriate, meeting high standards, \nimproving and enhancing communication between the FDA and the public it \nserves, nurturing, not stifling, research and innovation. And, yes, we \nneed to draw upon the untapped scientific excellence outside the FDA, \nat all times remembering that the FDA has the final say as to whether \nor not to accept the conclusions from that partnering with outside \nindividuals and agencies.\n  The bill before us today, S. 830, the Food and Drug Administration \nModernization and Accountability Act of 1997, does represent a \nbipartisan effort, including significant input from the Food and Drug \nAdministration aimed at making the FDA more efficient. The bill was \npassed out of the Labor Committee on June 18 with a bipartisan vote, \nagain, 14-4. On September 23, the Senate overwhelmingly approved the \nsubstitute amendment by Senator Jeffords.\n  I want to take this opportunity to commend Senators Jeffords, Coats, \nDodd, and Mikulski and my other colleagues on the Labor Committee, \nSenator Kennedy, all for their tireless efforts and commitment to \nmodernizing the FDA.\n  But to the American people I hope we have sent a signal that we can \naccomplish a very good bill, yes, a first step, but a very good bill in \nupdating an organization, in updating a Federal agency which will \naffect the lives of every American in a positive way.\n  I do urge my colleagues later today to support this bill. But I also \nask that we all view this legislation and discussion as an ongoing \ncommitment to improve the agency, not just a one-shot change in the \nagency, which we will put aside and come look at again in 10 years, but \nrealize this needs to be an ongoing process with continued oversight.\n  The Prescription Drug User Fee Act, commonly known as PDUFA, has been \ncommented upon today. It has been one of the great successes in the \nrelationship between the FDA, industry, and the American people. This \nbill is much more than just a reauthorization of PDUFA. It is also \nabout improving the FDA and fostering, better communication and \npartnering with the private sector.\n  I am a cosponsor of this bill because I believe it is a needed step \nin the right direction. We need to continue the debate, to look at both \nshort and long-term investment of resources in order to move the agency \nforward in areas of regulatory research, professional development, \ncollaboration between Government, academia and the private sector. I \nhope to continue working with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to \nfurther improve FDA in the following years.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts was going through a number of the \nitems in the bill and talking about the work on both sides of the aisle \nin pulling together areas that were contentious initially. I want to \nthank him formally, and his staff, for working together on what I \nconsider a very important aspect of this bill that has to do with \ndissemination of scientifically, peer-reviewed medical literature to my \ncolleagues, to people in the health care profession, about the uses of \ndrugs, both on-label and off-label.\n  As a physician, I understand the need for this up-to-date sharing of \nmore information than is currently allowed today. Off-label uses have \nbeen in the news recently, both in terms of pharmaceuticals, and we \nhave talked a lot about it in terms of devices recently.\n  I think it is very confusing to the American people what off-label \nuse of medicines is. In truth, about 90-percent of all cancer therapies \nare off-label today. So if you have cancer, there is a 90 percent \nchance you will be receiving off-label medicine. When we say off-label, \nit doesn't mean the medicines are bad. Sometimes it means those are the \nmost effective, and in cancer therapy, it does mean they are the most \neffective, up-to-date modern therapy to\n\n[[Page S9821]]\n\nhave if you want your cancer treated. The American Medical Association \nhas estimated between 40 and 60 percent of all prescriptions are for \noff-label uses, and up around 50 to 60 percent for the pediatric \npopulation, which means if your child is sick today medical therapy is \nlikely to be off-label.\n  Why? It only makes sense. The FDA can't study every use for every \ndrug in every combination of drug available. It is impossible to do \ntoday.\n  I want to acknowledge the tremendous work by Senator Mack on this \nparticular provision during the last few years. I have had the \nopportunity to work with him over the last 2\\1/2\\ years on this \nspecific provision of dissemination of information. I want to thank \nSenators Dodd, Wyden, and Boxer, and Senator Kennedy for his work in \nnegotiating with us in order to allow the inclusion of this important \nprovision which will be to the benefit of all Americans in S. 830.\n  The bill before the Senate today will help meet the need for \nincreased access to scientific and technical expertise that is \ncurrently lacking at the FDA. I touched upon this. It is that whole \nconcept of interagency collaboration with Federal agencies and with the \nprivate sector. We will see more collaboration with the National \nInstitutes of Health, more collaboration with the Centers for Disease \nControl, the National Academy of Sciences.\n  The bill allows the FDA to contract with outside reviewers and expand \nits current third-party medical device review pilot program which has \nbeen very successful to date. Everyone agrees that it has been \nsuccessful, which in turn will help conserve FDA resources, so that \nthose resources can be used in other areas. Because the FDA always \nretains the final authority to approve or disapprove new drugs or \nmedical devices reviewed by outside experts, the FDA always has the \nfinal authority, and it will not impede nor weaken the FDA's ability to \nsafeguard the public health. To help alleviate the confusion and \nfrustration that many feel today in working with the FDA, the bill \ncodifies evidence requirements for new drug and medical device \napplication submissions, it improves communication between the agency \nand industry. After almost 60 years, the FDA will be held and made \naccountable by giving it a specific mission statement and requiring the \nFDA to develop a plan of action to meet its requirements under law.\n\n  Again, we talk a lot about the specific provisions of the bill. The \nbill as a whole, once it is passed, will be of benefit to every \nAmerican, to every consumer, to every patient. Thanks to the bipartisan \nefforts of Senators Snowe, Feinstein, and Dodd, individuals with \nserious life-threatening disease will be able to access new clinical \ntrial databases providing expedited access to investigational \ntherapies.\n  Imagine yourself being in a situation of having a disease which \nsomebody says is not treatable, it is incurable. Where do you turn \ntoday? Nobody knows. There is no central repository, no database for \nsharing information of where the most up-to-date clinical trials exist. \nThere will be after this bill is passed.\n  This bill will also expand the fast-track drug approval process for \nnew drugs intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening \nconditions. It puts a focus right on those conditions that we know \npeople are dying from every day. Let's focus in that particular area, \nmake sure we get potential drugs to market if they are safe, sooner \nthan the 15 years that we are averaging over the last decade from \nbeginning to the initial discovery to final placement on the market. \nThe bill itself will provide access to investigational therapies for \npatients who have no other alternative but to try an unapproved \ninvestigational product.\n  Consumers will also benefit from this bill. The Senator from New \nHampshire talked earlier this morning about national uniformity. It is \ncritically important. We have not talked much about that in terms of \nfood and drugs over the last several days. The uniformity aspect of \nover-the-counter drugs, the uniformity there will have a huge impact. \nAgain, touching people in all sorts of ways. It will keep prices down, \nit will provide the consumer with a unified and consistent information \nfor self-medication.\n  Another benefit to consumers, if the health claim information for \nfood, published by the NIH or the CDC, Centers for Disease Control, or \nother Government, well-respected scientific bodies, will be allowed to \nappear on food labeling, giving the consumer accurate information, \neducating the consumer, empowering the consumer when they make their \ndietary choices.\n  In closing, Mr. President, this bill is a good bill that will benefit \nall Americans now and into the future. Medical science, moving at \nskyrocketing speed, offers promise of not just longer, but healthier \nlives, a higher quality of life. In the not-too-distant future, medical \nscience and medical technology will not just thwart the assaults of \ninfectious agents, but will eliminate many of the ailments of modern \nlife.\n  The FDA must facilitate, not complicate, that endeavor. We need a new \nmodel for a new century. It is time to update the FDA. This bill \naccomplishes that reform, that modernization. It will give a starting \npoint for a model that will facilitate, not stifle, the medical \nprogress of mankind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to express my sincere \nappreciation to Senator Frist, especially for his most recent \ndiscussion.\n  We have been concentrating on one small part of this bill--small in \nthe sense of the number of pages or words relative to the rest of the \nbill, and by outlining and expressing the tremendous advancements we \nmade in many of these areas in this bill, which has kind of gotten lost \nin the dialog, especially in the off-label use which has been a very \ncontentious issue. But I think the resolution which you and Senator \nMack, working with Senator Kennedy, myself and others have come up with \nis a tremendous step forward in preventing such things that have \noccurred in fen/phen and things like that, and making sure we exchange \nknowledge and that we work together to improve what can be improved.\n  I deeply appreciate the comments of the Senator and all the work the \nSenator has put into this bill. Your expertise and your knowledge has \nbeen a reward to us and has given us confidence that we have done the \nright thing. You have done a fantastic job and it is deeply \nappreciated. I yield the floor.\n  I see the Senator from Delaware on the floor. I would be glad to \nyield to him for the time that he might take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank my colleague. With the permission of the Chair and \nmy colleagues, I will take about 12 minutes, if I may.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of this FDA reform bill we are considering \ntoday is obviously to streamline the process for approving drugs so \nthat they are available to people who need them more quickly. I support \nthe bill and I look forward to its becoming law.\n  But, Mr. President, I rise today to speak to several amendments and \nseveral points that were, quite frankly, made nongermane as a \nconsequence of the cloture vote, so I will pursue this at another date. \nI rise today to discuss the problem of drugs that do not get to the \nmarket, even though we need them desperately, because there are \ninsufficient financial incentives for pharmaceutical companies to \ndevelop these drugs that we need to get to the market. In particular, I \nam speaking about medicines to treat addiction to illegal drugs like \ncocaine and heroin, so-called pharmacotherapies--that is, drugs that \nwould be able to be developed and used to combat addiction to cocaine \nand heroin and other scheduled drugs.\n  Since 1989, when I first offered a comprehensive report, which--I \ndon't know whether I am going to burden the Record with it, but I will \npoint it out to my colleagues. It was a report entitled \n``Pharmacotherapy: A Strategy for the 1990s.'' Since that time, I have \nargued that a key component of our national drug strategy should be the \ndevelopment of these pharmacotherapies that would act as antigens or \nantagonists to the effects of the illegal drugs being purchased on the \nstreets.\n  These medicines are critical for turning around addicts, particularly \naddicts who are difficult to treat with traditional methods. Getting \nthese addicts off of drugs is one of the most important efforts we can \nundertake to reduce the harm done to our Nation by the drug epidemic--\nbecause these\n\n[[Page S9822]]\n\ntreatment-resistant addicts commit such a large percentage of the drug-\nrelated crime, we would, if we could find some of the answers, \nsignificantly impact on and increase the safety of all Americans.\n  In my 1989 report, I posed the question: ``If drug use is an \nepidemic, are we doing enough to find a medical `cure' for this \ndisease?'' The obvious answer, as the report concludes, is, no, we are \nnot. If, for example, everyone who was victimized by a drug addict who \nhas knocked them on the head or hurt them or robbed them or burglarized \ntheir home, and everyone who is addicted to drugs had a rare disease \ninstead of the victims of drug addiction, or of being addicted to \ndrugs, we would have a multibillion dollar national campaign to find a \nmedical cure for it, as we rightfully are attempting to do with AIDS, \nbreast cancer, or cancer generally. But there is precious little going \non, although there is a lot of potential in the area of developing \nmedicines, drugs, to combat drug addiction.\n  Based on my report, I offered legislation with Senators Kennedy, \nMoynihan, and others, enacted into law in 1992, which created the \nMedications Development Program of the National Institute of Drug Abuse \nand commissioned a major study by the National Academy of Science on \npharmacotherapies.\n  This study highlighted the promise of the medical research that I \nreferred to. In fact, in recent years, there have been a number of \npromising advances that give hope that effective medicines could be \ndeveloped if we dedicated a sufficient amount of energy and resources.\n  One example of this promising research is the recent development of a \ncompound that appears to immunize laboratory animals against the \neffects of cocaine. Let me say that again. There is a compound that has \nbeen developed in a laboratory that appears--it hasn't gone through \nclinical trials--to be able to immunize laboratory animals against the \neffects of cocaine. The compound works like a vaccine by stimulating \nthe immune system to develop an antibody that blocks cocaine from \nentering the brain.\n\n  Now, this is pure conjecture on my part. Let's assume that that was \nable to be developed and it worked for human beings. What an incredible \nimpact it would have on the United States of America. What an \nincredible impact it would have not only on the addicts, but on those \nof us who are victims of the addicts. I want to remind everybody that \nover 60 percent of all the violent crime committed in America is \ncommitted by people who are addicted. At the moment they are committing \nthe crime, they are high, they are on a drug or a substance. Just think \nwhat a difference that would make.\n  Now, there are at least eight new medicines with promising potential, \nbeyond the one that I mentioned, to treat drug addictions which are at \nvarious stages of research and development. By the way, I commend to my \ncolleagues the report put out by the Institute of Medicine called the \n``Development of Medications for the Treatment of Opiate and Cocaine \nAddiction.''\n  Now, of the eight promising medicines that are out there, one is \nLAAM, a treatment for heroin addiction, the first new medicine since \nmethadone was approved in the early 1970's. Others are Naloxone, \nNaltrexone, Imipramine, Desipramine, Carbamazepine, Burprenorphine, and \nDiltiazem. These are all medicines identified by the various studies--\nin this case, by the Institute of Medicine--that in fact have promising \ncapacity to deal with either blocking the effect of the drug when it is \ningested by an addict or someone attempting to use it for the first \ntime, or it has the effect of causing that person to be sick and not \nwanting to take the drug again. Not a silver bullet that cures \neverything, but every single drug expert I have spoken with indicates \nthat if these could be developed, they would be significant tools in \naiding in the recovery of addiction and preventing addiction.\n  The National Academy of Sciences study also outlined the key steps we \nhave to take to fully realize the promise of pharmacotherapeutic \nresearch. Yet, almost a decade after my original report, almost a \ndecade after Senators Kennedy, Moynihan, myself and others moved to \nchange the law in 1992, despite promising research, despite the \ntremendously important gains that such medicines would mean for our \nnational effort against a drug epidemic, despite the fact that it's \nclear what steps we have to take to speed and encourage the research in \nthis area, despite all this, we are still not doing enough to encourage \nthe development of medicines to treat drug addiction.\n  That is why I have come to the floor today, Mr. President--to discuss \nthree amendments I had offered to the FDA reform bill. These amendments \nsought to take three different approaches to addressing our critical \nneed to develop pharmacotherapies to deal with our drug epidemic.\n  First, I believe we should reauthorize the Medications Development \nProgram of the National Institute of Drug Abuse and increase its \nfunding to $100 million by the year 2002. I might add, every time we \nidentify serious and pernicious diseases like breast cancer, prostate \ncancer, or AIDS, what do we do? We all immediately know that if we \nspend more money on research, we will attract more brilliant women and \nmen into the field to find the answer because they have funding to do \ntheir research, and we increase exponentially the prospects that we \nwill find a cure or find something to mitigate against the ravages of \nthe disease. But not all people instinctively reach that conclusion. \nWhy don't we reach that conclusion about drug addiction when the \nmedical community says there are so many promising avenues we could go \ndown? It would be different if the National Academy of Sciences and \nresearchers and experts said, ``You know, there isn't any promise here, \nthere is nothing we should bother to do, there is nothing we can do. \nThis is like trying to be able to go warp speed in our Challenger.'' \nWell, that would be one thing. But that is not the case. That is not \nthe case.\n\n  Currently, the program I have referred to at the National Institute \nof Drug Abuse receives about $67 million. Increasing that level by 50 \npercent over the next 5 years is the very least we should be doing in \nlight of the savings in crime reduction, reduction in health care \ncosts, and other expenses that would be eliminated or diminished if we \ncould effectively treat drug addiction with medicine.\n  Yet, despite the progress being made by Government and university \nresearchers, the Federal Government cannot solve this problem by \nitself, even if the amendment I proposed were not out of order or were \naccepted.\n  Private industry has not aggressively developed pharmacotherapies for \na variety of reasons, including a small customer base, difficulties in \ndistributing medicines to the targeted population, and fear of being \nassociated with the notion of substance abuse.\n  There are two major, major drug companies in my State--Zeneca and Du \nPont Merck. They have a number of brilliant researchers. I have visited \ntheir laboratories.\n  They say to me what every other drug company says. ``OK. Biden, how \nmany addicted drug people are there in all America?'' I believe the \nnumber is estimated at 5.6 million people. Let's say we spend $200 \nmillion, $300 million, $500 million, or $700 million developing it. \nThey say, ``Say we go out and spend all this money. And let's say we \ncome up with a cure or a silver bullet. How do we get that to the 5.6 \nmillion people who need it? They don't have the money to buy it. Are \nyou going to guarantee us that you will buy it? Are you going to \nguarantee us they will take it? What are you going to do? Our return on \ninvestment is de minimis. We will lose money in all probability, even \nif we come up with a silver bullet,'' which they are not suggesting \nthey will.\n  Conversely, if they come up with a silver bullet for prostate cancer, \nor a silver bullet for breast cancer, the world would beat a path to \ntheir door to buy it. That is one of the reasons they don't want to get \ninto the game, even though they acknowledge that these are promising \nopportunities.\n  Second, none of these companies, or anyone I named--Lilly, Squibb, \nany of them--wants to be known as the company that deals with drug \naddiction. It is bad public relations.\n  So for these and many other reasons, private industry has not really \ngotten\n\n[[Page S9823]]\n\ninto the fray. We need to create financial incentives to encourage \npharmaceutical companies to develop and market these treatments. And we \nneed to develop a new partnership between private industry and the \npublic sector in order to encourage the active marketing and \ndistribution of new medicines so they are accessible to all addicts who \nneed treatment.\n  My amendments sought to create these incentives in two ways.\n  First, I believe we must provide additional patent protections for \ncompanies that develop drugs to treat substances abuse. Under my bill, \npharmacotherapies could be designated ``Orphan Drugs'' and qualify for \nan exclusive 7-year patent.\n  These extraordinary patent rights would increase the market value or \npharmacotherapies--providing a financial reward for companies that \ninvest in the search to cure drug addiction.\n  This provision was contained in a bill introduced by Senator Kennedy \nand me which passed the Senate in 1990, but the provision was dropped \nin conference. It was also contained in the pharmacotherapy bill I \nintroduced last year and the youth violence bill I introduced this \nyear.\n  In addition, I proposed an amendment which would provide a \nsubstantial monetary reward for companies that develop medicines to \ntreat drug addition and shift responsibility for marketing and \ndistributing such drugs to the Government--a ``Biden Bounty'' as some \nhave called it.\n  This approach would create a financial incentive for drug companies \nto invest in research and development but enable them to avoid any \nstigma associated with distributing medicine to substance abusers.\n  To qualify for the award, a pharmaceutical company would have to \ndemonstrate that the new medicine meets strict guidelines--developed by \nthe National Academy of Sciences--that the medicine effectively treats \ncocaine or heroin addition.\n  At a minimum, the guidelines will require the producer of the drug to \nconduct a controlled, long-term performance test which demonstrates \nthat: Patients--addicts--will actually take the medicine; addicts will \ncontinue taking the medicine for as long as it takes to cure the \naddition; a significant percentage of those who receive treatment \nrefrained from using cocaine or heroin for at least 3 years; and the \nmedicine has a reasonable cost.\n  So, it is real simple--if a medicine meets the National Academy of \nScience test and it is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, \nthen the Government will purchase the patent rights for the drug from \nthe company that developed it.\n  So this bounty that would be made available to them is literally a \nreward. A reward, not unlike if I were a billionaire and say, ``I will \ngive any company $100 million if they found the cure for cancer, or for \nany cancer.'' It is the same notion.\n  The key reason the Government must not only reward companies with a \nbounty for developing medicines, but also purchase the patent rights is \ndue to the stigma problem identified by the National Academy of \nSciences report. This stigma problem is the legitimate concern of \ncompanies that they not be identified as the drug addicts company.\n  I would also note, that if a company does want to market and \ndistribute the medicine, they do not have to sell the patent to the \nGovernment. But if they don't want to they can sell the patent to \nGovernment, and we market it.\n  The purchase price for the patent rights is established by law: $100 \nmillion for a drug to treat cocaine addiction and $50 million for a \ndrug to treat heroin addiction, figures recommended by the Tufts \nUniversity Center on Drug Development.\n  So the way it works. You develop a patent. You don't want to be \ndistributing it because you don't want to be known as that company. The \nFederal Government would pay you $100 million for the patent after it \nhas demonstrated that it works, and it was effectively done, and we \nwould be the one engaged in the business of doing it. We can pay all of \nthis money to buy cops, we can pay all of this money for prisons, and \npay all of these other moneys for other things. It is a reasonable \nexpenditure for taxpayer dollars, in my view, to deal with the problem \nand scourge of drug addiction.\n  Once the Government has purchased the patent rights, then the \nGovernment would contract out the production of the drug and distribute \nit to the existing clinics, hospitals, State and local governments, and \nother entities qualified to operate drug treatment programs.\n  This is not a radically different process from how our military \nprocurement works: The Pentagon specifies what they want a fighter \nplane to be capable of--how fast, its stealth capabilities, what kind \nof weapons, et cetera; then the powers of the private sector are \nunleased because the Government will buy the best plane which meets the \nspecifications.\n  If my colleagues doubt that any such medicine could ever be \ndeveloped, fine.\n  If you are right, the Government will never spend the money.\n  But, if I am right--just imagine the promise--in terms of reduced \ndrug abuse; reduced crime; and reduced health care costs.\n  The bottom line is that--this joint public/private endeavor I seek \nwill harness the most important engine of innovation the world knows--\nthe private sector.\n  The three pharmacotherapy amendments I offered were directly related \nto the purpose of the FDA reform bill and I hoped they would be \naccepted. Nonetheless, I understand that for procedural reasons, my \namendments were out of order and could not be offered for a vote.\n  Still, I urge the Labor Committee to hold hearings on the topic and \nconsider this legislation as soon as possible. And, I put my colleagues \non notice that I will be back to offer these amendments on the next \nappropriate legislation.\n  In closing, I would observe that America's drug epidemic is reduced \neach and every time a drug abuser quits his or her habit. Fewer drug \naddicts mean fewer crimes, fewer hospital admissions, fewer drug-\naddicted babies and fewer neglected children. The benefits to our \ncountry of developing new treatment options such as pharmacotherapies \nare manifold.\n  Each dollar we spend on advancing options in this area can save us 10 \nor 20 times as much in years to come. The question should not be--``can \nwe afford to pursue a pharmacotherapy strategy?'' But rather, ``can we \nafford not to?''\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in promoting an important, and \npotentially ground breaking, approach to addressing one of our Nation's \nmost serious domestic challenges.\n  A lot of the scientific community says that there are great promising \nmedicines out there but which the companies will not move on for the \nreasons I have stated. We should be doing all that we can for our own \nsafety's sake.\n  I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio who has worked tirelessly on this bill as well as the bill we \nreported out of committee by unanimous agreement relative to the work \nforce improvement. So I yield to him 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, let me first make a unanimous-consent \nrequest that my congressional fellow, Jan Burrus, be granted floor \nprivileges during the duration of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I wish to make some comments about one \nparticular element of this year's FDA reform bill--one that I believe \nis especially important and valuable.\n  I want to thank Chairman Jeffords and my colleagues for including in \nthis bill a revised version of the Better Pharmaceutical for Children \nAct (S. 713). Senator Dodd and I introduced this bill earlier this year \nbecause an overwhelming majority of pharmaceuticals currently on the \nmarket have not been tested for safety or effectiveness in children.\n  In fact, Mr. President, a shocking 80 percent of the drugs that are \non the market today have never been tested for children.\n  We need to provide our young people with prescription drugs that have \nbeen studied for their effects on children's\n\n[[Page S9824]]\n\nbodies and appropriately labeled with doses suitable for young ages. \nToo many children today are taking adult-size drugs because we don't \nhave a comprehensive strategy to test drugs to determine appropriate \ndosages for children.\n  Children deserve better than this. Children deserve he same assurance \nadults have--that the drugs they take are safe and effective.\n  Section 618 of the FDA reform bill includes a modified version of the \nbill Senator Dodd and I have worked so hard on. It provides an \nadditional 6 months of market exclusivity to drug manufacturers who \ncomplete requested or required pediatric studies on drugs that are \nuseful for children. This exclusivity will act as financial incentive \nfor manufacturers to do research on their products for young patients.\n  As our legislation with incentives came close to final passage, the \nFDA proposed a rule to mandate pediatric studies. The rule was proposed \nlast month and would require pediatric studies for most new drugs and \nfor many drugs that are already on the market.\n  When the administration released its new regulation, I applauded \ntheir decision to join Senator Dodd and myself in trying to fix this \nproblem. I offered to work with them in a bipartisan way to combine the \nproposals for the benefit of the Nation's children. The legislation \nbefore us today does just that, and in essence combines our bill along \nwith the administration's proposal.\n  We have adapted the legislation that Senator Dodd and I originally \nintroduced so that it will work with the FDA's regulation. To ensure \nthat we do the best that we can for children, we have combined the two \napproaches to this problem: the financial incentives from the better \npharmaceuticals for children bill and the mandates from the proposed \nFDA rule.\n  We're now moving in the right direction. This combined approach may \nnot yet be perfect, but we can still work on it. I have extended an \ninvitation to all interested parties to continue to work toward a \nbetter compromise between now and conference. The most important thing \nis to get it right. I think this compromise between a market-based \napproach and mandates goes a long way toward that.\n  Time is of the essence in ensuring that children and their doctors \nhave the information they need to safely and effectively use \npharmaceuticals. Providing market incentives to manufacturers will help \nspeed this process along.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to again congratulate \nChairman Jeffords for the tremendous job that he has done over a long \nperiod of time in bringing this bill to the floor. This is a good FDA \nreform bill. The ``Better Pharmaceuticals for Children'' section is \nonly one of many creative, practical steps this bill makes and takes in \nthe right direction.\n  The reform bill makes commonsense changes that will help patients get \naccess to new medical technologies. At the same time, Mr. President, it \nmaintains assurances that products are safe and that they are \neffective.\n  Again, I applaud Chairman Jeffords for this bill. I look forward to \nits speedy passage.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his excellent \ncomments and praise him again for his work.\n  Mr. President, the goal of this legislation is to ensure a strong and \nefficient FDA.\n  The modernization and revitalization provision included in S. 830 \nmakes for a better FDA--not a weaker one, as some have suggested.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have had the opportunity to meet with \nindustry groups here in Washington, and with consumers, patients, and \nphysicians--both here and at my home in Vermont. All of these \ninterested parties have made important points about how to modernize \nthe agency while ensuring that its stellar standards for public safety \nremain as strong as ever. Though the large industries regulated by FDA \nare by and large not present in Vermont, all of us use their products. \nThe people and the patient advocates in Vermont have told me that more \nneeds to be done to ensure their timely access to the best therapies \navailable.\n  I believe we have accomplished that with this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         FOOD LABELING REFORMS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Jeffords and \nSenator Kennedy for the inclusion of my two amendments in S. 830. My \namendments address specific food labeling reforms that benefit both \nconsumers and the food and agriculture industry.\n  First, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 [NLEA] \nrequires that any nutrient content claim on a food label be accompanied \nby a referral statement--``See Back Panel for Nutrition Information.'' \nThe original intent of this provision was to help educate consumers \nabout the presence and location of nutrition information on food \nproducts. Based on the NLEA's success, today few consumers even notice \nthis generic referral statement because most individuals immediately \nlook to the mandatory Nutrition Facts panel to obtain nutrition \ninformation.\n  My proposal seeks to improve the effectiveness of this consumer \nnotice by requiring a referral statement only in those instances where \nthe FDA identifies that a food contains a nutrient at a level that \ncould increase the risk of a health condition for vulnerable persons.\n  For example, if a food label states that the product is low in fat, \nbut the FDA finds that the sodium content could prove harmful to \npersons with high blood pressure, the referral statement would state--\n``See Nutrition Information Panel for Sodium Content.''\n  Through the continued use of a specific referral statement, persons \nwho may find themselves at risk from potentially harmful levels of some \nnutrients would be reminded where to find detailed nutrition \ninformation. My proposal simply removes the requirement for a generic \nreferral statement whose purpose is now fulfilled by active consumer \nuse of the Nutrition Facts panel.\n  My second proposal addresses a keen concern for American consumers \ntoday--food safety. The much publicized outbreaks of E. Coli 0157:H7, \ncyclospora, and salmonella have captured the attention and apprehension \nof Americans, particularly parents, who are concerned about the \ninadvertent exposure to food pathogens.\n  Since the 1960's, food irradiation has presented a safe, simple, and \ninexpensive process to kill harmful pathogens in many foods. Today, \nthis approved food safety technology promises to reduce the incidence \nof many food borne illnesses which threaten the health of millions of \nAmericans, especially the very young and the very old.\n  The food irradiation process is quite straightforward. Food is \nexposed to a carefully measured amount of intense radiant energy which \nkills parasites and micro-organisms. Food irradiation is not a cure-\nall, but it can be an important food safety tool. Broader use of FDA-\napproved irradiation promises a significant step forward in improving \nour Nation's food safety. Dr. Michael T. Osterholm of the Minnesota \nDepartment of Health eloquently sets forth the argument in favor of \nfood irradiation's use in his May 1997 editorial in the New England \nJournal of Medicine. I ask that the text of his editorial be printed in \nthe Record after my statement\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In addition to the FDA, the World Health Organization, \nthe American Medical Association, and the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture agree that food irradiation presents no health risk, and \nhave endorsed irradiation as a method to prevent food borne diseases. \nToday, more than 35 countries have approved irradiation as a safe food \ntreatment technology.\n  Despite their well-documented food safety benefits, few irradiated \nfoods are marketed in the United States. Why? Because the current \nlabeling requirements render the foods virtually unmarketable. FDA \nregulations require that irradiated foods prominently and conspicuously \nbear the international radura symbol and the phrase ``treated with \nirradiation'' or ``treated by irradiation.'' Clearly, public notice of \nirradiation is necessary for informed consumer choice. However, the \ndegree of prominence for the current irradiation labeling creates a \nfalse impression among many consumers that the irradiation statement is \na warning. This\n\n[[Page S9825]]\n\nunintended labeling result must be corrected. Targeted improvements in \nthe labeling will provide consumers with clearer information on \nirradiation's approved use and provide a simple means to further food \nsafety in our Nation.\n\n  My amendment simply requires irradiated foods to bear an appropriate \ndisclosure requirement and specifies that the FDA-approved disclosure \nneed not be more prominent than the ingredient statement. The intent of \nmy amendment is for the FDA to revise its irradiation disclosure \nrequirement to assure that consumers do not misinterpret this \ndisclosure as a warning.\n  Clearly, the FDA should have the authority to require appropriate \ndisclosure of food irradiation. However, the use of a disclosure design \nthat discourages the utilization of this government-approved technology \ncompromises efforts by the FDA and food processors to improve food \nsafety in our Nation.\n  Mr. President, two dozen well-known and well-respected food and \nagriculture groups--such as the American Farm Bureau Federation, the \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association, and the Institute of Food \nTechnologists--have endorsed this targeted change as a means of \npromoting greater use of irradiation as a food safety tool. I ask that \nthe text of their letter of support be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I want to emphasize that even with this amendment FDA \nwould retain full authority to regulate all aspects of irradiation on \nfood, including products on which it can be used, what dose can be \nused, and the content and placement of irradiation labeling. Under my \namendment, the FDA can still use the current radura symbol and the \ndisclosure statement. No information would be hidden from consumers. In \nthe same manner that the FDA alerts purchasers to the presence of \nallergens, the FDA has the ability to inform consumers of the use of \nfood irradiation. I also want to emphasize that this modest labeling \nimprovement does not diminish the need for the FDA, USDA, the food \nindustry, and consumer groups to work together to improve the public's \nunderstanding of how food irradiation works and its potential benefits \nto public health.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the inclusion of these amendments in S. \n830 demonstrates the U.S. Senate's interest in food safety and \neffective labeling. Again, I greatly appreciate the consideration that \nthe chairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources have given to these targeted food labeling reforms.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n        [From the New England Journal of Medicine, May 29, 1997]\n\n         Cyclosporiasis and Raspberries--Lessons for the Future\n\n                       (By Michael T. Osterholm)\n\n       One hundred years ago, Osler observed that to know syphilis \n     was to know clinical medicine. Today, to know and appreciate \n     the many clinical, microbiologic, and public health aspects \n     of the outbreak of cyclosporiasis associated with raspberries \n     that Herwaldt and colleagues describe in this issue of the \n     Journal \\1\\ is to know foodborne disease in the modern world. \n     The investigation conducted by Herwaldt et al. illustrates \n     the changing epidemiologic characteristics of foodborne \n     disease in this country.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Two of the key factors that have contributed to these \n     changes are the substantial alterations in the American diet \n     over the past two decades and the globalization of the food \n     supply.\\2\\ Although the promotion of a ``heart-healthy'' diet \n     (high consumption of fruits and vegetables and low \n     consumption of fat) may be improving cardiovascular health, \n     it has led to a new range of problems for the \n     gastrointestinal tract. Infectious-disease specialists \n     frequently remind persons traveling to developing countries \n     to reduce the risk of traveler's diarrhea by eating only \n     foods that can be boiled or peeled. Yet seasonally, up to 70 \n     percent of selected fruits and vegetables consumed in this \n     country come from developing countries. One does not need to \n     leave home to contract traveler's diarrhea caused by an \n     exotic agent. Although produce from U.S. growers is also a \n     source of pathogens, fruits and vegetables from developing \n     countries are cause for additional concern. Many developing \n     countries are just entering the global produce market. The \n     first raspberry vine was planted in Guatemala in 1987, yet \n     approximately 20 percent of all fresh raspberries sold in May \n     1996 in the United States came from Guatemala.\n       Emerging or reemerging infectious agents are another factor \n     associated with the changing epidemiologic characteristics of \n     foodborne disease. Cyclospora cavetanensis is such an agent. \n     When an emerging foodborne agent is first recognized, there \n     are typically many unanswered questions about the \n     epidemiologic characteristics of the infection and its \n     prevention. Furthermore, clinicians need to be aware of the \n     clinical presentations associated with new agents. For \n     example, a patient presenting with a diarrheal illness of \n     five or more days' duration, severe fatigue, and loss of \n     appetite should be evaluated for cyclosporiasis regardless of \n     whether the patient has traveled to a foreign country or \n     consumed contaminated water. Clinical laboratories now need \n     to be proficient at performing routine examinations for a \n     wide variety of emerging agents. Moreover, public health \n     officials need to be aware of the importance of initiating \n     and maintaining population-based surveillance for these types \n     of agents. Today, the resources for conducting surveillance \n     are severely limited at the state and local levels.\n       A serious problem posed by new agents such as C. \n     cayetanensis is our lack of understanding of their biology. \n     Herwaldt et al. emphasize the potential role of contaminated \n     water. However, there appears to have been only limited \n     consideration of the role that birds or other animals may \n     have had in contaminating the berries. Recent evidence \n     suggests that eimeria, a recognized coccidial parasite in \n     birds, may be very similar to C. cayetanensis, if not the \n     same agent.3,}}4 Eimeria has long been recognized \n     as an important cause of diarrheal disease in birds. \n     Consumption of berries by birds is a major cause of crop loss \n     and results in frequent contamination of the berries. The use \n     of high-quality water for irrigation and pesticide spraying \n     and other good management practices will not solve the \n     problem of C. cayetanensis contamination if birds play a \n     major part in that contamination. A similar outbreak of \n     cyclosporiasis in Florida during the spring of 1995 was only \n     later recognized as likely to be associated with Guatemalan \n     raspberries. Yet no outbreaks were documented in association \n     with the fall harvest and shipment of Guatemalan raspberries \n     in 1995 or 1996. The season migration of wild birds in \n     Guatemala needs to be evaluated as a possible explanation for \n     the patterns seen with berry shipments and outbreaks of \n     disease in the United States. One test of this hypothesis \n     will be whether there is another outbreak of cyclosporiasis \n     associated with this year's spring shipment of raspberries \n     from Guatemala.\n       I believe that one of the unfortunate lessons of the \n     outbreak in the spring of 1996 came from public announcement \n     of the apparent association between a product and an illness \n     without sufficient epidemiologic evidence. The implications \n     of this lesson reach far into the future. When an outbreak \n     occurs, public health agencies are often under pressure to \n     act quickly. The public has come not only to expect a quick \n     response but also to demand it. The Texas Department of \n     Health and the Houston Department of Health and Human \n     Services investigated a cluster of cases of cyclosporiasis \n     among 20 participants at a May 9, 1996, conference in \n     Houston. On June 8, these agencies issued a press release \n     summarizing the results of their epidemiologic investigation. \n     In that announcement, they concluded that the consumption of \n     fresh California strawberries was associated with the \n     illness. The need to warn the public is legitimate, but it \n     must be weighted carefully against the possibility of being \n     wrong, which will result in economic loss for the falsely \n     accused industry, as well as weaken the confidence of both \n     industry and the public in future public health warnings. \n     Confusion about the actual cause of this outbreak persisted \n     for more than six weeks, until additional epidemilogic \n     studies conducted by state and local public health agencies, \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and health \n     officials in Canada concluded that raspberries from \n     Guatemala were the source of the outbreak.\\5\\\n       We need to establish well-defined criteria for evaluating \n     the quality of epidemiologic data from investigations of \n     outbreaks, particularly when the etiologic agent is not \n     readily isolated from the implicated food product. \n     Furthermore, when a widely distributed product is implicated \n     in an outbreak, we must ensure that before public \n     announcements are made, all available epidemiologic and \n     microbiologic evidence and information on product \n     distribution are reviewed quickly and that the conclusion is \n     supported by federal, state, and local experts in foodborne \n     disease.\n       On January 25, 1997, President Bill Clinton announced an \n     important new initiative to improve the safety of the \n     nation's food supply, including improvements in our ability \n     to detect foodborne outbreaks and coordination of the local, \n     state, and federal responses. However, we already have the \n     means of virtually eliminating the problem of cyclosporiasis \n     associated with fruit and vegetable consumption--namely, \n     irradiation. The use of ionizing radiation for food \n     pasteurization has been extensively evaluated and is \n     supported by the World Health Organization, the Food and \n     Agriculture Organization, the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency, and various other international agencies,\n\n[[Page S9826]]\n\n     scientists, and government officials.\\6\\ Irradiation provides \n     the greatest likelihood of substantially reducing bacterial \n     and parasitic causes of foodborne disease associated with \n     numerous foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables. \n     However, the food industry remains reluctant to use this \n     technique out of fear of incurring the wrath of activist \n     groups that wrongly proclaim that irradiation is unsafe or \n     seriously compromises the quality of the food product. The \n     time has come to use irradiation; we must not let any group \n     use arguments without a scientific basis to keep such an \n     important technique from the marketplace. This may be the \n     most crucial lesson to be learned from the story of \n     cyclosporiasis and imported raspberries.\n\n\n                          footnote references\n\n       \\1\\ Herwaldt BL, Ackers M-L, Cyclospora Working Group.

Mitch McConnell,\n     Committee on Labor and Human Resources, U.S. Senate, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: We are writing to advise you of our \n     enthusiastic support for an amendment you may offer to FDA \n     Reform legislation regarding labeling of food products under \n     the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. We understand that \n     your amendment is intended to remove labeling impediments \n     that discourage consumer acceptance of irradiation as a \n     technology designed to strengthen food safety and expand the \n     availability of safe and affordable food products.\n       Irradiation is a simple and inexpensive process used since \n     the 1950s to kill harmful pathogens in many foods, but is \n     rarely used today because of FDA's label disclosure \n     requirements. Irradiated food products must prominently bear \n     the international ``radura'' symbol and the phrase ``treated \n     with radiation'' or ``treated by irradiation.'' These bold \n     labeling requirements more prominent than required warning \n     statements, render the foods virtually unmarketable. Again, \n     we understand that your amendment would require irradiated \n     foods to bear an appropriate disclosure requirement, but \n     specifies that the disclosure need not be more prominent than \n     the ingredient statement. In this way, concerned Americans \n     may be assured that food that has been irradiated will be \n     marked as such but the prominence of disclosure will not be \n     so bold as to create the false impression that the \n     irradiation statement is a warning. Broader use of \n     irradiation and other pathogen-reducing technologies promises \n     a significant step forward in further improving food safety.\n       We enthusiastically support your irradiation prominence-of-\n     disclosure amendment. It would provide for labeling policies \n     that encourage the use of FDA-approved food safety and \n     agricultural production technologies.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Farm Bureau Federation, American Feed Industry \n           Association, American Meat Institute, Animal Health \n           Institute, Apple Processors Association, Chocolate \n           Manufacturers Association, Florida Fruit And Vegetable \n           Association, Food Distributors International, Institute \n           of Food Technologists, Millers' National Federation, \n           National Cattlemen's Beef Association, National \n           Confectioners' Association, National Fisheries \n           Institute, National Food Processors Association, \n           National Meat Association, National Pork Producers \n           Council, National Turkey Federation, Northwest \n           Horticulture Association, Produce Marketing \n           Association, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, United Egg \n           Producers, United Egg Association, United Fresh Fruit & \n           Vegetable Association, and Western Growers Association.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 30 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I will just review quickly the work that was done by \nthe committee.\n  As I outlined earlier, there were 20 major proposals that were made \nby the Secretary in June. We have addressed 19 of those. The one \nremaining proposal we have not addressed is the one that brought about \nthe Reed-Kennedy amendment which was defeated yesterday, and the one \nwhich virtually all of the consumer groups feel ought to be altered and \nchanged before we get to final resolution and passage of this \nlegislation.\n  I reviewed some of the other provisions and the changes that were \nmade as a result of bipartisan efforts, which I think are important and \nsignificant improvements, and also provide additional kinds of \nprotection.\n  I mentioned the fast tracking of the various products, and the \nability of individuals who do not have expanded access to drugs still \nunder investigation for patients who have no alternatives, the \ninclusions of the Snowe-Feinstein bill that will help to expand \nopportunities by using the NIH database, and some of the streamlining \nof the FDA procedures.\n  I will mention just a final few.\n  One concerned the improved consultation between manufacturers and the \nFDA. Prior to this provision, if there were any changes being \nimplemented by manufacturers with these medical devices, they had to be \ncleared.\n  We have changed that so that manufacturers can make adjustments and \nchanges that are not going to affect issues of safety in order to make \ntheir production more efficient. But we also have some protections for \nsafety included in there.\n  The environmental issues. The original bill would have eliminated all \nthe environmental impact statements from FDA applications. I didn't \nthink that was what we were doing when we were extending PDUFA. We made \nadjustments and changes on that to ensure that those environmental \nimpact statements will be preserved.\n  The strengthening of the safety protections of the various medical \ndevices. FDA will still require device manufacturers to file \nsupplemental applications when they are making changes that affect \nsafety and effectiveness of the devices, but we have made efforts to \nstreamline that provision.\n  The tracking of various devices after approval. Under the initial \nbill, there was a termination of tracking of medical devices. We had a \ngood debate on this. I thought the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] \nmade a strong case for continuing postmarketing surveillance of medical \ndevices. We have now compromised and said that we permit the FDA to \nmake the judgment. We have found that a principal reason for \npostmarketing surveillance was a safety factor, a belief that if you \ntrack the various medical devices and are able to get information that \nshows that those medical devices may pose a danger to the people, you \nshould be able to notify others who might have used a similar kind of \ndevice to give those individuals protections as well.\n  Initially it was thought that by having that kind of review, you \ncould advance these medical devices because you are going to have a \npretty good evaluation of those medical devices as they affect people \nby having tracking mechanisms rather than just attempting to evaluate \nsafety and effectiveness prior to the time that the medical devices are \nactually utilized. So it was an attempt to speed up the process that \nthe tracking provisions were put into effect initially. Now they are \nenormously important because if we find out that people do have adverse \nimpacts from these medical devices--and we have tracking mechanisms--we \ncan protect not only those individuals but also others who might have \nthe same kind of device implanted in them.\n  We worked out a compromise, and I think the public interest is \nprotected. It would not have been if we had not worked it out.\n  The tightening of the process for FDA approval of medical devices. We \nhave 180 days for these devices. What we are saying is at the end of \n100 days the FDA indicates the deficiencies in those devices but still \nhas 180 days to be able to make a final judgment. But it does give an \nearlier indication to the medical device manufacturer about the \npotential problems that they are going to face.\n  Recordkeeping by distributors of devices. In the initial bill, they \nwiped out all of that information. So if there was an adverse impact \nfrom the medical device, the distributors would not have collected the \ninformation and the FDA\n\n[[Page S9827]]\n\nwould not know about it. What we have done is maintained that the \ndistributors have to keep the information which they have with regard \nto adverse impacts from devices. They do not have to report it to the \nFDA, but they have to keep it. And then if there is some kind of \nindication about adverse impact, the FDA will be able to pursue it. It \nsaves a good deal of paperwork. And, it still adequately protects the \npublic.\n  We have made many changes in a bipartisan effort to improve and \nstrengthen the bill. We have safety standards for drugs to ensure that \nthe alternative use of a drug is going to meet high safety standards. \nThat is an improvement.\n  Health care economic information. When pharmaceuticals are given or \nsold to health care organizations, there is going to be complete \ninformation given in terms of alternative treatments for individuals, \nand this is a very important element.\n  Health claims for food products. In the initial proposal, this \nlegislation which was to extend the PDUFA to ensure \nfaster consideration of pharmaceutical drugs, was effectively going to \neliminate any FDA rule on health claims for food products. There was an \nexample where the industry was leaning on us again in order to \nundermine the kind of information that would be given to consumers on \nthese various food products, the health claims.\n\n  I was around here in the late 1980's when we passed the legislation \nwith regard to food labeling to make sure that the consumer was going \nto have the right information as to the health assets a particular food \nmight provide, and our committee wanted to effectively eliminate those \nadvances. We were able to maintain them. I think that was important. \nThose are some of the items. And in each and every instance, the public \nhealth was enhanced, with the exception of one--404. There is the \nrecord. I could have taken more time and gone into greater detail. And \nthere can be no review of any of those 19 that would bring one to a \ndifferent conclusion except for the one that we are talking about here. \nThat is the only one that was brought out in the June 11 letter by the \nSecretary of HHS that said you have to address it because of the \ncompelling need to protect the public.\n  That is the one that every consumer group has said, why don't you \naddress that the way you did the other 19? You worked out bipartisan \nagreements on all of the other 19 proposals and enhanced the public \nprotection. Why can't you do it on this one?\n  Well, we have been unable to. But we still hear from some of our \ncolleagues about what a long process this has been, that we could have \npassed this in June, you would not have passed it without those health \nprotections. I think that we protected the public with the one \nexception--and that stands out.\n  We have gone over the FDA's impact on the lives of the consumers of \nthis country. How in so many different ways it impacts and affects our \nlives and how they have taken action in each and every one of those \ncircumstances to protect the public health. I have gone through in \ndetail about how the medical device industry is prospering. They have a \nmore positive attitude than they have ever had.\n  Now what they are going to do is restrict the protection of the \npublic health with this particular provision, and it is wrong. The \nissue is clear. Will medical devices be approved on the basis of false \nand misleading labels? All we needed was to add the words ``false and \nmisleading`' to the bill. This bill would have gone through \nunanimously. But we were defeated on the amendment that would have \nprohibited false or misleading labels. When our colleagues go back home \nand they are asked in their town halls, why were you for permitting \nmedical device companies to submit false information? I hope they have \na good answer, because I cannot think of one, not when the industry is \nmaking the progress it is making and is having record sales, and safety \nis still being protected.\n  Will dangerous medical devices that have not been tested for safety \nand effectiveness be foisted on the American people?\n  Will unscrupulous companies like U.S. Surgical Corp. be rewarded for \ndeceiving the FDA?\n  Will there be a higher value placed on the profits of the powerful \nthan the health of the American people?\n  Section 404 of the FDA bill requires the FDA to approve a medical \ndevice based on the use identified on the label submitted by the \nmanufacturer, even if that label is false or misleading. It prevents \nthe FDA from requiring the manufacturers show that their product is \nsafe and effective for the purpose for which it will be really used as \nopposed to the purpose falsely claimed on the label. It stands 20 years \nof progress toward safer and more effective medical devices on its \nhead.\n  Nothing better shows the need for the Reed-Kennedy amendment than the \nrecent history on the Advanced Breast Biopsy Instrumentation system \ndevice developed and marketed by the U.S. Surgical Corp. This attempt \nto mislead the FDA and foist an untested machine on women with breast \ncancer shows why it is critical that section 404 not be passed in its \ncurrent form.\n  The U.S. Surgical Corp. submitted their new machine to FDA for \napproval based on a label claim that it was to be used for biopsy of \nbreast tissue suspected of being malignant. This is a common procedure \nused in mammograms or other diagnostic techniques to identify \nsuspicious looking areas of the breast that may indicate malignant \ntumors. If the biopsy of a small piece of the suspicious material \nindicates a malignancy, surgery would normally follow to remove the \ncancerous tissue.\n  But U.S. Surgical's label claim was false. One of the models of the \nmachine was designed to excise a piece of tissue 50 times as large as \nprevious biopsy instruments--the size of a piece of hot dog as compared \nto the size of the tip of a lead pencil. It was clearly designed to be \nused to excise small tumors, not just to perform a biopsy. But the \nmachine was not tested to see whether it was safe and effective for \nthis purpose. The company was, in effect, proposing to subject women \nwith breast cancer to surgery with a machine that might have been less \neffective in treating their illness than existing therapies. It placed \nthe company's profits first and the patient's needs last.\n  Because FDA initially relied on U.S. Surgical's false and misleading \nlabel, the device was subjected only to an engineering review and was \ncleared for use on February 1, 1996. Had the product been honestly \nlabeled, FDA would have reviewed it using a multidisciplinary team and \nrequired the company to present genuine clinical data in support of the \napplication.\n  On March 29, 1996, the FDA obtained a copy of a promotional videotape \nthat U.S. Surgical was distributing to physicians to try to sell their \nproduct.\n  We have a copy of it right here, Mr. President, and the videotape \nclearly describes the device as appropriate for surgically removing \nsmall lumps of cancerous tissues. Let me quote some extracts from this \nslick production.\n\n       U.S. Surgical is entering a new millennium in breast \n     surgery by combining advanced stereotactic technology with \n     minimally invasive surgery.\n       Unlike needle biopsies where small samples of the lesion \n     are removed for pathological analysis, the ABBI system \n     removes the entire specimen.\n       If the specimen proves to be cancerous but pathology \n     reports the entire margin is clear, it is up to the clinical \n     judgment of the surgeon to decide to remove additional tissue \n     or if the procedure can be considered complete.\n       The ABBI system--\n\n  Which is the needle I referred to--\n\n     allows surgeons to provide the benefits of a minimally \n     invasive technique to breast surgery. . .. Benefits to the \n     patient include: Reduced physical and emotional trauma as a \n     woman undergoes only one versus two procedures.\n       Minimally invasive breast surgery. A new standard of \n     patient care offered only by United States Surgical Corp.\n\n  Here is their advertisement: ``The latest technique is minimally \ninvasive breast biopsy.''\n  And here is the language included in the videotape that says minimal \ninvasive breast surgery. And we heard out on the floor, well, U.S. \nSurgical Corp. did not have anything to do with promoting this. ``A new \nstandard of patient care offered by the United States Surgical Corp.''\n  It is clear that this company has designed this machine for breast \nsurgery, not just biopsy, and is promoting it for this use despite the \nfalse and misleading label submitted to the FDA.\n  Here is what a distinguished physician, Dr. Monica Morrow, professor \nof surgery at Northwestern University, had to say about the company's \nmachine:\n\n\n[[Page S9828]]\n\n\n       I am writing to express my feelings regarding the \n     importance of the FDA's mandate to evaluate ``behind the \n     label'' uses of devices and drugs.\n       The need for such evaluation is clearly exemplified by the \n     marketing strategy for the U.S. Surgical breast biopsy device \n     (ABBI). This device was approved for use as a diagnostic \n     instrument. However, the company video clearly depicts the \n     use of the device for definitive breast cancer therapy.\n       No clinical trials using the accepted techniques for \n     comparing cancer treatments have been conducted to validate \n     this claim, and without such trials, the device could \n     potentially pose a significant risk to patients. In addition, \n     other claims regarding improved cosmetic outcome and patient \n     acceptance are similarly unsubstantiated. The indications for \n     the uses of devices and drugs should be determined by \n     appropriate clinical and scientific data, and not by their \n     appeal as marketing gimmicks.\n       This video was dropped off in my office by a company \n     representative as part of an effort to interest me in \n     purchasing this equipment.\n\n  When the FDA became aware that the company was promoting the device \nfor this unauthorized purpose, it also became aware that it had made a \nmistake in clearing a device that was clearly designed for a purpose \nnot stated on the label--tumor removal--without adequate clinical \ntesting. The FDA then acted to require the company to include a strong \ncautionary label that the device was only to be used for tissue \nsampling, not tumor excision. And it required it to submit clinical \ndata on its use for the original claimed purpose of biopsy. Based on \nthis revised label and the new clinical data, the FDA recleared the \nmachine for breast biopsy on September 24, 1996.\n  And it further required the company to conduct studies on the safety \nand effectiveness of the machine for tumor removal, studies which are \nongoing.\n  Evidently the company sees its potential now, and now is doing the \nstudies which it didn't do before on the removal of the breast. Now \nthey are doing it, after the FDA caught them promoting this device for \nthat purpose.\n  We have listened out here, ``This is just another machine. This is \njust another biopsy machine.'' And we find the clearest example of a \ncase where it gets approved for one purpose, it is promoted and used \nfor another purpose. When it is caught by the FDA, they did submit \nadditional clinical information for the removal of breast--and they are \ndoing it now. They didn't say, Tumor removal? We never thought we were \ngoing to use it for tumor removal. Why is the FDA suggesting that we \nhad ever intended to use it for that, but, OK, there is an idea, we \nwill go out and conduct the clinical studies.\n  Let's be realistic here, they had intended to use it for an \nalternative use. They promoted it for an alternative use. And they \nnever supplied the FDA with the safety information on that alternative \nuse.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, U.S. Surgical's public response to this \nsorry record of profiteering at public expense is a disgraceful attempt \nto avoid responsibility for its unacceptable behavior. It claimed it \nhad not produced the video--even though the video carries the company \nlog and it is impossible to watch it without it being clear that the \ncompany paid for it, produced it, and wrote the script.\n  It claimed that it had not distributed the video, even though there \nis no reason to produce a promotional video except to distribute it, \nand even though Dr. Morrow has written that the video was delivered to \nher office by a company representative trying to convince her to buy \nthe U.S. Surgical machine. And, according to the Associated press, a \ncompany spokesman said that ``the label * * * makes clear that the \nbiopsy divice is `to be used only for diagnostic breast biopsy and is \nnot a therapeutic device.' '' But as the history of this machine makes \nclear, that clear disclaimer is only on the label because the FDA \nstepped in and stopped the company from its illegal promotional \nefforts.\n  If section 404 is passed in its current form, the FDA will be \nhandcuffed in its efforts to protect the public against untested and \npotentially harmful--even fatal--devices. Under current law, the FDA is \nable to require that the company develop data to show that the new \ndevice was safe and effective for removing tumors--the real use \nintended by the company, not the false and misleading use submitted on \ntheir proposed label. When the FDA made a mistake and inappropriately \ncleared the device, it had the authority to go back to the company and \nwarn that it would revoke their approval unless adequate warnings were \nplaced on the label and necessary clinical testing was performed.\n  But under section 404 of the FDA reform bill, the FDA would be forced \nto approve the new device without such evidence. Unscrupulous companies \nwill not only be allowed but encouraged to submit misleading labels, \nbecause they will gain a competitive advantage over companies that play \nby the rules.\n  American women do not want to die from breast cancer because \ncompanies are allowed to sell devices that may be unsafe and \nineffective. No Senator would want their own wife or mother or daughter \nto be subjected to such an untested device, solely because a greedy \ncompany wanted higher profits.\n  Supporters of this measure claim that FDA will still have the power \nto require that dangerous devices be shown to be safe and effective \nbefore they are sold. They point to the language of the statute that \nsays a device approved as substantially equivalent must meet two tests. \nFirst, it must have the same intended use as the predecessor device. \nSecond, ``the information submitted that the device is substantially \nequivalent to the predicate device contains information, including \nclinical information if deemed necessary by the Secretary, that \ndemonstrates that the device is safe and effective as a legally \nmarketed device, and does not raise different questions of safety and \nefficacy that the predicate product.''\n  What their argument ignores is the first part of the test--the \nintended use test. Today, the FDA can look at the device and say, from \nthe technical characteristics of the product, that it is obvious that \nit has been redesigned so that it is primarily for a different use than \nthe older device. But under the amendment, they would be barred from \ndoing this. They would be forced to accept the manufacturer's word as \nto the intended use of the device--even if that label were false and \nmisleading, even if the manufacturer was lying. That is what happened \nwith U.S. Surgical and the biopsy machine that was really designed to \ntreat breast cancer. Under the current law, FDA could require that U.S. \nSurgical show their device was safe and effective for treating breast \ncancer. Under the amendment, they could not.\n  This is not just my opinion. It is the reason that the administration \nhas singled out this provision as possible grounds for a veto. It is \nthe reason it is opposed by a broad coalition of consumer and public \nhealth groups. It is obvious that the only reason that the proponents \nof this provision are not willing to compromise is that they want to \nhamstring the FDA for the benefit of the industry. How else can they \npossible justify requiring FDA to evaluate a device based on a false \nand misleading label.\n  If allowed to stand, this provision will give unscrupulous companies \na license to lie to the FDA. It will penalize ethical companies who are \ntruthful and do the necessary testing to prove that their products are \nsafe and effective.\n  Most of all, it will put the health of America people at risk so that \na greedy few may profit.\n  The issue goes far beyond products to excise breast cancer. If \napplies to lasers to treat prostate disease, stents to place in carotid \narteries, imaging systems to detect breast cancer, and a host of other \ntreatment for dread diseases.\n  A few days ago, the public was made aware of the tragedy that \nresulted from the use of diet drugs in ways that had not been approved \nby the FDA as safe and effective. This so-called off-label use of \nfenphen may well have caused serious and irreversible heart damage in \ntens of thousands of women who thought the drugs were safe.\n  The legislation before us would actually encourage the use of off-\nlabel, unapproved uses of medical devices. It can fairly be called the \nfen-phen device provision.\n  It is shocking that this shameful provision has been so cavalierly \nincluded in this bill. It is incomprehensible that reputable device \nmanufactures are not prepared to support a compromise that allows the \nFDA to look behind labels that are false or misleading.\n\n[[Page S9829]]\n\n  Medical devices can heal, but they can also main and kill. The \nhistory of medical devices is full of stories of unnecessary death and \nsuffering.\n  But thanks to the authority the FDA now has, there are also many \nstories of lives saved by the vigilance of the FDA. What is \nincomprehensive about the bill before us is that it would take \nbackward--in the direction of less protection of public health rather \nthan more. The whole history of device regulation has been to provide \nthe public greater protections.\n  Two decades ago, the Dalkon shield disaster led to the passage of a \nlaw giving the FDA greater authority over medical devices. At the time, \nthis birth control device went on the market, the FDA has no authority \nto require manufacturers to show that devices are safe and effective \nbefore they are sold. In 1974, an FDA advisory committee recommended \nthat the Dalkon shield be taken off the market--after almost 3 million \nwomen had used it.\n  The device was found to cause septic abortions and pelvic \ninflammatory disease. Hundreds of women had become sterile, and many \nrequired hysterectomies. According to the manufacturer's own estimates, \n90,000 women in the United States alone were injured. The manufacturer, \nA.H. Robbins, refused to halt distribution of the device, even though \nthe FDA requested it, while the issue was reviewed by the advisory \ncommittee.\n  The Shiley heart valve disaster was so serious that it led to the \nenactment of further legislation. This mechanical heart valve was \napproved in 1979. It was developed by the Shiley Co. the Shiley Co. was \nsubsequently sold to Pfizer, which continued marketing the value. It \nwas taken off the market in 1986 because of its high-breakage rate.\n  By that time, as many as 30,000 of these devices had been implanted \nin heart patients in the United States. One hundred and ninety-five \nvalves broke and 130 patients died. Thousands of other patients who had \nthe defective valves in their hearts had to make an impossible choice--\nbetween undergoing a new operation to remove the device, or living with \nthe knowledge that they had a dangerous device in their heart that \ncould rupture and kill them at any moment. Depositions taken from \ncompany employees indicated that cracks in defective valves may have \nbeen concealed from customers.\n  Before the defective valve was withdrawn, the manufacturer had tried \nto introduce a new version with a 70 degree tilt instead of the 60 \ndegree tilt approved by the FDA.\n  The increased tilt was intended to improve blood flow and reduce the \nrisk of clotting. The FDA's review found that the greater tilt \nincreased the likelihood of metal fatigue and valve breakage, and the \nnew version was not approved for use in the United States. Four \nthousand of the new devices were implanted in Europe. The failure rate \nwas six times higher than for the earlier valve--causing at least 150 \ndeaths.\n  In another example of a human and public health tragedy involving a \nmedical device, the firm Telectronics marketed a pacemaker wire for use \nin the heart.\n  Twenty-five thousand of these pacemakers were marketed, beginning in \n1994, before it was discovered that the wire could break, cause damage \nto the wall of the heart, or even destroy the aorta.\n  Another device disaster is toxic shock syndrome from superabsorbent \ntampons. Most women would not think that a tampon could kill them or a \nchange as minor as increasing the absorbency of the material used could \nhave life-threatening consequences. About 5 percent of toxic shock \nsyndrome cases are fatal. As a result of this problem FDA began \nrequiring testing of the absorbency of all types of tampons. Women \ndeserve protection. FDA should be strengthened, not crippled.\n  The case of artificial jaw joints--referred to as TMJ devices--are \nanother tragedy that devastated tens of thousands of patients, mostly \nwomen. These devices were implanted to assist patients with arthritic \ndegeneration of the jaw joint, most with relatively mild discomfort. \nBut the impact of the new joints, sold by a company called Vitek, was \ncatastrophic. The new joints often disintegrated, leaving the victims \ndisfigured and in constant, severe pain. To make matters worse, Vitek \nrefused to notify surgeons of the problems with the joints, and FDA had \nto get a court order to stop distribution of the product. Similar \nproblems were experienced with Dow Corning silicone jaw implants.\n  In yet another example, the FDA was able to block a device that \ninvolved a plastic lens implanted in the eye to treat nearsightedness. \nThe device was widely marketed in France, but the FDA refused to \napprove it for use in the United States. Long-term use of the device \nwas later shown to cause damage to the cornea, with possible blindness.\n  The angioplasty catheter marketed by the Bard Corp. turned out to be \na dangerous device that the company sold with a reckless disregard for \nboth the law and public health. The device was modified several times \nby the corporation without telling the FDA in advance, as required by \nthe law. The company was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to 391 counts in \nthe indictment, including mail fraud and lying to the Government.\n  Thirty-three cases of breakage occurred in a 2-month period, leading \nto serious cardiac damage, emergency coronary bypass surgery, and even \ndeath.\n  Devices as simple as patient restraints used in nursing homes and \nhospitals have been implicated in 231 injuries, including 128 deaths.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  These tragedies resulted in expanded powers for the FDA to protect \nthe public against dangerous devices and greater vigilance on the part \nof the agency. But this bill steps backward by forcing the FDA to try \nto protect the public with one hand tied behind its back.\n  This bill actually forces the FDA to approve devices based on false \nand misleading labels.\n  Under the provision, the FDA cannot look behind the manufacturer's \nproposed use to demand appropriate safety and effectiveness data, even \nif it is obvious that the device has been designed for an altogether \ndifferent use than the manufacturer claims. I have already discussed \nthe dangers of a breast cancer biopsy needle that would have been used \nto treat breast cancer without adequate evidence that it was effective. \nThere are many other examples of the kind of dangerous devices that \ncould be foisted on the American public, if the provision of the bill \nallowing false and misleading labels is allowed to stand.\n  Surgical lasers are increasingly used for general cutting, in place \nof traditional instruments such as scalpels. In a recent case, a \nmanufacturer called Trimedyne adapted the laser in a way that indicated \nit was clearly intended for prostate surgery. But it submitted an \napplication to the FDA saying that the laser was only intended for \ngeneral cutting. The label was clearly false, and the FDA was able to \nrequire adequate safety data before the product was allowed on the \nmarket. But under this bill, the FDA would be forced to approve the \nproduct, without requiring evidence that the device is safe and \neffective for prostate surgery.\n  Prostate surgery is a very common procedure affecting tens of \nthousands, if not hundreds of thousands of older men.\n  Failed surgery can result in permanent incontinence and other \ndevastating side effects. Do we really want surgical tools to be used \nto treat this common illness that may not be safe and effective? If \nthis legislation passes unchanged, that is exactly the risk that large \nnumbers of patients needing prostate surgery could face.\n  A further example involves digital mammography, an imaging technology \nthat is becoming an alternative to conventional film mammography. The \nnew device is approved for better diagnostic imaging of a potentially \ncancerous lump in the breast that has already been detected. But it is \nnot known whether the new machine can be used effectively in screening \nfor breast cancer when there are no symptoms.\n  Under this bill, if a manufacturer seeks approval for a digital \nmammography machine that is clearly designed for breast cancer \nscreening, not just for diagnosis, the FDA would be prohibited from \nrequiring data to show that the machine is effective for screening. \nDoes the Senate really want to support legislation that could result in \nwomen dying needlessly from undetected breast cancer? That is what this \ndevice provision could cause.\n\n[[Page S9830]]\n\n  Another example involves the large number of patients who have \nsuffered serious fractures and who benefit from orthopedic implants \nthat help the broken bones to heal. In some cases, these implants are \ndesigned to be removed after the healing is complete. In other cases, \nto avoid further surgery or to strengthen the bone, the implants are \nleft in place.\n  Under this legislation, a manufacturer of plates and screws approved \nfor short-term use could modify them in a way that clearly shows they \nare intended for long-term use. The FDA would be prohibited by this \nbill from looking behind the false and deceptive label and requiring \nthe manufacturer to show that the device will not degenerate or weaken \nthe bone during long-term use.\n  Pedicle screws are a clear example of just such behavior by \nmanufacturers. Originally designed to hold long bones in place after a \nfracture, they were modified by the manufacturer so that they could be \nused to make the spine more rigid, with the goal of reducing painful \nback problems. But the many manufacturers of these screws did not \npresent safety and effectiveness data to the FDA for this new use.\n  The result: the screws sometimes broke and sometimes caused spinal \nfractures. Reoperation rates ranged from 14 to 52 percent--and patients \nsuffered permanent pain and disability. This is exactly the kind of \nunethical behavior by manufacturers that this bill encourages.\n  Other examples in the way that this provision could allow unsafe and \nineffective devices abound. A stent designed to open the bile duct for \ngallstones could be modified in a way that clearly was designed to make \nit a treatment for blockages of the carotid artery. Without adequate \ntesting, it could put patients at risk of stroke or death. But under \nthis bill, the FDA would be prohibited from looking behind the label to \nthe actual intended use of the device.\n  Still another example involves contact lenses, which can be approved \nfor either short- or long-term wear. Extended wear contact lenses can \nbe left in the eye overnight, and sometimes are worn for weeks. Under \nthis bill, a manufacturer could take contact lenses approved for short-\nterm wear, and modify them in a way clearly intended for long-term \nwear. The FDA would have to approve the modified lenses based on the \nfalse and misleading label for short-term use. Unsuspecting patients \ncould suffer corneal ulcers and even blindness.\n  The vast majority of medical device manufacturers meet high-ethical \nstandards. Most devices are fully tested and evaluated by the FDA \nbefore they are marketed.\n  But as many examples make clear, if the FDA does not have adequate \nauthority to protect innocent patients, the result can be unnecessary \ndeath and injury to patients across the country. There is no \njustification--none whatever--for Congress to force the FDA to approve \ndevices with false or misleading labels. And there is certainly no \njustification for giving a competitive advantage to unscrupulous \ncompanies who will exploit this gaping loophole in the law.\n  Companies that hope to benefit by weakening the FDA are powerful and \nprofitable. They believe they have the votes to push this disgraceful \nprovision through the U.S. Senate. Today, they probably do have the \nvotes.\n  But if the American people truly understand what is at stake, I do \nnot believe they will permit this dangerous provision to become law. \nWhen the vote comes on Tuesday, we will see how many Senators are \nwilling to stand with the American people--and how many are willing to \nvote in favor of false and misleading labeling.\n  The legislation we are considering has many constructive elements. \nBut it does not deserve to go forward unless this disgraceful provision \nis removed. False or misleading labels should have no place in approval \nof medical devices. Unscrupulous manufacturers do not deserve a free \nride at the expense of public health.\n  I intend to continue to fight to modify this provision so that public \nhealth can be protected, and I believe that we will ultimately be able \nto reach a compromise that will not sacrifice the public interest to \nthe profits of greedy manufacturers. We have been successful in \nassuring that every other objectionable provision of this bill has been \nmodified so that the public health is protected. This provision must be \nchanged as well.\n  Here are some significant advances in the FDA bill and compromises \nworked out on S. 830 since the committee markup on June 18.\n  First, preserving State oversight of safety of cosmetics. This \ncompromise assured that the States will be able to continue to regulate \nthe safety of cosmetic products. The Gregg proposal in the underlying \nbill would have barred States from any regulation whatsoever of \ncosmetics, even though the FDA has neither the authority nor the staff \nto regulate these products. The compromise allows States to continue \ntheir regulation unless a specific inconsistent regulation has been \nissued by the FDA in a particular area.\n  Second, safeguards for off-label use of drugs. This important \ncompromise will allow companies to circulate reputable journal articles \nabout off-label use of drugs but will ultimately enhance the public \nhealth and safety because the FDA will be given the opportunity to \nreview, comment on, and approve articles which the companies will \ncirculate. The compromise also requires companies to undertake studies \non the safety of their drugs for the specific off-label use and submit \napplications to the FDA for approval of their drugs for these uses \nwithin 3 years. Currently, companies are circulating articles without \nreviewing them for off-label use without seeking review or approval by \nthe FDA and are also never conducting the studies which would lead to \nultimate FDA approval or disapproval of the drug.\n  Third, expanding access to drugs for patients and fast track \napproval:\n  Fast track approval. This is one of the most important new \ninitiatives in the legislation. Fast track approval will provide the \nsame streamlined availability for drug treatments for patients with any \nlife-threatening disease now available only to patients with cancer or \nAIDS.\n  Expanded access to drugs still under investigation for patients who \nhave no other alternatives. The compromise combines protections for \npatients with expanded access to new investigational therapies, without \nexposing patients to unreasonable risks.\n  Providing access for patients to information about clinical trials \nfor serious or life-threatening diseases. This compromise will assure \nthat patients suffering from serious or life-threatening diseases will \nhave available to them information about ongoing clinical trials \nrelating to these diseases.\n  Fourth, streamlining FDA procedures. In order to expedite some \nproduct reviews, the compromise authorizes the Secretary to contract \nout to third-party reviewers when it will improve timeliness, but not \nwhen it will reduce quality. For medical devices, the compromise \nestablishes in law an already existing pilot program for reviewing \ndevices by outside third parties. The compromise limits the review only \nto low-risk class I devices and specifically excludes higher risk \ndevices that are life-sustaining or if the device was not shown to be \nappropriate could cause substantial impairment to human health. The FDA \nwill not have to expend resources on unnecessary reports which may be \nduplicative of other reports already required to be filed by the \nagency.\n  Fifth, improved consultation between manufacturers and FDA. The \ncompromise increases the requirements on the FDA to consult with device \nmanufacturers and specifically to work toward achieving agreement on \nwhat set of data needs to be provided by the device manufacturer before \napproval can be granted. In addition, the device manufacturers are \nrequired to supply progress reports to the FDA, and in particular, \nreport significant deficiencies in the device which have developed \nduring the review period.\n  Sixth, environmental issues. The original bill would have eliminated \nenvironmental impact statements from FDA applications. The compromise \nensures that the bill does not undermine environmental protections \nprovided by the Environmental Protection Act.\n  Seventh, strengthening safety protections of medical devices:\n  Safety and effectiveness of devices. The FDA will still require \ndevice manufacturers to file supplemental applications when they are \nmaking changes to\n\n[[Page S9831]]\n\ntheir manufacturing procedures which may affect the safety and \neffectiveness of the devices.\n  Tracking of devices after approval. The compromise ensures that FDA \ncan require surveillance of products after they have been approved for \nas long as needed to protect the public health.\n  Tightening up the process for FDA approval of medical devices. The \nFDA will now be required to accept the classification made by the \nmanufacturer unless questions are raised within a specific period of \ntime. The compromise also tightens up timeframes within which the FDA \nmust make a final decision on a device application.\n  Recordkeeping by distributors of devices. The compromise requires \nlimited recordkeeping by device distributors so that patients using \ndevices will be readily identifiable if there is a health problem.\n  Eighth, other issues:\n  Safety standards for drugs. Supplemental applications for drug \napprovals need to meet the same safety standards as the original \napplication.\n  Health care economic information. Only valid and supportable health \neconomic claims may be made by drug manufacturers.\n  Health claims for food products. This compromise assures that the \nNutrition Labeling Act is not undercut or weakened, and that any health \nclaims by food manufacturers have to be substantiated.\n  Mr. President, we want to be able to give the FDA the authority, when \nit is clearly indicated as a result of the technological changes in \nthat medical device that an alternative use is intended, to look in \nbehind the proposal and examine the safety data that would indicate \nthat device is going to be safe, for the American public to be \nprotected.\n  That is the issue. We have had too many medical device tragedies in \nthis country. It has not been that long ago, whether it is the Dalkon \nshield or the Shiley heart valve, or even the adjustments in absorption \nlevel in tampons that produced toxic shock and resulted in the deaths \nof women--there have been too many medical device tragedies. We have \nbeen able to avoid them in recent times. The industry is doing well. We \nare having new breakthrough technologies.\n  We have reviewed 19 of the 20 key elements that have been raised by \nthose who have been most concerned about the safety and security of the \nAmerican people. We have addressed them and advanced the public's \ninterest in protecting the health of the American people with the \nexception of this provision.\n  It would be wrong and a major mistake to permit this legislation to \nbe passed without making that change.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe Senator from Indiana, who has been somewhat involved in this issue. \nI am sure he may have a few things to say.\n  Take as long as you like.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont. I have \nbeen listening carefully to the words of the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I have clearly come to the conclusion the only remaining \nproblem with the entire 215-page bill is section 404. We have had \nconsiderable debate about that yesterday and today. The Senator said \nthis is the last remaining piece. The Senator correctly pointed out, of \nthe 20 items that he was interested in, 19 have been resolved. That is \nan awfully good batting average, 19 out of 20. Yet the Senator says the \nbill cannot go forward until the last one is resolved.\n  We had a debate on this. The Senator passionately presented his case, \nbut it was not persuasive. Mr. President, 65 Members of the Senate did \nnot agree with the Senator from Massachusetts. We had the vote. That \nissue has been dispensed with. I know the Senator is upset that his \nview did not prevail, but it did not prevail, despite lengthy and \npassionate argument to the contrary.\n  But, putting that aside, I hope we can take the Senator at his word, \nthat this is the only part of the bill that remains of concern to him. \nI have word the FDA lobbyists are currently trying to work the House to \nundo the negotiations, some of the negotiations on some of those 19 \nitems. I trust the Senator, having acknowledged that those have been \nnegotiated fairly and addressed, would support us in maintaining the \nlanguage that is in the Senate bill when this bill goes to conference, \nand not encourage any kind of modification of that or weakening down of \nthat agreed-upon compromise.\n  I assume that means section 406 is satisfactory and there is nothing \nmore we need to do with it, based on the Senator's remarks. I am \npleased we can go forward on that basis.\n  I also heard the Senator say that basically everything is fine at \nFDA, that this revolution that has taken place under Dr. Kessler solved \nthe problem, admitting there were problems before but we really don't \nneed to do anything more. To quote him, he said, ``If it ain't broke, \ndon't fix it.'' FDA is improving as we speak. Everything is going fine \nat FDA.\n  The reason why we are here is that everything is not going fine at \nFDA. It has not for 20 years. We have been attempting to reform the \nprocess at FDA for the past 20 years and there are some reasons for \nthat. It is not fine because there clearly have been delays that have \nresulted in impaired health and safety of Americans.\n\n  You know, there are two edges to this sword. There are two sides to \nthis issue. One side is making sure that we have a Food and Drug \nAdministration that follows careful procedures before approving drugs \nand devices, because clearly that is in the best interests of the \nhealth and safety of Americans. There is no one on this floor, as \nSenator Dodd said yesterday, who does not want to maintain a vital FDA, \nwith the authority to review drugs and to review devices and to make \nsure, to the best of their ability, that those drugs and devices \npromote the health and promote the safety of Americans.\n  They will not always be perfect, as we have learned in this \ndiscussion. They make mistakes. Sometimes politicians lean on them to \napprove things that should not be approved and they approve them only \nto find out later that they should not have approved them. Maybe they \nshould not be subject to that political pressure. They should not. None \nof us, whether we are for or against a particular drug or device, \nshould be involved in the scientific process of approving or not \napproving a drug. But we can involve ourselves in requiring that the \nFDA do what is necessary to avoid the bureaucratic delays, avoid the \ninefficiencies, and make itself a more efficient administration. I will \ntalk about that in just a moment.\n  But let me talk about the other side of this issue. Let me talk about \nthe patients and the consumers, the Americans whose health and safety \nand whose lives have been jeopardized or lost because of inefficient \nFDA bureaucratic delays. We talk about those who have been impacted by \ndrugs that have been approved, in some people's view, too quickly. What \nabout those whose health and safety has been impaired and who have died \nbecause the drugs have not been approved quickly enough? A very \nprestigious institution, the Hudson Institution, has done a seminal \nstudy on that issue and put out a report in November of 1995 titled, \n``The Human Cost of Regulation. The Case of Medical Devices and the \nFDA.''\n  I hope my colleagues will read this to understand the other side of \nthe issue, the rest of the story. I will just quote briefly from it.\n\n       When policymakers weigh the costs and benefits of our \n     current policies governing the production of new medical \n     technologies, persons who die from the absence of a device \n     that should have been available should count as much as the \n     victims of a defective device.\n\n  We have heard a lot here about victims of defective devices, but we \nhave not heard very much about victims of devices that have been \nunnecessarily delayed that could have saved patients' lives, that could \nhave improved their safety.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield just for a question?\n  Mr. COATS. I will be happy to yield to the Senator for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What is the date of that particular study? I did refer \nto recent studies. I was just interested in the date.\n  Mr. COATS. November 1995. I will quote further:\n\n       Although these improvements are certainly laudable, they \n     are not worth the human costs of the FDA's approval system.\n\n[[Page S9832]]\n\n      Rather than protecting public safety, in some cases the \n     FDA's system for approving medical devices actually endangers \n     lives.\n\n  Let me cite some examples: Coronary stents. Coronary stents are \nsimply a wire mesh tube that holds the artery open to facilitate the \nflow of blood to the heart muscle. During angioplasty, which nearly \n400,000 Americans a year undergo, before the coronary stent was \ndeveloped 15 percent of patients undergoing that operation had a blood \nvessel collapse and had to go into emergency bypass surgery, which \nplaced them at greater risk, and a lot of lives were lost. The coronary \nstent, however, became an alternative method of treatment for most of \nthese patients and reduced dramatically the amount of collapsed blood \nvessels and dramatically the lives that were lost.\n  You would think that, given the importance of this technological \nbreakthrough, the FDA would have given expeditious handling to the \napplication for approval of the stent. Sadly, for thousands of \nAmericans who died when they could have benefited from this stent, this \nwas not the case. It took 9 months for the device's developers to \nobtain permission from the FDA to even begin preliminary phase I \nclinical trials. These trials took another year. Then the manufacturer \nconducted phase II trials for 9 months, and based on those results \nrequested immediate permission to begin the final phase III trials.\n  The FDA rejected this request. The manufacturer appealed and then \nagain requested permission to begin phase III trials. Three more months \nand the FDA came back and said no, you can't start. In the meantime, \nthe manufacturer had repeated a whole series of phase II trials again. \nFinally, 7 months later, the manufacturer completed the first segment \nof phase III after the FDA finally granted permission, and on and on it \nwent for another 15 months.\n  Four months later the FDA's advisory panel of medical experts said \nOK, we will issue the order granting approval--excuse me. They \nrecommended the order to grant approval. It then took the FDA 12 months \nto comply with their medical experts' request to order the approval of \nthe stent.\n  The Hudson Institute estimated the number of lives lost, and it is an \nestimate. But, based on a very thorough study, and it is all documented \nhere in this report, they estimated that the lag time attributable to \nthe FDA cost Americans 2,888 lives. That is the other side of the \nstory.\n  We hear about mistakes, and, yes, mistakes are made. We are all \nhumans after all. We hear about mistakes, and the Senator from \nMassachusetts has detailed and had his charts up about individual \npatients who have been injured, or had their health jeopardized through \nFDA approval of a product and then the fact that product was not \neverything that it was billed to be. But we have not heard anything \nsaid about the 2,888 patients who died because of FDA bureaucracy and \ninefficiency in approving a lifesaving medical device.\n  Let's assume that only 25 percent of that delay was due to FDA. We \nare still talking about 1,570 lives. That is the other side of the \nstory.\n  I could go on and on. The omnicarbon heart valve, the left \nventricular assist device, the heart transplant procedures, all of \nthese, just dealing with the heart--delays because of FDA inefficiency.\n  That is why the committee has been so insistent on moving forward \nwith reform. That is why the committee has said, no, everything is not \nfine at FDA. Yes, we appreciate the fact that they are doing a little \nbit better since they taxed the pharmaceutical industry to provide the \nfunds to hire the researchers to expedite the approval of drugs. But \nthey have not done better with devices.\n  The statements that the Senator has made were wrong. We have not had \nimprovement in the way that devices are handled. High-risk and novel \ndevice review times in 1995 increased from 348 days to 773 days; if you \ncount the days in FDA hands, 247 to 606. That is on average.\n  I could go over example after example. In fact, in the budget this \nyear, in responding to that, FDA said we are actually going to slow \ndown, we are actually going to have to slow down review times with \nrespect to device submissions. The agency itself predicted that they \nwould complete 6 percent fewer reviews but review them 20 percent \nslower. Part of that is our fault. We are not giving them the resources \nthat they need to speed up the process.\n  But there is another part of this story that we have not heard from \nthe Senator from Massachusetts. That is the testimony of the then-\nCommissioner of FDA, Dr. David Kessler. The Senator this morning said \nthat under the revolution that is taking place under the leadership of \nDr. Kessler, everything now is just hunky-dory.\n  Well, we had Dr. Kessler before our committee. Dr. Kessler did not \nsay everything was hunky-dory. Dr. Kessler did not say everything was \nfine. In fact, Dr. Kessler pretty much threw up his hands and said, ``I \ncan't control the agency. I can't administer this agency.'' In an \nastounding statement to Members of Congress, he said, ``It's only under \npressure from the Congress that we have been able to expedite and move \nthings here.'' He said, ``I'm at a loss to do this, but you keep the \npressure on.''\n  Well, if we listen to the Senator from Massachusetts, we would take \nthe pressure off. Then they probably would revert to the same old ways. \nIt is a bureaucracy that has not been administered well under the \nprevious Commissioner. Let us hope the current acting Commissioner or \nthe new Commissioner can do a lot better job than the previous \nCommissioner. The previous Commissioner seemed more intent on pursuing \na political agenda than he did in approving drugs and approving devices \nthat save the lives and improve the health of Americans.\n  To respond to a question from a Member of Congress, to make the \nstatement that, ``The only way we can improve is if you put pressure on \nus,'' probably explains the sudden rash of approvals that have come out \nof FDA. Why? Because we have a reform bill in the process. They have \ngotten the message. They have gotten the message that Congress will no \nlonger tolerate this delay.\n  They heard it not just from Republicans, not just from people who so-\ncalled represent the device industry or the pharmaceutical industry or \nthe business side, they have heard it from Republicans and Democrats, \nliberals and conservatives, people on both sides of the aisle.\n  How did we possibly get out of that Committee on Labor and Human \nResources, probably as divided philosophically as any committee in the \nU.S. Senate, how did we possibly get 14 out of 18 votes? We got it \nbecause liberals, Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, all came to \nthe same conclusion. The conclusion was: FDA needs reform, and it needs \nit now.\n\n  We have delayed several weeks here, and even months here, simply \ntrying to get this thing through the Congress. We have had two \nfilibusters. We have had untold procedural tricks and gimmicks, all \nperfectly within the rules but designed to delay the process. We have \nhad one objection after another.\n  It was not that long ago when the Senator from Massachusetts was down \non the floor saying, ``If we can just fix this cosmetic''--he had his \npictures up with problems with the cosmetic and food industry. ``That \ndoesn't go to the heart of the problem; the FDA's drugs and devices, \nthat part is fine. That part is settled. We just have to fix the \ncosmetic part.'' And so we said, ``OK. We'll fix it.'' And Senator \nGregg negotiated a compromise with the Senator from Massachusetts and \nthe Senators from California, and others, and we eliminated that \nconcern.\n  All of a sudden, when we were told that that is all we needed to do \nto move this forward, all of a sudden a new issue comes popping up, not \none that was offered by amendment in the committee. If it was the \nprimary, the No. 1 priority of the President and the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, you would have thought the Senator from \nMassachusetts or someone would have offered an amendment in committee. \nBut no, it was then the next thing to delay the bill, the next cause \nceleb, the next throw down the gauntlet, the next draw down the line in \nthe sand, the next ``we can't move forward,'' the next ``this bill is \ntotally worthless without a fix here.'' Fix 19 out of 20. Actually it \nwas 34. The Senator miscounted. Since markup--14-4--since markup, 30 \nsections of this 60-section bill have been altered. And 34 provisions--\nas I hold this here in my\n\n[[Page S9833]]\n\nhand--of negotiations trying to get the Senator to allow us to move \nforward with this bill.\n  The Wall Street Journal today in an op-ed piece calls this a timid \nbill. It has been watered down. It has been watered down substantially. \nA lot of us would have liked to have gone a lot farther than we have \nbeen able to go with this bill. We had provisions which would allow \noutside help for the agency, third-party accreditation. Only over the \nstrenuous objections and resistance of the Senator from Massachusetts \nwere we able to move forward with that.\n  Yet, the FDA had its own pilot program going on that. This is the \nmedical device equivalent of the PDUFA, of the user fee. Let us get \nsome outside help from accredited agencies that FDA certifies, not that \nDan Coats selects, not that some device company selects, but that FDA \nselects. We gave FDA the authority to go out and find scientific \nlaboratories and testing laboratories that met their standards and, \nunder their standards, would be able to assist them in the process of \nspeeding up the review time of devices. Then we built in all kinds of--\nall kinds of--FDA authority to select the companies, to make sure that \nthere was no conflict of interest, to oversee the process, to withdraw \nit at any time, to have a final veto over the approved product. Those \nare just some of them. I have five pages in this bill here of \naccredited party participation, restrictions that go to FDA to make \nsure that process is valid, to make sure it has integrity, to make sure \nit is not a loophole.\n  Here we are trying to do something that helps FDA, that helps speed \nthe approval of devices that can save lives and improve health. We give \nFDA all kinds of authority, and we still have to negotiate as if this \nwas going to destroy FDA. Every latest thing we saw, and then something \nelse comes up. ``This is going to destroy FDA.'' FDA retains plenty of \nauthority here, but it gets some help in the reform business and gets a \nstrong message from Congress to ``get your act together, get a \nCommissioner that knows how to administer as well as how to politic.''\n\n  I am more exercised than I usually get on this legislation. We have \nall tried to be patient as we have worked through this process. But \nmore than one person on this Senate floor can get indignant and upset \nwhen people's safety and health and lives are in jeopardy. And there is \nmore than one way that people's safety, health and lives are in \njeopardy. Delay of this bill, obfuscation, resistance also jeopardize \npeople's health and safety and lives. To suggest that those of us who \ndo not agree that the Senator's 20th item that he wants compliance with \nis something that is going to destroy FDA, undermine the entire device \nsection of FDA, put Americans at risk of their health and safety and \nmaybe even their lives, I do not think that is a responsible charge.\n  I think the obvious answer to that is, delay puts just as many, if \nnot more, people at risk. The Hudson study certainly points that out. \nWhat does that mean? It does not mean that we should have no FDA \nreform. It does not mean we should necessarily have the FDA reform I \nthink we should have. But it means we should have FDA reform. It means \nwe ought to move forward without an ill-conceived attempt to destroy \nthe whole bill.\n  I do not think the opposition here has been designed to make this a \nbetter bill. I think the opposition--and I think it has been made clear \nwith the Senator's statement this morning that everything is fine at \nFDA, hunky-dory, it is not broke, it does not need to be fixed, it is \nimproving as we speak, with revolutionary changes under Dr. Kessler. I \ndo not think anybody believes that. Well, maybe two people. We had a \nvote yesterday 98 to 2. Sixty-five people voted for the so-called \nprovision that the Senator said would absolutely kill the bill. And \nthen 33 more joined with those 65 in voting for the bill, even though \nthe Senator's point did not prevail.\n  So 98 to 2 is a pretty good indication that there is a solid belief \nhere for reform and the solid need for reform. I just hope now we do \nnot have to go through this same tortuous delay process in the House of \nRepresentatives where the hard work that has been accomplished here is \nundermined by those foes of any change in FDA, the status quo people. \n``Everything's fine. Let us just keep it as it is. Let's just keep \ndenying Americans the health and safety improvements. Let's keep \ndenying them an efficient FDA.''\n  Anybody who can stand up and defend efficiency and the effectiveness \nof this Government-run monopoly has not had very much experience with \nthe private sector. All we are trying to do here is--not strip FDA's \nauthority; there is a public function for that. We are trying to give \nthem some help in accomplishing what I think, what 98 of us at least \nbelieves needs to be accomplished.\n  I am glad I do not have to vent my spleen any more than I already \nhave on this because we are nearing final disposition of this in the \nSenate. It goes to the House. We will have a contentious conference. I \nthink those who do not want FDA reform will continue to resist this. As \nI said yesterday, the clock is ticking. If we want funds to provide for \nthe expedited review of drugs, we have to complete this very shortly. \nSeptember 30 is the date on which it runs out.\n  We are not going to go forward with PDUFA funds, appropriations or \nreauthorization unless it includes the reforms that are in this bill. I \nthink that has been made clear. And I think 98 people made that clear \nyesterday.\n  I will tell you what. I am reluctant to put this whole Hudson study \nin. It is several pages. It would be at considerable cost to the \ntaxpayers. I ask unanimous consent that excerpts, some portions, of the \nHudson briefing paper be printed in the Record so it is not so \nvoluminous. But it is available in my office for anybody to review it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [Excerpts from the Hudson Briefing Paper, Nov. 1995]\n\n The Human Costs of Regulation: The Case of Medical Devices and the FDA\n\n(By David C. Murray)\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                    Gianturco-Roubin Coronary Stents\n\n       The development of coronary stents has revolutionized the \n     treatment of certain heart conditions related to a severe \n     blockage in or collapse of a coronary artery, the vessel that \n     carries blood to the heart muscle. A sent is basically a wire \n     mesh tube. The surgeon places the stent over an uninflated \n     balloon on the tip of a long guide wire, inserts it into the \n     body through a major blood vessel, and snakes it through the \n     blood vessels into a coronary artery. Next, he anchors the \n     stent inside the artery by inflating the balloon. Then he \n     deflates the balloon, leaving the stent in place to hold the \n     artery open and facilitate the flow of blood to the heart \n     muscle. During the next few weeks, the lining of the artery \n     grows over the stent, anchoring it permanently in place.\n       Several other interventional techniques, including \n     angioplasty, can treat blockages of a coronary artery. During \n     angioplasty, the surgeon inserts an angioplasty balloon into \n     the coronary artery and expands the balloon next to the \n     blockage, thereby compressing the blockage into the artery \n     wall and allowing blood to flow freely through the artery.\n       During angioplasty, the coronary artery may collapse, \n     preventing the flow of blood to the heart muscle. This occurs \n     in 2 to 4 percent of the 400,000 such operations performed in \n     the U.S. each year. Unless the flow of blood is restored, the \n     patient suffers a heart attack. Before the development of \n     stents, the surgeon could restore the flow of blood to the \n     heart in about half of all patients by performing an \n     emergency coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. This \n     operation was quite risky, resulting in the death of \n     approximately 15 percent of patients undergoing the bypass \n     operation.\n       The coronary stent, however, became an alternative method \n     of treatment for most of these patients. In fact, at \n     hospitals that evaluated the stent during clinical trials, \n     only 8 percent of the patients suffering from abrupt closure \n     of the artery needed to have the bypass surgery. Of those \n     that did require the bypass surgery, only 5 percent died. At \n     the time the clinical studies were done, the late 1980s and \n     early 1990s, there were approximately 350,000 angioplasties \n     done per year in the U.S. Based on these numbers, it is \n     estimated that roughly 1,300 Americans died each year from \n     abrupt closure before the stent was available. Had the stent \n     been approved for use at that time, it is estimated that only \n     70 Americans would have died per year from abrupt closure, \n     resulting in roughly 1230 lives being saved per year.\n       Given the importance of this technological breakthrough, \n     one would assume that the FDA would have given expeditious \n     handling to the application for approval of the stent. Sadly \n     for the thousands of Americans who died when they could have \n     benefited from the stent, this was not the case. It took nine \n     months for the device's developers to obtain permission from \n     the FDA to begin preliminary, or Phase I, clinical trials. \n     These trials took another year. The manufacturer then \n     conducted Phase II trials for nine months and, based upon the \n     results of these trials,\n\n[[Page S9834]]\n\n     requested immediate permission to begin the final Phase III \n     trials.\n       The FDA rejected this request. The manufacturer appealed \n     and again requested permission to begin Phase III trials. \n     After three more months, the FDA said no. In the meantime, \n     the manufacturer had begun a second set of Phase II trials. \n     The manufacturer appealed again, and after another three \n     months, the FDA finally granted permission for the Phase III \n     trials to begin. Seven months later, the manufacturer had \n     completed the first segment of the Phase III trial and \n     requested permission to expand it. After another seven \n     months, the FDA granted this request; this trial was \n     completed in another 15 months. Four months later, the FDA's \n     advisory panel of medical experts recommended approval of the \n     device, but the FDA did not issue the actual order granting \n     approval until another 12 months had passed. At last, on May \n     28, 1993, more than six and a half years after the initial \n     application to begin the clinical trials, the FDA approved \n     the device for use in the U.S.\n       Obtaining approval in Europe was quite another matter. \n     Belgium first approved the device in June 1992, after only a \n     few months of review. Several other European countries \n     quickly followed suit. On the face of it, there appears to be \n     only an eleven-month lag between the European and FDA \n     approval dates, but the whole approval process in Belgium \n     took only a few months, compared with two years for the \n     formal review of the data by the FDA and four and a half \n     years for the clinical trials.\n       One could argue that the European approval process was a \n     ``free rider'' on the clinical trials the FDA mandated, thus \n     making this comparison unfair. The Europeans did use much of \n     the clinical data generated for the FDA approval process, but \n     the Europeans have a streamlined process for facilitating \n     clinical trials, with the go-ahead generally granted in fewer \n     than 60 days. It is unlikely that it would have taken nine \n     months just to get the clinical trials under way in Europe, \n     as it did in the U.S., just as it is unlikely that the \n     manufacturer would have encountered so many delays in \n     expanding the clinical trials. Indeed, manufacturers who move \n     their clinical trials to Europe cite regulatory flexibility \n     in designing and conducting clinical trials as their primary \n     reason.\n       Given the complexity of the situation, it is worthwhile to \n     create a range of estimates for the human costs of the FDA's \n     regulatory delays in approving the coronary stent. At an \n     absolute minimum, the delay in approval time between Belgium \n     and the U.S. was 11 months. Using the estimated loss of 1,230 \n     lives per year, the minimum human cost of the 11-month delay \n     is approximately 1,128 lives (11/12 times 1,230). This \n     estimate, however, does not include the delays associated \n     with the FDA's design and oversight of the clinical trials.\n\n   TABLE 1.--ESTIMATED NUMBER OF LIVES LOST DUE TO REGULATORY DELAY IN\n                      APPROVING THE CORONARY STENT\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          Percent of Lag Attributable to\n                                Time lag              the FDA\n       Regulatory Phase         (months) -------------------------------\n                                            25%     50%     75%    100%\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInvestigational Device                 7     182     365     547     718\n Application..................\nBegin Phase III trials........         5     130     260     391     521\nExpand Phase III trials.......         5     130     260     391     521\nClinical Subtotal.............        17     442     885   1,329   1,760\nApproval Lag..................        11   1,128   1,128   1,128   1,128\n                               -----------------------------------------\n    Total.....................        27   1,570   2,013   2,457   2,888\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Taking these delays into account substantially increases \n     the human costs attributable to the U.S. system. Table 1 \n     provides varying estimates of the number of lives lost due to \n     FDA regulatory delay. The estimates vary according to whether \n     the FDA is assumed to be 25 percent, 50 percent, 75 percent, \n     or 100 percent responsible for the delay at each phase of the \n     approval process. The lags in clinical trials in the table \n     are the time in excess of 60 days that it took a manufacturer \n     to obtain FDA permission to proceed to the phase in question. \n     The table estimates FDA responsibility for the 11-month lag \n     between European and FDA approval at 100 percent for all \n     scenarios.\n       It seems reasonable to estimate that between 1570 and 2888 \n     lives were lost in the U.S. due to the regulatory lags \n     imposed by the FDA for this device. It is readily evident \n     that delay does have a heavy price.\n\n\n                IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATORS\n\n       As mentioned earlier, implantable-defibrillators have saved \n     the lives of tens of thousands of Americans, many of whom \n     would have survived only a short time had they not received \n     the implant. The U.S. first approved implantiable \n     defibrillators for use in 1986; CPI, then a subsidiary of Eli \n     Lilly and Company, first brought them to market. The original \n     defibrillators were so large that they could not be implanted \n     in the chest; instead the surgeon placed them inside the \n     patient's abdomen. To connect the defibrillator to the \n     patient's heart, the patient needed a thoracotomy, which \n     involves cracking the sternum and opening the chest. The \n     surgeon then embedded a wire or lead from the defibrillator \n     into the chest and grafted it onto the heart. Needless to \n     say, this was quite a traumatic procedure for the patient and \n     resulted in substantial operative mortality. The early \n     defibrillators certainly saved many, many more lives than \n     they claimed; however, they were only able to deliver one \n     type of energy shock to the patient's heart. The high-energy \n     shock that these devices delivered was effective in some \n     patients, but not all.\n       A second generation of implantable-defibrillators was \n     approved for use in Europe in 1988 and in the U.S. in 1991. \n     These devices could deliver both high- and low-energy shocks \n     to the patient's heart and the physician could program them \n     to maximize effectiveness.\n       The third generation of implantable defibrillators was \n     approved for use in Europe in 1991 and in the U.S. in 1993. \n     These were multiprogrammable. The physician could tailor the \n     type of shock the defibrillator would deliver, according to \n     the patient's needs, even after the device was implanted, \n     through the use of an electronic wand. The defibrillator also \n     had an internal memory that kept a record of the number times \n     it had discharged, as well as several key statistics \n     concerning the nature of the shock it had delivered. The \n     physician could access this information with the wand. The \n     defibrillator could also pace the patient's heartbeat; it \n     incorporated recent advancements in pacing technology that \n     allowed the device to correct for both slow- and rapid-\n     beating problems.\n       The physician used either epicardial or endocardial leads \n     to attach third-generation defibrillators to the heart. He \n     grafted epicardial leads onto the heart muscle by means of \n     screw-in or stab-tab electrodes. This type of lead required a \n     thoractomy, or open chest procedure. Endocardial leads, on \n     the other had, could be threaded through the patient's blood \n     vessels to the heart. Because these leads stay inside the \n     blood vessels, there is no reason to open the chest. \n     Endocardial leads were not originally approved for use with \n     third-generation defibrillators in the U.S., but became \n     available in December 1993. Endocardial leads were first \n     widely available in Europe in late 1991, two years before \n     they were widely available in the U.S.\n       The clinical evidence in favor of endocardial leads over \n     epicardial leads is extremely strong. A clinical study \n     carried out at 125 participating hospital centers \n     demonstrated that 4.2 percent of patients receiving the \n     epicardial leads died within 30 days following surgery, and \n     only 0.8 percent of patients receiving the endocardial leads \n     died during the same period. Two years after surgery, 87.6 \n     percent of the patients receiving endocardial leads were \n     alive, but only 81.9 percent of patients with epicardial \n     leads were still alive. The medical characteristics of \n     patients in both groups were similar. Other studies have also \n     demonstrated the superiority of endocardial leads, exhibiting \n     a differential in survival rates of about 4 percent.\n       The fourth generation of implantable defibrillators is much \n     smaller than the previous three. These can be implanted in \n     the chest, under the pectoral muscle, much like a \n     conventional pacemaker. This greatly reduces the length of \n     the leads required and results in a smaller incision. The \n     devices can send out a more efficient type of energy wave \n     that allows the use of endocardial leads in nearly all \n     patients. This new wave, which is biphasic, achieves the same \n     results as the formerly used monophasic waves, but at \n     substantially lower energy levels and with fewer electrodes. \n     The gains in efficiency allow near-universal use of \n     endocardial leads. Another result of the enhancement in \n     efficiency is that the device needs far less testing while \n     the patient is on the operating table. This leads to a \n     reduction in the time the patient is in surgery and should \n     decrease several other complications.\n       Operative mortality with this fourth-generation device \n     again fell, this time to less than 0.5 percent. The smaller \n     device is also said to be much more comfortable for the \n     patient than the bulkier devices previously implanted in the \n     abdomen. Fourth-generation defibrillators were first approved \n     for use in Europe in October 1993 and in the U.S. in March \n     1995.\n       It is evident that during the last several years European \n     consumers have had earlier access to the latest model of \n     implantable defibrillators than American consumers. In fact, \n     American consumers were one full product cycle behind their \n     European counterparts for most of the past five years. Given \n     the improvements in patient survival for each generation of \n     the device, this is hardly a trivial issue. It is estimated \n     that in the early 1990s roughly 13,200 Americans received \n     defibrillators each year, and that the figure reached 20,000 \n     by the mid-1990s.\n       Because of the regulatory lags outlined earlier, it can be \n     estimated that 1,206 Americans died who, statistics indicate, \n     would not have died if the same device that was available in \n     Europe had been available in the U.S. The two-year regulatory \n     lags in approving endocardial leads led to 1,056 of these \n     deaths, and the 18-month regulatory lag in the approval of \n     fourth-generation defibrillators was responsible for the \n     remaining 150 deaths. Once again, the price of inefficient \n     regulation carried a heavy human cost for American heart \n     patients.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Let me yield the floor, because I do not think I will \nspeak again, but not before commending the chairman of the committee, \nwho has persisted with the patience here that is remarkable. He has \npersisted because he believes that this is an important thing to move \nforward on, that this issue is important to the health and safety and \nlives of Americans. I appreciate his effort and work and his \ncooperation and his standing tall with us even though it has not been \neasy.\n\n[[Page S9835]]\n\n  So I thank the chairman, The Senator from Vermont, and, in view of \nthat, yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from \nIndiana for bringing to the awareness of my colleagues what the other \nside of the story is with respect to the famous 404 provision relative \nto devices.\n  I only add, as I would point out, there are some 6,000 devices \napproved each year, and during the period of the last 5 years around \n30,000, of which there were only 5 or 6 that were found to have had \nproblems after approval. So I want to try to get the dimensions of this \nproblem which has really dominated our time.\n  I thank the Senator from Indiana.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement of the \nmanagers be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Statement of the Managers\n\n       After the mark-up of S. 830, supporters of the bill, the \n     minority, and the FDA were able to come to agreement on \n     several provisions, previously the subject of disagreement, \n     on the basis of new legislative history. Other new provisions \n     were agreed to which require accompanying legislative \n     history. The following substitutes for the language in the \n     committee report for S. 830, which shall not be considered \n     part of the legislative history of this bill on the topics \n     discussed below.\n\n\n                    section 601--minor modifications\n\n       The Committee changed section 601 only as that section \n     relates to manufacturing changes, and this statement only \n     supplants prior legislative history to the extent such \n     history describes and explains manufacturing changes to \n     approved PMA devices covered by the markup version of 601(c). \n     Section 601 now better reflects the Committee's desire to \n     ensure a workable means of expediting the clearance of \n     significant manufacturing changes. The provision permits \n     manufacturers to submit a notice to FDA describing \n     manufacturing changes, summarizing data and information \n     supporting the changes, and asserting that the changes were \n     made in accordance with current good manufacturing practices. \n     Before commercially distributing a device subject to such \n     manufacturing changes, the manufacturer must wait 30 days \n     from the date of the Secretary's receipt of the notice. If \n     within the 30 day period the manufacturer receives from the \n     Secretary a written statement that the notice is inadequate, \n     the device may not be distributed until sufficient \n     information is added to the notice to make it adequate within \n     the meaning of the notice requirements of this subsection.\n       The Secretary will also have the option of requesting PMA \n     supplements for the manufacturing changes identified in \n     notices. If such a request is made, the Secretary will have \n     135 days from the date of receipt of the manufacturing \n     supplement to approve or deny it. However, to the extent that \n     a notice satisfies the content requirements for a \n     manufacturing supplement, the time used by the Secretary for \n     reviewing the notice will be deducted from the 135 day review \n     period. For example, if the Secretary used 30 days to review \n     a notice and requested a PMA manufacturing supplement, then \n     the Secretary would have 105 days to review the supplement \n     from the day of its receipt by the Secretary. The Committee \n     expects that the Secretary commonly will permit manufacturing \n     changes through the 30 day notice procedure after gaining \n     experience with the procedures outlined by this subsection \n     and with the performance of regulated persons. Important to \n     the Committee's consideration in advancing this approach to \n     manufacturing changes was the Secretary's recent \n     implementation of pre-production design controls which \n     require consideration of manufacturing specifications in the \n     overall design evaluation of a device.\n\n\n              section 604--automatic class iii designation\n\n       Section 604 includes a process that permits the Secretary \n     to classify devices based on the Act's risk-based \n     classification criteria when a device is found to be not \n     substantially equivalent to a predicate devise. Specifically, \n     thirty days after receipt of a not substantially equivalent \n     determination, the person receiving the Secretary's \n     classification order may request that the Secretary make a \n     risk based classification determination for the person's \n     device, if the type of device had not been previously \n     classified. The manufacturer should provide information to \n     assist the Secretary in making the risk-based classification. \n     The Secretary will then determine the device's classification \n     based on the classification definitions in section 513(a)(1) \n     and any material provided for the Secretary's review. These \n     classification definitions have been used by the Secretary to \n     classify or reclassify over a thousand types of devices.\n       Within 60 days of the above request, the Secretary must \n     make a classification determination, placing the device into \n     one of three statutory device classes. If the device is \n     placed into classes I or II, it may be commercially \n     distributed immediately. Of course, like any device, devices \n     classified into class I or II under section 604 will be \n     subject to all provisions of the Act. However, if the device \n     is placed in class III, its status will remain unchanged from \n     its not substantially equivalent designation; that is, the \n     device will be classified into class III and will require an \n     approved premarket application under section 515 before \n     marketing.\n       Once a device is classified into class I or II under \n     section 604, it becomes a predicate for future premarket \n     notification submissions. Persons who file reports under \n     section 510(k) may demonstrate the substantial equivalence of \n     newer devices to these predicates in the same manner as under \n     current law.\n       The Committee realizes that ``special controls'' can be \n     controls or a variety of controls that will assist in \n     providing a reasonable assurance of device safety and \n     effectiveness. When conducting a classification review under \n     this section, the Secretary may classify a device into class \n     II even when special controls do not yet exist.\n       Importantly, the fact that a device is subject to a special \n     control under this section does not mean that enforcement \n     authority over such controls in other parts of the Act become \n     ineffective. For example, postmarket surveillance and \n     labeling can be special controls. Nonetheless, postmarket \n     surveillance is still enforceable as a misbranding under \n     section 502(t) and specified labeling instructions remain \n     enforceable under either section 502(a) or 502(f)(1) as \n     misbrandings, depending on the labeling control at issue.\n       The Committee included section 604 to avoid the needless \n     expenditure of the Secretary's resources that would occur if \n     lower risk devices were subjected to premarket approval \n     reviews under section 515 because such devices were unique \n     and found to be not substantially equivalent to a predicate \n     device. The Committee also believes that section 604 may \n     permit the Secretary to avoid time and resource consuming \n     substantial equivalence determinations that rely on remote \n     predicates. The committee does not intend that this provision \n     will alter the Act's substantial equivalence provisions or \n     the Secretary's longstanding approach to the 510(k) \n     classification process.\n       In sum, insofar as special controls are referenced in \n     section 604, the committee intends to clearly communicate \n     that any special control is enforceable to the extent \n     enforcement authority specifically addressing such controls \n     exists in the Act. Special controls that are voluntary, for \n     example standards recognized by FDA under section 205 or \n     agency guidance documents, may not be required to demonstrate \n     substantial equivalence or, more generally, compliance with \n     any requirements under the Act; however, alternate means of \n     achieving compliance must be demonstrated by regulated \n     persons.\n\n\n             Section 612--health care economic information\n\n       The purpose of section 612 is to make it possible for drug \n     companies to provide information about the economic \n     consequences of the use of their products to parties that are \n     charged with making medical product selection decisions for \n     managed care or similar organizations. Such parties include \n     formulary committees, drug information centers, and other \n     multidisciplinary committees within health care organizations \n     that review scientific studies and technology assessments and \n     recommend drug acquisition and treatment guidelines. The \n     provision is limited to analyses provided to such entities \n     because such entities are constituted to consider this type \n     of information through a deliberative process and are \n     expected to have the appropriate range of expertise to \n     interpret health care economic information presented to them \n     to inform their decision-making process, and to distinguish \n     facts from assumptions. This limitation is important because \n     it will ensure that the information is presented only to \n     parties who have established procedures and skills to \n     interpret the methods and limitations of economic studies. \n     The provision is NOT intended to permit manufacturers to \n     provide such health care economic information to medical \n     practitioners who are making individual patient prescribing \n     decisions nor is it intended to permit the provision of such \n     information in the context of medical education.\n       Health care economic information is defined as an analysis \n     that identifies, measures, or compares the economic \n     consequences of the use of the drug to the use of another \n     drug or another health care intervention or no intervention. \n     Incorporated into economic consequences are the costs of \n     health outcomes. Data about health outcomes associated with \n     the use of drug, other treatments, or no treatment are \n     therefore incorporated into the economic analysis. This \n     provision limits such incorporation to health outcomes that \n     are directly related to the approved use of the drug and are \n     based on competent and reliable scientific evidence. The \n     provision presumes that the current standard practice of \n     including full disclosure of all assumptions and health \n     outcomes used in the economic analysis will continue.\n       The type of health care economic information that can be \n     provided pursuant to this section is that which is directly \n     related to an approved labeled indication. To illustrate this \n     point, economic claims based on preventing disease \n     progression would ordinarily not be considered to be directly \n     related to an approved indication for the treatment of\n\n[[Page S9836]]\n\n     symptoms of a disease, for a drug for which the use in \n     prevention of disease progression has not been approved. \n     For example, rheumatoid arthritis drugs are approved for \n     the treatment of symptoms and not for the prevention of \n     deformity. Therefore, economic claims based in part on an \n     assumption of prevention of deformity would not be \n     considered directly related to the approved indications \n     for these drugs.\n       Similarly, economic claims based on prolonging patient \n     survival would not be considered directly related and would \n     not, therefore, be permitted under this subsection, for \n     agents approved for the symptomatic treatment of heart \n     failure, but not approved for prolonging survival in heart \n     failure patients. This provision also is NOT intended to \n     provide manufacturers a path for promoting off label \n     indications or claiming clinical advantages of one drug over \n     another when such claims do not satisfy FDA's evidentiary \n     standards for such claims.\n       However, the provision would permit health care economic \n     information that includes reasonable assumptions about health \n     care economic consequences derived from, but not explicitly \n     cited in, the approved indication that is supported by \n     competent and reliable scientific evidence. The nature of the \n     evidence needed will depend on how closely related the \n     assumptions are to the approved indication and to the health \n     significance of the assumptions. For example, modeling the \n     resource savings from tight control of blood sugar in Type 1 \n     diabetes with insulin therapy could include costs savings \n     associated with the prevention of retinopathy (an eye \n     disease) and nephropathy (kidney disease) based on well-\n     controlled study(ies) that demonstrate that control of blood \n     sugar levels with insulin leads to a reduction of such \n     consequences. Because prevention of retinopathy and \n     nephropathy could not simply be assumed to be a result of \n     blood sugar control, these prevention claims would have to be \n     shown by well-controlled study(ies) before inclusion as \n     health care outcome assumptions.\n       In contrast, economic claims that model, based on \n     observational studies in a population of women, the economic \n     consequences of prevention of fractures due to osteoporosis \n     would be permitted for drugs already approved for prevention \n     of fractures due to osteoporosis. This is possible because \n     observational data may be considered competent and reliable \n     for making an assumption about the secondary consequences of \n     an osteoporotic fracture once the primary prevention has been \n     established. Similarly, the long-term economic consequences \n     of the prevention of meningitis by haemophilus be influenza \n     vaccine could be modeled using population-based data once the \n     primary prevention claim is established.\n       The standard of competent and reliable scientific evidence \n     (49 Fed. Reg. 30999--August 2, 1984) supporting health care \n     economic information provided under this subsection takes \n     into account the current scientific standards for assessing \n     the various types of data and analyses that underlie such \n     information. Thus, the nature of the evidence required to \n     support various components of health care economic analyses \n     depends on which component of the analysis is involved. For \n     example, the methods for establishing the economic costs and \n     consequences used to construct the health care economic \n     information would be assessed using standards widely accepted \n     by economics experts. The methods used in establishing the \n     clinical outcome assumptions used to construct the health \n     care economic analysis would be evaluated using standards \n     widely accepted by experts familiar with evaluating the \n     merits of clinical assessments. In addition, the evidence \n     needed could be affected by other pertinent factors.\n       Under FDA's current postmarketing reporting regulations, \n     health care economic information as defined in this section \n     must be submitted to FDA at the time it is initially provided \n     to a formulary committee or other similar entity. In \n     addition, pursuant to this provision, FDA will have access, \n     upon request, to any data or other information related to the \n     substantiation of the health care economic information. Such \n     information is evaluated by the Secretary to determine if the \n     health care economic information meets the requirements of \n     this section. This consists of, for example, health outcome \n     data, health resource utilization data and other information \n     related to the economic consequences of the use of the drug. \n     It would not include, for example, confidential corporate \n     financial data, including confidential pricing data.\n\n\n                       Section 617--Health Claims\n\n       Section 617 of the bill amends section 403(r)(3) of the Act \n     to authorize a health claim based upon a published \n     authoritative statement of an authoritative body of the \n     United States. Such a claim would be lawful if it meets the \n     requirements of clause (C), including the requirement that \n     the Secretary be notified 120 days prior to a claim appearing \n     on a food in interstate commerce. It is expected that the \n     Secretary will ensure that all relevant offices of the \n     Department give sufficient priority to evaluating the \n     information in the notice submitted under clause (C) so that \n     only accurate and appropriate claims appear on food labels. \n     Specifically, the Committee expects that where the Secretary \n     determines that a claim should be modified or prohibited \n     under clause (D), a regulation can be drafted by the Food and \n     Drug Administration within 100 days, and that the remaining \n     20 days will be adequate for other necessary reviews, \n     including review within FDA and within the Department. The \n     Committee also expects that the Office of Management and \n     Budget will either waive its review of a regulation \n     promulgated under clause (D) or complete that review \n     expeditiously. In the event that FDA must consult with the \n     authoritative body whose statement forms the basis of the \n     claim, the Committee expects that the authoritative body will \n     give the highest priority to that consultation to facilitate, \n     within the 120 day notification period, the resolution of any \n     outstanding differences.\n\n\n               Section 619--Positron emission tomography\n\n       The Committee intends in section 619 to require FDA to \n     develop a framework for the regulation of radiotracers used \n     in positron emission tomography (PET) scans based on the \n     unique characteristics of PET and taking into account, where \n     appropriate, the differences between the limited quantities \n     of PET radiotracers compounded by not for profit \n     institutions, such as academic medical centers, and the \n     larger quantities that may be produced by commercial PET \n     centers.\n       The Committee has established a period of four years as a \n     reasonable time period in which appropriate new regulatory \n     procedures will be developed by FDA and any necessary \n     applications submitted by PET centers. Until the expiration \n     of that four year period, the Committee intends to require \n     that PET radiotracers meet the standards set by the United \n     States Pharmacopoeia (USP) for safety, efficacy and \n     compounding, and that the FDA or state agencies will enforce \n     the standards set by the USP. In addition, makers and users \n     of PET radiotracers will continue to be subject to the \n     requirements of the various state boards of medicine and \n     pharmacy which they are currently required to meet.\n       USP standards are recognized in the Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (FDCA) in the adulteration and misbranding \n     sections of the Act (Secs. 501(b) and 502 respectively). USP \n     establishes standards for marketed drugs in the U.S. It first \n     provided standards for PET pharmaceuticals in 1988. During \n     these years, USP standards have served to standardize and \n     help assure the quality of these items and protect the public \n     health. USP establishes standards or drugs through a rigorous \n     peer reviewed process, and the FDA provides input and comment \n     to USP as part of this process.\n       Section 619(a)(1) amends the FDCA to add a definition of a \n     ``compounded positron emission tomography drug'' to mean a \n     PET drug and associated software and hardware which has been \n     compounded in accordance with state law by or on the order of \n     a practitioner licensed in that State or in a federal \n     facility in accordance with the law of the State in which it \n     is located.\n       Section 619(b)(1) amends the FDCA to provide that a \n     compounded PET drug is adulterated, and thus subject to \n     regulatory and/or legal action by FDA, if it is compounded, \n     processed, packed, or held other than in accordance with the \n     PET compounding standards and the official monographs of the \n     USP.\n       Section 619(b)(2) provides that the amendment effected by \n     section 619(b)(1) shall cease to be effective four years \n     after the date of enactment of this act, or two years after \n     the adoption by FDA of the requirements specified in section \n     619(c), which occurs later.\n       Section 619(c)(1) requires that, no later than two years \n     after the enactment of this act, FDA shall establish \n     appropriate procedures for the approval of PET drugs pursuant \n     to section 505 of the FDCA and appropriate current good \n     manufacturing practice standards for such drugs. In both \n     instances, the Committee intends that FDA shall take due \n     account of any relevant differences between non-profit \n     institutions that compound PET drugs for their own patients \n     and commercial manufacturers of such drugs. FDA is directed \n     to consult with patient advocacy groups, professional \n     associations, manufacturers and physicians and scientists \n     licensed to make and/or use PET drugs prior to establishing \n     the procedures and requirements contemplated by this \n     provision.\n       Section 619(c)(2) provides that FDA shall not require the \n     submission of a new drug application for an abbreviated new \n     drug application pursuant to section 505 of the FDCA for PET \n     drugs which meet the appropriate USP standards referenced by \n     section 619(b)(1) for a period of four years after the \n     enactment of this act, or for two years after the \n     establishment of the procedures and requirements under \n     section 619(c)(1), whichever occurs later. The Committee \n     intends that FDA shall use up to two years of the four \n     year period to consult with the groups mentioned above and \n     to formulate its procedures and requirements. Thereafter, \n     the Committee intends that a period of one year be allowed \n     to prepare and submit any necessary applications. Finally, \n     FDA is given one year to review and act upon the \n     applications. The Committee would expect that FDA would \n     take no action against an applicant if, at the end of the \n     four year period, the agency has neither approved nor \n     issued a not approvable letter in response to an \n     application filed within one year after the agency's \n     procedures for PET drugs have been promulgated.\n       Section 619(d) requires the revocation of certain Federal \n     Register notices which announced a rule inconsistent with \n     this legislation.\n       PET is an imaging technique that produces a computerized \n     image (scan) using small quantities of a radioactive tracer \n     to measure biochemical activity in the body. It has been \n     demonstrated to be an effective method of separating benign \n     from malignant lesions,\n\n[[Page S9837]]\n\n     staging the degree of metastasis, determining therapeutic \n     effectiveness and identifying early recurrence of disease in \n     several types of cancer, including lung, breast, colorectal, \n     head and neck. In addition, PET has a high degree of accuracy \n     in identifying early signs of coronary artery disease and in \n     assessing whether cardiac tissue is alive following a heart \n     attack. In more than one million uses of PET tracers in \n     Europe and one million in the United States, the Committee is \n     unaware of any reported instance of an adverse reaction to \n     PET radiotracers. PET radiopharmaceuticals have been used in \n     patients in the United States for over 30 years. Recent \n     research and advances in imaging technology have enhanced the \n     clinical importance of PET.\n       PET radiotracers are unique among radiopharmaceuticals \n     because of their short half-lives, ranging from 30 seconds to \n     110 minutes. Therefore, most PET radiotracers are made using \n     a cyclotron which is at or near the PET site, and most are \n     made up on an individual dose basis upon the prescription of \n     a licensed physician. At present, there are 70 PET centers in \n     the United States, almost all of which are part of academic \n     medical centers. PET technology and its applications were \n     developed in large part with almost $2 billion in federal \n     research funds. Yet, while PET is widely used in Europe, its \n     benefits have not been widely available to American patients, \n     mainly because of lack of reimbursement and inappropriate and \n     costly regulations promulgated by FDA.\n       Under current FDA requirements, PET centers which compound \n     PET radiopharmaceuticals on an individual dose basis would be \n     required to meet FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practices \n     (CGMP) and to file NDA's and ANDA's for each type of PET \n     tracer and for each indication for which the tracer might be \n     used. This is the same type of regulation which the FDA \n     applies to large pharmaceutical manufacturers.\n       Academic medical centers are facing unprecedented cost \n     pressures. Without regulatory relief and expanded \n     reimbursement, particularly from the Medicare program, many \n     PET centers are likely to close, and the benefits of PET will \n     be unavailable to the taxpayers who funded their development. \n     For example, the University of California at Los Angeles \n     estimated that FDA's new PET regulations would cost the \n     University at least $300,000 for a single application for \n     a single use of a PET radiotracer.\n       The Committee intends that adoption of this section will \n     permit FDA to establish a regulatory framework for PET drugs \n     that will enable PET centers to continue to make this \n     valuable technology available to patients at reasonable cost \n     and assure that the public health will be protected. The \n     Committee also expects that the Health Care Financing \n     Administration will, until four years after the enactment \n     date, consider PET drugs which meet USP standards under the \n     provisions of this section to be approved by FDA for purposes \n     of Medicare reimbursement.\n\n\n                    section 807--national uniformity\n\n                                Warnings\n\n       New Section 761 provides for national uniformity for OTC \n     drugs for human use. Under this section state and local \n     governments may not in general have requirements for OTC \n     drugs that are different from or in addition, or otherwise \n     not identical with, a requirement under this Act, the Poison \n     Prevention Packaging Act of 1970 or the Fair Packaging and \n     Labeling Act.\n       Section 761(c)(2) makes it clear that the scope of national \n     uniformity extends to any state requirement upon a \n     manufacturer or distributor to mandate, by any method of \n     communication, a warning of any kind. Such a requirement \n     might relate to a warning on the label, in labeling, through \n     posters or advertising, in letters or other mailing, or in \n     any other form of public notification. Similarly, the \n     provision applies to all forms of required warnings, not just \n     those formally designated as a ``warning.'' It includes any \n     statement, vignette, or other representation which indicates, \n     directly or by implication, that the drug presents or may \n     present a hazard to health or safety. For public health \n     reasons, any warning of any kind, in any type of public \n     communication, should be uniform throughout the country.\n       The reference to ``a warning of any kind'' is intended to \n     make clear that a state requirement is preempted if it \n     relates to a warning, regardless of whether the state \n     requirement is described as a ``warning.'' For example, if \n     the substance of a state requirement is to mandate a warning, \n     it would be subject to preemption even if it were called a \n     ``notification'' or ``information'' requirement.\n       It should be noted that the provision would not prevent the \n     states from undertaking unilateral action to issue their own \n     public statements in the form of health department releases, \n     public service announcements, or public education campaigns \n     to alert state consumers about its concerns about an OTC \n     drug.\n\n                               Exceptions\n\n       Subsection (d) deals with the situation where a drug is \n     neither subject to a new drug application (NDA) or a final \n     OTC drug monograph, and therefore has not been the subject of \n     a full review by FDA of all applicable regulatory \n     requirements. Until that FDA review occurs, national \n     uniformity only applies where a state requirement relates to \n     the same subject as a federal regulation or the same subject \n     as a federal statutory amendment made on or after the date of \n     enactment, but is different from, or in addition to that \n     specific federal requirement. Where there is no such specific \n     federal requirement and the drug is not subject to an NDA or \n     a final monograph, the state remains free to impose its own \n     requirement.\n       Thus, a state generally can impose a requirement on the \n     content or labeling of a product not the subject of a final \n     monograph. But a state cannot establish a different \n     requirement (warning or otherwise) for a drug not subject to \n     a final monograph where a final federal regulation on the \n     subject is in place. For example, alcohol containing OTC drug \n     products intended for ingestion (whether or not the subject \n     of a final monograph) must meet the requirements of a final \n     federal regulation which specifies maximum permissible \n     concentrations of alcohol. A state could not issue a \n     different regulation on that subject even if the state \n     regulation applied only to products not subject to a final \n     monograph. A similar situation is presented by FDA's proposed \n     regulation requiring massive and in-depth changes in labeling \n     format for OTC drugs. That proposal applies to all OTC drugs \n     whether or not they are subject to a final monograph and \n     therefore when final would preempt any different or \n     additional state requirements.\n       Once FDA has conducted its full review in the form of an \n     NDA or final OTC drug monograph, the FDA regulatory program \n     will have a general preemptive effect for drugs subject to an \n     NDA or final monograph, no state may enact any additional or \n     different requirement that is of the type imposed by the \n     three designated federal statutes. States may enforce \n     identical provisions, but not requirements that are in \n     addition to, different from, or otherwise not identical with \n     the federal requirements. The full FDA review involved in an \n     NDA or final monograph, along with the requirements of other \n     applicable FDA regulations assures that all appropriate \n     regulatory requirements including those involving safety, \n     effectiveness, manufacturing, packaging, and labeling, are \n     all in place for OTC drug products. For that reason, no other \n     state requirements will be permitted.\n       Thus, generally (unless another final federal regulation \n     applies) a state can require a warning for a drug that is not \n     subject to an NDA or a final monograph, because FDA has not \n     yet had an opportunity to conduct a full review of all \n     potential warnings applicable to the drug. Once FDA approves \n     an NDA or promulgates a final OTC drug monograph for the \n     drug, however, no state may thereafter require any form of \n     warning on any subject, through any form of public \n     communication, unless it is identical with whatever warning \n     is required by FDA. Additional or different warnings would \n     thereafter be precluded.\n\n\n                   section 811--information exchange\n\n                        Incentives for Research\n\n       It is the Committee's belief that section 771 will provide \n     health care practitioners important scientific information \n     about uses that are not included in the approved labeling of \n     drugs, biologics, and devices. We recognize, however, that \n     our goal should also be to ensure that these new uses get \n     onto the product label. That is why we have incorporated \n     strong incentives to conduct the research needed to get those \n     uses on the label. Pursuant to subsection (a)(3)(A), a \n     manufacturer who seeks to disseminate information about a new \n     use must either certify that it will file a supplemental \n     application for the new use (if the studies have already been \n     completed) or must submit a proposed protocol and schedule \n     for conducting the necessary studies and a certification that \n     a supplemental application will be filed. If the studies are \n     completed at the time dissemination begins, a supplemental \n     application must be filed within 6 months from the date of \n     the initial dissemination. If the manufacturer commits to \n     conduct the studies, a supplemental application must be filed \n     within 3 years, unless the Secretary determines that more \n     time is needed to complete the studies and submit a \n     supplemental application. The Secretary may grant an \n     extension of the three year period if the manufacturer has \n     acted with due diligence to conduct the studies in a timely \n     manner, but such extension may not exceed two years.\n       Although our goal is to ensure that the research is done to \n     get new uses on the product label, we also recognize that \n     there may be limited circumstances when it is appropriate to \n     exempt a manufacturer from the requirement to file a \n     supplemental application. Subsection (a)(3)(C) provides that \n     a manufacturer may file a request for an exemption from the \n     requirement if such manufacturer can demonstrate (I) that due \n     to the size of the patient population or lack of potential \n     benefit to the sponsor, the cost of obtaining clinical \n     information and submitting a supplemental application is \n     economically prohibitive, or (ii) it would be unethical to \n     conduct the studies necessary to obtain adequate evidence for \n     approval of a supplemental application.\n       In making the determination of whether to grant an \n     exemption pursuant to subsection (a)(3)(C), the Secretary may \n     consider, among other things, the following factors, if \n     relevant, whether:\n       (1) the new use meets the requirements of section \n     186(t)(2)(B) of the Social Security Act;\n       (2) a medical specialty society that is represented in or \n     recognized by the Council of Medical Specialty Societies (or \n     is a subspecialty of such society) or is recognized by\n\n[[Page S9838]]\n\n     the American Osteopathic Association, has found that the new \n     use is consistent with sound medical practice;\n       (3) the new use is described in a recommendation or medical \n     practice guidelines of a Federal health agency, including the \n     National Institutes of Health, the Agency for Health Care \n     Policy and Research, and the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention of the Department of Health and Human Services;\n       (4) the new use is described in one of three compendia: The \n     U.S. Pharmacopeia--Drug Information; the American Medical \n     Association Drug Evaluations; or the American Hospital \n     Association Formulary Service Drug Information;\n       (5) the new use involves a combination of products of more \n     than one sponsor of a new drug application, a biological \n     license application, a device premarket notification, or a \n     device premarket approval application; and\n       (6) the patent status of the product.\n       Subsection (a)(3)(D) requires manufacturers who commit to \n     conduct studies to obtain evidence on new uses to provide the \n     Secretary with periodic reports that describe the status of \n     the studies. The reports required by this provision are not \n     intended to be burdensome. In many cases it would be \n     sufficient for manufacturers to provide brief updates on the \n     status of the studies. In general, the purpose of this \n     provision is to keep the Secretary apprised of how patient \n     enrollment is proceeding, any significant problems that could \n     affect the manufacturers' ability to complete the studies, \n     and expected completion dates.\n\n                         Additional Information\n\n       The principal policy considerations that underlie this \n     provision are the facilitation of greater access to timely \n     and accurate information to health care providers. Coupled \n     with this goal is a recognition that the FDA has a \n     responsibility to protect the public health. Thus, the \n     discretionary authority of the Secretary to offer objective \n     statements on the proposed dissemination and to require the \n     manufacturer to disseminate additional information to achieve \n     objectivity and balance is preserved.\n       It is important to recognize that it has been the long held \n     view of Congress that the FDA cannot, and should not, \n     regulate the practice of medicine. Thus, the FDA has no \n     authority or jurisdiction to regulate how physicians \n     prescribe approved drugs. This means that physician \n     prescribing of off label uses of approved products is not \n     within the jurisdiction of the FDA. In this case, because the \n     physician is receiving information from a drug sponsor (whose \n     conduct is within the jurisdiction of the FDA) the FDA has a \n     role to play with respect to assuring balanced and \n     objectivity necessary to fulfill its statutory mission. \n     Because health care providers retain responsibility of making \n     treatment decisions with respect to individual patients, the \n     FDA's role with respect to individual treatment decisions \n     based on peer reviewed articles and textbooks is advisory. In \n     that advisory capacity the FDA will take steps to make sure \n     that the amount of information given to the provider is \n     useful, useable, and in compliance with this section. This \n     requirement should not be read as requiring the FDA to \n     comment on each and every proposed dissemination, rather \n     this authority will likely be used in the limited \n     circumstances in which balance can not be fully met by the \n     options listed above of appending other journal articles \n     or data or analyses. The intent is that the statement be \n     limited to objective and scientific information and not \n     present an opportunity to editorialize independently-\n     derived scientific information. The statement is intended \n     to provide significant scientific information to the \n     health care providers.\n\n                            New Information\n\n       This section offers a safeguard to assure the health care \n     provider community that a disseminated journal article or \n     textbook which discusses an off label use will trigger an \n     update requirement in the event that the Secretary determines \n     that there is a risk that the drug may not be effective or \n     may present a significant risk to public health. The new \n     information submitted by the manufacturer will be in a form \n     prescribed by the Secretary in regulations. The Committee \n     notes that manufacturers are already legally required by \n     section 314.81 of volume 21 of the Code of Federal \n     Regulations to submit annual reports to the Secretary. As \n     opposed to the comprehensive data required under section \n     314.81, this requirement is limited to data on safety and \n     efficacy. The Committee assumes that this requirement will \n     not be burdensome, rather tailored to meet the public health \n     responsibilities to be exercised by the Secretary. In \n     addition, after the Secretary makes a finding under this \n     provision the Secretary is required to consult with the \n     manufacturer before determining what corrective actions are \n     commensurate with the public health need of the affected \n     health care provider community and what is in the best \n     interests of potentially affected patients.\n\n                          Rule of Construction\n\n       Subsection (d) provides that nothing in section 771 shall \n     be construed as prohibiting a manufacturer from disseminating \n     information in response to an unsolicited request from a \n     health care practitioner. The Committee has an interest in \n     ensuring that current agency policies that encourage \n     scientific exchange are not being modified by section 771. At \n     the same time, insofar as the Secretary may currently have \n     authority in other sections of the statute to restrict a \n     manufacturer's dissemination of information in response to an \n     unsolicited request from a health care practitioner, nothing \n     in section 771 is intended to change or limit that authority.\n\n Establishment of List of Articles and Textbooks Disseminated and List \n      of Providers That Received Articles and Reference Textbooks\n\n       In order to effectively implement the authority of the \n     Secretary to require corrective actions be taken by the \n     manufacturer, the regulations promulgated by the Secretary \n     may include record keeping requirements to make sure that \n     such corrective actions are effective. These record keeping \n     provisions should be tailored to meet the underlying purpose \n     of the provision requiring corrective action. For example, in \n     the case of new information under Section 771 that requires \n     an update of a disseminated article, it may be appropriate to \n     require the publication of an advertisement in the journal of \n     a specific medical specialty society; or, in other cases, a \n     ``Dear Doctor'' letter may be appropriate. It should not be \n     necessary for manufacturers to keep a list of all providers \n     who receive information disseminated under this section, if \n     the company is willing to notify by letter or advertisement a \n     larger group of health care providers in order to implement a \n     corrective action.\n\n\n                            pdufa sideletter\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I would like to have the chairman's \nunderstanding of the letter to be submitted by the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services concerning the performance goals of the FDA in \nconnection with the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee \nAct of 1997, PDUFA.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator from Maryland for raising this very \nimportant point. As with the 1992 law, I intend that the FDA's \nperformance goals that have been worked out between FDA and industry in \nthe PDUFA reauthorization be covered in a separate letter. The letter \nwill be sent by Secretary Shalala to Chairman Bliley and me, as well as \nthe distinguished ranking members of the House Commerce Committee, Mr. \nDingell, and our committee, Mr. Kennedy.\n  This letter is referenced in the findings section of the user fees \nprovisions of the bill. It will spell out in detail the performance \ngoals that FDA has agreed to meet for each of the 5 years of the \nreauthorized user fee law.\n  I consider the provisions that will be in the Secretary's letter and \nattachment to be as mandatory as if they were in the statute itself. I \nexpect the FDA will treat them as such just as it has with the \nprovisions in the 1992 letter.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. Chairman, I agree completely with what you just \nstated. The provisions that have been negotiated between FDA and \nindustry and set forth in the sideletter from the Secretary are a key \npart of PDUFA. These provisions cover electronic submissions, meeting \nmanagement goals, clinical holds, major dispute resolution, special \nprotocol question assessment and agreement, and additional procedures, \nsuch as action letters.\n  Not only should these performance goals be considered fully binding \non the agency, they should be considered as minimum, not maximum \ncommitments. If the agency can do better, it should. I know that FDA \nwill do its best to exceed the performance goals and other matters \nspelled out in the letter, just as it has exceeded its commitments in \nthe 1992 PDUFA letter.\n\n\n             Effective and aggressive oversight of the fda\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield to the Senator from Washington, a member of the \nSenate Labor and Human Resources Committee for purposes of engaging in \na colloquy.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. As a new member of the Senate Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee I have spent the last 8 months coming up to speed on the FDA, \nreform proposals and the impact of these proposals. I have met with \ngroups representing all sides on these issues--from the biotech \nindustry to groups representing patients. I have tried to keep an open \nmind and work to find acceptable solutions to the many problems pointed \nout by industry and the patient groups. There appears to be a general \nmistrust among all interested parties. As a result each side is \nconcerned about going too far--industry is concerned about burdensome \nand unnecessary regulation by FDA and the patients are concerned about \neffective regulation of the industry. It appears that this general \nmistrust is based on past experiences and each side can give numerous \nexamples.\n\n[[Page S9839]]\n\n  My objective was to revitalize the FDA to give it the regulatory \nflexibility to effectively regulate the pharmaceutical and medical \ndevice industry without jeopardizing timely approval of safe and \neffective lifesaving drugs and devices. At the same time, I am well \naware of the prominent public health role played by the FDA--it is \nafter all, a public health agency, not a drug or device manufacturer. \nMy support for real reforms by no means says that I did not support an \naggressive public health agency role for the FDA.\n  Several weeks ago, I met directly with several biotech companies in \nthe State of Washington. As I sat at the table listening to their \nconcerns I was struck by the amount of experience at the table and \nlevel of integrity that many of the companies are known for. I am proud \nto represent these companies that are on the cutting edge of medical \ntechnology and have contributed significantly to improving health care \nfor all Americans. I knew that those companies would not market a \ndangerous, life threatening drug or device; that none of these \ncompanies deliberately act to falsify clinical data or would refuse to \ncomplete clinical trials. I knew that these companies were more \nconcerned with getting their lifesaving technologies to patients than \nsimply making a profit. They know the value of one's reputation and are \ntruly proud of the lifesaving work they have done. Sadly, however, not \nall companies have the same commitment to the patient's health and are \nallowing stockholders, not scientists, to make decisions. Because of \nthis, I am asking for the Chairman's commitment that the Senate Labor \nand Human Resources Committee will retain a strong and aggressive \noversight role.\n  We are making some sweeping and some may argue dramatic changes in \nthe way the FDA operates. We need to be sure that these changes are \npositive and that FDA has the resources and ability to remain an \neffective public health agency. If we detect future problems or \nconflicts, I need your commitment and support for swift and thorough \nhearings. I need to know that we will continue to monitor the FDA, and \nif legislative revisions are necessary to protect the public health, we \nwill act with great speed. There is probably no other Member more \nhopeful that some of these reforms will means that patients get access \nto safe and effective drugs and devices sooner, but I also know that we \ncannot forget the past. There are certainly many examples of situations \nwhere the public health was put into jeopardy by unscrupulous \npharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. I need your assurances \nthat if problems arise we will act to address any potential threat to \nthe public health.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I share the Senator's goal of ensuring a strong FDA and \nbelieve the modernization and revitalization provisions included in S. \n830 make for a better FDA, not a weaker one. Like you I have had the \nopportunity to meet with industry groups here in Washington and with \nconsumers, patients, and physicians both here and at home in Vermont. \nAll of these interested parties have made important points about how to \nmodernize the agency while ensuring that its stellar standard for \npublic safety remain as strong as ever. Though Vermont doesn't have any \nof these large industries regulated by the FDA, all of us use their \nproducts. The people and the patient advocates of Vermont have told me \nthat more needs to be done to ensure their timely access to the best \ntherapies available. I believe we have accomplished that with this \nbill.\n  I think that the Senator from Washington would agree that it's \nimportant to put aside once and for all that consumers, patients, and \nphysicians universally oppose this measure. Vermont patient groups and \ntheir members--and I'm sure you have heard from your constituents--have \ntold me that they support this effort to modernize the FDA. The Vermont \nEpilepsy Association, the Vermont Medical Society, the Vermont \nAssociation for the Deaf, the Vermont Board of Pharmacy, the Vermont \nAlliance for the Mentally Ill, and the Epilepsy Foundation of Vermont \nhave all urged passage of the measure. At the national level we have \nheard from innumerable groups that support S. 830 and urge its passage. \nFor example, the National Health Council--which includes the Arthritis \nFoundation, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and the Leukemia \nSociety among its over 100 member organizations--took out a full-page \nadvertisement in the Roll Call newspaper urging that the Senate move \nforward with this legislation.\n  I agree with my colleague from Washington and you can be assured that \nif problems do arise, I would act quickly to address any threat to the \npublic health. Simply because we are authorizing PDUFA for 5 years does \nnot mean that we cannot change other sections of the Food, Drug and \nCosmetic Act. It could also turn out that some of these reforms, like \nexpanded third party review for medical devices, will become such a \nsuccess that the FDA will want to extend the program beyond the pilot \nphase.\n  Effective and aggressive oversight is one of the most important tools \nof the Labor and Human Resources Committee for making sure that the FDA \ncan keep pace with the rapid changes in medical technology and still be \na public health agency that is the envy of the world. I thank the \nSenator for her commitment to working toward real reforms that \nstrengthen the FDA and the contributions she has made in crafting this \nbipartisan measure.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chairman for his support and commitment to a \nstrong FDA and am grateful for his leadership on this legislation.\n\n\n                          pharmacy compounding\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I would like to engage my colleagues, \nSenator Jeffords, the distinguished chairman of the Labor and Resources \nCommittee, and Senator Hutchinson, the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas, regarding a provision in S. 830 pertaining to the practice of \npharmacy compounding.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would be pleased to enter into such a colloquy with \nthe distinguished Senators from Massachusetts and Arkansas.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First, I want to commend my colleagues and their staffs \nfor their efforts in the difficult task of drawing the line between \ndrug manufacturing and pharmacy compounding. Ordinary pharmacy \ncompounding has been traditionally regulated by the States, but drug \nmanufacturing, even when conducted by State-licensed pharmacists, is \nregulated under Federal law. Under current law, the Federal Food, Drug, \nand Cosmetic Act specifically exempts from the inspection and \nregistration provisions of the act pharmacies that compound drugs for \nsale in the regular course of dispensing or selling drugs at retail. \nHowever, FDA and the courts that have addressed the matter interpret \nthe act as not providing any general exemption from the new drug, \nadulteration, and misbranding provisions for drugs compounded by \npharmacists. It is my understanding that section 809 of S. 830 would \nbring the legal status of compounding in line with FDA's longstanding \nenforcement policy of regulating only drug manufacturing, not ordinary \npharmacy compounding. This legislation would, as I understand it, \nexempt drugs compounded in pharmacies from the new drug, and certain \nother, provisions of the act, but the exemption would not create a \nloophole that would allow unregulated drug manufacturing to occur under \nthe guise of pharmacy compounding.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. As the sponsor of the amendment that became section \n809 of S. 830, I concur with the distinguished ranking minority member \nof the Labor and Human Resources Committee that this legislation would \nensure patient access to individualized drug therapy, and prevent \nunnecessary FDA regulation of health professional practice. This \nlegislation would exempt pharmacy compounding from several regulatory \nrequirements but would not exempt drug manufacturing from the act's \nrequirements. The legislation also sets forth a number of conditions \nthat would have to be met in order to qualify for the exemption from \nthe act's requirements. I would note that the conditions established by \nsection 809 should be used by the State boards of pharmacy and medicine \nfor proper regulation of pharmacy compounding in addition to State-\nspecific regulations. When a State board determines that certain \ncompounding activities are outside the parameters established in \nsection 809, that State board should refer the practitioners in \nquestion to the FDA for review.\n\n[[Page S9840]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the distinguished Senator from Arkansas for \ndescribing the reasons why this section is so important to patients and \nto the health professions. I want to especially commend his staff for \nworking with mine to develop this legislation that exempts from Federal \nlaw the activities that are appropriately regulated by the States.\n  It is my understanding that some of the conditions are intended to \nensure that the volume of compounding does not approach that ordinarily \nassociated with drug manufacturing. Other conditions appear to be \nintended to ensure that the compounded drugs that qualify for the \nexemption have appropriate assurances of quality and safety since these \ncompounded drugs would not be subject to the more comprehensive \nregulatory requirements that apply to manufactured drug products.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I believe the Senator is correct in his understanding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise in support of S. 830, the FDA \nModernization Act. This bill provides comprehensive--and long overdue \nreform to the FDA.\n  The primary focus of S. 830 is to streamline and strengthen the FDA's \nreview and approval of lifesaving drugs and medical devices. One \nimportant mechanism for doing this is the Prescription Drug User Fee \nAct [PDUFA]. PDUFA authorizes the FDA to use fees collected from \nprescription drug manufacturers to expedite the FDA's review of drugs. \nThe fees collected go to hiring new employees to increase the FDA's \nresources for reviewing new drugs.\n  With all of the advances in science and medicine, we must ensure the \nswift review of new drugs for life-threatening diseases. When there are \nbacklogs and delays in drug approval, American lives can be lost. For \nexample:\n  The 7-year delay in the FDA's eventual approval of beta blocker heart \nmedicines cost the lives of 119,000 Americans; and\n  The FDA's 3\\1/2\\-year delay in approving the new drug Interleukin-2 \n(IL-2) cost 25,000 Americans to die of kidney cancer, even though the \ndrug already had been approved for use in nine other countries.\n  This bill is good because it will give Americans access to lifesaving \nmedication, without needless delay.\n  I would like to share with you the story of one man from my home \nState of New Mexico who would benefit from this bill.\n  Leonard Alderete is 39 years old and has lived in Albuquerque, NM all \nof his life. In 1987, Leonard was diagnosed HIV positive. Five years \nlater, Leonard sought medical intervention because his condition \nworsened and he feared his life would end. Leonard began taking the \nstandard AZT. In 1996, Leonard's health again took a downturn. Blood \ntests revealed that the virus had spread at an alarming rate through \nhis system. In order to slow the spread of the virus, Leonard needed an \naggressive treatment.\n  Leonard's doctor prescribed the drug regiment of 3TC, AZT, and \nCrixivan, which is also known as a triple cocktail. A key drug in this \nmixture is the protease inhibitor, Crixivan. Through PDUFA, Crixivan \nwas made available to consumers within 3 months of its submission to \nthe FDA. Shortly thereafter, Leonard began taking Crixivan.\n  Thanks to the ``triple cocktail,'' the virus is now below detectable \nlevels. Although this is not a cure, it does provide Leonard hope--a \nmore long-term hope for the future.\n  Leonard is a member of the Governor's task force on HIV/AIDS. He is \nthe only member who has HIV. As a member of the Task Force, he \nadvocates for the rights of those who are HIV infected--as well as \nthose in the community who are affected.\n  Leonard has written, called, and even traveled to my office in \nWashington, DC two times this year to urge my support for this bill. \nLeonard provides testimonial for the importance of FDA reform, and \nespecially PDUFA.\n  Fortunately, patients afflicted with AIDS as well as other life \nthreatening diseases have a ``Leonard'' advocating for them. There are \nmany other Leonards both silent and vocal all across the country who \nwill benefit from this bill. It is on their behalf that I urge my \ncolleagues to support S. 830.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Madam President, I support S. 830, the Food and \nDrug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997. I \nalso want to commend Senators Jeffords and Kennedy for their hard work \non this legislation, and the compromises that will ultimately improve \nthe FDA and improve the public's access to cutting edge medical \ntechnology.\n  Despite recent improvements, I am concerned that the length of time \nand amount of paperwork required for FDA approval of new products may \nstill be excessive. For many companies desiring to market new products, \napplication to the FDA is a formidable obstacle. In some cases, the \nlength and complexity of the process can deter companies from even \napplying. This is a particularly troubling prospect given the \nincreasing globalization of markets for health care products and food.\n  The FDA cannot continue to protect the public health through its \ntraditional methods. Most industrialized and emerging nations \nparticipate in multilateral trade agreements that aim to reduce trade \nbarriers. These agreements will continue to bring pressure on the FDA \nto harmonize its regulatory policies with other international safety \nand performance standards. The policies that have made the United \nStates the ``gold standard'' in public health protection must be \nreformed to function properly in this global economy. This does not \nmean that we cannot continue to be the gold standard. It simply means \nthat market forces will bring pressure on the FDA to implement policies \nthat encourage the launching of new products in this country, as \nopposed to Europe, and ensures that the United States maintains its \ntechnical and scientific leadership in health disciplines.\n  As stewards of this generation, we must move to strike the balance \nbetween protecting the public health, fostering global trade under \nmultilateral agreements, ensuring swift access to new health technology \nfor Americans, and strengthening the U.S. technical and scientific \nleadership. S. 830 is a very good effort to balance those sometimes \ncompeting goals.\n  First, the bill reauthorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee Act \n[PDUFA] for an additional 5 years. PDUFA has been one the most \nsuccessful pieces of governmental reform legislation. During the 5 \nyears since we first passed PDUFA, the average approval time for \npharmaceutical products has dropped over 40 percent. There is still \nmore room for improvement. Many product reviews remain cumbersome, and \napplicants at times do not have a clear indication of the type of \ninformation necessary for FDA review.\n  S. 830 also makes considerable progress in expediting patients access \nto important new therapies and potentially life-saving experimental \ntreatments. Just a few months ago, one of my constituents encountered \nconsiderable bureaucratic red-tape in her effort to access a \npotentially life-saving treatment for Hodgkin's disease. Only after \ncountless appeals by my office and hundreds of my constituents did the \nFDA acquiesce. The troubling part of this incident was that the FDA had \napproved the same treatment for other patients several years prior. \nThis is not to say that the people who work at the FDA were not \nfollowing their current guidelines. They were probably following the \nguidelines to the letter. But the spirit of the FDA's mission was \nutterly lost in the process. S. 830 makes the much needed reforms.\n\n  Along the same lines, the bill also establishes a national registry \nof clinical trials. The primary impediment to patients access to \npotentially life-saving treatment is not the FDA but actually a lack of \nknowledge about ongoing research. A national database, which patients \ncan access, will greatly assist people across the Nation who are \nsearching for hope for their illnesses. This important reform is long \noverdue and absolutely necessary to continue providing Americans the \nbest in medical treatment and technology.\n  Finally, the bill strikes an appropriate balance between protecting \nthe public interests and allowing manufacturers to share important off-\nlabel use information with providers. It would have been a grave \nmistake to either prevent the distribution of off-label use information \nor not allow the FDA to play a vital role in ensuring the adequacy of \ninformation being distributed by manufacturers. I know that a lot of \nwork went into the compromise\n\n[[Page S9841]]\n\nreached regarding off-label usage information and the agreement greatly \nbenefits the American public.\n  I would like to congratulate the architects of legislation including \npatient and industry groups who worked so hard to achieve balance. \nPatients groups are to be especially congratulated for their steadfast \npursuit of this reform. Just 2 weeks ago, I met with some of my \nconstituents who have multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral \nsclerosis--also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. Their message was loud \nand clear--pass FDA reform now. This is a resounding message that I \ncannot ignore.\n  Madam President, it is equally important to say that this legislation \nis not meant as an attack on the efforts of the women and men who work \nat FDA. I have great respect for the role that the agency and its \nemployees play in protecting consumers from unsafe and ineffective \nhealthcare, food, and cosmetic products. The FDA has taken a number of \nsteps over the last several years to streamline administrative \nfunctions and work better with industry and consumers to facilitate the \navailability of cutting edge medical technology. The success that FDA \nhas achieved in reducing the time to review new drugs and get \npotentially life-saving therapies on the market is laudable. The \nreviewers at FDA should take pride in these accomplishments. This \nlegislation simply builds on those reforms.\n  My support for S. 830 should not be construed as a complete \nendorsement of the bill. This is not a perfect piece of legislation. \nThere are features that patient advocates, industry, and regulators \nsimply do not support. Senator Kennedy has done a good job of \nhighlighting some of the issues and there have been a number of \namendments accepted that further improve the bill.\n  I am particularly concerned that the bill does not adequately address \nfood safety, which will certainly emerge as a major public health \nissue. Most of the recent criticism of the FDA has focused on the \nbiologics and medical technology areas. Regulation of imported food \nproducts will probably be the pressing issue of the next millennium. As \nmore imported agricultural products find their way to American tables, \nthere will be more pressure upon FDA to act to prevent tainted products \nfrom getting to the market.\n  Nonetheless, reform is absolutely necessary and S. 830 is a good \nstart in that direction. This bill represents a full year of work by \nstakeholders aimed at reaching compromise legislation. The bill does \nnot contain the draconian hammer provisions that made many of us \nreluctant to support FDA reform last year. I am happy to have a bill \nthat I can support and that I truly believe moves the country in the \nright direction. S. 830 is good for patients, good for the industry, \nand good for the Nation's global competitiveness. I hope that my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this important legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, in 1906, Congress approved the first \nnational statute to prevent the sale of adulterated and misbranded food \nand drugs. Since then, the FDA's responsibility to protect the health \nand safety of American consumers from unsafe products has expanded to \ncover over one-third of the products sold in our Nation.\n  While medical research and technological developments have \nrevolutionized our Nation's capacity to advance the public health, the \nFDA's adherence to bureaucratic and inefficient practices threatens to \nundermine the potential benefit of these hard-earned innovations. In \nthe 1950's, it took a new drug or medical device approximately 8 years \nor less to achieve FDA approval. Today, the average time for approval \nruns between 12 to 15 years. Over the course of 20 years, the FDA's \nproduct approval system has undergone careful study by Congress, \ninvestigational committees, and the FDA itself, and each has identified \nkey areas of reform that would enhance FDA performance.\n  This week, the U.S. Senate considers vital legislation to ensure that \nthe FDA can successfully fulfill its core mission to protect public \nhealth and safety through priority management, timely review of product \napplications, and effective use of expert resources. S. 830, the Food \nand Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act, reflects \nthe fundamental recommendation of the Advisory Committee on the Food \nand Drug Administration that the FDA ``should be guided by the \nprinciple that expeditious approval of useful and safe new products \nenhances the health of the American people.'' The Advisory Committee \nnoted that product approval ``can be as important as preventing the \nmarketing of harmful or ineffective products, . . . especially . . . \nfor people with life-threatening illnesses and for diseases for which \nalternative therapies have not been approved.'' In other words, \nantiquated procedures that promote unnecessary delays in the review of \nnew products and therapies fail to promote the public health.\n  In recent weeks, misinformation regarding the purpose and application \nof S. 830 reforms has been disseminated. As a supporter of S. 830 and a \nmember of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, I want to \nclarify the objectives of this important legislative initiative.\n  First, this bill clearly sets forth the FDA's mission to protect the \npublic health by ensuring products meet appropriate regulatory \nstandards, and to act promptly and efficiently in its review of \nclinical research and other information relevant to the marketing of \napproved products.\n  Second, S. 830 responds to increasing public concern on the lack of \naccess to investigational products for patients suffering from serious \nor life-threatening diseases. The FDA has established programs for the \ncompassionate use of investigational products, however, only a limited \nnumber of patients have benefited from these opportunities. This bill \nwill enable any patient with a seriously debilitating or immediately \nlife-threatening condition to gain access to an investigational drug or \ndevice if the request is made by a licensed physician and the product's \nuse meets the FDA's standards for expanded access. S. 830 also improves \npatient access to new therapies through a new fast-track drug approval \nprocess.\n  Third, the bill addresses key deficiencies in the assessment of \npharmaceutical effects on children. Currently, there is no systematic \nmeans for testing drug safety and efficacy for pediatric use. S. 830 \nwill allow the Secretary to request pediatric clinical trials for new \ndrug applications and provide an extra 6 months of market exclusivity \nto manufacturers who voluntarily meet conditions under the trial \nprogram.\n  Fourth, this measure will improve the availability of health care \neconomics information for medical providers, and create data bases \nabout on-going research and clinical trials for new lifesaving \ntherapies for patients. Access to clear, concise information will help \nboth health care professionals and patients identify the best course of \nmedical treatment available.\n  Fifth, S. 830 contains a series of reforms to assure that the FDA \nutilizes the scientific expertise of qualified Federal agencies, like \nthe National Institutes of Health, and accredited outside organizations \nin order to improve the timeliness and quality of product reviews. The \nbill also contains reforms to ensure that the application process for \nnew products is governed by consistent and equitable regulatory \nrequirements in the areas of product classification, review, and \napproval.\n  Sixth, this measure reaffirms the FDA's accountability for the \nperformance of its Federal obligations. As a member of the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee for Agriculture, I have repeatedly \nquestioned the FDA regarding its failure to prioritize resources for \nthe fulfillment of its statutory requirements. In response to these \nconcerns, S. 830 requires the FDA to develop a clear plan outlining how \nit will comply with its obligations under Federal statute, and report \nto Congress annually on the plan's implementation. In addition, the FDA \nmust streamline and update procedures for product review and inspection \nso its resources are applied cost effectively.\n  Seventh, S. 830 contains targeted reforms for food regulation. The \nbill simplifies the approval process for indirect food contact \nsubstances. It provides a more reasonable standard for the use of bona \nfide health claims based on the authoritative recommendations of \nqualified scientific bodies, such as the National Institutes of Health \nand the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While food reforms \ntake on a minor role in this bill, I look forward\n\n[[Page S9842]]\n\nto working with my fellow members on legislation that will more \nthoroughly address the regulatory concerns of the food industry.\n  Finally, S. 830 reauthorizes the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. In \n1992, the FDA and pharmaceutical industry agreed to the collection of \nadditive user fees to pay for the additional staff needed to rectify \ndelays in the review of new drug applications. This reauthorization \nproposal seeks to build upon those successes through new performance \ngoals and equipment modernization plans. PDUFA serves as a clear \nexample that the FDA can work with regulated industry and consumers to \nadvance the public health through priority management and efficient use \nof resources.\n  Madam President, S. 830 has been formed brick by brick from \ninclusive, bipartisan negotiations by representatives of the FDA, the \nClinton administration, the U.S. Senate, industry, and consumer groups. \nThe purpose of this bill is not to weaken the FDA's ability to defend \nthe public health, but rather to enhance its capacity to fulfill this \nstatutory obligation. Whether the issue is food safety or a \nbreakthrough medical treatment, our Nation's researchers will only be \nsuccessful if the FDA is prepared to effectively respond to the \nquickening pace of scientific discovery. S. 830 lays this essential \nfoundation for the FDA's future, and I urge my colleagues to join in \nits approval.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise today to address S. 830, the Food \nand Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997. \nThis is an important bill with serious implications for the health of \nthe American people.\n  The FDA is responsible for assuring that the Nation's food supply is \npure and healthy as well as providing a guarantee that drugs and \nmedical devices are safe and effective. The FDA has an immense impact \non the lives of all Americans. Few government agencies provide this \nkind of important protection for the American people. Indeed, the FDA's \nmandate requires it to regulate over one-third of our Nation's \nproducts. Daily, the FDA faces the delicate balance between ensuring \nthat patients have swift access to new drugs and devices, while \nguaranteeing that those new products are safe and effective.\n  S. 830 contains many positive elements. It reauthorizes the important \nPrescription Drug User Fee Act, one of the most effective regulatory \nreforms ever enacted. S. 830 also includes a number of provisions that \nwill improve and sensibly streamline the regulation of prescription \ndrugs, biologic products, and medical devices. I believe that these \nimportant reforms to the operation of the Food and Drug Administration \nwill increase its efficiency and speed the delivery of important new \nmedical treatments to patients.\n  One of the most important elements of this legislation is the \nreauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, often referred \nto as PDUFA. PDUFA established an important partnership between the \nagency and the industry, and has successfully streamlined the drug \napproval process.\n  I am pleased that S. 830 will provide expedited access to \ninvestigational therapies. This provision builds on current FDA \nprograms related to AIDS and cancer drugs. Another important element \nwill allow designation of some drugs as fast track drugs, thus \nfacilitating development and expediting approval of new drugs for the \ntreatment of serious or life-threatening conditions. The bill will also \nrequire the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to \nestablish a database on the status of clinical trials relating to the \ntreatment, detection, and prevention of serious or life-threatening \ndiseases and conditions. Patients have long deserved access to such \ninformation, and I am pleased that this bill provides it.\n  S. 830 is the result of ongoing negotiations both prior to and \nsubsequent to the markup of the legislation. Through this process, a \nnumber of provisions that seriously threatened public health and safety \nwere dropped or otherwise resolved. I am particularly pleased that \nimprovements made since the markup include important protections to the \nthird party review process. Important changes have also been made to \nprovisions regarding health claims for food products, health care \neconomic claims and a number of other provisions in the original \nlegislation.\n  Yet, there was one important change that was not made to S. 830. \nYesterday, along with Senators Kennedy, Bingaman, and Durbin, I offered \nan amendment that would make a change on device labeling claims--an \nissue that has been identified by the Secretary of HHS as worthy of a \nrecommendation to the President to veto this bill. Although our \namendment did not prevail, I am still hopeful that this issue can be \nresolved as the bill continues through the legislative process.\n  In effect, the bill limits the FDA's current authority to ask device \nmanufacturers for safety data. It prohibits the FDA from considering \nhow a new device could be used if the manufacturer has not included \nthat use in the proposed labeling application. As a general matter, the \nFDA does not consider uses that the manufacturer has not included in \nits proposed labeling materials. However, there are instances when the \nlabel does not tell the whole story. It is these instances--when the \nlabel is false or misleading--that our amendment addressed.\n  I am disappointed that we were not able to resolve this one issue, \nbecause the rest of the bill is worthy of support. However, I am unable \nto support this bill today because the device labeling issue remains \nunresolved. This matter is too important to the health and safety of \nAmericans to vote for S. 830 at this time.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to resolve the issue of \nthe FDA's authority in the device approval process. And when this issue \nis resolved, I am prepared to vote in favor of this bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I want to begin my remarks by \nacknowledging the tremendous amount of work both Senator Jeffords and \nSenator Kennedy have put into this bill. I know there are a few issues \nwhere there is still disagreement. I also realize that some of my \ncolleagues may be offering amendments which they believe will \nstrengthen the bill.\n  On balance, however, I believe this is a good bill that will have a \nvery positive impact on helping to streamline and expedite some of the \nFDA review processes; and thus, help patients get access to new and \npromising treatments and devices in a safe, efficient, and expeditious \nmanner. There is no agency within the Federal Government which has as \ndirect or significant an impact on the American people as the Food and \nDrug Administration.\n  The FDA is responsible for ensuring the foods that we eat are safe, \nwholesome, sanitary, and properly labeled, that the drugs that we take, \nand that we give our pets, are safe and effective and that there is a \nreasonable assurance that the medical devices which we use are safe and \neffective. I believe the FDA has done, and continues to do, a \ntremendous job in carrying out this mission--it is internationally \nrecognized as the gold standard for the approval of medical products.\n  The most important aspect of any FDA reform bill must be public \nsafety. We have the safest food, drugs, and medical devices of any \ncountry in the world; and nothing we do should ever undermine this--\nperiod.\n  I also believe, however, that rapid technological advancements being \nmade by biotechnology companies, and others, necessitate, and allow \nfor, an expeditious product review and approval process. Obviously, \nthis product review and approval process must simultaneously assure \nsafety and efficacy. Again, safety and efficacy should not be \ncompromised.\n  Let me share with my colleagues an example of the technological \nadvances being made by the biotechnology industry. Affymax, a \nbiotechnology company located in my home State of California, has \ndeveloped a technology to speed-up the analysis of drug and biological \ncompounds.\n  Affymax is a leader in the emerging field of combinatorial chemistry. \nCombinatorial chemistry functions by creating large numbers of diverse \ncompounds to test against different disease targets. Affymax combines \nchemistries, sophisticated software and innovative molecular biology \ntechniques to rapidly analyze and synthesize these potentially useful \ndrug and biological compounds.\n  I know about this process because I had the pleasure of seeing it \nwhen I\n\n[[Page S9843]]\n\ntoured Affymax's laboratories last year. Affymax has greatly \naccelerated the pace of drug discoveries by developing high technology \nautomated machines which can synthesize and screen 10,000 compounds in \njust one week. The same testing, previously done in test tubes and \npetri dishes, used to take about 5 years.\n  These are the kinds of advancements which I believe make it necessary \nfor the FDA to streamline its process, in those areas which can be \nstreamlined, so that patients may get safe and effective products as \nexpeditiously as possible. There are literally hundreds of thousands of \npatients around the country waiting for the next new and promising drug \ntherapy and/or device to be approved.\n  There are, of course, other very important aspects of this bill. Not \nthe least of which is the reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User \nFee Act--commonly referred to as PDUFA.\n  PDUFA is generally considered the most successful piece of FDA reform \nlegislation in recent history. It enables the FDA to collect user fees \nfrom pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Those fees are used to \npay the salaries of hundreds of additional product reviewers and to \nfund product review. As a result, the FDA is able to speed-up its drug \napproval process and to more expeditiously get new and promising drug \ntherapies, and medical devices, to those that need them.\n  By all measures, PDUFA has been enormously successful. One measure of \nthat success is the assertion by all parties involved--the FDA, \npatients, prescription drug manufacturers, consumer groups, and \npolicymakers--that the program has worked. Certainly any program that \nreceives the unanimous support of industry, consumer groups, the FDA, \nand policymakers must be extremely beneficial and should continue to be \nsupported.\n  This bill has other constructive elements as well. For example, the \nbill allows for expedited access to investigational drug therapies and \nfor the expanded humanitarian use of devices. The bill also provides an \nincentive for drug manufacturers to conduct studies which support the \nsafety and effectiveness of pediatric drugs and it provides for \nexpanded collaboration and communication between the FDA and device \nmanufacturers.\n  The pediatric drug provision in this bill is especially important \ninasmuch as the overwhelming number of drugs on the market today are \nnot tested for safety and effectiveness on children. It is important, \ntherefore, that we provide drug manufacturers an incentive to test \ntheir products on children.\n  I believe this provision, which gives drug manufacturers an \nadditional 6 months of market exclusivity, is a reasonable and \nappropriate incentive, and will be a first step toward getting more \ndrugs labeled for pediatric use. A very important and significant goal.\n  I am also excited about the provision in this bill which allows for \nexpanded communication and collaboration between the FDA and device \nmanufacturers. It is important that device manufacturers and FDA \nexaminers, early on in the review process, clearly establish the type \nof scientific evidence that will be necessary to demonstrate device \neffectiveness. Not only will this provision help bring about increased \nclarity and certainty in the review process, it will also help speed \nsafe and effective devices to market. I believe this is especially \nimportant given the rapid technological advancements being made in this \narea.\n  Finally, I want to thank Senators Gregg and Jeffords for working with \nme to ensure that California's proposition 65 will not be preempted by \nthe uniformity provisions of this bill. California's proposition 65 was \npassed by California voters in 1986 and requires that persons who \nexpose others to certain levels of carcinogens or reproductive toxins \ngive a clear and reasonable warning.\n  Proposition 65 has successfully reduced toxic contaminants in a \nnumber of consumer products sold in California and it has even led the \nFDA to adopt more stringent standards for some consumer products. For \nexample, proposition 65 has been used successfully to reduce toxic \ncontaminants in ceramic dishware and in lead-foil wine bottle caps. \nNotably, the FDA followed the lead of California in both those \ninstances. In fact, the FDA has adopted a standard completely barring \nthe use of lead-foil wine bottle caps pursuant to California's \nagreement with the wine industry to convert to tin or plastic bottle \ncaps. So I am very pleased that the FDA reform bill now being debated \nwill exempt California's proposition 65.\n  As I stated at the outset, I believe, on balance, this is a good bill \nand will be beneficial in helping to get safe and effective drugs and \ndevices to the American people in a more expeditious manner.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, S. 830, the bill before us today, \nwill improve the tools used by the Federal Food and Drug Administration \nto bring more, safe and effective drugs, biologics and medical devices \nto the American people more quickly.\n  FDA is one of our Government's most important agencies because FDA \napproves life-saving medicines and devices and FDA protects us from \nunsafe and ineffective medicines and devices. Thanks to FDA, products \nlike defective heart pacemakers, dangerous intrauterine devices, and \noverheating infant incubators are not sold.\n  FDA's 2,100 scientists and 7,000 other employees monitor about $1 \ntrillion worth of products each year, inspect over 15,000 facilities a \nyear, and examine about 80,000 product samples. FDA finds about 3,000 \nproducts a year unfit for consumers and detains 30,000 imports a year \nat ports of entry.\n\n\n                      Hope for Cures for Diseases\n\n  Millions of Americans have serious, debilitating illnesses for which \nthere is no treatment or cure. There are 3,000 to 4,000 genetic \ndiseases alone. Cancer kills half a million Americans per year. \nDiabetes afflicts 15 million Americans a year, half of whom do not even \nknow they have it. Fifteen thousand American children die every year. \nAnd, for children, the rates of asthma, bronchitis, sinusitis, heart \nmurmurs, epilepsy, and anemia are on the rise. We put our faith in the \nmedical industry and Government to find cures and therapies. Americans \nwant an FDA that brings safe and effective drugs to market as quickly \nas possible to alleviate suffering, pain, and disease and to prevent \ndeath.\n  The bulk of the bill before us today, a bill to accelerate the \napproval of prescription drugs, biologics, and devices, is an important \nbill to the Nation and especially to my State. It is a good bill, \nexcept for section 807, ``National Uniformity'', provisions that could \ninterfere with California's efforts to protect the public health laws.\n\n\n                           California's Role\n\n  California is the Nation's premier medical technology base, public \nand private. Many of the Nation's leading drug, biotech, and device \ncompanies collaborate with the State's nine academic medical centers \nand conduct some of the world's leading health research. The UC system \nhas spawned 30 Nobel laureates. Forty percent of California's biotech \ncompanies were started by UC scientists.\n  The Nation's largest concentration of health care technology \ncompanies is in California who employ 165,000 people. California's 900 \nhealth care technology companies are producing leading edge products, \nfor example, the first new therapy for cystic fibrosis in 30 years, \nGenentech; technology that enables doctors to do heart surgery without \nopening the chest cavity, Heartport; a cancer drug that is genetically \nengineered and stimulates the bone marrow to produce important white \nblood cells, Amgen; and linear accelerators for treating cancer, \nVarian, and intraocular eye lenses, Allergan.\n  California produces 19 percent of all U.S. medical instruments, 20 \npercent of all diagnostic materials, and 13 percent of all biologics. \nThere are 915 drugs, biologics, and devices under development in my \nState.\n  So the bill before us is important to both the human health and the \neconomic health of the Nation and of California.\n\n\n                             Key Provisions\n\n  The bill includes several improvements over current law that will \nbring more drugs, medical devices, and biotech products to people more \nquickly:\n  1. Extends User Fees: Extends for 5 years the Prescription Drug User \nFee Act to accelerate drug and biologics approvals. The prescription \ndrug user fees, enacted in 1992, have enabled FDA to hire 600 \nadditional drug reviewers and FDA has cut drug approval times almost in \nhalf, from 29.2 months in 1992\n\n[[Page S9844]]\n\nto 15.5 months in 1996, according to the drug industry. This means that \npatients have had access to drugs almost a year sooner. These include a \nnew class of drugs for asthma; a new treatment for multiple sclerosis; \nfive new cancer drugs; the first new insulin product in 14 years; and \nthree new antiviral medicines for AIDS, including two protease \ninhibitors.\n  This bill reflects the agreement of the drug and biotech industries \nto pay over $500 million in new user fees over the next 5 years, which \ncould bring to the public 1,000 medicines now in the pipeline. These \nrenewed user fees could help FDA cut drug approval times even more, an \nadditional 10 to 16 months.\n  2. Clinical Trials Database (the Feinstein-Snowe bill): Requires NIH \nto establish a database, including a 1-800 number, for patients and \nmedical providers to obtain information on clinical trials on serious \nand life-threatening diseases. This provision incorporates S. 87, a \nbill I introduced with Senator Snowe, last August, was suggested by one \nof my constituents in a hearing of the Senate Cancer Coalition, which I \nco-chair. Facilitating access to information can help patients and \ntheir doctors learn about research underway and can expand the pool of \nresearch participants.\n  4. Pediatric Drugs: Provides 6 months of additional market \nexclusivity of a drug when the manufacturer, at the request of the FDA, \nconducts pediatric studies to support pediatric labeling for a drug.\n  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, only 20 percent of \ndrugs have been tested and proven to be safe and effective for use in \ninfants and children. This creates serious problems for pediatricians \nwho must prescribe with inadequate information or deny children \nimportant therapies. In a July 24 letter to me, they give the example \nof asthma and say that in most children it manifests itself by age \nfive, but there is only one asthma drug labeled for children under age \nfive.\n  5. Accelerating Approvals: The bill includes a number of provisions \ndesigned to modernize, streamline, and accelerate the drug and device \napproval process. For example, it allows products manufactured at a \nsmall or pilot facility to demonstrate safety and efficacy prior to \nscaling up to full manufacturing, unless FDA determines that a full-\nscale facility is necessary to ensure safety and effectiveness.\n  For biotech products, it establishes one license, rather than the \ncurrent two, covering both the biologics or product license and the \nplant's manufacturing processes license . For medical devices it \nrequires FDA to meet with manufacturers to establish the type of \nscientific data needed to demonstrate efficacy of the device and it \nrequires FDA and the applicant to meet to evaluate the status of an \napplication 100 days after submitting applications.\n\n\n               PreEmpting California's Public Health Laws\n\n  California has a long history of regulating nonprescription drugs and \ncosmetics and has led the Nation in many instances in protecting the \npublic in these areas. For example, in 1981, California adopted a \nrequirement that nonprescription drugs carry a label warning pregnant \nor nursing women to consult with their physician or pharmacist prior to \nusing a drug. In the following year, FDA adopted the California \nrequirement.\n  But section 807 of the bill, titled ``National Uniformity,'' \nrestricts States' actions by prohibiting States from establishing or \ncontinuing, for nonprescription drugs, any requirement that is \n``different from or in addition to or that is otherwise not identical \nwith'' a Federal requirement. For cosmetics, Section 807 prohibits \nstates from establishing or continuing requirements for packaging and \nlabeling that are ``different from or in addition to or that is \notherwise not identical with'' a Federal requirement.\n  California Attorney General Lungren, in a July 14 letter, cites the \nSherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law as an example. He argues, ``* * * \nwe are concerned that this provision may be construed to preempt States \nfrom imposing any requirements on cosmetics or over-the-counter drugs, \nand could therefore prevent the State of California from enforcing \nsignificant laws dealing with the health and safety of its citizens in \nthe absence of a specific FDA exemption.''\n  The California Department of Health Services has also raised concerns \nabout the preemption language, concern about the bill's impact on their \nability to protect the public health. I believe in allowing States to \nenact stronger laws to protect the health of citizens and introduced an \namendment on September 15 to allow California's laws to stand.\n  I appreciate the colloquy of my colleague and the bill manager, \nSenator Jeffords, that clarifies the extent of preemption intended by \nthe authors of the bill. Senator Jeffords clarified that it is not the \nintent of this bill to prohibit the state from issuing public \nstatements to warn the public about public health dangers. He said that \nit is not the intent of the bill to preempt State enforcement authority \nsuch as California's power to embargo products and to license and \nannually inspect facilities. On advertising, he stated that it is not \nthe intent of the bill to affect State laws that prohibit false and \nmisleading advertising or to prohibit unsubstantiated claims for \nnonprescription drugs. My office will remain in communication with the \nState to determine if problems develop and work with Senators Jeffords \nand Kennedy in this regard.\n  The bill does include, at my request, an explicit protection--an \nexemption from preemption--for California's ``Proposition 65,'' a \nballot initiative enacted in 1986 on a 63 to 37 percent vote which \nrequires anyone exposing someone to chemicals known to cause cancer or \nbirth defects to give a warning. Attorney General Lungren wrote on July \n14 to Senator Jeffords, ``S. 830 [as reported from the Labor Committee] \nwould, in the absence of specific FDA exemption, appear to prevent the \nState of California from enforcing both the Sherman Food, Drug and \nCosmetic Law as well as Proposition 65, a state `Right to Know' \nstatute, passed by the voters of California in 1986. * * * We therefore \nrespectfully urge you to seek modification of your bill to address this \nissue.''\n  Proposition 65 has provided important protections to the public and \nhas prompted manufacturers to reformulate products. Because of this \nlaw, for example, manufacturers removed toluene from nail polish, lead \nfrom antacids, and calcium supplements and leadfoil from wine bottles. \nI am pleased that the Senate agreed with my request to explicitly \nexempt proposition 65, preserving this important California law, and I \nthank my colleagues for their support.\n  I believe it is wrong to preempt California's progressive drug and \ncosmetic laws. The citizens of my State have chosen to safeguard the \npublic health through a strong State law and I have worked to protect \nour State's laws in this bill.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  By extending prescription drug user fees, we can give FDA some of the \nresources it needs to bring products to the public and alleviate human \nsuffering. I hope that this bill can move quickly to enactment so that \nthe public will have a strong FDA.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I take this opportunity to thank my \ncolleagues for all of the hard work that they have done on S. 830, the \nFDA Modernization and Improvement Act of 1997. Senator Jeffords has \nprovided his leadership in bringing this legislation forward, and my \nother colleagues have worked to negotiate agreement on provisions where \nthere was concern. I would like to thank Senator Coats, who was true to \nhis word that he would work with us to come to an agreement on third \nparty issues, and Senator Gregg, who worked to reach a compromise on \nthe national uniformity provision.\n  It is my belief that we can provide medical products to consumers in \na more timely manner through many of the provisions in this bill, while \nretaining significant consumer protections. Many of the provisions in \nS. 830 will take a significant step toward addressing Americans' \nconcerns with the FDA. The legislation would improve the \npredictability, timeliness and focus of the regulatory process for \nmedical products. The legislation would also improve communication and \ncollaboration between the FDA and the regulated industries. I strongly \nendorse the view that these objectives can be met\n\n[[Page S9845]]\n\nand unnecessary regulatory burdens can be minimized without \ncompromising the quality of the reviews.\n  My colleagues and I have worked very hard on bringing forward needed \nreform proposals with respect to the review and approval of medical \ndevices. We have negotiated many of the original provisions in the bill \nto the point that we have reached agreement on them, and can join \ntogether in supporting them. We have taken into consideration the \ncomments and concerns of consumers and industry in order to present a \nbill that will improve the review and approval processes.\n  As you know, I have always been and will continue to be a strong \nconsumer advocate. I think that S. 830 provides many things for \nconsumers and will help to bring them medical therapies that are safe \nand effective in a more timely fashion. This is especially true with \nrespect to devices. This is the part of the bill on which I have \nfocused the bulk of my attention, and I do think that a large number of \nconcerns that I and some of my colleagues, in particular Senator \nKennedy, had have been addressed.\n  There has been a great deal of discussion and debate about section \n404 of the bill, which deals with labeling for intended use of devices. \nThis issue is highly technical, but it is clear that all of us have the \nsame goals in mind: First, to provide a degree of consistency in the \nway devices are reviewed by individual reviewers, so that reviewers do \nnot try to second guess an honest manufacturer with respect to the \nintended use of a device, and second, to prevent the very few companies \nwho might try to avoid presenting the FDA with adequate data about \nsafety and effectiveness from having their devices classified and \nbrought to market under the 510(k) process. I do not believe that the \nprovision in this bill prohibits the FDA from exercising its authority \nto not find a device substantially equivalent to its predicate device \nwhen there are technological differences that raise new issues of \nsafety and effectiveness. But obviously, there are differences of \nopinion with respect to this provision. Since we all agree on the goals \nthat we are trying to achieve, I think that there must be a way of \nclarifying the authority of the FDA in a way that is satisfactory to \neveryone.\n  The Reed-Kennedy amendment offered one option, but this option is not \nthe appropriate one. Several other suggestions for language to clarify \nthis have been offered, but none capture what we are all trying to do. \nRather than reiterate all of the arguments that were stated in the \ndebate over the past several days, I will ask that my colleagues who \nare appointed as conferees work together to ensure that this provision \nis worded to make clear that it will penalize anyone who tries to get \naround the law, but will not penalize those who are complying with the \nintent of Congress and the law.\n  Madam President, as I have said before, I think this is an important \npiece of legislation. It is clearly important that we reauthorize and \nimprove PDUFA, and that we work to bring safe and effective medical \ntherapies to the public in a timely manner. Again, I would like to \nthank my colleagues, especially Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy \nand their staff members for all of their efforts on this bill. I would \nalso like to thank the consumer groups for their input, and the \nadministration for its assistance in the negotiations process. I trust \nthat the conferees will keep the importance of this bill in mind as \nthey negotiate to bring the final legislation to the floor for passage.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nNonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association to Senator Lott be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 15, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: In a letter to you dated September 4, \n     the National Governors' Association (NGA), National \n     Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) and Association of \n     State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) stated their \n     opposition to the national uniformity provision (Sec. 761) in \n     S. 830, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) and FDA \n     modernization legislation. Unfortunately, their letter \n     contained several incorrect and misleading statements \n     concerning nonprescription, over-the-counter (OTC) medicines \n     and the application of the national uniformity provision. In \n     order to set the record straight on this important issue, I \n     offer the following comments.\n\n\n1. national uniformity for otc drugs will protect the public health and \n                                 safety\n\n       One national, uniform system of regulation for OTC drugs \n     protects the interests of all American consumers. There is \n     simply no difference in the safety, effectiveness, and proper \n     labeling of OTC drugs from one state to another. An OTC drug \n     that is safe, effective, and properly labeled for a consumer \n     in Louisiana is safe, effective, and properly labeled for a \n     consumer in Massachusetts, and vice versa.\n       Allowing states to establish a patchwork of different \n     requirements for OTC drugs makes no sense. It would even be \n     detrimental, resulting, for example, in confusion as \n     consumers are confronted with different labels for the very \n     same OTC drug obtained in different states. Moreover, non-\n     uniform laws for OTCs would drive up consumer expense through \n     the costs of different and inconsistent state requirements \n     for testing, labeling, and packaging, and through disruption \n     of the distribution for products required to meet as many as \n     50 disparate state systems.\n       The authors assert that there is no evidence that shows a \n     need to preempt state laws regulating OTC drugs. Attachment A \n     lists several examples of state proposals, which, if enacted, \n     would have disrupted national uniformity.\n\n\n   2. Important state interests would be fully protected under S. 830\n\n       The authors mistakenly say that states would be prevented \n     from effectively addressing compelling OTC drug problems \n     unique to their states under S. 830. They particularly \n     criticize the exemption procedure in S. 830. The exemption \n     provision enables a state to petition FDA to depart from the \n     single uniform national standard for an OTC drug. The \n     preparation and submission of an exemption petition will not \n     be a very burdensome or expensive process, and FDA can be \n     expected to rule on such petitions promptly. Moreover, the \n     three requirements for exemption from uniformity for a state \n     are logical. If the public interest represented by the state \n     proposal is already protected, there is no need for a state \n     exemption to protect it. As interstate products, OTC drugs \n     could not and should not violate other applicable federal \n     laws. The prohibition against unduly burdening interstate \n     commerce simply requires a sensible balancing of competing \n     interests.\n       The authors also claim that states would be prohibited from \n     taking action on their own even where there are compelling \n     local conditions. They argue that states are expected to \n     address compelling local conditions and that the Constitution \n     already prohibits state laws that unduly burden state \n     commerce. Therefore, they argue that the preemption provision \n     of S. 830 is unneeded, and that states should not be required \n     to petition FDA for exemptions from preemption.\n       The authors' premises are flawed. States are not limited to \n     laws that address ``compelling'' local conditions. They have \n     broad police powers to enact laws that deal with any \n     legitimate issue. Moreover, they can pass laws that affect \n     not just local conditions but regional and national ones as \n     well. When analyzed under the ``dormant'' Commerce Clause, \n     state laws enjoy a presumption of validity, and they will not \n     be invalidated unless they impose burdens on interstate \n     commerce that are clearly excessive in comparison to their \n     benefits. This is a very different test from the one embodied \n     in the national uniformity provision of S. 830 for OTC drugs.\n       A state law that does address a compelling local condition \n     and does not unduly burden interstate commerce would be \n     eligible for FDA consideration of an exemption petition. Many \n     state laws, however, will not meet such a test and therefore \n     should not be permitted to stand. The only way to distinguish \n     one type of law from the other is to establish an exemption \n     petition procedure. The petition process would not be \n     expected to be burdensome, as described above.\n       Apart from the exemption procedure from preemption in S. \n     830, states would retain full authority to take action in \n     emergency and (non-emergency) situations involving OTC drugs \n     as follows: First, the bill would not affect the right of a \n     state to take action immediately, without consultation with \n     FDA, to deal with an authentic local emergency involving a \n     nonprescription drug, such as outbreak of an abuse problem. \n     If there is a true local emergency, as the authors \n     acknowledge, the state could take immediate action to place a \n     nonprescription drug on prescription status until the problem \n     abates: And as noted below, some states have done that in the \n     case of ephedrine-containing OTC drug products.\n       Second, the bill would prevent the states from undertaking \n     unilateral action, again without consultation with the FDA, \n     to issue their own public statements in the form of health \n     department releases, public service announcements, or other \n     public education campaigns to alert state consumers about its \n     concerns about an OTC drug. The bill would simply prevent the \n     states from imposing 50 different notification requirements \n     on the OTC maker, whether in labeling, packaging or other \n     form of public communication, which would disrupt the \n     longstanding national system of review and marketing for \n     nonprescription drugs.\n\n[[Page S9846]]\n\n       Third, the bill would not prevent the states from utilizing \n     their enforcement authority to take immediate action against \n     an OTC drug that was adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise \n     out of compliance with laws that are the same as federal \n     laws.\n       Fourth, as recognized by the authors, the states can also \n     require an OTC drug to be dispensed only by prescription.\n\n\n  3. states can petition for adoption of their ideas as the national \n                            uniform standard\n\n       The authors comment that FDA lacks adequate resources to \n     act and states must be permitted to provide ``important \n     protections'' FDA is unable to provide. This is specious. FDA \n     has not failed to act in any case in the OTC area where \n     action was otherwise warranted, on the basis of resources. \n     FDA regulation of OTC drugs under the OTC Review, for \n     example, is unrivaled in the world as the most comprehensive \n     system of safety, effectiveness, and labeling review of its \n     kind ever undertaken. Similarly, FDA is currently embarked \n     upon a mammoth program to completely overhaul and standardize \n     the format and content of all OTC drug labels.\n       The authors' argument also ignores the fundamental policy \n     embodied in the national uniformity provision--that FDA is a \n     national expert agency that should set national standards. \n     The states remain laboratories of good ideas, which FDA can \n     adopt as national standards or allow to take effect locally \n     if they qualify for an exemption. But there is no \n     constitutional or policy reason to prefer 50 mini-FDAs over a \n     singly national one.\n       The bill would preserve the states right to petition the \n     FDA to adopt a state proposal as the uniform national \n     standard for OTC drugs. If a state believes it has an \n     innovative idea for protection of the nation's OTC drug \n     consumers as a whole that is superior to protection provided \n     by FDA, it can petition FDA to adopt the idea as the national \n     standard. That way, potential improvements in the OTC \n     regulatory system can be evaluated by all interested parties \n     against the background of the overall FDA regulatory program \n     for OTC drugs. If FDA concludes that the state's proposal is \n     the right one, then it can adopt it as the national standard.\n\n\n 4. states would not be preempted in regulation of dietary supplements \n                        or other kinds of foods\n\n       The authors mistakenly assume that dietary supplement state \n     regulation and other health food regulation would be affected \n     by preemption. Neither dietary supplements nor foods of any \n     kind, including dietary supplements or health foods \n     containing ephedrine, would be covered by the OTC drug \n     preemption provision of S. 830. Thus, none of the state laws \n     cited by the authors in Louisiana, New York, Michigan, \n     Maryland, Vermont, Washington, or Minnesota, would be \n     preempted by S. 830 because there is no preemption of food \n     laws.\n\n\n 5. states would not be preempted from regulating OTC drugs other than \n with respect to the federal laws governing OTCs that are specifically \n                          enumerated in S. 830\n\n       With respect to ephedrine-containing OTC drug products, \n     contrary to the authors' statements, no state has imposed any \n     labeling or packing restrictions on these products different \n     from or beyond those imposed by the FDA. Some states have \n     taken action on some OTC ephedrine products to place certain \n     products on a controlled substance schedule, to place \n     ephedrine on prescription status, to limit access to adults, \n     and to prohibit possession of large quantities of the drug \n     with intent to make methamphetamine. None of these state laws \n     or actions would be preempted by the national provision of S. \n     830, because they are not laws enumerated in the section 807 \n     of the bill (Sec. 761(a)(1)(B)).\n\n\n     6. all otc drugs are subject to the same exacting fda safety, \n                effectiveness and labeling requirements\n\n       The authors make an unfounded and alarmist assertion that \n     as more medications are switched from prescription to OTC \n     status, consumers, especially the elderly and youth, are \n     placed at greater risk. All nonprescription drugs, whether \n     brought to market by being switched from prescription status, \n     or marketed as OTC drugs from the outset, are subject to the \n     same high and exacting standards for safety, effectiveness, \n     and labeling. Indeed, nonprescription drugs are required to \n     have an especially wide margin of safety precisely because \n     they are intended to be purchased and used by consumers \n     without the intervention of a doctor.\n\n\n    7. national uniformity is supported by many state and national \n           organizations and several former FDA commissioners\n\n       Support for national uniformity of OTC medicines is \n     widespread and continues to grow. Over 90 organizations \n     including the American Medical Association, National \n     Consumers League, United Seniors Health Cooperative, as well \n     as several state pharmacy, medical and retail organizations \n     are in favor of one, uniform system of regulation for these \n     important products. In addition, four former FDA \n     Commissioners support this provision. (See Attachment B.)\n       Thank you for considering our views on this important \n     subject. We urge you to continue your support for national \n     uniformity for OTC medicines.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    James D. Cope.\n                                                        President.\n       Attachments: (A) Examples of State Proposals That Would \n     Disrupt National Uniformity; (B) Organizations Supporting \n     National Uniformity.\n\n                              Attachment A\n\n\n   examples of state proposals that would disrupt national uniformity\n\n       The authors state that there is no evidence that there is a \n     need for pre-exemption of state laws that seek to regulate \n     OTC drug packaging and labeling. That quite simply is not \n     true!. Here are just a few examples of state proposals that \n     would, if enacted, disrupt national uniformity.\n       First, in 1993 alone, three states proposed to require \n     bittering agents in certain OTC medicines sold in those \n     states to deter childhood poisonings and overdoses. These \n     state bills received consideration despite the federal CPSC's \n     rejection of bittering agents under the Poison Prevention \n     Packaging Act in favor of child resistant packaging and \n     consumer education to address the problem.\n       Second, in the 1990s, at least fifteen state legislatures \n     have considered legislation to require ``environmentally-\n     friendly packaging'' of OTC drugs, that would mandate certain \n     recycled content levels and plastic resins. These proposals \n     would have conflicted with FDA's safety requirements that \n     certain drugs be packaged only in ``virgin'' materials to \n     prevent adulteration of the drugs. In some cases, these \n     various proposals would conflict with each other as well.\n       Third, numerous states have proposed to require certain \n     language and label warnings on OTC drugs that add additional, \n     inconsistent and confusing precautions to these labels, in \n     addition to the lengthy and comprehensive labeling \n     requirements imposed by the FDA. Where would this extra room \n     on OTC labels come from to accommodate all the suggestions \n     that would be imposed by 50 states? Most OTC drugs are \n     relatively small products, and thus have very limited label \n     space.\n       OTC drug labels contain much FDA required information \n     essential to their safe and proper use; therefore state-by-\n     state proposals requiring additional label information \n     obscure FDA-mandated warnings. Such proposals must be viewed \n     in the context of the available label space. FDA makes these \n     judgments recognizing the need for judicious use of scarce \n     label space. Examples of these state-by-state proposed \n     requirements include:\n       Conflicting proposed legislation in various states that \n     would require--(1) the word ``poison'' along with antidote, \n     (2) a ``Mr. Yuk'' symbol affixed to the label, (3) a special \n     poison warning including a dark green background, and (4) a \n     black ``X''--each of these different state proposals seek to \n     address the same problem of childhood poisonings; label \n     disclaimers that the elderly should disregard label dosages \n     and consult a physician before taking any OTC drug, despite \n     an absence of any scientific evidence that drug absorption or \n     metabolism is connected to turning 65 years old; label \n     disclosure that a certain product was tested on animals in \n     its development, even though the FDA may require animal \n     testing of the drug prior to its use in humans; label \n     warnings that a product is unsuitable for disposal on land or \n     in water; one state's attempt to require extensive label \n     cautions on fluoride-containing toothpastes that fluoride is \n     an enzymatic and protoplasmic poison 15 times more poisonous \n     than arsenic; and initiatives or legislation in ten states \n     that would have required special label warnings that certain \n     ingredients may be carcinogens, even where the FDA has \n     reviewed the drug and determined that it is safe and \n     effective at the levels that the ingredient is used in that \n     product. These states would reject the FDA's careful risk/\n     benefit analysis of medications in favor of scaring consumers \n     even where only trace quantities of the substance are \n     present.\n       One can easily understand the confusion to consumers that \n     would result if these warnings showed up on products in one \n     state but not on the same identical product destined for \n     another state. If any of the above ideas are good ones, they \n     should be considered by FDA; receive comments from the \n     public, the states, and the industry; and if they are \n     determined to be sound public policy, they should be made \n     national requirements.\n       There is absolutely a need for national uniformity to \n     prevent such state proposals from disrupting commerce and \n     confusing consumers.\n\n                              Attachment B\n\n\n              organizations supporting national uniformity\n\n       American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy; American \n     Beauty Association; American Medical Association; American \n     Society of Health-System Pharmacists; Area Agencies on Aging \n     Association of Michigan; Arizona Retailers Association; \n     Associated Food Dealers of Michigan; Association of Commerce \n     and Industry of New Mexico; California Arthritis Foundation \n     Council; California Chapters of the National Association of \n     Pediatric Nurse Associates & Practitioners; California \n     Coalition of Hispanic Organizations; Central Ohio Retail \n     Grocers Association; Chain Drug Marketing Association, Inc.; \n     Citizens for the ``Right to Know''; and Congress of \n     California Seniors.\n       Congress of California Seniors--Los Angeles; Connecticut \n     State Medical Society; Florida Medical Association; Food \n     Marketing Institute; Generic Pharmaceutical Industry \n     Association; Giant Food, Inc.; Gulf Coast\n\n[[Page S9847]]\n\n     Grocers Association (Texas); Health Advocacy Services \n     (California); Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers & \n     Distributors, Inc.; Indiana Manufacturers Association; \n     Indiana Retail Council; Industry and Commerce Association of \n     South Dakota; Interamerican College of Physicians and \n     Surgeons; Iowa Retail Federal, Inc.; and Maryland Association \n     of Chain Drug Stores.\n       Maryland Retailers Association; Medical Society of the \n     State of New York; Medical Society of Virginia; Michigan \n     Chamber of Commerce; Michigan Distributors and Venders \n     Association, Inc.; Michigan State Medical Society; Minnesota \n     Chamber of Commerce; Minnesota Grocers Association; Minnesota \n     Retail Merchants Association; Mississippi Wholesale \n     Distributors Association; Missouri Grocers Association; \n     Missouri Retailers Association; Missouri State Medical \n     Association; National Association of Chain Drug Stores; and \n     National Association of Manufacturers.\n       National Coalition of Hispanic Health and Human Services; \n     National Community Pharmacists Association; National \n     Consumers League; National Council on the Aging; National \n     Hispanic Council on Aging; National Retail Federation; \n     National Wholesale Druggists' Association; New Hampshire \n     Medical Society; New Mexico Pharmaceutical Association; \n     Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association; North \n     Carolina Retail Merchants Association; Ohio Council of Retail \n     Merchants; Ohio Grocers Association; Ohio Wholesale Druggists \n     Association; and Pennsylvania Association of Chain Drug \n     Stores, Inc.\n       Philadelphia Association of Retail Druggists; Philadelphia \n     College of Pharmacy; Retail Merchants Association of New \n     Hampshire; Retailers Association of Massachusetts; Robbie \n     Vierra-Lambert Spinal Cord Organization for Regaining \n     Excellence; Safety & Health Council of New Hampshire; \n     Safeway, Inc.; Senior Medication Awareness & Training \n     Coalition, Sickle Cell Disease Association of America, Inc.; \n     South Dakota Pharmacists Association; Tennessee Association \n     of Business; Tennessee Grocers Association; Texas Association \n     of Business & Chambers of Commerce; Texas Food Industry \n     Association; and The 60 Plus Association.\n       United Seniors Association; United Seniors Health \n     Cooperative; United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce; \n     Ukrop's; Vermont Board of Pharmacy; Vermont Chamber of \n     Commerce; Vermont Grocers Association; Vermont Medical \n     Society; Virginia Chamber of Commerce; Virginia Manufacturers \n     Association; Virginia Pharmacists Association; Virginia \n     Retail Merchants Association; Washington Retailers \n     Association's Retail Pharmacy Council; Washington State \n     Medical Association; White House Conference on Small \n     Business, New Jersey Delegation; Wisconsin Grocers \n     Association, Inc.; and Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce.\n\n\n        former fda commissioners supporting national uniformity\n\n       Charles C.

Madam President, I rise today because I believe the \nSenate set a terrible precedent last Thursday when it voted to uphold a \npoint of order that was made against an amendment that Senator Gregg \nand I offered to H.R. 2107, the Interior appropriations bill. This \namendment proposed to collect the royalty from hardrock mining \noperations on public land and a reclamation fee from hardrock mining \noperations on land that was patented pursuant to the 1872 mining law. \nThe receipts collected from the royalty and reclamation fee would have \nbeen deposited in a trust fund to be used to reclaim abandoned hardrock \nmines in the West.\n  Opponents of my amendment, in an attempt to prevent Senators from \ngoing on record in support of an effort to make the mining industry \nhelp pay for the environmental disasters it has created, raised a point \nof order arguing that the reclamation fee constituted a tax proposed by \nthe Senate and thus the amendment violated the origination clause of \nthe Constitution; that is, that all revenue measures must originate in \nthe House. Unfortunately, the Senate voted to uphold the point of order \neven though the amendment was not even close to being unconstitutional.\n  The Supreme Court has held on numerous occasions that while a tax \nprovision may not originate in the Senate, a governmental fee can. ``A \nstatute that creates a particular governmental program and that raises \nrevenue to support that program, as opposed to a statute that raises \nrevenue to support government generally, it is not a `bill for raising \nrevenue' within the meaning of the origination clause.'' That is \nconfirmed in United States versus Munoz-Florez. My amendment would have \nimposed a royalty and a fee in order to directly fund the reclamation \nof abandoned hardrock mines. It was not intended to raise revenues for \nthe Treasury.\n  In fact, Madam President, the Parliamentarian has already ruled that \nthe reclamation fee provision does not constitute a tax when the \nParliamentarian referred S. 326, which includes the very same \nreclamation fee proposal that I had, to the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee rather than the Finance Committee. The House \nParliamentarian made the very same ruling when he referred the House \ncompanion to S. 326 to the House Natural Resources Committee rather \nthan the Ways and Means Committee.\n  I find it perplexing that anybody could argue that the amendment that \nSenator Gregg and I offered to the Interior appropriations bill could \npossibly constitute a tax. However, even if that were the case, it \nought to be noted that the Interior appropriations bill originated in \nthe House of Representatives in accordance with the origination clause \nof the Constitution. It does not matter that the amendment was offered \nin the Senate as long as the bill originated in the House. In Flint v. \nStone Tracy Company, 220 U.S. 107 (1911), the Supreme Court ruled that \nlegislation which created the tax on corporations complied with the \norigination clause even though the corporate tax was proposed by the \nSenate as a substitute to an inheritance tax that was included in the \nbill as reported by the House.\n  The fact that H.R. 2107 was reported by the Appropriations Committee \nrather than the Finance Committee is not relevant. The Senate has in \nthe past added an amendment which modified the Tax Code to an \nappropriations bill. For example, in 1982 the Senate added a provision \nto the supplemental appropriations bill which limited the availability \nof certain tax deductions for Members of Congress.\n  Madam President, Senate rules do not permit the Parliamentarian to \nrule when a point of order is made against an amendment on \nconstitutional grounds. If the Parliamentarian had been able to rule, \nthe point of order would not have even been made and the decision would \nnot have been close. Instead, the point of order was made with the \nknowledge that Senators would be able to defeat the Bumpers-Gregg \namendment without actually going on record in support of allowing \nmining companies to continue acquiring billions of dollars worth of \nminerals from the taxpayers of this country without compensation and \nleaving those same taxpayers with environmental disasters to clean up.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine).

As I pointed out earlier in the debate, \nof the 20 major health safety issues identified by the administration, \n19 have been addressed, not only in our committee markup, but also in \nthe negotiations that we had prior to the time of the legislation \ncoming to the floor. There is the one remaining item, which deals with \nsafety and medical devices. It is extremely important. We have given \nfocus to this issue because it deserves the focus that we have given \nit.\n  Mr. President, I have in my hand the statement of the administration \npolicy. It indicates that it has two major concerns with the bill. One \nis the technical provision with regard to the budget agreement and how \nthey are going to allocate to PDUFA, which is a technical issue. But \nthe other issue mentioned by the administration is this particular \nprovision:\n\n       First, section 404 of the bill would lower the review \n     standard for marketing approval by precluding the FDA from \n     reviewing medical devices for uses other than those for which \n     the manufacturer says they are intended.\n\n  The administration indicates, as they did in the letter in September, \nas they did in June, that this particular provision is dangerous in \nterms of the consumers in this country.\n  We have reviewed, over the course of the debate, the dangerous \nsituations that have been the result of medical device disasters. We \nare committed to avoiding that kind of disaster in the future. We have \na good safety record at the present time, but we are endangering that \nrecord with section 404. We noted that virtually every consumer group \nsupports changing section 404. It is enormously important. It goes to \nthe fundamental question of providing FDA with the power and authority \nto pursue the protections of the American health in the area of medical \ndevices.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement of the \nadministration policy supporting our position regarding 404 be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                               Washington, DC, September 24, 1997.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n    (This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the concerned \n                               agencies.)\n\n\n        S. 830--FDA Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997\n\n                       (Senator Jeffords (R) VT)\n\n       The Administration applauds the Senate for its bipartisan \n     effort to improve S. 830 since it was reported by the Senate \n     Committee on Labor and Human Resources, and appreciates the \n     Senate's responsiveness to concerns that have been raised. \n     Because of the importance of obtaining a five-year extension \n     of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the \n     Administration has no objection to passage of the bill by the \n     Senate at this time. However, the Administration finds that \n     the provisions identified below are unacceptable and as the \n     legislative process continues, will work to ensure that our \n     remaining concerns are resolved.\n       In general, this legislation represents a significant step \n     toward accomplishing our mutual goal of assuring the agency's \n     optimum performance while protecting the health of the \n     American public. The Administration, however, continues to \n     have two major concerns with the bill.\n       First, section 404 of the bill would lower the review \n     standard for marketing approval by precluding the Food and \n     Drug Administration (FDA) from reviewing new medical devices \n     for uses other than those for which the manufacturer says \n     they are intended. Second, the PDUFA trigger as proposed in \n     S. 830 undercuts the bipartisan budget agreement (BBA) by \n     requiring budget increases for FDA not envisioned by the BBA, \n     and would interfere with HHS' ability to allocate resources \n     appropriately throughout the Department.\n       In order to be able to support the final bill, the \n     Administration will continue to work with the House of \n     Representatives and in conference to resolve these and other \n     identified issues.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We hope that we can be convincing as this legislation \ngoes forward. We have not been convincing here on the floor. We hope \nprovisions can be accepted that will make 404 acceptable in terms of \nthe public health issues. I want to express my sincere appreciation to \nthe chairman of the committee, Senator Jeffords, who has been a \nchairman's chair. He is strong in his belief. He is a fighter for the \nthings that he champions. He has been willing to accommodate differing \nviews. He protects his strong posture and positions on his own views, \nand I respect that. I thank the other Members of this body for their \ncourtesy during the course of what I know has been a continuing \ndiscussion and debate on a very important measure. I thank all of our \nMembers for their courtesy and consideration as we move toward a vote \non this legislation. I thank my chairman.\n  At the time when the Senator from Vermont is prepared to yield back \nhis time, I will be prepared to do so likewise and move to our vote.\n\n\n                       unanimous-consent request\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first, I have a unanimous-consent \nrequest, which has been cleared on both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to consider amendment No. \n1184, as modified, with changes that are at the desk; further, that the \namendment be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  I'm sorry, Mr. President, I withdraw that request at this moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is withdrawn.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the ranking member \nfor his help on this bill. We agree on 19 out of 20 provisions. His \nsteadfast and articulate objection to the 20th, relative to section \n404, has been done sincerely and very well done on that issue. I \nbelieve that we have a good bill, but we remain open to suggestions, as \nalways, as to how the bill can be improved. I am extremely pleased that \nthe Senate has overwhelmingly approved S. 830 yesterday. I believe this \nis an important step forward for ensuring a stronger and more efficient \nFDA.\n  Throughout this process, we have had the benefit of input from all \ninterested parties on how best to modernize the Agency, while ensuring \nthat its stellar standard for public safety remains as strong as ever. \nI am extremely proud of the strong support of this legislation \nexpressed by the health community. For instance, the National Health \nCouncil, a coalition of over 100 health and patient organizations, has \nurged the Senate to move forward with this legislation. We have also \nreceived support from physician groups, including the American Medical \nAssociation and the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n  We must remember that drugs and medical devices delayed at the FDA \nare often lives lost. When cardiac defibrillators were first developed \nin the late 1980's, they brought new hope and opportunity to many of \nthe 350,000 Americans who would otherwise suffer sudden cardiac death \neach year.\n\n  But the first version of this technology required opening the chest \nand separating the ribs to apply this technology to the heart. This \nprocedure carried a 4.2 percent mortality rate.\n  Improvements to this defibrillator technology were widely available \nin Europe two years before patients could benefit in this country. The \nnew technology did not require cracking the patients chest, but only a \nsmall incision to allow the technology to be threaded through a vein \ninto the heart.\n  During this unnecessary 2-year delay, it is estimated that 1,056 \nAmericans died from complications related to the more invasive \ntechnique. Delay does cost lives.\n  And far from allowing dangerous products on the market as Senator \nKennedy has alleged, section 404 of this bill keeps intact FDA's \nauthority to investigate technological issues which raise new safety \nand effectiveness questions, does not limit FDA's enforcement \nauthority, and does not touch FDA's regulations which require that \nmedical device applications be truthful and not omit any material \nfacts.\n\n[[Page S9849]]\n\n  Section 404 does quite appropriately keep FDA out of regulating the \npractice of medicine. That is important and we should fight to protect \nthe intent of this provision.\n  Patients will also benefit from other provisions of the bill \nincluding the registry of clinical trials, fast-track approval for \ndrugs treating life-threatening diseases, expanded access to \ninvestigational therapies, and the incentives established to \ninvestigate pediatric uses of drugs.\n  I want to thank the patient, consumer, and physician groups, and all \nthe others we have worked with, for their commitment to working toward \nreal reforms that strengthen the FDA and the contributions they have \nmade in crafting this bipartisan measure.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thank Senator Jeffords for yielding.\n  First of all, I want to commend him for a tremendous amount of work. \nThis is an incredibly complicated piece of legislation. It has involved \na lot of different interest groups in some issues that have become very \ncharged.\n  So I again want to thank the Senator from Vermont for his willingness \nto work with Senator Frist and I as we worked on the so-called off-\nlabel issue.\n  I also want to express my appreciation to Senator Kennedy. He had \nsome deep concerns about the legislation, and as a result of extensive \ndiscussions we were able to find a compromise. I think it was one of \nthe reasons that this bill was able to move forward.\n  So I thank Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy. And I also want to \nput in a comment with respect to Mark Smith, my staffer who has worked \non this issue for more than some 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  Again, I thank Senator Jeffords for what he has done.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator for his comments, and I want to \npraise him for his efforts with respect to off-label. This is an \nincredibly important amendment that Senator Mack and Senator Frist have \nworked out with the FDA and the minority. That is going to give a great \ndeal of assistance to people in this country who are in need of help in \nstraightening out a relatively difficult area with such preciseness. \nThe Senator from Florida did a good job.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1184, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to \nconsider amendment No. 1184, as modified, with changes that are at the \ndesk; further, that the amendment be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1184), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n       Strike section 809 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 809. APPLICATION OF FEDERAL LAW TO THE PRACTICE OF \n                   PHARMACY COMPOUNDING.\n\n       Section 503 (21 U.S.C. 353) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(h)(1) Sections 501(a)(2)(B), 502(f)(1), 502(l), 505, and \n     507 shall not apply to a drug product if--\n       ``(A) the drug product is compounded for an identified \n     individual patient, based on a medical need for a compounded \n     product--\n       ``(i) by a licensed pharmacist in a State licensed pharmacy \n     or a Federal facility, or a licensed physician, on the \n     prescription order of a licensed physician or other licensed \n     practitioner authorized by State law to prescribe drugs;

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COATS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and I thank them \nprofusely for their vote, for their support in the committee, and all \nthe work that has gone into this. But, as we all know, there are people \nwho work behind the scenes, those who are probably more responsible for \nthis vote than we on the floor are. I just want to take a moment to \nthank the staff.\n  In the office of Senate Legislative Counsel, Robin Bates, Elizabeth \nAldridge, and Bill Baird worked tirelessly to produce countless bill \ndrafts and amendments. And how they came out with them as expeditiously \nas they did, I'm not sure.\n  The staff at CRS, especially Donna Vogt, and at GAO, including \nBernice Steinhardt deserve thanks for their willingness to provide \nessential information and documents on extremely short notice. We must \nalways remember to appreciate these organizations that provide so much \nassistance to the Congress.\n  The staff to the members of the committee contributed greatly to the \nsuccess of this bill. In particular, Vince Ventimiglia with Senator \nCoats' staff worked closely with ours in a true partnership on all \naspects of S. 830.\n  In addition, Kimberly Spaulding with Senator Gregg, Sue Ramthun with \nSenator Frist, Saira Sultan with Senator DeWine, and Kate Lambrew-Hull \nwith Senator Hutchinson all played important roles in fashioning \ncompromises on key provisions of this bill. Also, Mark Smith with \nSenator Mack's staff worked very hard to make the agreement on off-\nlabel dissemination of information possible.\n  I would also like to thank the many staff of the administration who \nhave worked on this legislation.\n  In particular, I want to thank Bill Schultz, Diane Thompson, and \nPeggy Dotzel, of the FDA.\n  Similarly, three staffers for members of the minority on the \ncommittee played pivotal roles even before committee markup took place \nin making this bill a bipartisan success.\n  Lynne Lawrence with Senator Mikulski deserves special mention in \nrecognition of her hard work in the last Congress on FDA reform and her \nwillingness to put her future career plans\n\n[[Page S9868]]\n\non hold to commit herself again to the long hard job of bringing this \nbill to the floor this year. Jeanne Ireland with Senator Dodd and Linda \nDeGutis, a fellow with Senator Wellstone also provided invaluable \nassistance.\n  Of course I would like to thank the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee majority and minority staffs who did the most work on this. \nIn particular, I want to recognize Susan Hattan who stayed on with the \ncommittee after Senator Kassebaum's retirement.\n  She, and another Senator Kassebaum staffer, Jane Williams, who is now \non the staff of Representative Fred Upton, worked long hours last year \nto put FDA reform on the Senate agenda and brought a bill to successful \ncommittee markup in the last Congress--we stand here today in large \npart due to their hard work.\n  On the minority staff, I would like to thank Nick Littlefield and \nDavid Nexon and two minority fellows Diane Robertson and Debbie \nKochever. Finally, I would like to thank the majority staff director \nMark Powden, Jay Hawkins, and majority fellow Sean Donohue.\n  I want to take a moment to elaborate on my comments regarding one of \nthe majority staff who has worked so diligently on this measure--Jay \nHawkins. Jay joined my staff in January--literally hit the ground \nrunning--and I don't think he has stopped moving since.\n  He has set a new standard of dedication for professional staff to \nfind the best solution in a difficult and controversial policy arena. \nHe has been saluted by other Senators' staffs, from both majority and \nminority offices, for his willingness to include them in all aspects of \nthis effort.\n  Mr. President, part of the job description for Senate staff is to \ntake abuse. Jay unfortunately received more than his share, but it said \nmore about his critics than him.\n  More recently--a little more than a month ago--Jay lost his mother to \nher 4-year battle with cancer. My friend, Senator Hatch, acknowledged \non the floor just yesterday this hardship Jay faced and was eloquent in \nhis praise for both Jay and for his mother--Donna Lotz Hawkins. Mrs. \nHawkins was not unfamiliar with challenge and adversity. She was an \nexperienced mountain climber and conquered some of the world's most \ndifficult mountains in the Alaska range, the Tetons, the Alps, and the \nHimalayas. She was a dedicated ocean swimmer and conquered the white \nwaters in Waikiki and Maui.\n  It is clear to us who know Jay that he too has the spirit of taking \non the task when faced with adversity and challenge. We know the source \nof that sense of commitment and we cannot thank him enough for his \nefforts on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in typical fashion, Senator Jeffords has \ngiven great credit where credit is due, and as I mentioned just before, \nthe chairman of our committee really deserves credit for the passage of \nthis very important bill. I commend him.\n  If I could, I will just take a moment of the Senate's time, but I \nthink it is important to mention on our side David Nexon and Diane \nRobertson, who worked so closely with us; Jim Manly, Debbie Kochevar, \nMeg Archdeacon, Burt Cowgill, Susan Hammersten, Jonathan Halperin, and \nDanielle Drissel, Carrie Coberly and Addy Schmidt; Bonnie Hogue on \nSenator Reed's staff and Deborah Walker on Senator Bingaman's staff; \nSabrina Corlette with Senator Harkin and Anne-Marie Murphy with Senator \nDurbin.\n  I would like to believe the staffs have been helpful to all of us and \ndon't work so much in a partisan way as in a common spirit, to try to \nadvance the common interests. That has been, certainly, true on this \nlegislation.\n  I thank all of those, and the majority staff as well, for all of \ntheir courtesies and for their cooperation. I think the record ought to \nshow the dedication of, really, an outstanding group of men and women \nwho have really served the Senate very, very well. I thank the \nchairman.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the ranking minority member on \nmy committee for his words. I commend him, also. We disagreed rather \nstrongly on one issue here, but 19 out of 20 we were together and \nworked together, and certainly that's a pretty good average.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/24/senate-section/article/S9847-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9868-S9874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH.

Mr. President, I send to the desk a list of staff. I \nask unanimous consent they be allowed full privilege of the floor \nduring the consideration of S. 1156, the D.C. appropriations bill.\n  The list follows:\n\n       Mary Beth Nethercutt; Jay Kimmitt; Terry Sauvain; Neyla \n     Arnas;s Kate O'Malley; David Landers; Liz Tankersley; Quinn \n     Dodd; and Jim Hyland.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am pleased to present the fiscal year \n1998 District of Columbia appropriations bill to the Senate.\n  This budget is the first I have had the opportunity to present to the \nSenate since becoming the chairman of the District of Columbia \nAppropriations Subcommittee. This is essentially a clean bill, with no \nnew policy riders.\n  I am very pleased that this budget was reported favorably by the full \nAppropriations Committee by a vote of 27 to 1. This is a bipartisan \nbill, and a bill that reflects the consensus of both the Financial \nControl Board established by Congress and the city's elected \nleadership.\n  This budget of $4.2 billion is a smaller budget than last year's $5.1 \nbillion budget for two reasons.\n  First, the Federal Government is providing the city with fewer \nFederal dollars. This past July, Congress enacted landmark legislation \nrestructuring the city's budget, transferring some city functions to \nthe Federal Government, and in exchange, cutting the Federal payment to \nthe District.\n  That legislation also added some important management reforms at my \nurging. I'll have more to say about these structural changes and \nmanagement reforms in a moment.\n  Second, this is a smaller budget because it is the first balanced \nbudget submitted to the Congress by city officials since 1993. That one \nproved very unbalanced. This one will be balanced.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the law enacted by Congress in 1995 \ncreating a Financial Control Board included a timetable requiring the \ncity of Washington, DC to submit a balanced budget to Congress by next \nyear.\n  Fortunately, the Control Board and the D.C. Council managed to agree \non enough spending cuts to submit a balanced budget to Congress 1 year \nahead of schedule. That is essentially the budget before the Senate \ntoday.\n  This balanced budget cuts roughly $85 million from last year's \noperating budget, not to mention a reduction of over $500 million in \nthe direct Federal contribution to the city, from $712 million last \nyear down to $190 million this year.\n  Most agencies in the District of Columbia government have been cut. \nOne exception is the police department, which received a modest \nincrease reflecting a citywide effort--and I might say a nationwide \neffort--to crack down on crime within the city.\n  Perhaps the most important point is that both the Control Board and \nthe D.C. Council have agreed to these cuts.\n\n[[Page S9869]]\n\n  The Control Board and the D.C. Council worked together to craft a \nconsensus budget. That consensus has been incorporated into this bill.\n  I do not think it is necessary for the U.S. Senate to revisit every \nspending decision that has been agreed upon by both the council and the \ncontrol board, especially since we have achieved a balanced budget 1 \nyear ahead of time.\n  Such decisions are long overdue even if it took some prodding from \nthe Congress to get. I think it is the responsibility of the Senate to \nratify those decisions once they have been made.\n  In addition to being the first balanced budget in several years, this \nbudget pays for many of the structural changes and management reforms, \nincluding the District of Columbia Revitalization Act, signed into law \non August 5, 1997.\n  For example, the Revitalization Act transferred the city's prison \nsystem, the courts, and a huge unfunded pension liability of $5 billion \nto the Federal Government. In exchange, the Congress will no longer \nprovide an annual Federal payment of $660 million or a $52 million \nannual payment on the pension liability. Instead, this bill provides a \none-time Federal contribution of $190 million as authorized by the \nRevitalization Act. Of that $190 million, the bill directs that $30 \nmillion be applied to pay down on the city's debt.\n  The Revitalization Act has been called a rescue plan for the District \nof Columbia. I feel strongly that any rescue plan must first rescue the \ncity from terrible mismanagement, waste, and unresponsive and \nirresponsible local government.\n  I insisted that the rescue plan, and the majority leader with me \ninsisted that the rescue plan include the Management Reform Act of 1997 \nto begin the process of cleaning house in each of the major city \nagencies.\n  The Management Reform Act authorized the control board to hire \nprofessional consultants to conduct a top-to-bottom review of nine \nmajor city agencies to map out a plan for improving the quality of \nservices.\n  This District of Columbia appropriations bill provides $8 million to \npay for the consultants to go into the various city agencies.\n  The structural changes in the Revitalization Act provide the city \nwith a one-time windfall of $200 million. I am pleased that the mayor, \nthe council, and the Control Board agreed that this windfall should not \nbe used for a spending spree and that none of the funds should go \ntoward increasing the operating costs of the city.\n  Of the $200 million available, $160 million will be applied to pay \ndown the city's accumulated deficit. The remaining $40 million will be \nused to make infrastructure repairs and the management changes and \nproductivity improvements suggested by the management consultants. The \ninfrastructure of the city is in dire need of much improvement.\n  The Management Reform Act also called for the immediate dismissal of \nthe heads of nine major city agencies and called on the Mayor to either \nnominate new officials or renominate the current officials to head each \nof the agencies, with each nomination subject to the consent and \napproval of the Control Board. In other words, a final decision rests \nwith the Control Board.\n  In order to preserve the checks and balances between the executive \nand the legislative branches and the District of Columbia, section 133 \nof this appropriations bill makes clear that the D.C. Council does have \nofficial responsibility for confirming the Mayor's nominations to head \nthose agencies. But then again, I reiterate, the final decision rests \nwith the Control Board.\n  Some Members expressed concern to me that funding for the homeless \nmay be reduced by a consequence of this very tight budget. Section 146 \nof the bill directs the District government to maintain homeless \nservices at the same level for fiscal year 1998 as the level for fiscal \nyear 1997. I think this can be accomplished in a manner that is \nconsistent with the spending restraints needed to maintain a balanced \nbudget.\n\n  Perhaps no issue received more attention in recent weeks than the \ninability of the District's public schools to open on time. It was a \nlocal and a national embarrassment. As the new chairman of the D.C. \nsubcommittee, I am going to make sure that such a delay does not happen \nagain.\n  Section 147 of this bill directs the Control Board and General \nBecton, the CEO of the D.C. public schools, to report to the House and \nSenate appropriations and authorizing committees for the District of \nColumbia no later than April 1, 1998, of any and all necessary measures \nto ensure that the schools open on time in the fall of 1998.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues on the subcommittee, Senator \nBoxer, the ranking member, and Senator Hutchison of Texas.\n  I also thank the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, Senator \nStevens, and our distinguished ranking member, Senator Byrd, for their \nleadership and assistance on this bill.\n  In summary, as I said, this is a consensus bill and the first \nbalanced budget the District has seen in some time. This one truly is \nbalanced. This bill funds the tough medicine of management reforms as \nwell as restructuring of courts and corrections enacted by the Congress \nand signed into law by the President. It is a good bill and it is a \nbipartisan bill.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield to our ranking member, my good \nfriend, Senator Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I thank the chairman of the D.C. Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator \nFaircloth. I thank him for the hard work he has put into this bill. I \nthank his staff, and I thank the staff on our side. I think it is very \nfair to say they worked beautifully together.\n  We do have basically a consensus bill here. There are a couple of \nprovisions that I am sure Senator Faircloth isn't enamored with and I \nam sure there are a couple of provisions that this Senator isn't \nenamored with. I do believe in local control --that cities and counties \nshould be able to make their own policies in terms of how they spend \ntheir own health funds, how they spend funds that they raise.\n  There are a couple of problems in this bill. But Senator Faircloth is \ncorrect, there are no new riders here. The problems that I have with \nthis bill this year were in this bill last year. So I just hope that as \nwe take up this last appropriations bill--this is the 13th one--that we \nwill have a relatively easy time of it.\n  I hope that any amendments that are offered here will be \nnoncontroversial amendments that both sides can agree to. \nUnfortunately, I am hearing that may not be the case, that this bill \nmay become the vehicle for some very controversial amendments.\n  If that happens, so be it. Senator Faircloth and I will be on our \nfeet, and we will manage that in the best way we can with the \ncooperation of colleagues. But I really do hope that Senators from both \nsides would refrain from those kinds of amendments, because this bill \nwas a long time in coming. This kind of consensus over the District of \nColumbia was a long time in coming. We put so much work into it, \nparticularly the chairman.\n  I see that Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton has joined us to sit \nin on this debate. There was a tremendous amount of work on her part in \ngetting us to reach this consensus.\n  I have heard that it is possible we are going to have an amendment on \nvouchers. I want to make the point right here as the minority ranking \nmember that I have discussed this amendment with my colleagues on this \nside. We are not going to look kindly upon any amendment that would \nlook at helping 2 to 3 percent of the children in Washington, DC, while \nleaving 97 to 98 percent of those children without anything at all.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield in a moment so I do not lose this track. I \nwill absolutely yield.\n  I say to my colleagues who may or may not be listening to the opening \nof the debate, should we be faced with that, we will have an \nalternative that will help 100 percent of the children--that will help \n100 percent of the children. We are working on that because we are here \ntalking about people's lives, not about philosophy of education, not \nabout trying somebody's pet idea. We should not be doing that. We \nshould be in fact reaching out to all the children.\n\n[[Page S9870]]\n\n  Again, I say to my colleagues, I could offer a number of amendments \nhere that would be controversial. I do not really want to do that. I \nknow other colleagues could as well. I know that I feel as strongly as \nany colleague on certain of these matters. But this is an \nappropriations bill. This isn't an authorization bill. This isn't the \neducation authorization bill where we can debate, from morning till \nnight, what helps kids most--making sure that our public schools are \nthe best in the world or taking a small segment of children and saying, \nWell, if you draw the lucky straw, you can run away from a public \nschool, instead of making that public school the greatest it could be.\n  I have to say that I went to public schools from kindergarten through \ncollege. Some of the people who like me could say, Well, look what \ngreat things public schools can do, and some who do not, could say, You \nsee, those public schools aren't very good. But the bottom line is, \nwhatever you think of an individual who did get that chance, we do know \nthat we have the education in this country that we can give to our \nchildren so they can be the future Senators, they can be the future \nleaders of the world.\n  When we lose that because we decide we are going to abandon our \nchildren because of some political theory, I think it is a sad state \nfor us. So I am very much hoping that we do not get into that debate. \nBut if we do, as you can see, we are prepared for it.\n  I will be glad to yield to my friend from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you.\n  I actually was prepared to put a question to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  I want to commend the Senator for her stewardship and working with \nthe Senator from North Carolina on this issue because getting this \nappropriations passed for the District of Columbia is not only \nimportant but long overdue. It is unfortunate that the District winds \nup being a guinea pig of sorts for every kind of experiment that we \nhave.\n  I just commend the Senator from California for the poignancy of her \nstatement and her plea that amendments not be brought to this bill that \nwould delay its passage.\n  It is kind of open knowledge that the schools in the District of \nColumbia, many of them, have been closed because they were crumbling \nand falling down. The courts would not allow children to attend schools \nin that kind of condition. And they have just recently reopened.\n  In fact, we had working in my office two young high schoolers from \nthe District of Columbia. Pursuant to a project that Congresswoman \nEleanor Holmes Norton put together for all the displaced children of \nthe District, we took two of them into our office as interns while the \nschools were closed down.\n  The schools have now reopened and those children are back where they \nought to be, in a classroom, but it just seems to me to further \ndisplace all of those children because of a filibuster or an argument \naround an experiment with the District of Columbia schools would be \ncruel to say the least, and certainly an unfortunate development.\n  So I commend my colleague for her plea in the first instance that we \nnot have this battle because there is so much at stake, but also to put \nthe question to her whether or not it is her opinion that the District \ncan afford to delay further to wait for this appropriation to be \nfinalized?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, clearly, all the work that the \nchairman has done, along with Congresswoman Norton, Senator Hutchison, \nmyself, all of our staffs, this has been hard. As Senator Faircloth has \nsaid, we have a balanced budget submitted here. As a part of the \nagreement on the balanced budget plan of 1997, signed into law, the \nPresident forwarded to Congress a series of budget amendments to \nimplement the Revitalization Act for Washington, DC.\n  So we are moving along. It has not been easy. I think every Member of \nthe Senate--at least it is my feeling--would like to see us turn this \nCapital around. I think we have great pride in this Capital. We are \nvery concerned about some of its problems. I think we are on the road \nto addressing them.\n  So my colleague, in asking her question, is implying that a delay \nwould send the wrong signal to Washington, DC, residents, would send \nthe wrong signal, frankly, to the whole country, that we are backing \noff, and here they go again, adding extraneous matters to a DC \nappropriations bill.\n\n  What I hear around is not very promising. I hear that these \ncontroversial amendments are coming. I make this plea to whoever might \nbe listening to this opening debate on both sides: That we refrain from \ncontroversial amendments. This is the last bill we are getting together \nhere. We should move it forward, keep it free of this controversy, move \nforward, do our business, do our work and get on with the Senate's \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, the fiscal year 1998 District of Columbia \nappropriations bill was reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee \non September 9, 1997, by a vote of 26 to 1. I commend the chairman of \nthe subcommittee, Mr. Faircloth, for his efforts to produce a \nbipartisan appropriations bill for the District of Columbia. While the \nbill contains a few provisions I do not support, in most respects, I \nthink we succeeded in producing a consensus bill.\n  I will speak briefly about the three principal aspects of this bill: \nFederal funds in the bill; District of Columbia funds in the bill; and \ngeneral provisions in the bill.\n\n\n                             federal funds\n\n  The bill includes $820 million in budget authority in Federal funds \nfor the District of Columbia. These funds are to be used to implement \nthe provisions of the National Capital Revitalization and Self-\nGovernment Improvement Act of 1997, which was incorporated into the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997, and enacted into law on August 5, 1997.\n  Subsequently, on August 14, 1997, the President forwarded to Congress \na series of budget amendments to implement the provisions of the \nRevitalization Act. The bill fully funds the President's revised budget \nand, in addition, provides $8 million for management reforms, $30 \nmillion for the full authorization of $190 million for the Federal \ncontribution and $5 million for a reimbursement to the National Park \nService for Park Police services.\n\n\n                       district of columbia funds\n\n  In response to the Revitalization Act, the District government, \nincluding the mayor and the city council, and the control board, \nsubmitted to Congress a consensus and balanced budget, incorporating \nthe changes made by the Revitalization Act.\n  The revised District budget for fiscal year 1998 is $4,693,637,000. \nThe committee adopted the consensus balanced budget without change.\n\n\n                           general provisions\n\n  Most of the general provisions included in the bill have been \nincluded in previous years and restate existing law.\n  With regard to section 134, which restricts the use of funds for \nabortions, the bill states that no funds--Federal or local--may be used \nfor this purpose.\n  As I said during committee markup, I believe this provision to be an \nunwarranted intrusion in the affairs of the District of Columbia and I \nmay offer an amendment at the appropriate time to allow the District of \nColumbia to use its own funds to pay for abortions for poor women.\n  Another general provision prohibits funds being used by the District \nto implement its domestic partners law. Again, I believe this is an \nunwarranted and inappropriate intrusion by the Federal Government into \nmatters under local control.\n  One general provision was included in the bill at my request. It \nwould provide that the D.C. initiative homeless services in the \nDistrict of Columbia be maintained in fiscal year 1998 at the fiscal \nyear 1997 level.\n  My amendment prevents a reduction in services to the homeless which \nhad been recommended in the consensus budget from the District.\n  Again, I commend the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Faircloth, \nfor his efforts to produce a bipartisan bill. I would also like to \nexpress my thanks to the Appropriations Committee staff--Terry Sauvain \nof the Democratic staff and Mary Beth Nethercutt of the majority--for \ntheir assistance in helping us bring this bill to the floor today.\n  Finally, Mr. President, with respect to amendments that may be \noffered to this bill, I hope my colleagues will refrain from proposing \namendments that\n\n[[Page S9871]]\n\nare not germane to this measure. The new fiscal year begins in only a \nfew days, and the District of Columbia desperately needs to have its \nnew budget in place. So I hope we can quickly pass a bill with broad \nbipartisan support and send it to the President for signature.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending measure is S. 1156, the \nfiscal year 1998 District of Columbia appropriations bill.\n  This appropriations bill provides Federal payments to the District of \nColumbia totaling $820.0 million. The bill provides $190 million for \nthe Federal contribution to the District of Columbia, $169 million to \noperate the District's correctional facilities for felons, $302 million \nto build new correctional facilities to replace the Lorton facility, \n$146 million to operate the District Court System, $8 million to \nimplement management reform initiatives, and $5 million to the National \nPark Service to support U.S. Park Police operations in the District.\n  This appropriation is in addition to the resources allocated to the \nDistrict by the Balanced Budget Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n1997. Combined, the two laws provide tax breaks and mandatory spending \nworth $4.5 billion over 10 years. Because the cost of taking over the \nDistrict's $5.8-billion pension liability is largely delayed until \nafter this period, the total bailout is worth substantially more to the \nDistrict.\n  This appropriation bill is at the subcommittee's revised 302(b) \nallocation for both budget authority and outlays.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      D.C.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, which \nis a series of technical amendments, on behalf of myself and Senator \nBoxer, and I ask they be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared, and I ask \nfor its immediate adoption.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. This has been cleared. We urge adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1248) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, we were expecting some other people to \noffer amendments and I assume they are coming down.\n  In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats], for himself, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Coverdell and Mr. \n     Gregg, proposes an amendment numbered 1249.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Oregon is waiting \nto bring forward an amendment and I will not take but just a few \nminutes. We have sent the amendment to the desk as the pending \nbusiness. It will be debated tomorrow. Senator Lieberman and I are \njoining as cosponsors in offering this amendment. I have a number of \nSenators, I think on both sides of the aisle, that wish to speak to it. \nThere will be ample time for them to speak tomorrow on the amendments. \nThey do not need to be concerned about rushing over here now. We did, \nhowever, want to have the amendment introduced so it is the pending \nbusiness when we begin tomorrow.\n  In brief summary, the amendment provides opportunity scholarships for \nchildren in the District of Columbia in grades K through 12 whose \nfamily income is 185 percent or below the poverty level. The \nscholarships can be used for tuition costs of public or private \nscholarships in the District of Columbia, and adjacent counties in \nVirginia and Maryland. Scholarships are available for tutoring of \nstudents who attend public schools in the District.\n  The legislation creates a District of Columbia Scholarship \nCommission, a seven-member private, nonprofit corporation, to \nadminister the scholarship program and certify institutions that will \nbe eligible to participate in the scholarship program. One board member \nwill be appointed by the mayor of\n\n[[Page S9872]]\n\nWashington, DC, and the remaining six are to be appointed by the \nPresident, three from the list of nominees provided by the Speaker of \nthe House of Representatives and three by a list of nominees provided \nby the majority leader of the Senate, both in consultation with the \nminority. Members must be residents of the District of Columbia and may \nnot be Federal Government employees.\n  Students whose family incomes are below the poverty line may receive \na scholarship of up to $3,200. Students whose family incomes are above \nthe poverty line but below 185 percent of that level may receive the \nlesser of 75 percent of the cost of tuition, and mandatory fees for and \ntransportation to attend an eligible institution, or $2,400. Students \nreceiving tutoring assistance are eligible for up to $500. Both of \nthese figures are indexed for inflation.\n  If there are not sufficient funds available for all of the eligible \napplicants, scholarships are to be awarded on a random basis by a \nlottery selection. The lottery is required to the extent practical to \naward an equal number of tuition scholarships and scholarships for \nfees. In other words, there will be no skimming of the green, there \nwill be no biasing of the selection. If there are more scholarships \nthan students, then, of course, every student would receive a \nscholarship that requested one. It is on a voluntary basis. If there \nare more students than scholarships, they will be awarded on a random \nbasis. The amendment authorizes $7 million for spending in fiscal 1998 \nout of the Federal contribution earmarked to repay the cumulative \nFederal fund deficit for the District of Columbia. This total is $30 \nmillion. This $7 million earmark would leave $23 million remaining for \nthat specific purpose of deficit fund reduction.\n\n  I point out that that is above the amount recommended by the \nadministration. The administration requested a total Federal \ncontribution for the District of Columbia of $160 million, and the bill \nbefore us, the D.C. Appropriations bill, contains $190 million.\n  In summary, then, we are not taking a dollar or a penny away from the \nD.C. public schools. We are not taking any money away from the current \noperating requirements of the District of Columbia that we are funding. \nIn fact, we are adding $30 million for the purpose of reducing the \ngeneral fund deficit. Of that additional $30 million, we are earmarking \n$7 million for these opportunity scholarships.\n  In the interest of time, I will not continue here. I will have much \nmore to say about this tomorrow. I am looking forward to offering this \namendment, together with my counterpart, Senator Lieberman. This is a \nbipartisan effort. We are hopeful that we can begin the process of \nproviding alternatives to students and their parents, who do not feel \nthey are getting an adequate education. Our goal is not to undermine \nthe school system of the District of Columbia; it is to improve it. Our \ngoal is to move from the status quo, which is failing many, many \nstudents. We think this is an opportunity to do that. We look forward \nto debating this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, if the Senator from Oregon will yield, \nI would like to ask for a time agreement of 30 minutes for the \ndiscussion of the amendment Senator Wyden has. Is that agreeable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is proposing a \n30-minute time agreement.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I need 30 minutes on my side.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have 30 \nminutes on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to a 1-hour time limit \nequally divided?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1250\n\n            (Purpose: To eliminate secret Senate ``holds'')\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Wyden], for himself and Mr. \n     Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 1250.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC.   . ELIMINATING SECRET SENATE ``HOLDS.''\n\n       (a) Standing Order.--It is a standing order of the Senate \n     that a Senator who provides notice to leadership of his or \n     her intention to object to proceeding to a motion or matter \n     shall disclose the objection (hold) in the Congressional \n     Record not later than 2 session days after the date of said \n     notice.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment today on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Grassley of Iowa. Mr. President, one of the most \nsignificant personal powers of a U.S. Senator is the power to \neffectively block the consideration of a bill or nomination from coming \nto the floor of the U.S. Senate. This power has become known as putting \na ``hold'' on a measure or bill that a Senator opposes. It is a power \nthat a U.S. Senator can exercise in secret. The name of the Senator \nplacing a hold on Senate business is now held confidentially by party \nleadership.\n  This extraordinary power was once used rarely by Senators, usually as \na matter of common courtesy. In the last 20 years, however, the hold \nhas become a special tool for influence and leverage. It is especially \nvaluable at this time--at a time when we are moving toward the end of \nthe session--because it allows a Senator, secretly, to exercise an \nenormous amount of clout over a matter when time is short.\n  Mr. President, the record is replete with statements of Members of \nthis body who have indicated that there have been abuses of the hold, \nand that this is a procedure that has completely gotten out of hand. \nLet me read from the words of Senator John Glenn during the final hours \nof the 101st Congress. Senator Glenn said:\n\n       I find it deplorable that, suddenly, anonymously, a Senator \n     or a combination of Senators on the Republican side can stand \n     against the strong desire of the President and the Office of \n     Management and Budget for this legislation.\n\n  Lest anyone think that this be a partisan matter, Senator Thurmond \nsaid:\n\n       I think abuse does arise out of that.\n\n  Senator Hatch said:\n\n       We get victimized by holds, especially at the end of a \n     session.\n\n  Senator Leahy of Vermont, another senior Member said:\n\n       There should not be any holds at all.\n\n  He said we just should not have any holds.\n  Well, I am not proposing anything like that. But I do think that \nevery Member of the U.S. Senate ought to be held publicly accountable. \nI think when one Member of the U.S. Senate moves to effectively block \nthe consideration of a bill or a nomination, they ought to make it \nclear to their constituents that they are the individual blocking this \nmatter.\n  Mr. President, as I have worked on this issue with Senator Grassley, \non a bipartisan basis, for a year and a half, I have found that very \nfew Senators are aware of how extensive some of these abuses are until \nit happens to them. For example, I learned last year that, often, a \nmember of the staff places a hold on a measure and the Senator whose \nname in which the hold is placed isn't even aware of it. So what you \nhave are secret holds, not just by someone with an election \ncertificate, but by someone who doesn't have an election certificate at \nall--a member of the staff.\n  So I believe that it is time to ensure that the rights of Senators \nand the rights under the Senate rules afford substantial opportunities \nfor Senators to make sure that they are heard and, to represent their \nfolks, are accompanied by responsibilities. I want to make it clear to \neach and every Senator that I, in no way, would limit the right to \nfilibuster. I would, in no way, limit the right to ensure that they can \nspeak at length on a motion to proceed. And, in fact, I am not even \ngoing so far as to put any limits on the right to place a hold on a \nmeasure or a matter, other than that a U.S. Senator be public about \nwhat they are doing.\n  As I have talked about it with my constituents, they raise serious \nquestions about whether one Member of the U.S. Senate should be able to \neffectively block consideration of Senate business at all. So I think \nthat the\n\n[[Page S9873]]\n\nAmerican people will consider this a very modest reform. I see no \nevidence that citizens want this kind of information held confidential, \nheld secret. So I want to make clear to my colleagues that what I am \nagainst is the secrecy. It is the secrecy that is wrong, not the \nquestion of whether a Senator wants to exercise their rights.\n  Let me also say that I think it is particularly appropriate for the \nSenate to move now. I have discussed this, over the last 15 months, on \na number of occasions with the majority leader, Senator Lott. Senator \nLott, to his credit, has taken several steps to improve the procedures \nof the Senate and in dealing with the holds that I think are very \nconstructive. But what has not been done is there has been no change in \nthe Senate rules to deal with the issue that I bring up today. A hold \ncan still be kept secret. A hold can still be kept confidential with \nthe party leadership.\n  So, in my view, Senator Lott's proposal and the proposal that he made \non January 27 of this year is a constructive one. It puts in place a \nnumber of sensible changes, such as disallowing what are known as \n``block holds,'' where a Senator would put a hold on a block of bills. \nBut it still keeps this procedure and the use of one of the most \nextensive personal powers a U.S. Senator has secret. So I hope that as \nthe Senate considers this legislation--and it is only one sentence \nlong, it is not a complicated amendment; it is only one sentence long. \nI hope that the Senators will see this for what it is, which is to \nbring sunlight to the debate over the Senate's rules.\n\n  I will be speaking for a few additional minutes, Mr. President, but I \nunderstand that the chairman of the subcommittee has asked to make a \nchange in the time for the vote that he had arranged earlier. I am \nhappy to yield to him at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n    Unanimous Consent Agreement--Legislative Branch Appropriations \n                           Conference Report\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, speaking for the leader, I ask \nunanimous consent that the vote on the legislative branch \nappropriations conference report now occur at 6 o'clock today, rather \nthan 5:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1250\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this effort that Senator Grassley and I \nhave pursued for many months has been endorsed by a number of groups \nthat are seeking to try to make the U.S. Senate more open in the way it \nconducts its business. Common Cause, for example, is an organization \nthat has sought to have public disclosure of this particular procedure.\n  What we are talking about here is if a Member of the U.S. Senate is \ngoing to exercise this extraordinary, unilateral power, there should be \nsunshine; sunshine, we all know, is the very best disinfectant. It is \nan opportunity for all Members of the U.S. Senate to have a chance to \nbe part of the debate because at least they will know who they are \ndebating with. What is the most ironic part of the use of the hold is \nthat the Senate, in which every Member takes pride, an institution to \nfoster debate about important issues, doesn't in many instances allow \nfor a Member of the U.S. Senate to even know who they are debating with \nbecause one Member of the Senate has anonymously blocked the issue. So \nlet me be clear with respect to what this legislation does. This \napplies to a Senator who is digging in and making it clear that they \nobject to a measure or a nomination.\n  This is not an individual who perhaps needs to know when an amendment \nis coming up, or perhaps have an opportunity to come over to the Senate \nfloor to speak on a measure or matter. That is not what is being \ndiscussed here. What is being discussed here is making sure that when \nthere is a full court press to oppose a bill or a nomination that that \nkind of opposition be brought to light.\n  We had some recent experience with how influential polls can be. For \nexample, we saw that in the last Congress, to quote USA Today on the \nmatter, ``A skulk of faceless Senators is using a series of \nparliamentary holds to dry gulch legislation extending health insurance \nto millions of Americans.''\n  That wasn't 20 years ago. That wasn't 30 years ago. That was an \nanonymous hold that was used to influence an important piece of health \ncare legislation in the last session of the U.S. Congress. The fact is, \nMr. President, that this procedure, which was once a matter of common \ncourtesy, is now so widely used that it has become one of the most \nfrequent ways to prevent any public disclosure of Senate business.\n  I hope that as we look to these last few days of this session--I \nbring this to the floor now because I believe that the abuse of the \nhold is most likely during these last few days of the session--that we \ntake this opportunity to make the U.S. Senate more open and more \naccountable.\n  Right now, if a Senator seeks to personally block a measure or \nmatter, there is no cost to them. They face no disapproval because no \none would know who they were disapproving of. The fact is that this is \na process and a power, an enormous power, held by the U.S. Senate that \nis exercised in the dark. It seems to me that it carries the odor of \nback room deals, abuse of privilege, and a body that cares more about \nindividual personal desires than those of the American people.\n  This isn't cutting off the right of any Member of the U.S. Senate. \nEvery Senator can still filibuster. Every Senator can still exercise \ntheir rights with respect to a motion to proceed. It simply says that \nit has to be done publicly.\n  Let me also say that it has been the experience of Senator Grassley \nand myself that you can do this, and, as Senator Grassley has told me, \nit doesn't hurt. For example, just a week ago Senator Smith and I felt \nstrongly, on a bipartisan basis, about issues with respect to a C-130 \ncrash that carried Oregonians who were reservists. At that time, \nbecause we were seeking answers from the military and given the fact \nthat the appointment of the new head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was \nforthcoming, I put a hold on that nomination for a brief period of \ntime. I made it clear on the floor and in other forums that I was the \nMember of the Senate who did it. I published it in the Congressional \nRecord, just as my amendment calls for.\n  So, during that period, there was, over a short few days, an effort \nto have a public discussion about this matter. There were also \nbipartisan discussions with Senator Thurmond and Senator McCain, and \nothers were extremely helpful in the efforts that Senator Smith and I \nmade on this matter. And early the next week the hold that I had, which \nwas public, I lifted. The needs of my constituents were addressed, and \nthe American people saw a good man--a good man--General Shelton, \nconfirmed to head the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  So, Mr. President, what we have done, Senator Grassley and I, is we \nhave practiced what we preach. We don't believe that it abridges our \nrights in any way. All we are saying is that there is no reasonable \nplace for protracted ongoing anonymous delay. That is what we think is \nwrong. There is no place, as the New York Times recently said, for \n``the hold as currently practiced.''\n  So I am not suggesting today, Mr. President and colleagues, that the \nhold be abolished. I am not suggesting that the filibuster be changed \nin any way. I am not suggesting that on the motion to proceed there be \nany change. All I am saying is when a hold is put on a matter so that a \nSenator digs in to personally effectively block the consideration of a \nmeasure or a matter, that within 2 days of that time they notify party \nleadership that they are the individual seeking to prevent \nconsideration of that measure or matter on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, and that they just put a little notice in the Congressional \nRecord. No big procedure, no hassle, just a notice, just a notice \nidentifying that Senator as the Senator who has put a hold on a measure \nor matter.\n  Mr. President, my guess is that if my amendment passes, there may be \na variety of ways that Senators may still seek to vitiate the spirit of \nwhat Senator Grassley and I are seeking to do. But I do think that \npassage of this amendment will put the U.S. Senate on record. We will \nbe on record for sunshine. We will be on record as being opposed to \nsecrecy, and especially we will be taking steps so that at this time of \nthe session as the session moves into the last few weeks when history \nshows\n\n[[Page S9874]]\n\nthat you are most likely to have abuses of the hold, we will have shown \nthat we are willing to make changes that hold the U.S. Senate and each \nMember here publicly accountable for their actions.\n  Mr. President, none of us got here easily. Like many other Senators, \nmy campaign and my election was something of a trial by fire. No Member \nof this body lacks fortitude. I think we can stand some extra added \nlight. I think we can stand some extra added sunshine. I think that we \ncan take the secrecy out of the hold procedure and still make sure that \neach and every Senator is able to exercise their rights and protect \ntheir constituents.\n\n  I believe that the passage of this amendment, at a time when millions \nof Americans are especially cynical and skeptical about Government, \nwill cause citizens to say that the Senate is doing the right thing, \nand we will see constituents have a bit more respect for this body as a \nresult of Senators being willing to be held publicly accountable. This \namendment is not about getting rid of the hold. It is not about doing \nanything to a hold other than saying that a Senator has to be publicly \naccountable when that one Senator effectively moves to block the \nconsideration of a bill or a nomination.\n  Mr. President, I have not been here as long as some, but I read the \nstatements of Senators who have been here for quite some time--Senator \nGlenn, who called it deplorable; Senator Thurmond, who said that there \nhas been an abuse; Senator Hatch, who said that every Senator has been \nvictimized by it; and, Senator Leahy, who went far far farther than \nanything I would be talking about. He said there shouldn't be any holds \nat all.\n  In fact, in my conversations with Senators, I have been told that \nsome Senators find this procedure so abhorrent that they will not \nexercise it at all, and they are especially frustrated by their \ncolleagues who do.\n  So, in closing, Mr. President, let me go back to just how great the \nabuse is.\n  It is one thing if Chairman Faircloth or Senator Boxer or another \nMember of U.S. Senate puts a hold on a matter. All of the Senators are \ndirectly responsible to their constituents. What I found is a lot of \nSenators didn't even know that a hold had been placed on a bill in \ntheir name.\n  One senior Member of the U.S. Senate came to me last session, and \nsaid, ``I am for your bill. I think it is a good idea. We need some \npublic disclosure of these holds. And the reason I am for it is a few \nminutes ago a Senator came up to me and said, `Why do you have a hold \non my bill?' And the person who was sympathetic to what I have been \ntrying to do said, `I don't have a hold on your bill.' '' It turned out \nthat a staff person had done it in their name.\n  So what we have is a situation where not just are holds by Senators \nkept anonymous and kept confidential, but now we have staff that \ndoesn't have an election certificate putting holds on these matters as \nwell.\n  The hold started out many years ago. I gather from historians that it \nis well over 100 years old. It started out as a matter of common \ncourtesy. It was something that Senators did to accommodate each other \nto make sure that an individual could be present to speak on an \namendment, to ensure that they would have an opportunity to be heard if \nthey had some sort of glitch in their time schedule. That is not what \nthis amendment addresses. That is not what this amendment addresses at \nall.\n  This amendment is about ensuring that when a U.S. Senator uses all of \ntheir power, every bit of their power, to block a measure or a \nnomination, and they exercise those extraordinary rights that each of \nus has, that it be accompanied by a responsibility to the American \npeople. That responsibility to the American people is to tell them, \ntell your constituents, when you exercise this extraordinary power that \nyou are the one who did it. You are the one who blocked a bill or a \nnomination.\n  Let's bring some sunshine here.\n  I will tell leadership--let me say that Senator Daschle and Senator \nLott have talked with me about this. Both of them have been very \ngracious. Senator Daschle indicated that he is in support of this. I \nbelieve that what I am proposing in this amendment complements the \nuseful changes that Senator Lott, the majority leader, made this \nJanuary.\n  The majority leader, Senator Lott, implemented a number of changes \nthat I think are constructive, but they still allow for the secrecy. \nThey still allow for one Senator to effectively block consideration of \na measure or matter.\n  I gather that the vote on this amendment will be tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time to be able, prior \nto the vote tomorrow, to speak on this amendment again for up to 10 \nminutes, to be able to ensure that Senators prior to the vote----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. There is objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, reclaiming the floor, will the Senator from \nNorth Carolina be open to a question at this time?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I am proposing that an amendment be accepted by the Senate \nthat would modestly change one of a Senator's most extensive powers, \nthe power to secretly block a measure or matter from coming to the \nSenate floor. Does the Senator believe that it is not appropriate to \nhave 10 minutes of discussion of it tomorrow before it comes up?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. It might be all right to have 10 minutes, but we will \nhave to decide it tomorrow. I am not ready now to agree to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a B-1 bomber from Ellsworth Air Force \nBase near Rapid City, SD, crashed last Friday killing all four of the \nflight crew members. All four men who lost their lives were highly \ndecorated American airmen receiving such awards as the Meritorious \nService Medal, the Air Force Commendation Medal, the Humanitarian \nService Medal, the Combat Readiness Medal, and the National Defense \nService Medal.\n  The four men were Col. Anthony Beat of the 28th Bomb Wing, vice \ncommander. He was from Attica, OH, and is survived by his wife, Delores \nAnn, and sons, James and Alan. Maj. Clay Culver was the 37th Bomb \nSquadron assistant operations officer and weapons systems officer. He \nwas from Sulfur, LA, and is survived by his wife, Cynthia, his \ndaughter, Ann, and son, Parker, all of Rapid City. Maj. Kirk Cakerice, \nthe 37th Bomb Squadron assistant operations officer and instructor \npilot, was from Eldora, IA, and is survived by his wife, Myra, son, \nBrett, and daughter, Kendra, all of Rapid City. Capt. Gary Everett was \nthe 37th Bomb Systems weapons systems officer from Brooklyn, NY, and is \nsurvived by his parents, Joseph and Dorthy Everett, of Glasgow, KY, and \nseveral brothers and sisters and fiance.\n  On Monday, over 1,500 friends, peers, colleagues, and family mourned \nthe loss of these four brave men in a memorial service at Ellsworth Air \nForce Base. At this time of tragedy, thoughts and prayers and the \nattention of people of the Black Hills region and the State of South \nDakota and our Nation are with the families and friends of these four \ncrewmen.\n  This tragic incident underscores how quickly lives of even our \nbravest and most skilled military personnel can be lost. It is \nimportant that the legacy of these four men live on as dedicated \nairmen, proud parents, loving husbands, grateful sons, and honorable \nmen. Our loss reflects the fact that in peacetime, as well as during \nconflict, the men and women of our military, our friends, our spouses, \nour children, put their lives on the line each and every day to \npreserve and protect our liberty as Americans.\n\n  Colonel Beat, Major Cakerice, Major Culver, and Captain Everett were \ndecorated veterans and honorable men who approached their military \nservice with extraordinary dedication, commitment, pride, and \nprofessionalism.\n\n[[Page S9875]]\n\n  In this time of tragedy, we must also acknowledge that our Nation is \nstronger and our liberties more secure because of the willingness of \nthese patriots to commit their talent, their leadership, and ultimately \ntheir lives to the defense of our Nation.\n  Colonel Beat, Major Cakerice, Major Culver, and Captain Everett were \nshining examples of the quality, the expertise and the talents of the \nmen and women who put on the uniforms of our Armed Forces.\n  And so again, Mr. President, our prayers are with the families of \nthese four great American airmen. We know that every day of the week \nothers embark on similar training experiences and similar endeavors. \nLives are always at risk in times of peace as well as in conflict in \norder to protect our liberties as Americans, including our ability in \nthis Senate to gather, to debate, to discuss policy issues affecting \nour Nation.\n  So it is in the great effort of these airmen, and others like them in \nall of our branches of the military, that we owe great gratitude. All \npeople in the State of South Dakota share the grief but also the pride \nof these families in the great contribution that these airmen have made \nto our Nation.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON.

The report will be stated.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2209) having met, after full and free conference, have agreed \n     to recommend and do recommend to their respective Houses this \n     report, signed by all of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 18, 1997.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I am pleased to report that the House \nand Senate conferees reached an agreement on funding for the \nlegislative branch for the fiscal year 1998. The agreement we reached \nprovides for total spending of slightly under $2.5 billion--an increase \nof 2 percent over the fiscal year 1997 level and a decrease of 6 \npercent from the President's budget.\n  Before we begin, I would like to state for the record that the issue \nof pay for Members of Congress is not in this bill.\n  However, there were significant differences in the amount of funding \nin the House and Senate bills. The House wanted to limit the growth of \nthe legislative branch to the fiscal year 1997 level exclusive of \nSenate items. The Senate had made a commitment to the General \nAccounting Office--a commitment which was made when Senator Mack \nchaired this subcommittee and oversaw a 25-percent reduction in GAO. \nThis was a 25-percent reduction in their budget and a 33-percent \nreduction in staff. I participated in the decision to reduce the \nagency, and I was also a party to the Senate's commitment to stabilize \nthe agency once it made the reduction. Senator Dorgan shared my desire \nto meet that commitment.\n  I want to thank Senator Dorgan for his hard work, and interest in the \nbill. It was only with his strong support that we were able to provide \nadequate funding--a $7 million increase in direct appropriations plus \nand increase of $1.5 million in offsetting receipts over the fiscal \nyear 1997 level.\n  The Federal Government will spend almost $1.7 trillion next year. The \nlegislative branch has the responsibility to oversee this budget and \nmake sure that taxpayer funds are being spent wisely. GAO is \nresponsible for identifying wasteful Federal spending and recommending \nways in which we can save billions of dollars. This past year GAO has \nidentified $6 billion in measurable savings in the Federal Government. \nThat does not include other savings which cannot be measured in \ndollars--such as better organization, ways in which an agency can \nbetter serve taxpayers, etc. For every $1 appropriated to GAO, they \nhave identified $50 savings. This is an agency which is worth the \ninvestment.\n  Maintenance was another issue in this bill. I believe strongly in the \nneed to invest in maintenance. Saving a small amount of money now on \nmaintenance will only result in higher costs in the future.\n  I learned in business that if you do not properly maintain your \nbuilding and equipment you will soon find yourself spending much more \nmoney to replace those items which have crumbled or can no longer \nfunction. There are a number of maintenance and security items which \nthe Senate identified as priorities such as, repairs to the Library of \nCongress roof, investment in the Capitol powerplant, and Capitol \nsecurity.\n  Funding for the Joint Committee on Taxation was also an issue. The \nSenate conferees agreed at the strong urging of the House conferees to \nsplit the difference between the House and Senate bills resulting in an \nincrease of $91,500 over the Senate bill. For many years now the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation has operated as an extension of the Finance and \nWays and Means committees. Members of Congress who are not members of \nthose committees have not been able to get revenue estimates for their \nproposals. Without the revenue estimates, it is almost impossible to go \nto the floor to offer an amendment to a tax bill.\n  We have been assured by the House that Congressman Archer--the \ncurrent chairman of the Joint Committee on Taxation is committed to \nworking harder to provide to Senators and Representatives revenue \nestimates in a timely fashion. It is our intent to ensure that the \nJoint Committee on Taxation assists all Members of Congress. Included \nin the statement of managers on page 26 of the conference report is \nlanguage identifying the scope of the assistance we expect the Joint \nCommittee to provide to Members.\n  During the course of the next year, I would like to hear from my \ncolleagues if they are finding the Joint Committee to be helpful.\n  In reaching this agreement, the Senate came down $37 million in \nbudget authority and the House went up $24 million. I am comfortable \nthat the legislative branch will be able to meet its oversight \nresponsibilities with the funding provided in this agreement.\n  Again, I would like to thank Senator Dorgan as the ranking member for \nhis hard work on reaching this agreement. In addition, I would like to \nthank Senator Steven, Senator Craig and Senator Boxer for their \nassistance on the subcommittee as well as the following staff: \nChristine Ciccone, Jim English, Mary Dewald, Mary Hawkins, Chuck \nTurner, and Chip Yost, for their superior work.\n  I thank my colleagues in advance for their support of the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise in support of the conference \nagreement to H.R. 2209, the fiscal year 1998 legislative branch \nappropriation bill. The conference agreement provides a total of $2.25 \nbillion for fiscal year 1998 for the Congress and other legislative \nbranch agencies. This represents a reduction of $144 million from the \nbudget request.\n  All in all, this is a good conference agreement. I wish to take just \na minute to point out the level of funding agreed to by the conferees \nwith respect to the General Accounting Office [GAO]. As Members are \naware, an agreement was reached last Congress between the GAO and \nappropriators to reduce the GAO's budget by a total of 25 percent over \nfiscal years 1996 and 1997. The GAO successfully implemented a plan for \nthis reduction, without having to be dragged kicking and screaming. Our \ncommitment to them, in return, was to stabilize their funding at that \nreduced level. Unfortunately, for fiscal year 1998, the House \nrecommended an appropriation of only $323.5 million for the GAO, a \nreduction of $37.9 million below their budget request. The Senate bill, \nafter thorough consideration and cooperation from the GAO itself, found \nthat an appropriation of $346.8 million would be sufficient to maintain \nGAO's level of operations.\n\n[[Page S9876]]\n\n  Madam President, this was the most difficult issue in the conference. \nChairman Bennett joined me in urging the House to come up substantially \nfrom their level. Ultimately, the conferees agreed to an appropriation \nof $339.5 million for fiscal year 1998, $7 million above the fiscal \nyear 1997 appropriation and $16 million above the House-passed bill. \nWhile not providing GAO every last dollar that they would like to have \nhad, this level of funding comes very close to fulfilling our \ncommitment to the GAO.\n  I commend Senator Bennett for his fairness and the leadership he \nshowed during our conference with the House. I also compliment the \nHouse conferees, particularly the House subcommittee chairman, \nCongressman Walsh, and his minority counterpart, Congressman Serrano, \nas well as their very capable staffs, Ed Lombard for the majority and \nGreg Dahlberg for the minority.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to vote for this conference \nagreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, as I said when this bill came before the \nSenate for consideration, this is, overall, a good bill. It contains \nvery few of the types of earmarks and set-asides for pork-barrel \nspending that are included in most of the appropriations bills.\n  Of course, I don't believe I have ever had the pleasure of reading an \nappropriations bill that is completedly devoid of earmarks, and this \nbill is no exception.\n  When this bill came before the Senate, I applauded the Senate's \ndecision to eliminate or reduce funding for several projects that did \nnot appear to be high-priority projects. The Senate cut $50,000 for a \nstudy of electromagnetic fields in the Russell Senate Office Building, \nreduced funding for elevator modernization in the Hart Building by \n$200,000. Unfortunately, the Senate did include $100,000 for a new \nsubway from the Russell Building to the Capitol.\n  Because of these and other reductions, the overall budget for Senate \nbuildings was reduced by about $2 million. This conference agreement \nrestores the full $52 million originally proposed for the Senate.\n  My staff was told by the Appropriations Subcommittee staff that this \nrestored money will not be used for the projects noted above that the \nSenate explicitly cut. Instead, $2 million will be transferred and used \nfor maintenance and repair projects and security improvements in the \nCapitol. Although I can find nothing in the conference agrement that \nwould ensure this is the case, I trust that none of the restored funds \nwill be used, for example, to study electromagnetic fields in the \nRussell Senate Office Building.\n  Finally, I am disappointed that the conferees chose to specifically \nreverse the direction in the Senate report that would require the \nGeneral Accounting Office to place higher priority on Members' requests \nfor audits, studies, and investigations. This has been a particular \nmatter of concern to me, and I was pleased that the Senate \nAppropriations Committee chose to take the initiative to establish the \nproper priority for the GAO's work.\n  I am sure most of my colleagues have, at one time or another, been \nadvised that the GAO cannot complete work we have requested in a timely \nfashion. But I don't know if my colleagues are aware that GAO does a \ngreat deal of work that is either self-initiated or requested \ninformally by staff members. And often this work is placed ahead of \nwork that is requested by Members in the GAO's assignment of staff and \nresources to complete the work. I don't believe most of my colleagues \nwould think that is the proper prioritization for an agency that works \nfor the Congress.\n  Frankly, I can see no good reason why the conferees took the unusual \nstep of repudiating this very much-needed directive. Unfortunately, \nhowever, because this provision has been summarily reversed by the \nconferees, I will have to consider other appropriate means to ensure \nthat GAO's prioritization of work reflects the needs of the Congress, \nnot the GAO itself.\n  Madam President, these are not major problems. The total of the pork-\nbarrel provisions in this bill is only slightly more than $1 million. \nHowever, again, I remind my colleagues that every taxpayer dollar we \nwaste reinforces the disdain of the American people for the Congress \nand our way of doing business.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of objectionable provisions be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n   Objectionable Provisions in the Conference Report on the FY 1998 \n                 Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill\n\n\n                             Bill Language\n\n       $100,000 from the Library of Congress budget for an \n     International Copyright Institute.\n       $2,250 from the Library of Congress budget for official \n     representational and reception expenses offor activities of \n     the International Copyright Institute.\n       Earmark of unlimited amount of GAO's funds to finance an \n     appropriate share of the expenses of: the Joint Financial \n     Management Improvement Program, including the salary of the \n     Executive Director and secretarial support; the National \n     Intergovernmental Audit Forum or a Regional Intergovernmental \n     Audit Forum, as determined by the respective forum, including \n     necessary travel expenses of non-Federal participants; and \n     the costs of the American Consortium on International Public \n     Administration, including any expenses attributable to its \n     membership in the International Institute of Administrative \n     Sciences.\n\n\n                            Report Language\n\n       $300,000 for improved lighting in the Senate Chamber.\n       $100,000 to design a new subway from the Russell Building \n     to the Capitol Building.\n       $550,000 to modernize elevators in the Hart Building.\n       Total Objectionable Provisions: $1.052 million.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport on H.R. 2209, the legislative branch appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 1998.\n  The bill, as reported, provides $2.25 billion in new budget authority \nand $2 billion in outlays for the Congress and other legislative branch \nagencies, including the Library of Congress, the General Accounting \nOffice, and the Government Printing Office, among others.\n  When outlays from prior year appropriations and other adjustments are \ntaken into account, the bill totals $2.3 billion in budget authority \nand outlays.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent when the \nSenate resumes the Wyden amendment No. 1250, there be 20 minutes \nequally divided remaining, and following the conclusion or yielding \nback of time, the amendment be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, all without further action or debate.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I do not intend to object. I have had a \nchance to discuss this with the majority leader who has been gracious \nin offering me his time on this matter.\n  I ask only that the further discussion of this amendment take place \nat a time when the majority leader could be on the floor and he and I \ncould discuss this briefly. I believe the proposals he has made with \nrespect to holds are constructive. This proposal goes one step further, \nto have public disclosure of holds.\n  I ask only that the majority leader, at a time convenient with his \nschedule, be allowed to participate in that 20-minute discussion so he \nand I could briefly discuss that.\n  With that, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further objection? If not, without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I must applaud the actions of the \nchairman of the D.C. Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Faircloth, \nfor his restraint in putting together this bill.\n  The bill is the first step in implementing the National Capital \nRevitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act that Congress passed \nthis summer. This bill provides the funding necessary to carry out that \nact, and includes several provisions that will ensure fiscal \nresponsibility and adherence to the act.\n  In reviewing this bill, I have found only one section in the report \nlanguage that causes some concern. On page 31 of the report, the \nfollowing language appears:\n\n       The Committee is aware of the need for an adult and \n     pediatric heart transplant program at a not-for-profit \n     academic medical center servicing this Nation's Capital. The \n     D.C. metropolitan area is the only major metropolitan area \n     that does not have an academic medical center with a heart \n     transplant program. Since this not-for-profit medical center \n     has recently enhanced its capabilities by the additional of a \n     nationally and internationally renowned cardiovascular \n     surgeon and a nationally known pediatric cardiologist, the \n     Committee strongly recommends that the State health planning \n     and development agency approve the certificate of need \n     application for a nonprofit academic medical center in the \n     District of Columbia that has an approved lung transplant \n     program.\n\n  I am sure my colleagues are aware of the likely result of this type \nof language in an Appropriations Committee report. Although not bound \nto do so, I would expect that the State health planning and development \nagency will feel pressured to approve the application of this academic \nfacility. Although that may not be an inappropriate decision, I \ncontinue to believe it is inappropriate for Congress to direct these \ntypes of decisions on a case-by-case basis, rather than assessing the \nbroader requirements for health facilities in the District of Columbia. \nI would hope the committee would see fit to withdraw this near-\ndirective and allow the agency to make decisions based on the criteria \nit has developed for all such matters.\n  Again, this bill is free of the types of earmarks that we have seen \nin virtually every other appropriations measure to come before the \nSenate this year.\n  As the last appropriations measure to come before the Senate for \ndebate, perhaps this is a welcome sign of things to come as we turn to \nthe appropriations conference reports.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous-Consent Agreement--Amendment No. 1249\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask \nunanimous consent that debate on amendment No. 1249 begin at 12 noon on \nThursday and the time between noon and 5 p.m. be equally divided in the \nusual form. I further ask that at 5 p.m. the amendment\n\n[[Page S9878]]\n\nbe laid aside until Tuesday, September 30, and a cloture vote occur on \nthe amendment at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, September 30, with the mandatory \nquorum under rule XXII being waived, and the time between 10 a.m. and \n11 a.m. on Tuesday be equally divided between Senators Coats and \nKennedy. I further ask that no second-degree amendments be in order to \namendment No. 1249 prior to the cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared with respect to \nthe National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (``UNITA'') is \nto continue in effect beyond September 26, 1997, to the Federal \nRegister for publication.\n  The circumstances that led to the declaration on September 26, 1993, \nof a national emergency have not been resolved. The actions and \npolicies of UNITA pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to \nthe foreign policy of the United States. United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution 864 (1993) continues to oblige all Member States to \nmaintain sanctions. Discontinuation of the sanctions would have a \nprejudicial effect on the Angolan peace process. For these reasons, I \nhave determined that it is necessary to maintain in force the broad \nauthorities necessary to apply economic pressure to UNITA to reduce its \nability to pursue its aggressive policies of territorial acquisition.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to authorize the acquisition of the geologic \nformation known as the Valles Caldera currently managed by the Baca \nLand and Cattle Co., and to provide for an effective management program \nfor this resource within the Department of Agriculture, and consistent \nland management to protect the watershed of the Bandelier National \nMonument; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          VALLE GRANDE VALLES CALDERA PRESERVATION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this bill that I have just sent to the \ndesk, in my view, gives us a chance in this Congress to grasp a \nhistoric opportunity to make a real difference for the American people \nfor generations to come.\n  Most Americans can name various geologic treasures and places of \nwonder within our land. Places like Diamond Head in Hawaii, the \nSawtooth Mountains in Idaho, the Grand Canyon in Arizona, and Rocky \nMountain National Park in Colorado readily come to mind because our \npeople have access to them. However, there is a place in New Mexico \nthat rivals these areas in splendor and yet, few people know about, or \nfully appreciate its significance. It is called the Valles Caldera.\n  The Valles Caldera is one of the world's greatest volcanic features. \nA large circular crater 12-15 miles in diameter, the views from the rim \nare awe inspiring. As one looks across the vast green valleys and \nmountains that now sit within the ring of the caldera, and realizes \nthat they are all merely the cooled workings of a resurgent lava dome, \none is struck by the sheer magnitude of the natural forces that created \nthe Jemez Mountains in north central New Mexico.\n  The explosions that created the caldera, some 1.2 million years ago, \nejected over 100 cubic miles of earth, rock, and lava. It is estimated \nthat if the original mountain had come to a peak that it would have \nbeen taller than Mount Everest.\n  However very few people, even in New Mexico, have ever been on this \nland. Since 1860, it has been in private ownership. At that time it was \ngranted by the United States to the heirs of Don Luis Maria Cabeza de \nVaca as part of a settlement of Spanish land grant claims under the \nTreaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, and has since been known as the Baca Land \n& Cattle Company.\n\n  It has passed through several owners since 1860, and about once in a \ngeneration the United States has tried to purchase the land. The first \ntime was in the 1930's. Again, in the 1960's the late former Senator \nfrom New Mexico, Clinton P. Anderson tried to negotiate a deal for the \nland. Finally in 1980, the owner of the land, James ``Pat'' Dunigan, \nwas in negotiations with the Government to sell the land when he died a \npremature death. Now, his family has come forward and said they would \nlike to fulfill his dream of seeing this land move into public \nownership.\n  Mr. President, this is an opportunity that we cannot let pass us by. \nIn 1993, the Forest Service completed a study of this land which lays \nout the tremendous value it could have within public ownership:\n  First, the Valles Caldera is the classic example of a resurgent lava \ndome. The study of its features has helped geologists to understand \nvolcanic processes throughout the world;\n  Second, the recreation potential is enormous. Hiking, camping, cross-\ncountry skiing, photography, horse back riding, hunting, and fishing \nare obvious possibilities.\n  The headwaters of the Jemez and San Antonio rivers are located on \nthis land, and represent some of the best trout fishing streams in New \nMexico. There are nearly 27 miles of trout streams on the ranch, most \nof which meander through grass meadows perfect for fly fishing.\n  Also over 6,000 elk live on this land, making it ideal for hunting.\n  Perhaps the most unique features of this land are the seven enormous \nopen grassland valleys that are tailor made for horseback riding.\n  Third, finally, and perhaps most important, this land has been well \npreserved. Through careful management of their grazing land, selective \ntimbering, and the use of proscribed fire, the current owners have \nmaintained the caldera as an ecological jewel. With over 65,000 acres \nof conifer forests mixed with aspen, gamble oak, and broken rock known \nas felsenmeer, and 30,000 acres of lush grasslands, the Caldera \nsupports an abundance of wildlife, including black bears and cougars.\n  Mr. President, words are a poor substitute for seeing this land, and \nalthough pictures cannot convey its grandeur, they may provide my \ncolleagues with a sense of it:\n  First, to give people a sense of location, here is a map of north \ncentral New Mexico. To the south is Albuquerque and then Santa Fe above \nit. You'll notice that the Baca Ranch is nestled between the Santa Fe \nNational Forest, and Bandelier National Monument, which many members of \nthe public have visited.\n  Second, here is a satellite photo of the volcano. The black outline \nrepresents the Baca Ranch, approximately 95,000 acres. For perspective, \non the right side of this photo is Los Alamos, NM, and just below it is \nthe Bandelier National Monument. This large yellow spot on the bottom \nright corner of the caldera rim is known as the Valle Grande. It is the \nonly part of the Ranch that most people have seen because state highway \n4 comes through on the side, but it is only one of seven valleys on the \nproperty.\n  Third, here's a picture of the Valle Grande, it's about 4 miles wide \nand 6 miles long covering over 17,000 acres.\n  Fourth, and here is the upper Jemez river which originates and \nmeanders through the Valle Grande.\n  Fifth, finally, here is a picture of the Valle Toledo the third \nlargest valley on the property, about 4,000 acres.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I'm introducing today does two things: \nit gives the Forest Service the authority to start negotiating for the \npurchase of this land in good faith by authorizing appropriations, land \nexchanges, and the acceptance of donations; and it rationalizes the \nboundaries between the Santa Fe National Forest and Bandelier National \nMonument for consistent management of their respective watersheds.\n  Acquiring land of this quality and magnitude will not be cheap or \neasy. It will take a lot of work on the part of this body and our \ncounterparts on the House, and on the part of the administration. \nHowever, if we don't close this deal this time, I'm not sure the \nAmerican people will ever forgive us. Although the Dunigan's have been \ngreat stewards of the land, they want to sell it. Who knows how future \nowners may use this land.\n  When Senator Anderson tried to acquire this land for the United \nStates 35 years ago, we could have bought this land for less than $5 \nmillion. Now the costs will be much much greater, and if it is ever \nsubdivided, the costs will go up exponentially.\n  Mr. President, I know that many people will want to argue about the \nmanagement of this land. There are many, many uses that this land could \nbe put to, but I would caution my colleagues that now is not the time \nto argue over future use. Let's worry about how we will acquire the \nland first. Management options can be worked out later.\n  I think it will take additional time before a full management plan \ncan be put in place for the property. It would be an exercise in \nfutility for us to try to work all of that out before we move to take \nadvantage of this historic opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I understand that there is support for this effort to \nbring this property into public ownership by others in the delegation. \nI very much want to work with them and with people in the \nadministration to see this happen. It is a very important initiative \nand a very important goal for us to pursue in the second session of \nthis Congress. So I hope very much that we can make progress on it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 1212. A bill to amend the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 to clarify that records of arrival or \ndeparture are not required to be collected for purposes of the \nautomated entry-exit control system developed under 110 of such act for \nCanadians who are not otherwise required to possess a visa, passport, \nor border crossing identification card; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n[[Page S9888]]\n\n    the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act \n                  clarification amendment act of 1997\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, approximately 1 year ago the Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act became law.\n  Next year at this time, September 30, 1998, section 110 of this act \nwill be implemented and will adversely--and unintentionally--affect our \nneighbors in Canada. Section 110 requires the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service [INS] to develop an automated entry and exit \nsystem for the purpose of documenting the entry and departure of every \nalien arriving and leaving the United States. The United States has \nnever had such an alien departure management system.\n  Unfortunately, section 110 as enacted fails to recognize the decades-\nlong practice of not requiring most Canadian nationals to fill out INS \ndocuments--referred to as ``I-94s'' at the border.\n  In a December 18, 1996 letter to the Ambassador of Canada at the \ntime, Raymond Chretien, Senator Alan Simpson, and Representative Lamar \nSmith, the chairmen of the Senate and the House Judiciary Subcommittees \non Immigration, respectively, indicated to Ambassador Chretien that it \nwas not the intention of the Judiciary Committee to impose any new \nrequirements for border crossing cards--so-called I-94's--on Canadians \nwho are not presently required to possess such documents.\n  The legislation which I am introducing today--which was introduced in \nthe House on September 16 by Congressman John LaFalce of New York--\nwould simply clarify the intent of Congress by exempting from the \nsection 110 provisions of the act Canadian nationals who are not now \nrequired by law to possess a visa, passport, or border-crossing \nidentification card to enter the United States.\n  There is no logical reason to inhibit the flow of traffic between the \nUnited States and Canada. If the committee's intention is not \nclarified, and section 110 is implemented at the Canadian border, \ncongestion would become intolerable.\n  According to U.S. Customs, the port in Pembina, ND, saw 963,665 \nindividuals cross into North Dakota in fiscal year 1996, averaging \n2,640 people a day. Customs estimates that if the entry/exit system had \nto be implemented on the Canadian border, providing the agent to spend \njust 1 minute per person entering it would take two customs workers a \nnonstop daily shift of 22 hours to process them.\n  An estimated 116 million persons cross into the United States at all \nland points on the Canadian border. Of these, 76 million are Canadian \nor United States permanent residents. More than $1 billion in goods and \nservices trade crosses the United States/Canadian border each day. I \nurge the Judiciary Committee to consider soon mine or other legislation \nto clarify the intent of the 1996 act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1212\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXEMPTION FOR CERTAIN ALIENS FROM ENTRY-EXIT \n                   CONTROL SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 110(a) of the Illegal Immigration \n     Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (8 U.S.C. \n     1221 note) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) System.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), not later than \n     2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Attorney General shall develop an automated entry and exit \n     control system that will--\n       ``(A) collect a record of departure for every alien \n     departing the United States and match the records of \n     departure with the record of the alien's arrival in the \n     United States; and\n       ``(B) enable the Attorney General to identify, through on-\n     line searching procedures, lawfully admitted nonimmigrants \n     who remain in the United States beyond the period authorized \n     by the Attorney General.\n       ``(2) Exemption for certain aliens.--The system under \n     paragraph (1) shall not collect a record of arrival or \n     departure for an alien--\n       ``(A) who is--\n       ``(i) a Canadian national; or\n       ``(ii) an alien having a common nationality with Canadian \n     nationals and who has his or her residence in Canada; and\n       ``(B) who is not otherwise required by law to be in \n     possession, for purposes of establishing eligibility for \n     admission into the United States, of--\n       ``(i) a visa;\n       ``(ii) a passport; or\n       ``(iii) a border crossing identification card.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the \n     Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \n     of 1996 (Public Law 104-208; 110 Stat. 3009-546).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Inouye, Mr. Breaux, Mr. McCain, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Biden, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Murkowski):\n  S. 1213. A bill to establish a National Ocean Council, a Commission \non Ocean Policy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                         the oceans act of 1997\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Oceans Act \nof 1997. I am pleased to be joined in this endeavor by Senators \nStevens, Kerry, Snowe, Breaux, McCain, Inouye, Kennedy, Boxer, Biden, \nLautenberg, Akaka, and Murkowski. Mr. President, plainly and simply, \nthis bill calls for a plan of action for the 21st century to explore, \nprotect, and use our oceans and coasts.\n  This is not the first time we have faced the need for a national \nocean policy. Three decades ago, our Nation roared into space, \ninvesting tens of billions of dollars to investigate the Moon and the \nSea of Tranquility. During that golden era of science, some of us also \nrecognized the importance of exploring the seas on our own planet. In \n1966, Congress enacted the Marine Resources and Engineering Development \nAct in order to define national objectives and programs with respect to \nthe oceans. That legislation laid the foundation for U.S. ocean and \ncoastal policy and programs and has guided their development for three \ndecades. I was elected to the Senate just 3 months after the 1966 act \nwas enacted into law, but I am pleased that both Senators Inouye and \nKennedy, the two cosponsors of the 1966 act still serving in the \nSenate, have agreed to join me today in introducing the Oceans Act.\n  One of the central elements of the 1966 act was establishment of a \nPresidential commission to develop a plan for national action in the \noceans and atmosphere. Dr. Julius A. Stratton, a former president of \nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then-chairman of the Ford \nFoundation, led the Commission on an unprecedented, and since \nunrepeated, investigation of this Nation's relationship with the oceans \nand the atmosphere. The Stratton Commission and its congressional \nadvisers--including Senators Warren G. Magnuson and Norris Cotton--\nworked together in a bipartisan fashion. In fact, the Commission was \nestablished and carried out its mandate in the Democratic \nadministration of Lyndon Johnson and saw its findings implemented by \nthe Republicans under President Richard Nixon. With a staff of 35 \npeople, the commissioners heard and consulted over 1,000 people, \nvisited every coastal area of this country, and submitted some 126 \nrecommendations in a 1969 report to Congress entitled ``Our Nation and \nthe Sea.'' Those recommendations led directly to the creation of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in 1970, laid the \ngroundwork for enactment of the Coastal Zone Management Act [CZMA] in \n1972, and established priorities for Federal ocean activities that have \nguided this Nation for almost 30 years.\n  While the Stratton Commission performed its job with vision and \nintegrity, the world has changed since 1966. Today, half of the U.S. \npopulation lives within 50 miles of our shores and more than 30 percent \nof the gross domestic product is generated in the coastal zone. Ocean \nand coastal resources once considered inexhaustible are severely \ndepleted, and wetlands and other marine habitats are threatened by \npollution and human activities. In addition, the U.S. regulatory and \nlegal framework has developed over the years with the passage of a \nnumber of statutes in addition to CZMA. These include the Endangered \nSpecies Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Marine Protection, \nResearch, and Sanctuaries Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act, the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, and \nthe\n\n[[Page S9889]]\n\nOil Pollution Act. Finally, the United Nations has declared 1998 to be \nthe International Year of the Ocean, focusing global attention on the \nstate of the world's oceans. In short, it is time to reexamine our \nNation's relationship to the sea.\n  The Oceans Act is vital to the continued health of the oceans and \nprosperity of our coasts. It is patterned after and would replace the \n1966 act. Like that act, it is comprised of three major elements:\n  First, the bill calls for development and implementation of a \ncoherent national ocean and coastal policy to conserve and sustainably \nuse fisheries and other ocean and coastal resources, protect the marine \nenvironment and human safety, explore ocean frontiers, create marine \ntechnologies and economic opportunities, and preserve U.S. leadership \non ocean and coastal issues.\n  Second, the bill establishes a 15-member Commission, similar to the \nStratton Commission, to examine ocean and coastal activities and report \nwithin 18 months on recommendations for a national policy. Commission \nmembers would be appointed by the President and the Congress. In \ndeveloping its recommendations, the Commission would assess Federal \nprograms and funding priorities, ocean-related infrastructure \nrequirements, conflicts among marine users, and technological \nopportunities. The bill authorizes appropriations of $6 million over 2 \nyears to support Commission activities.\n  Third, the bill creates a high-level Federal interagency Council that \nis chaired by the Secretary of Commerce and includes the heads of the \nDepartments of Navy, State, Transportation, and the Interior, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, the \nOffice of Science and Technology Policy, the Office of Management and \nBudget, the Council on Environmental Quality, and the National Economic \nCouncil. This new Council will advise the President and serve as a \nforum for developing and implementing an ocean and coastal policy, will \nprovide for coordination of Federal budgets and programs, and will work \nwith non-Federal and international organizations.\n  By establishing an action plan for ocean and coastal activities, the \nOceans Act should contribute substantially to national goals and \nobjectives in the areas of education and research, economic \ndevelopment, and public safety. With respect to education and research, \nour view of the oceans 30 years ago was based on a remarkably small \namount of information. When Jack Kennedy was in the White House, we \nwere just beginning to develop the capability for exploring the oceans, \nand the driving factor was the military need to hide our submarines \nfrom the Soviets during the cold war. What we knew of the oceans at \nthat time was based as much on what fishermen brought up in their nets \nas it was on reliable scientific investigation.\n\n  Today, we still have explored only a tiny fraction of the sea, but \nwith the use of new technologies what we have found is truly \nincredible. For example, hydrothermal vents, hot water geysers on the \ndeep ocean floor, were discovered just 20 years ago by oceanographers \ntrying to understand the formation of the earth's crust. Now this \ndiscovery has led to the identification of nearly 300 new types of \nmarine animals with untold pharmaceutical and biomedical potential.\n  Many of our marine research efforts could have profound impacts on \nour economic well-being. For example, research on coastal ocean \ncurrents and other processes that affect shoreline erosion is critical \nto effective management of the shoreline. Oceanographers are working \nwith Federal, State, and local managers to use this new understanding \nin protecting beachfront property and the lives of those who reside and \nwork in coastal communities.\n  Development of underwater cameras and sonar, begun in the 1940's for \nthe U.S. Navy, has led to major strides not only for military uses, but \nfor marine archaeologists and scientists exploring unknown stretches of \nsea floor. Consumers have benefited from the technology now used in \nvideo cameras. Sonar has broad applications in both the military and \ncommercial sector.\n  Finally, marine biotechnology research is thought to be one of the \ngreatest remaining technological and industrial frontiers. Among the \nopportunities which it may offer are to: restore and protect marine \necosystems; monitor human health and treat disease; increase food \nsupplies through aquaculture; enhance seafood safety and quality; \nprovide new types and sources of industrial materials and processes; \nand understand biological and geochemical processes in the world ocean.\n  In addition to the economic opportunities offered by our marine \nresearch investment, traditional marine activities play an important \nrole in our national economic outlook. Ninety-five percent of our \ninternational trade is shipped on the ocean and each year products \nvalued at more than $220 billion are shipped within the United States \nvia the water. In 1996, commercial fishermen in the United States \nlanded almost 10 billion pounds of fish with a value of $3.5 billion. \nTheir fishing-related activities contributed over $42 billion to the \nU.S. economy. During the same period, marine anglers contributed \nanother $20 billion. Travel and tourism also contribute over $700 \nbillion to our economy, much of which is generated in coastal areas. \nLast year, in South Carolina alone, the total impact of tourism in \ncoastal areas was almost $6 billion. With a sound national ocean and \ncoastal policy and effective marine resource management, these numbers \nhave nowhere to go but up.\n  With respect to public safety, it is particularly important to \ndevelop ocean and coastal priorities that reflect the changes we have \nseen in recent years. Before World War II, most of the U.S. shoreline \nwas sparsely populated. There were long, wild stretches of coast, \ndotted with an occasional port city, fishing village, or sleepy resort. \nMost barrier islands had few residents or were uninhabited. After the \nwar, people began pouring in, and coastal development began a period of \nexplosive growth. In my State of South Carolina, our beaches attract \nmillions of visitors every year, and more and more people are choosing \nto move to the coast--making the coastal counties the fastest growing \nones in the State. Seventeen of the 20 fastest growing states in the \nNation are coastal states--which compounds the situation that the most \ndensely populated regions already border the ocean. With population \ngrowth comes the demand for highways, shopping centers, schools, and \nsewers that permanently alter the landscape. If people are to continue \nto live and work on the coast, we must do a better job of planning how \nwe impact the very regions in which we all want to live.\n  There is no better example of how our ocean and coastal policies \naffect public safety, than to look at the effects of hurricanes. \nThroughout the 1920's, hurricanes killed 2,122 Americans while causing \nabout $1.8 billion in property damages. By contrast, in the first 5 \nyears of the 1990's, hurricanes killed 111 Americans, and resulted in \ndamages of about $35 billion. While we have made notable advances in \nearly warning and evacuation systems to protect human lives, the risk \nof property loss continues to escalate and coastal inhabitants are more \nvulnerable to major storms than they ever have been. In 1989, Hurricane \nHugo came ashore in South Carolina, leaving more than $6 billion in \ndamages. Of that total from Hugo, the Federal Government paid out more \nthan $2.8 billion in disaster assistance and more than $400 million \nfrom the National Flood Insurance Program. The payments from private \ninsurance companies were equally staggering. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew \nstruck southern Florida and slammed into low-lying areas of Louisiana, \nforever changing the lives of more than a quarter of a million people \nand causing an estimated $25 to $30 billion in damage. Hurricanes \ndemonstrate that the human desire to live near the oceans and along the \ncoast comes with both a responsibility and a cost.\n  The oceans are part of our culture, part of our heritage, part of our \neconomy, and part of our future. Therefore, we need to be smart about \nocean policy--we need the best minds to come together and take a look \nat what the real challenges are. It is not enough to sit back and \nassume the role of caretakers. We must be proactive and develop a plan \nfor the future.\n  Mr. President, Members who doubt the need for this legislation need \nonly pick up a newspaper and they will be\n\n[[Page S9890]]\n\nface to face with pressing ocean and coastal issues: fish covered with \nlesions in the Chesapeake Bay and North Carolina; a powerful El Nino \nbrewing in the Pacific; condemnation of vacation homes as the beaches \nbeneath them erode; U.S. ships held hostage over fishing disputes; and \nthe list could go on. Deciding how to manage these problems and use the \nseas is one of the most complicated tasks we can tackle. There are no \nboundaries at sea, no national borders with fences and checkpoints. The \nresources of the sea are a common heritage, shared by all. While our \ncoastal waters are governed by the United States for all of us, there \nare few rules on the high seas and progress relies primarily on \ninternational cooperation.\n  The United Nations has declared 1998 to the be the Year of the Ocean. \nOne reason for launching the International Year of the Ocean is to wake \nup the governments and the public so we pay adequate attention to the \nneed to protect the marine environment and to ensure a healthy ocean. \nThis is an unprecedented opportunity to celebrate and enhance what has \nbeen accomplished in understanding and managing the ocean.\n  The Stratton Commission stated in 1969: ``How fully and wisely the \nUnited States uses the sea in the decades ahead will affect profoundly \nits security, its economy, its ability to meet increasing demands for \nfood and raw materials, its position and influence in the world \ncommunity, and the quality of the environment in which its people \nlive.'' Those words are as true today as they were 30 years ago.\n  Mr. President, it is time to look toward the next 30 years. This bill \noffers us the vision and understanding needed to establish sound ocean \nand coastal policies for the 21st century. I thank the cosponsors of \nthe legislation for joining with me in recognizing its significance and \ntrust that this body will work quickly to enact it into law. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1213\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ocean Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS; PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Covering more than two-thirds of the Earth's surface, \n     the oceans and Great Lakes play a critical role in the global \n     water cycle and in regulating climate, sustain a large part \n     of Earth's biodiversity, provide an important source of food \n     and a wealth of other natural products, act as a frontier to \n     scientific exploration, are critical to national security, \n     and provide a vital means of transportation. The coasts, \n     transition between land and open ocean, are regions of \n     remarkably high biological productivity, contribute more than \n     30 percent of the Gross Domestic Product, and are of \n     considerable importance for recreation, waste disposal, and \n     mineral exploration.\n       (2) Ocean and coastal resources are susceptible to change \n     as a direct and indirect result of human activities, and such \n     changes can significantly impact the ability of the oceans \n     and Great Lakes to provide the benefits upon which the Nation \n     depends. Changes in ocean and coastal processes could affect \n     global climate patterns, marine productivity and \n     biodiversity, environmental quality, national security, \n     economic competitiveness, availability of energy, \n     vulnerability to natural hazards, and transportation safety \n     and efficiency.\n       (3) Ocean and coastal resources are not infinite, and human \n     pressure on them is increasing. One half of the Nation's \n     population lives within 50 miles of the coast, ocean and \n     coastal resources once considered inexhaustible are now \n     threatened with depletion, and if population trends continue \n     as expected, pressure on and conflicting demands for ocean \n     and coastal resources will increase further as will \n     vulnerability to coastal hazards.\n       (4) Marine technologies hold tremendous promise for \n     expanding the range and increasing the utility of products \n     from the oceans and Great Lakes, improving the stewardship of \n     ocean and coastal resources, and contributing to business and \n     manufacturing innovations and the creation of new jobs.\n       (5) Marine research has uncovered the link between oceanic \n     and atmospheric processes and improved understanding of world \n     climate patterns and forecasts. Important new advances, \n     including availability of military technology, have made \n     feasible the exploration of large areas of the ocean which \n     were inaccessible several years ago. In designating 1998 as \n     ``The Year of the Ocean'', the United Nations highlights the \n     value of increasing our knowledge of the oceans.\n       (6) It has been 30 years since the Commission on Marine \n     Science, Engineering, and Resources (known as the Stratton \n     Commission) conducted a comprehensive examination of ocean \n     and coastal activities that led to enactment of major \n     legislation and the establishment of key oceanic and \n     atmospheric institutions.\n       (7) A review of existing activities is essential to respond \n     to the changes that have occurred over the past three decades \n     and to develop an effective new policy for the twenty-first \n     century to conserve and use sustainable ocean and coastal \n     resources, protect the marine environment, explore ocean \n     frontiers, protect human safety, and create marine \n     technologies and economic opportunities.\n       (8) While significant Federal ocean and coastal programs \n     are underway, those programs would benefit from a coherent \n     national ocean and coastal policy that reflects the need for \n     cost-effective allocation of fiscal resources, improved \n     interagency coordination, and strengthened partnerships with \n     State, private, and international entities engaged in ocean \n     and coastal activities.\n       (b) Purpose and Objectives.--The purpose of this Act is to \n     develop and maintain a coordinated, comprehensive, and long-\n     range national policy with respect to ocean and coastal \n     activities that will assist the Nation in meeting the \n     following objectives:\n       (1) The protection of life and property against natural and \n     manmade hazards.\n       (2) Responsible stewardship, including use, of fishery \n     resources and other ocean and coastal resources.\n       (3) The protection of the marine environment and prevention \n     of marine pollution.\n       (4) The enhancement of marine-related commerce, \n     transportation, and national security, and the resolution of \n     conflicts among users of the marine environment.\n       (5) The expansion of human knowledge of the marine \n     environment including the role of the oceans in climate and \n     global environmental change and the advancement of education \n     and training in fields related to ocean and coastal \n     activities.\n       (6) The continued investment in and development and \n     improvement of the capabilities, performance, use, and \n     efficiency of technologies for use in ocean and coastal \n     activities.\n       (7) Close cooperation among all government agencies and \n     departments to ensure--\n       (A) coherent regulation of ocean and coastal activities;\n       (B) availability and appropriate allocation of Federal \n     funding, personnel, facilities, and equipment for such \n     activities; and\n       (C) cost-effective and efficient operation of Federal \n     departments, agencies, and programs involved in ocean and \n     coastal activities.\n       (8) The preservation of the role of the United States as a \n     leader in ocean and coastal activities, and, when it is in \n     the national interest, the cooperation by the United States \n     with other nations and international organizations in ocean \n     and coastal activities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

REPEAL OR 1966 STATUTE.\n\n       The Marine Resources and Engineering Development Act of \n     1966 (33 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) is repealed.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of Senator Hollings' bill to require a wholesale review of \nthe Nation's oceans and coastal policies to prepare for the 21st \ncentury. We have not done this since the 1960's, and the time has come.\n  The bill has three important components: First, it calls for the \ndevelopment of a coherent national ocean and coastal policy; second, it \nestablishes a 15-member commission similar to the Stratton Commission \nto make recommendations within 18 months on this national ocean and \ncoastal policy; and third, it creates an interagency council of all the \nFederal agencies involved in oceans and coastal matters, chaired by the \nSecretary of Commerce, to coordinate the implementation of the national \npolicy.\n  I applaud Senator Hollings for developing this legislation. As has \nbeen pointed out, over half of the U.S. population lives within 50 \nmiles of our shores. In my State, the oceans employ more people in the \nprivate sector than any other industry. The demands on our oceans and \ncoastal resources continues to grow, and we must be prepared to meet \nthese demands in the 21st century.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to support the efforts of my \nesteemed colleagues, particularly the ranking member of the Commerce \nCommittee, Senator Hollings, and the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Stevens, and to cosponsor the Oceans Act of 1997. I \nhave great respect for Senators Hollings and Stevens and their \nstewardship of our ocean and coastal resources.\n  Since the day I first arrived in the Senate nearly 12 years ago, I \nhave worked hard to address the many challenges confronting our common \nocean and coastal resources. I have led this effort principally through \nmy participation and leadership on the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee, and particularly as ranking member on the \nOceans and Fisheries Subcommittee and as cochair of its predecessor, \nthe national ocean policy study [NOPS].\n  Over the last 25 years, Congress has worked to develop innovative \npolicy solutions to enable the long-term protection, conservation, \nutilization, and management of our vulnerable marine resources. We have \nacted to ensure strong coastal economies in Massachusetts and a clean, \nhealthy coastal environment from the Gulf of Maine to the Gulf of \nAlaska.\n  In that vein therefore, I believe that it is time for us, like the \nStratton Commission did over 30 years ago, to\n\n[[Page S9893]]\n\ntake an inventory of where our Nation has been and where we are going \nregarding the great responsibility of stewardship of our coastal \nresources. The Oceans Act of 1997 will provide the framework for that \neffort.\n  The bill contains three major provisions. First, it calls for \ndevelopment of a national ocean and coastal policy to provide for \nprotection from natural hazards, stewardship of fisheries and coastal \nresources, protection of the marine environment, enhanced marine \ntransportation and security, continued investment in marine \ntechnologies, ocean monitoring and exploration, Government cooperation \nand coordination, and continued U.S. international leadership. Second, \nit establishes a Commission on Ocean Policy to complete an 18-month \nexamination and evaluation of ocean and coastal activities and provide \nrecommendations for national policy. Third, it creates an interagency \nNational Ocean Council, headed by the Secretary of Commerce to advise \nthe President and serve as a forum for developing and implementing \nocean and coastal policy programs, designate funding responsibilities, \nprovide coordination of Federal budgets, and work with non-Federal \norganizations to periodically review the Nation's ocean and coastal \npolicy.\n  The time for this legislation is now, the world population will \ndouble to over 10 billion by the middle of the next century. Today over \n50 percent of world population resides in coastal areas. The United \nStates and its insular areas have more than 95,000 miles of coastline \nand the offshore U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone [EEZ] encompasses more \nthan 3.4 million square miles, nearly equal to the land area of the \nUnited States.\n  Over the last 30 years the coastal area populations have increased \nfrom 80 to over 110 million and is projected to reach 127 million by \n2010. If these trends continue, much heavier demands will be placed on \nocean and coastal resources, that is, need for food from the sea for \nworld protein requirements and energy and mineral production from \noffshore deposits. Ocean threats from this vast expansion include; \nsewage, chemical, and garbage disposal, runoff from agricultural and \nforested lands, exploitation of fisheries resources, development of \nenergy and mineral resources, and coastal infrastructure development. \nMoreover, recent years have yielded a degradation of coastal water \nquality, loss of wetlands, closure of beach and recreational areas, \npollution of fishery and shellfish management resources that diminish \nthe resource base, contaminate seafood, and endanger human health. In \nfact over 70 percent of U.S. commercial and recreational fish and \nshellfish depend on estuaries at some point in their life cycle.\n  Toxic chemicals and sewage dumped have contaminated the Nation's \nharbors and waterways. More than 20,000 combined sewer overflows \n[CSO's], sewers that combine storm water and sanitary flows empty \ndirectly into rivers and coastal waters. In 1992 heavy rains and \nflooding caused severe CSO overflows in Los Angeles which forced the \ntemporary closing of over 70 miles of adjacent coastal areas. Coastal \narea real estate development has accelerated to the point that over 50 \npercent of annual U.S. residential construction during the past two \ndecades has occurred in coastal areas. This trend is expected to \ncontinue and is expected to stress coastal ecosystems even further \nmostly in California and Florida, two of the Nation's most productive \ncoastal areas. This also increases risk to life and property due to \nhurricanes and other major storms. For example the price tag for \nHurricane Andrew, one of the largest storms in history, was estimated \nto be $25 to $30 billion. Further sea level rise from global warming \nwill exacerbate this already growing problem.\n  Further, as the world population grows, we will become more and more \ndependent on food from the sea. Since 1977 total fish harvest from the \nEEZ increased more than 325 percent to a peak of 6.65 billion pounds \nannually in 1986-88, but has subsequently declined--only 6.32 in 1993. \nAlaska pollock and Gulf of Mexico shrimp were the leading fisheries in \n1993. Imported seafood comprised 57 percent of U.S. consumption during \n1996, a 3 percent increase from 1995.\n  Many problems exist however in the way we manage the world's \nfisheries. A Time magazine article of August 11, 1997, on the world \noverfishing problem, stated that ``fish of all kinds are being hauled \nfrom the sea faster than they can reproduce.'' We addressed many of \nthose concerns with the passage of ``Sustainable Fisheries Act'' last \nyear. With a focus on overfishing, we established National goals to \nrebuild most currently overfished stocks in 10 years, provided for the \nprotection of fish habitats and Pacific Insular Areas, established a \nby-catch reduction program, and encouraged the development of \nunderutilized species.\n  However, more can be done, particularly on an international level. \nFish stocks migrate across jurisdictions. Nations approach fisheries \nconservation and manage differently. Development of conversation \nobjectives of nations harvesting common fish stocks often clash, and \novercapitalized fleets are over-harvesting the available resources in \nmany areas.\n  Again, much work remains and we must be vigilant in our duty to \npreserve and protect the oceans and coastal resources as we start the \nnext century.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the ranking member of \nthe Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, in the introduction of the \nOceans Act of 1997. This bill will establish a commission like the \nStratton Commission of 1966 to review the many ocean and coastal issues \nfacing the United States, and to develop a comprehensive, coordinated, \nnational ocean and coastal policy.\n  Prior to introduction, I raised a few concerns with Senator Hollings \non some provisions of the draft bill. Basically, I had recommended some \nlanguage that made it clear that as we develop a new ocean and coastal \npolicy for the Nation, we keep in mind the facts that our fiscal \nresources are limited, and that our Federal investments in ocean and \ncoastal resources must be spent efficiently and wisely. I also raised \nsome concerns about the fact that the original draft had the President \nappointing all of the members of this important commission.\n  Mr. President, Senator Hollings has graciously agreed to make some \nchanges to the bill pursuant to my recommendations. For instance, the \nbill now authorizes the Congress to appoint more than half of the \ncommission members, and the commission is directed to identify \nopportunities to reform Federal ocean programs to improve efficiency \nand effectiveness. I commend Senator Hollings for his willingness to \nwork with me and other Republican Senators before introduction of the \nbill. After introduction, I look forward to working with the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina, a Senator who worked on the \noriginal Stratton Commission bill 30 years ago and who is a true \nchampion of ocean protection, in the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee \non any further refinements along these lines that might be \nconstructive.\n  Again, I thank Senator Hollings and commend him upon introduction of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor for me to join as a \nsponsor of the Oceans Act of 1997. Our goal in this legislation is to \ndeal more effectively with one of the most important aspects of our \noverall policy for the environment--our efforts to preserve and protect \nour management ocean and coastal resources.\n  I commend Senator Hollings for his leadership on this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 1214. A bill to amend the Line-Item Veto Act of 1996 to eliminate \nthe requirement that a Federal budget deficit must exist in order for \nthe President to use the line-item veto authority; to the Committee on \nthe Budget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant \nto the order of August 4, 1977, as modified by the order of April 11, \n1986, with instructions that if one committee reports, the other \ncommittee have 30 days to report or be discharged.\n\n\n              legislation to strengthen the line-item veto\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that will strengthen the recently enacted line-item veto.\n  Currently, the line-item veto can only be exercised by the President\n\n[[Page S9894]]\n\nwhen there is a deficit. This legislation would eliminate that \nrestriction and provide for line-item veto authority whether there is a \ndeficit or a surplus.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of the line-item veto should be to reduce \nwasteful Government programs, as well as reduce deficits.\n  Last year the Congress approved legislation that granted the \nPresident line-item veto authority beginning in 1997. The Congress did \nthis out of principle. Members did not wait to see which candidate won \nthe election before deciding whether to grant the new authority, and in \nAugust history was made when President Clinton became the first \nPresident to exercise the line-item veto.\n  While some Members of Congress may not agree with the specific \nprovisions that the President selected to line-item veto, the important \npoint is that any President should have this power as a check on narrow \nspecial interest spending and tax provisions. If Congress wishes to \nrestore a vetoed provision it can do so with the requisite two-thirds \nvote.\n  I have long been a supporter of line-item veto authority for the \nPresident. In my view it will serve as a powerful check on Congress' \nability to load up bills with wasteful provisions.\n  I think it is safe to say that the President's use of the line-item \nveto has created an environment in which narrow spending and tax \nprovisions are going to be scrutinized much more carefully before they \nare loaded onto legislation.\n  I recognize that there have been court challenges concerning the \nconstitutionality of the statutory line-item veto. I believe that this \nauthority is constitutional and I certainly hope that the Supreme Court \ncomes down on that side. However, this issue is important enough that \nwe should amend the Constitution if necessary. That is why earlier this \nyear I introduced a line-item veto constitutional amendment.\n  Today, however we should focus on the line-item veto that is before \nus and look for ways to improve that law. That is the purpose of this \nlegislation.\n  In the last several years our economy has been very healthy and tax \nrevenues have come in at much higher levels than previously forecast. \nThis has created a situation where we may actually see a budget surplus \nat some point in the next several years. Does this mean we should \nrescind the line-item veto authority we have given the President? Of \ncourse not, but that would be the result as the law was drafted in \n1996.\n  My view is that the line-item veto should be used in both deficit and \nsurplus times. While we may have some surplus years on the horizon, it \nis clear that without entitlement reform massive deficits will return \njust after the turn of the century. This means that we must be \nconstantly working to eliminate wasteful Government programs. A line-\nitem veto is one way to help do that.\n  Mr. President, I cast my vote for a permanent line-item veto. The \nPresident and Congress cannot afford to take a vacation from the battle \nagainst wasteful Government programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 1215. A bill to prohibit spending Federal education funds on \nnational testing; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                      National Testing Legislation\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprohibit the Federal Government from developing and/or imposing new \nnational individualized tests on students across the country.\n  During his State of the Union Address this year, President Clinton \nannounced his intentions to establish national tests for students in \nfourth grade reading and eighth grade mathematics. Without waiting for \ncongressional authority, the Department of Education surged ahead and \nbegan development of uniform national tests, with plans to administer \nthem starting in 1999. In August, the Department announced the award of \na $13 million contract for its national testing initiative, and plans \nto spend an estimated $50.6 million under the contract from fiscal year \n1998 through fiscal year 2001, including $12.3 million for fiscal year \n1998.\n  In response, Representative Bill Goodling, chairman of the Committee \non Education and the Workforce, offered an amendment in the House which \nprohibits the expenditure of fiscal year 1998 funds for a new national \ntesting program. While the Senate failed to consider fully and vote on \nthe Goodling approach during its debate of the Labor-HHS appropriations \nbill, the House embraced the Goodling amendment, approving it by a \nresounding vote of 295 to 125.\n  The House vote sends a clear and strong signal that Congress should \nprohibit Federal funds for national testing in education. In fact, the \nalliance of members from both sides of the political spectrum \ndemonstrates the universal concern that the administration's proposal \nis besieged by problems. Here are just a few of the many reasons why \nnational tests should be opposed:\n  First, education experts such as Dr. Donald J. Senese, former \nAssistant Secretary for Educational Research and Improvement during the \nReagan administration, warn that national testing will lead to a \nnational curriculum.\n  Second, Lynne Cheney, former chairperson of the National Endowment \nfor the Humanities, reminds us that Federal efforts to set standards \nand tests have been disastrous. She points to the politically correct \nFederal history standards and the English-language arts standards, \nwhich were such an ill-considered muddle that even the Clinton \nDepartment of Education cut off funding for them after having spent \nmore than $1 million in taxpayer funds.\n  Third, the proposed math test is steeped in the new, unproven whole \nmath or fuzzy math philosophy, which encourages students to rely on \ncalculators, discourages basic math skills, and has resulted in \ndeclines in math performance. For example, the median percentile \ncomputation scores on the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills taken by \nmore than 37,000 DODDS students one year after the Defense Department \nintroduced whole math dropped 9 points for third graders, 12 for fourth \ngraders, 11 for fifth graders, 10 for sixth graders, 10 for seventh \ngraders, and 4 for eighth graders.\n  Finally, Federal testing takes away local control and parental \ninvolvement. The Federal Government should not impose its will on \nschool boards, parents, and teachers about the education of their \nchildren. Rather, education should be controlled by school boards in \nlocal communities, where parents have the greatest opportunity to be \ninvolved in the education of their child, by participating in the \ndevelopment of school curriculum and testing. After all, research \nconfirms that parental involvement is the single most important element \nin educating our children.\n  Mr. President, the big losers from national tests will be students, \nparents, teachers, and local school boards. Once Federal exams are in \nplace, teachers and schools will teach the test. In other words, they \nwill change their classes to fit the Federal tests, in order to get \nhigher scores. Textbooks and instructional materials will follow suit, \neven in areas that attempt to avoid national tests. As a result, \nWashington bureaucrats who design the tests will shape local curriculum \ndecisions. National control of curriculum is absolutely unacceptable to \nme. Once the Federal Government is using tests to shape curriculum, \nparental control through local school boards will be doomed.\n  Who should control local education? I believe our schools should \nremain under the control of parents, teachers, and school boards, in \ncooperation with the States. The flawed whole math approach which \nbrought major losses in computation test scores demonstrates the \ncentral threat in national control: When the bureaucrats make a \nmistake, everybody pays, from coast to coast.\n  Parents are looking to Congress to protect their right and their \nability to shape the education of their children. A national testing \nsystem would deprive parents of this vital opportunity. As Members of \nCongress, we can show our support for education by saying ``no'' to \nnational testing and ``yes'' to parental control of their children's \nlearning.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S9895]]\n\n                                S. 1215\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON NATIONAL TESTING.\n\n       Part C of the General Education Provision Act (20 U.S.C. \n     1231 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 447. PROHIBITION ON NATIONAL TESTING.\n\n       ``(a) General Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of Federal law, funds provided to the Department or \n     for an applicable program may not be used to develop, plan, \n     implement, or administer any national testing program.\n       ``(b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to the \n     following:\n       ``(1) The National Assessment of Educational Progress \n     carried out under section 411 of the National Education \n     Statistics Act of 1994 (20 U.S.C. 9010).\n       ``(2) The Third International Mathematics and Science Study \n     (TIMSS).''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS:\n  S. 1217. A bill for the relief of Olga Gorgiladze; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       PRIVATE RELIEF LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today that will \ngrant permanent residency in the United States to Olga Gorgiladze.\n\n  I serve as the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee that \nhas jurisdiction and oversight over both the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service and the Executive Office for Immigration Review. \nI can tell you that with respect to Mrs. Gorgiladze's case--they have \nmissed the mark. They have done this woman an injustice. It is a wrong \nthat this Senate and this Congress should make right.\n  Olga Gorgiladze's case is a special situation that involves the \nturmoil and changes that came with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union. In September 1991, Mrs. Gorgiladze came \nto the United States to stay with her lifelong friend, Merilyn Hodgson. \nThree months later the Soviet Union was dissolved and civil and ethnic \nwar broke out in Georgia, the Soviet Republic where Mrs. Gorgiladze's \nhusband was from. She applied for asylum in this country in March 1992. \nINS and the Executive Office of Immigration Review finally got to her \ncase in late 1995 and turned down her request. They instructed Mrs. \nGorgiladze to obtain Georgian citizenship and to leave for that \ncountry. The irony, of course, is that Olga Gorgiladze is not now and \nnever has been a Georgian citizen. In fact, quite the contrary she \nfears for her safety should she be forced to go to that nation. She \nloves the United States. She loves our democratic society that protects \nfreedom of speech and religion. Most importantly, she feels safe in a \nnation that has racial and ethnic diversity. The reality is that Olga \nGorgiladze wants to become an American, not a Georgian citizen.\n  Olga Gorgiladze is not even ethnically Georgian. She is half Chinese \nand half Russian. She was born in China in 1940 to a Russian father and \na Chinese mother. Her father was a naval officer in the Tsarist navy \nand fought against the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. Her \nmother met Mrs. Gorgiladze's father in Shanghai where he had fled after \nthe war. Olga grew up in China, speaking Chinese. But, once again in \n1954, her family had to flee another violent Communist takeover--and \nher father moved the family back to the Soviet Union. They were sent to \nwork on the undeveloped desert lands of Kazakhstan. In 1959, after her \nfather died of cancer she was given permission by the Soviet \nauthorities to move to Sukhami, Georgia, near the Russian border.\n  In 1971, Olga graduated from the Teachers College of Foreign \nLanguages where she majored in English. However, she was denied a \nteaching position because preference was given to Georgians. She \nfinally got a job as a part-time teacher at the college from which she \ngraduated, but was later fired when all classes for Russian speaking \ngroups were terminated. Despite her advanced education--equivalent to a \nmasters degree in this country--she has continually been forced to take \nlow-paying clerk positions because of discrimination against her as a \nnon-Georgian. Other discriminations displayed against her included \nhousing which is controlled by the state and purchasing of food and \nsupplies.\n  Since 1991, the Caucasus nations have been plagued by ethnic strife \nand warfare. We have all watched the violence and bloodshed in the \nAbkhaszia region of Georgia, between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno-\nKarabakh, and the war in Chechneya. Less well televised is the \nhostility and persecution of outsiders and ethnic minorities. In \nGeorgia, there is hostility to anything or anyone affiliated with \nRussia. As a woman who looks Chinese, speaks only Russian and English, \nOlga Gorgiladze has been subject to countless incidents of verbal, \nphysical, and mental abuse. Mrs. Gorgiladze does not and cannot blend \ninto the Georgian population. She has been beaten, spit on, verbally \nand physically abused. Her safety and livelihood have always felt \nthreatened every minute of every day while living in Georgia. For \nexample, while riding the bus, Mrs. Gorgiladze has been beaten and \nthreatened with knifes, chains, and various other weapons.\n  Her husband of 25 years, Malkhaz Gorgiladze, stayed in Georgia and \nwarned Olga of the dangers posed to her if she returned to that \ncountry. He encouraged her to seek asylum in the United States and \ncollected evidence for her hearing. He especially worked to document \npolice inactivity and the Georgian officials' complicity in attacks on \nnon-Georgians by violent nationalist groups. The police warned him to \nstop his efforts. Malkhaz Gorgiladze began to receive anonymous phone \ncalls and threats and warnings to stop criticizing the police. In 1996, \nwhile returning home from a New Year's Eve gathering, his car was \nrammed by a Georgian police car and Olga's husband was killed.\n  When asked by the immigration judges at Justice, our State Department \nreported that Georgia is in a state of cease-fire and everybody is \ngetting along with each other. Further, the Justice Department \nconjectured that if the Georgian police wanted Olga's husband killed, \nthe would have used means other than an auto accident involving a \npolice car. The INS and immigration judges down there at the Justice \nDepartment have used this information and conclusions to deny Mrs. \nGorgiladze's request for asylum. Yet, there were numerous letters and \naffidavits by witnesses regarding Malkhaz Gorgiladze's murder. And, in \nGeorgia, the ultranationalists blame non-Georgians, and in particular \nblame Russians, for all their misfortunes and lack of economic \ndevelopment. Friends and relatives of Olga Gorgiladze have warned her \nthat she should not return. They tell her that she will never be able \nto get a job and always will be an outcast. They say she will be \nconsidered a traitor. And, Malkhaz will not be there to try and defend \nher as in the past. In short, they fear for her safety, as do I.\n  Mrs. Gorgiladze's case is truly heart-wrenching. And, here is a woman \nI might add--that has worked for the last 5 years at MCI Customer \nService Representative International Department and turned around and \npaid her taxes to the State of Virginia and the U.S. Government. In my \nview, she has been an outstanding resident in our Nation who serves as \nan example of the American dream. She has never broken any law and has \nnever been on welfare or asked the Government for handouts. She has \nfollowed the immigration rules every step of the way. She is what \nAmerica is all about. What astonishes me is why the Justice Department \nwould want to deport this 57-year-old woman.\n  Mr. President, I have served in the U.S. Senate over 30 years. Every \nnow and then we get an opportunity to stand up for someone who the \nFederal bureaucracy has mistreated. This is one of those times. Olga \nGorgiladze's situation has touched me. Since her friend brought the \ncase to my attention, I can't stop thinking about how unfair it seems. \nI've sat in Senate hearing after hearing on the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service asking why action is not taken to deport illegal \naliens who got into this country through deception. I have listened to \nthis administration try to explain how in 1996 they naturalized \nthousands of aliens with criminal backgrounds. And, I find it \nastonishing, these very same Justice immigration judges have ruled in \nseparate cases that homosexuality per se does constitute a legitimate \nclaim for asylum. But, in this case we have a woman who came to the \nUnited States legally, who is not and never has been a citizen of \nGeorgia, who had her husband killed by\n\n[[Page S9896]]\n\nGeorgian authorities, who legitimately fears for her safety if sent \nthere, who has complied with all the United States immigration laws, \nand who has paid her own way and has not been a burden to taxpayers in \nthis country--and this is who the Justice Department wants to deny \nasylum and deport? Maybe I should forgo this bill and simply tell Olga \nto pretend that she is homosexual. This is injustice. This is just \nsimply wrong.\n  Mr. President, I am introducing this bill today because the system is \nnot working. I believe that Olga Gorgiladze has legitimate reasons to \nfear being deported to Georgia. She is not Georgian and does not belong \nin that country. It is ludicrous for the United States Government to be \nordering her to apply for Georgian citizenship. What she has \ndemonstrated is that she does belong in this country. In her case the \nsystem has failed and I think it is incumbent upon the United States \nSenate to put things right. I am pleased to sponsor this bill. I intend \nto work with the Judiciary Committee, with Senators Abraham, Kennedy, \nHatch, and Leahy, to ensure that Mrs. Olga Gorgiladze is permitted to \nremain in the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERREY.\n  S. 1218. A bill to assure the integrity of information, \ntransportation, and telecommunications upon the arrival of the year \n2000; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                           the millennium act\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, one of the challenges of the 21st century \nis already upon us. It is commonly known as the year 2000 computer \nproblem or the millennium bug. At issue is a programming technique that \ncould lead to the malfunction of computer systems worldwide on January \n1, 2000. It is essential that government, business, and personal \ncomputer users take adequate steps to fix this problem in advance of \nDecember 31, 1999, to ensure that cyberspace enters the next millennium \nwithout a hitch.\n  During the early years of computing, computer storage space was \nincredibly expensive. Storage space that costs only 10 cents per \nmegabyte today, cost $36 per megabyte in 1972. In an effort to reduce \nstorage costs, computer programmers commonly programmed date \ninformation using only two digits to indicate the year. For example, \n1999 would be programmed as 99. This clever space saving trick saved \ncomputer users millions of dollars and became industry practice because \nprogrammers believed that by the time the year 2000 arrived any code \nthey were working on would be obsolete and out of service. \nUnfortunately, the conventional wisdom was wrong and many computer \nsystems still use these programs. Computers and computer software \nprogrammed in this fashion may misinterpret the year 2000 as 1900. This \nelectronic confusion could lead to serious malfunction or collapse of \ncomputers and computer networks around the world.\n  Date information plays a significant role in almost all computer \napplications developed over the last 30 years. The year 2000 problem \nhas many practical implications from the relatively benign to the very \nserious. Credit cards may be read as invalid, traffic lights may not \noperate, 99 years of bank records could be destroyed or the Nation's \nair traffic control systems could fail. The list of possible failures \nis nearly endless and can be found in systems used by the government, \nthe business community, and personal computer users worldwide. Personal \ncomputers are less susceptible to the problem and in most cases can be \nquickly fixed. However, business and government leaders should be \nworking night and day to ensure that the computer systems the country \ndepends on are reprogrammed to correctly recognize the date in time for \nthe arrival of New Year's Day 2000.\n  The time and financial commitment necessary to replace the \nproblematic date code is stunning. The Gartner Group estimates that \ncosts could exceed $600 billion. Newsweek magazine points out that this \nsum is enough to fund a year's worth of education costs, preschool \nthrough graduate school. Correcting the problem is technically simple, \nhowever in order to find the date information the entire program must \nbe manually scanned line for line. Often, the programs are written in \nthe outdated COBAL programming language and finding programmers skilled \nin older languages to solve the problem is very difficult because the \ndemand for their services is sky rocketing. After a competent \ntechnician is hired and they have analyzed the code and made the \nnecessary changes, the programs must go through a time consuming \ntesting phase. In sum, it is a very complex task and it is quickly \nbecoming too late to begin the reprogramming process.\n  Many companies and government offices have already taken steps to \navert this problem and are well on their way to making their systems \nyear 2000 compliant. Unfortunately, many others have not addressed the \nproblem and the time needed to analyze, modify, and test the code used \nby these entities is quickly slipping away. I am very concerned that \nfurther delays will leave the government and many private companies \nunprepared to carry out normal transactions in the early days of the \nnext century. In order to address this problem, I have joined Senator \nMoynihan as a cosponsor of S. 22. S. 22 would create a commission that \nwould be required to report to the President, by July 3, 1997, with \nproposals for new procedures or regulations to address the year 2000 \ncomputer problem for systems of Federal, State, and local governments \nand would make recommendations for funding levels that might be needed \nto address this problem.\n\n  In addition I am introducing a bill today that would instruct the \nFederal Communications Commission to initiate a proceeding to determine \nthe integrity of the telecommunications networks as the year 2000 \narrives. It also requires the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology to review the risks to personal computers and requires the \nDepartment of Transportation to assure that transportation safety is \nnot compromised.\n  Inconvenience can be tolerated, but every effort must be taken to \nassure that the health and safety of humans and the security and \nintegrity of networks and data are not compromised by what we know to \nbe a significant weakness in our computer networks and software.\n  In conclusion, I am also very concerned by reports that small and \nmidsize businesses are experiencing difficulty in determining if their \ncomputer systems are year 2000 compliant because some third-party \nsystems vendors are not forthcoming with information about their \nproducts. An already difficult task is further complicated by \nuncooperative third party vendors who fail to help these companies \nunderstand how the year 2000 problem could affect their businesses. \nThese companies have a responsibility to provide their customers with \nthe information they need to make their systems year 2000 compliant.\n  There is still time to act and prevent dangerous disruptions in \ncomputer, transportation and computer networks and the loss of valuable \ndata. If the private and public sector does that, then Americans can \nparty, and not panic when the clock strikes midnight on New Year's eve \n1999. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1218\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS.\n\n       (a) The Federal Communications Commission shall initiate a \n     proceeding to evaluate the potential dangers to the nation's \n     telecommunications networks from to software and systems \n     which are unable to effectively toll the passage of time from \n     December 31, 1999 to January 1, 2000.\n       (b) The Commission shall make necessary and appropriate \n     regulatory changes within their jurisdiction to ensure the \n     integrity of the nation's telecommunications networks.\n\n     SEC. 102.

Res. 124\n\n       Whereas, the Khmer Rouge recently staged a show trial of \n     Pol Pot, the reputed leader of the Khmer Rouge during the \n     Cambodian genocide;\n       Whereas, the Khmer Rouge have been promoting their National \n     Solidarity Party and proclaiming their support for ``liberal \n     democracy'' as a means to legitimate their role in Cambodian \n     politics;\n       Whereas, while the Khmer Rouge have been weakened since the \n     Paris Peace Accords of 1991, they remain a key source of \n     violence in Cambodia;\n\n[[Page S9898]]\n\n       Whereas, Cambodian People's Party leader and Second Prime \n     Minister Hun Sen staged a bloody and illegal coup against the \n     First Prime Minister and leader of the FUNCINPEC Party, \n     Norodom Ranaridhh;\n       Whereas, Hun Sen maintains that the coup was necessary \n     because elements of FUNCINPEC were on the verge of \n     consummating a deal to bring the Khmer Rouge military and \n     political organization into the legitimate political arena;\n       Whereas, Norodom Ranariddh, by contrast, has argued that \n     FUNCINPEC had no plan to form an alliance with the Khmer \n     Rouge and that this allegation was used as a pretext by Hun \n     Sen for the coup;\n       Whereas, Norodom Ranaridhh asserts instead that he was on \n     the verge of finally destroying the Khmer Rouge and bringing \n     them to justice;\n       Whereas, Norodom Ranaridhh further asserts that the real \n     reason for the coup was that Hun Sen fears that convening an \n     international tribunal to bring the Khmer Rouge to justice \n     would implicate Hun Sen in genocidal atrocities;\n       Whereas, Hun Sen has consistently argued that the top Khmer \n     Rouge leadership--including, but not limited to Pol Pot--must \n     be brought to justice before an international criminal \n     tribunal;\n       Whereas, earlier this year, Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen \n     wrote to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan asking \n     for ``the assistance of the United Nations and the \n     international community in bringing to justice those persons \n     responsible for genocide and crimes against humanity during \n     the rule of the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979'';\n       Whereas, after the coup, troops loyal to Norodom Ranariddh \n     appear to have formed a military alliance with troops loyal \n     to the Khmer Rouge leadership, thus reinforcing the fears of \n     the Cambodia people that the Khmer Rouge will use any means \n     necessary to regain power;\n       Whereas, peace, democracy, stability, the rule of law and \n     national reconciliation in Cambodia are unlikely to be \n     achieved until the Khmer Rouge are brought to justice;\n       Whereas, the Cambodian Genocide Justice Act states that it \n     is the policy of the United States to support efforts to \n     bring to justice members of the Khmer Rouge for their crimes \n     against humanity, and in circumstances which the President \n     deems appropriate, to encourage the establishment of an \n     international criminal tribunal for the prosecution of those \n     accused of genocide in Cambodia and provide such tribunal \n     with relevant information;\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) a primary objective of U.S. policy toward Cambodia \n     should be the establishment of an international tribunal for \n     the prosecution those responsible for the Cambodian genocide;\n       (2) in compliance with the Cambodian Genocide Justice Act \n     and the objectives stated above, the President should \n     immediately deem it appropriate to encourage the \n     establishment of an international criminal tribunal for the \n     prosecution of such members of the Khmer Rouge;\n       (3) in further compliance with the Cambodian Genocide \n     Justice Act, the United States should support efforts to \n     bring members of the Khmer Rouge--including Pol Pot--to \n     justice for their crimes against humanity before an \n     international tribunal, including providing that tribunal \n     with any information available on such members' involvement \n     in the Cambodian genocide;\n       (4) the Secretary of State should encourage all Member \n     countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the \n     People's Republic of China, Japan and other interested \n     countries to support such a tribunal.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Mr. \nThomas, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Grams to a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution that the Khmer Rouge and other participants in the Cambodian \ngenocide should be brought to justice before an international tribunal.\n  Just a couple of months ago, we witnessed the grotesque spectacle of \na Khmer Rouge show trial of Pol Pot, the Leader of the Khmer Rouge \nduring its genocidal reign in the 1970's. In July, Cambodian People's \nParty leader and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen staged a bloody coup \nagainst the First Prime Minister and leader of the FUNCINPEC Party, \nNorodom Ranariddh.\n  Hun Sen has claimed the coup was necessary because Norodom Ranaridhh \nwas attempting to gain Khmer Rouge support for his party.\n  Norodom Ranaridhh, on the other hand, has labeled Hun Sen's \nallegations a false pretext for the coup. Norodom Ranaridhh has also \nasserted that Hun Sen fears an international tribunal on the Cambodian \ngenocide would implicate Hun Sen for atrocities he committed during his \ntenure as a senior Khmer Rouge official.\n  Finally, troops loyal to Norodom Ranariddh now appear to have formed \na military alliance with troops loyal to the Rhmer Rouge leadership, \nthus reinforcing the fears of the Cambodia people that the Khmer Rouge \nwill use any means necessary to regain power.\n  These events and the assertions of the two Prime Ministers \ndemonstrate that while the Khmer Rouge have been weakened since the \nParis Peace Accords of 1991, they remain central to the continuing \nconflict in Cambodia. Recent events also demonstrate that the \nobjectives of bringing peace, democracy, national reconciliation, and \nthe rule of law to Cambodia are likely to remain out of reach until the \nKhmer Rouge are brought to justice.\n  What this resolution does, Mr. President, is make it clear that an \ninternational tribunal is essential if we are to achieve these \nobjectives. It also points out that before the coup and before their \nallegations against one another about their respective involvement with \nthe Khmer Rouge, Norodom Ranariddh and Run Sen wrote a joint letter to \nU.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan asking for U.N. assistance in \nconvening such a tribunal.\n  We should take them up on their request because removing the Khmer \nRouge as a military and political force in Cambodia is essential if we \nare to avoid another slide toward authoritarianism and war. I believe \nan international tribunal will also prevent the Khmer Rouge from \nsucceeding in their transparent attempt to emerge as a legitimate \npolitical force in Cambodia. Indeed, at the show trial of Pol Pol they \nstaged, the Khmer Rouge loudly proclaimed their support for liberal \ndemocracy. Other members of the Khmer Rouge have been promoting the \nNational Solidarity Party to give Khmer Rouge a legitimate voice in \nCambodian politics.\n  According to the Yale Cambodian Genocide project, the principal \norganization documenting atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge, such \na tribunal ``would soon return indictments against all or most of the \ncurrent Khmer Rouge leadership.\n  Mr. President, the Cambodian tragedy will never end until the Khmer \nRouge are brought to justice. I offer this resolution to move us closer \nto that goal and to demonstrate this body's continued interest in the \ndevelopment of a free, democratic, and peaceful Cambodia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/24/senate-section/article/S9897-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 125--COMMENDING THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE TAIPEI \n   ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL REPRESENTATIVES OFFICE IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Lott) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PRECEDENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the ``District \n     of Columbia Student Opportunity Scholarship Act of 1997''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Public education in the District of Columbia is in a \n     crisis, as evidenced by the following:\n       (A) The District of Columbia schools have the lowest \n     average of any school system in the Nation on the National \n     Assessment of Education Progress.\n       (B) 72 percent of fourth graders in the District of \n     Columbia tested below basic proficiency on the National \n     Assessment of Education Progress in 1994.\n       (C) Since 1991, there has been a net decline in the reading \n     skills of District of Columbia students as measured in scores \n     on the standardized Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills.\n       (D) At least 40 percent of District of Columbia students \n     drop out of or leave the school system before graduation.\n       (E) The National Education Goals Panel reported in 1996 \n     that both students and teachers in District of Columbia \n     schools are subjected to levels of violence that are twice \n     the national average.\n       (F) Nearly two-thirds of District of Columbia teachers \n     reported that violent student behavior is a serious \n     impediment to teaching.\n       (G) Many of the District of Columbia's 152 schools are in a \n     state of terrible disrepair, including leaking roofs, \n     bitterly cold classrooms, and numerous fire code violations.\n       (2) Significant improvements in the education of \n     educationally deprived children in the District of Columbia \n     can be accomplished by--\n       (A) increasing educational opportunities for the children \n     by expanding the range of educational choices that best meet \n     the needs of the children;\n       (B) fostering diversity and competition among school \n     programs for the children;\n       (C) providing the families of the children more of the \n     educational choices already available to affluent families; \n     and\n       (D) enhancing the overall quality of education in the \n     District of Columbia by increasing parental involvement in \n     the direction of the education of the children.\n       (3) The 350 private schools in the District of Columbia and \n     the surrounding area offer a more safe and stable learning \n     environment than many of the public schools.\n       (4) Costs are often much lower in private schools than \n     corresponding costs in public schools.\n       (5) Not all children are alike and therefore there is no \n     one school or program that fits the needs of all children.\n       (6) The formation of sound values and moral character is \n     crucial to helping young people escape from lives of poverty, \n     family break-up, drug abuse, crime, and school failure.\n       (7) In addition to offering knowledge and skills, education \n     should contribute positively to the formation of the internal \n     norms and values which are vital to a child's success in life \n     and to the well-being of society.\n       (8) Schools should help to provide young people with a \n     sound moral foundation which is consistent with the values of \n     their parents. To find such a school, parents need a full \n     range of choice to determine where their children can best be \n     educated.\n       (c) Precedents.--The United States Supreme Court has \n     determined that programs giving parents choice and increased \n     input in their children's education, including the choice of \n     a religious education, do not violate the Constitution. The \n     Supreme Court has held that as long as the beneficiary \n     decides where education funds will be spent on such \n     individual's behalf, public funds can be used for education \n     in a religious institution because the public entity has \n     neither advanced nor hindered a particular religion and \n     therefore has not violated the establishment clause of the \n     first amendment to the Constitution. Supreme Court precedents \n     include--\n       (1) Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972); Pierce v. \n     Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925); and Meyer v. \n     Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923) which held that parents have \n     the primary role in and are the primary decision makers in \n     all areas regarding the education and upbringing of their \n     children;\n       (2) Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388 (1983) which declared a \n     Minnesota tax deduction program that provided State income \n     tax benefits for educational expenditures by parents, \n     including tuition in religiously affiliated schools, does not \n     violate the Constitution;\n       (3) Witters v. Department of Services for the Blind, 474 \n     U.S. 481 (1986) in which the Supreme Court ruled unanimously \n     that public funds for the vocational training of the blind \n     could be used at a Bible college for ministry training; and\n       (4) Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District, 509 U.S. \n     1 (1993) which held that a deaf child could receive an \n     interpreter, paid for by the public, in a private religiously \n     affiliated school under the Individual with Disabilities \n     Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.). The case held that \n     providing an interpreter in a religiously affiliated school \n     did not violate the establishment clause of the first \n     amendment of the Constitution.\n\n     SEC. __02.

Mr. President, this past weekend I was invited \nto speak at the annual conference of the Frank Lloyd Wright Building \nConservancy which took place in Buffalo, NY. I promised some of the \nattendees that I would enter my keynote address in the Congressional \nRecord. I ask that the full text of my address be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The text follows:\n\n           Keynote Address by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan\n\n       Not long ago I happened to be in Phoenix and took the \n     opportunity to visit Taliesin West, Frank Lloyd Wright's \n     desert commune. I was most generously received and shown \n     everywhere, including the atelier where the plans were being \n     drawn for Wright's splendid Monona Terrace Community and \n     Convention Center, just now completed in Milwaukee. At \n     length, I was shown the splendid, terraced dining room where, \n     in the manner of the Englishman in the jungle, all \n     communards, faithful to the Master's edict, dress for dinner \n     on Saturday night.\n       We are less formal here in Buffalo, but no less welcoming, \n     and greatly honored to be at the site of this year's Frank \n     Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy Annual Conference.\n       Each of us, I cannot doubt, has a personal story of an \n     encounter with the spiritual and physical force of \n     architecture. As Americans, we tend to begin in Europe, but \n     with time, more and more we return to our own.\n       I have two tales to tell.\n       The first is simple enough. In 1992, I was asked to address \n     the convention of the American Sociological Association then \n     meeting in Pittsburgh. I arrived in a fine new hotel in the \n     Golden Triangle expecting all manner of posters and \n     pronouncements as had been the fashion of a few decades \n     earlier. Instead, I was greeted by a large sign announcing \n     the times of departure for the tour of Fallingwater. American \n     sociologists are finally getting their priorities straight.\n       My second tale, more personal and specific to Buffalo, took \n     place some twenty-one years ago. I was then in a five-way \n     primary contest for the Democratic nomination for United \n     States Senator. In the manner of such campaigns, most of \n     one's time is spent in strategy sessions in hotel rooms. One \n     August day, having spent the morning and afternoon at the \n     Statler Hotel in a seemingly endless succession of these \n     consultations, I announced I was going out for a walk. An \n     economist would call it a random walk. I had no direction in \n     mind, save any that would get me away from that hotel room.\n       And so I wandered westerly to Church Street and reached \n     Pearl. Glancing south along Church Street, of a sudden I saw \n     something that did not exist. Couldn't exist. Certainly \n     something I for certain had not known to exist. A Sullivan \n     skyscraper. The Guaranty Building. The beginning of an \n     American architecture that would come to be known as the \n     International Style. Sure enough, on the east side of the \n     street there were three tall skyscrapers (an American term, \n     incidentally, the topmost sail of a clippership, save when \n     the moonraker is rigged). One was by an old friend, Minoru \n     Yamasaki. Each was an exact copy, if you would just look at \n     the essentials, of Sullivan's building across the street, \n     built fifty or sixty years earlier. (On closer examination, \n     there had been a fire of sorts, and the building was all but \n     abandoned.)\n       I then and there resolved to win the Democratic primary, \n     become a United States Senator and save the Sullivan \n     building.\n       My first task was to get the City of Buffalo interested. \n     One day the Mayor agreed to walk over with me from City Hall. \n     He was a fine new Mayor; if he had any weakness, it was that \n     he agreed with you on everything. I mean everything. Well, \n     most things. ``Mr. Mayor,'' I proclaimed, ``if we can save \n     that building, the time will come when people will get on \n     airplanes and fly to Buffalo just to see it.'' ``Bull,'' said \n     His Honor.\n       May I say, it was a special pleasure to see in Thursday's \n     Buffalo News a picture of Eugenio De Anzorena of Alexandria, \n     Virginia, one of your conferees, making videotapes of the \n     designs on the wall of the Guaranty Building. ``Appreciating \n     Architecture'' was the caption, although I should have \n     preferred, ``The Mayor Refuted!''\n       No matter. The Buffalo ``Evening News,'' as it then was, \n     got the point. I began to learn the history of this great \n     achievement of the Prairie School, the first American \n     architecture, soon to be seen world-wide.\n       We begin in middle of the 19th Century, in the village of \n     Stockton in nearby Chautauqua, County. It was in Stockton \n     where one Hascal L. Taylor, a carriage maker, had grown up. \n     Taylor would in time make a great deal of money in the oil \n     fields of western Pennsylvania. His vision was to build a \n     monument, the largest office building in the city, in \n     downtown Buffalo. Taylor immediately sought the \n     prestigious Chicago firm of Dankmar Adler and Louis \n     Sullivan, who had of course built the Wainright Building \n     in St. Louis four years earlier--in 1892.\n       Adler, the engineer, and Sullivan, the designer, had \n     created a new form. A form based on function. Taylor got it. \n     He, however, died in 1894. Fortunately the Guaranty Company \n     bought the plans for the building and the site. Note the \n     brevity of the subsequent succession: The Guaranty purchased \n     the land and plans in December of 1894. The constructors \n     began laying the foundation for the new building in February \n     of 1895. By July of 1895, the steel frame was complete, and \n     in March of 1896, barely a year after laying the foundation, \n     the first occupants were moving in. Incredible.\n       Using his ``organic'' philosophy, Sullivan, had created a \n     `sister' work to St. Louis's Wainwright Building. The new, \n     taller building, a 13 story, 140,000 square foot structure\n\n[[Page S9904]]\n\n     was called the nation's second skyscraper. An ornate \n     masterpiece, embellished with a warm terra cotta exterior but \n     forceful in its verticality, was the new ``American \n     skyscraper.'' Let me say, that I would rather see Mount \n     Vernon torn down, or even the White House. They are fine \n     buildings, but they are copies. Copies of European buildings, \n     which in turn were copies of Greek and Roman buildings. The \n     skyscraper is ours. Invented by this man of singular American \n     genius, Louis Sullivan. In architecture, as in much else, we \n     had followed the rest of the world. Then came Sullivan, and \n     ever since the world has followed us. Indeed, the Guaranty is \n     our treasure, and yet remarkably it has not always been \n     appreciated as such.\n       By the 1940s the building had already changed owners. In \n     the 1950s the owners were concerned about the accumulation of \n     dirt on the facade. They chose an unfortunately destructive \n     solution: they hired sandblasters to clean the terra cotta on \n     the first two stories. Other ``improvements'' included adding \n     suspended acoustical ceilings and tile flooring, thereby \n     altering the perspectives of Sullivan's rooms and hiding some \n     of the exquisite interior decorations.\n       Even though it was located downtown, its facilities became \n     ``outmoded'' and its rental space was in very little demand. \n     Even though it was listed on the National Register of \n     Historic Places in 1973 and designated a national historic \n     landmark in 1975, a fire in 1974 forced much of the building \n     to close, and placed the building's future in jeopardy.\n       In June of 1977, Progressive Architecture, reported: \n     ``Discreet inquiries have been made by owners of Louis \n     Sullivan's Prudential Building (formerly Guaranty) in \n     Buffalo, NY about steps to demolish a historic landmark.'' \n     Thus by 1977, architects were speaking of the building in \n     terms of how best to demolish it. In April of 1977 the City \n     threatened to destroy the building.\n       In September of 1977, the Greater Buffalo Development \n     Foundation established a volunteer task force of business and \n     community leaders to study the possible renovation of the \n     building. After concluding that it should be done, they came \n     up with new financial strategies that included tax exempt \n     financing rates, partial property tax abatement, and private \n     loans. The cost was estimated to be around $12.4 million.\n       I wrote to the Secretaries of Housing and Urban \n     Development, Commerce, and Interior seeking funds for the \n     building. In October of 1977, I convinced Vice President \n     Mondale to tour the building whilst visiting here. (He needed \n     no persuading, having the Owatonna Bank back home.) In \n     November of 1978, we got our first grant, small but \n     symbolic--$50,000 from The Department of Interior's Historic \n     Preservation Program. And in April of 1981, we secured a $2.4 \n     million Urban Development Action Grant (UDAG) from the US \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). In \n     addition, as a site on the National Register of Historic \n     Places, the building was qualified to receive a 25 percent \n     tax credit on the entire investment under the Economic \n     Recovery Tax Act of 1981.\n       After a majestic renovation by the architectural and \n     engineering firm Canon, the building re-opened in December of \n     1983.\n       But there is a lesson to be learned here. Fortunately, \n     throughout the process of renovating the Guaranty building \n     there were those of us, spurred on by the Buffalo News, who \n     began to recover the memory, if you will, of one of the \n     greatest tragedies of architecture in this nation--the \n     demolition of Frank Lloyd Wright's Larkin building. An \n     examination of that misguided chain of events tells us a \n     little more about the dangers of neglect, and introduces New \n     York to the mind of Louis Sullivan's greatest pupil.\n       As all of you know, Sullivan was Frank Lloyd Wright's \n     ``Lieber meister''. In his book largely on Sullivan, Genius \n     and the Mobocrocy, Wright wrote of his early days with \n     Sullivan:\n       `` `Wright,' the young draughtsman nineteen, he would often \n     say to me with undisguised contempt: `Wright! I have no \n     respect at all for a draughtsman!' . . . His haughty \n     disregard had already offended most of the Adler and Sullivan \n     employees. His contempt may have been due to the fact that he \n     was so marvelous a draughtsman himself. But I knew what he \n     really meant . . . He taught me nothing nor did he ever \n     pretend to do so except as he was himself the thing he did \n     and as I could see it for myself. He (`the designing \n     partner') was the educational document in evidence.''\n       Wright then clarified Sullivan's genius and its \n     relationship to the `mobocrocy':\n       ``Do you realize, that here in his [Sullivan's] own way, is \n     no body of culture evolving through centuries of time but a \n     scheme and `style' of plastic expression which an individual, \n     working away in the poetry crushing environment of a more \n     cruel materialism than any seen since the days of the brutal \n     Roman, has made out of himself? Here was a sentient \n     individual who evoked the goddess whole civilizations strove \n     in vain for centuries to win, and wooed her with this \n     charming interior style--all on his own in one lifetime all \n     too brief . . . [Sullivan's] language of self expression was \n     as complete in itself'' as that ``of any of the great style \n     which time took so many ages to perfect.''\n       Yet, I do not want to mislead. They had their \n     disagreements.\n       By 1902, Wright had perfected some of his outside \n     commissions in the form of the Prairie house. On September \n     11, 1902, Darwin Martin--Secretary of the successful Larkin \n     Company of Buffalo--visited his brother William in Chicago. \n     William was looking for a site for a new home, and as they \n     toured Oak Park they became intrigued with Wright's designs \n     there. William met with Wright a month later and wrote his \n     brother that he was most favorably impressed. William wrote:\n       ``He would be pleased to design your house - & further he \n     is the man to build your office - he has had large experience \n     in the large office buildings with Adler and Sullivan . . . \n     he says it is strange that he is only known as a residence \n     architect - when his best and largest experience was in large \n     buildings.''\n       Meryle Secrest in his biography of Wright, A House Divided, \n     wrote that Wright saw the Larkin Project as his chance to \n     ``break into the world of large building commissions,'' but \n     that he ``shamelessly exaggerated the importance of his role \n     at Adler and Sullivan.'' For Martin later told Larkin that: \n     ``the $500,000 Wainwright Building and the Union Trust \n     Building and the Union Trust Building of St. Louis; the \n     Schiller Theater and the Stock Exchange in Chicago; the \n     Seattle and Pueblo Opera Houses, all Adler and Sullivan's \n     work, were, I inferred from Mr. Wright, largely his \n     creations.' ''\n       The Larkin Company of Buffalo commissioned him (at Mr. \n     Darwin Martin's recommendation) to design its administrative \n     building across from the soap factory and warehouse. For \n     Wright, it was an opportunity to develop complex spatial \n     ideas. His exterior was an expression of almost pure \n     geometric form, with no ornamentation save for two piers \n     topped by sculptures supporting globes to symbolize the \n     company's international aspirations. Wright intended the \n     reductive form to be a ``genuine and constructive affirmation \n     of the new Order of the Machine Age.''\n       The Larkin Building was not at first widely praised in \n     architectural circles. It began to exert a great deal of \n     influence on European architects with the publication of \n     Wright's work by Ernst Wasmuth in Berlin in 1910. By the mid-\n     1920s the European appreciation of the Larkin Building had \n     crossed the Atlantic. The building gained prominence in \n     American surveys of modern architecture and does so to this \n     day.\n       Yet, the proliferation of chain stores in small towns began \n     to cut into the Larkin Company's mail order business. The \n     Depression caused further problems. Assets were liquidated to \n     pay creditors. By 1943 the Larkin Company had no assets other \n     than the building, on which it owed $85,000 in back taxes.\n       In August, 1949 the Western Trading Corporation offered the \n     Common Council $5,000 and promised to raze the Larkin \n     Building and replace it with something that would improve the \n     tax base. Two months later Mayor Dowd accepted the offer. The \n     building was demolished to make way for a truck terminal, but \n     Western Trading then petitioned to move the terminal to a \n     larger lot. A vacant lot exists on the site today.\n       So too in downtown Chicago, one of Sullivan's first \n     buildings was replaced by a multi-story parking garage. \n     Wright had warned of the ``poetry crushing environment of a \n     more cruel materialism'' and both his and Sullivan's works \n     were victims of this environment. The burden falls on men and \n     women like you to remind us all of the value of these works.\n       It was just such a reminder that opened my eyes to the \n     wonder, and neglect of the Darwin Martin House. It was Saint \n     Patrick's Day, 1991, and Jason Aronoff, the head of the \n     Landmark Society of the Niagara Frontier's Martin House Task \n     Force had asked me to look into the condition of the Darwin \n     Martin House. I was not prepared.\n       We first visited the splendidly maintained Heath House with \n     its gracious young family. We then went across to see the \n     Darwin Martin House, which was quite simply a ruin. The \n     concrete was running away like sand. Two of the great \n     ornamental urns were missing from the front step and were \n     only later found discarded in the yard. On the front door and \n     side windows thereof there was a printed sign which read:\n\n\n                                 Notice\n\n       ``New York State's Current fiscal condition has caused the \n     closing of the Darwin D. Martin House to the public until \n     further notice. Queries about future opening date and \n     restoration plans for the House should be Mailed to . . .''\n       I immediately wrote to the Buffalo News in an effort to \n     alert all to the horrid state of this wonderful House. What \n     had become of this masterpiece? Who was to blame? How can we \n     avoid such a tragedy in the future?\n       In the Martin House, Wright showed what he could do with \n     what became an almost unlimited budget. Construction on the \n     Martin House began in early 1904 and ended in 1906 with 20 \n     rooms and 11,000 square feet, at a cost of $160,000.\n       Because of, perhaps in spite of, their numerous dialogues \n     over the plans for and the cost of the house, Martin and \n     Wright became fast friends. Martin helped Wright get many \n     other commissions through the years. Late in life Martin \n     offered Wright one last commission, a monument for the family \n     plot in the Forest Lawn Cemetery. Martin wanted a design to \n     cover only the space for one grave. Typically, Wright \n     produced a much larger design with a flight of marble steps \n     climbing the slope of the lot to a single headstone bearing \n     the family names. The stock market crash prevented the \n     commission from being realized. On learning of Martin's death \n     in 1935, Wright referred to him as ``My best friend.''\n\n[[Page S9905]]\n\n       After Darwin Martin died the house stood vacant for the \n     next 17 years. There is no clear explanation for his son's \n     lack of appreciation for the house, no clear answer to why \n     Darwin Jr. began to strip the house of its doors, lighting, \n     wiring, moldings, heating, and plumbing systems and \n     installing them in other buildings he owned. When he finally \n     vacated the house, he left the doors unlocked. Neighborhood \n     children would come in for roller skating, or to smash some \n     windows or some of the remaining mosaic tiles over the \n     fireplace. Eventually part of the roof fell in from the \n     weight of snow.\n       In 1946 the City was the sole bidder on the Martin House at \n     the foreclosure sale. In 1954 Buffalo architect Sebastian \n     Tauriello bought the house, the pergola, the conservatory, \n     and the garage for $22,000. He wrote to Wright for the \n     original plans and received the following reply: ``Dear \n     Tauriello: Hope you treat the opus according to its merits. \n     When we return to Wisconsin May first I will look up the \n     plans and send you a set of prints with a bill for the \n     prints. Frank Lloyd Wright.''\n       Fearing an exorbitant fee, Tauriello proceeded without \n     them. The doors, heating, and plumbing systems were replaced \n     by August and the Tauriello's moved in. Part of his plan for \n     financing the restoration of the house was the sale of a \n     portion of the property. The pergola, conservatory, and \n     garage were in varying stages of decay. They were demolished \n     and the apartments you see today were built to Mr. \n     Tauriello's design.\n       Mr. Tauriello was not wealthy, and was not in a position to \n     restore the house to its 1908 condition. He also wanted to \n     add modern conveniences and some individual touches. As he \n     did not need a 20 room house and did need restoration funds, \n     he created two five-room apartments inside. But regardless of \n     the changes he made, he saved the house. Tauriello died in \n     1965. The next year his wife sold the house to SUNY Buffalo \n     at the request of new president Martin Meyerson, a Wright \n     aficionado. He left Buffalo in 1970. Several university \n     offices were located in the house until 1980, when it again \n     stood unused, as it was on the day of our visit in 1991.\n       There was a restoration plan in place, but next to no \n     money. I went to Robert C. Byrd, chairman of the subcommittee \n     that funds Federal historic preservation programs, and asked \n     for his help. While there was no program that provides \n     specific funds to restore specific buildings, he saw to it \n     that the Darwin Martin House got $500,000 that year. In 1995 \n     we were able to reprogram another $500,000, this time in \n     funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, \n     for the house. Last spring, at the urging of Stan Lipsey, I \n     asked Senator Gorton of Washington State for another $500,000 \n     in historic preservation funds, and the Senate bill, HR 2107, \n     which we passed on Thursday night, includes that amount.\n       I should warn you not to look at these appropriations and \n     think any deserving preservation project, even a Wright \n     house, can count on Federal funds. None can. The $40 million \n     we provide each year for preservation goes directly to the \n     State Preservation offices. There is no ``Save This \n     Building'' account. Is there support for one? I quote the \n     Senate bill we just passed: ``This will be the final year of \n     appropriations to the National Trust for Historic \n     Preservation.'' That is a battle for next year, but we have \n     all we can do to keep what programs we have.\n       Thus on a couple of last notes, I hope you have had a \n     chance to visit Kleinhans Music Hall, another of Buffalo's \n     wonders. It is one of the great later works of Eliel \n     Saarinen. It is also one of the first commissions on which \n     son Eero worked side by side with him. The building's sense \n     of balance is representative of, in Eliel's words, the \n     structure's ``masculine'' and ``feminine'' traits as \n     exhibited by ``strongly indicative line'' in the former and a \n     ``playful pattern of wall space'' in the latter. But function \n     was certainly important to the Saarinens; Kleinhans is a \n     splendid hall in which to hear a concert. It is also one of \n     but three examples of Eliel's work in the East.\n       In 1984 I secured a tax provision--a ``sale-leaseback'' \n     provision, that could have been worth millions to the upkeep \n     and restoration of Kleinhans. But one of the investors backed \n     out at the last minute before the legal deadline and the deal \n     fell through. A decade later the need for restoration funds \n     had not diminished. I got $1.5 million for the effort in \n     1994.\n       Then, of course, there are the buildings by H. H. \n     Richardson. Wright disclosed that Sullivan had a respect for \n     Richardson, that he (Richardson) had for few others. Again \n     from, Genius and the Mobocrocy: ``Later I [Wright] discovered \n     his [Sullivan's] secret respect, leaning toward envy (I am \n     ashamed to suspect), for H.H. Richardson.''\n       Eight of the original eleven buildings designed for the \n     Buffalo State Hospital stand today. The most splendid being \n     the twin towered centerpiece buildings. In 1990, the state \n     spent $4.5 million to restore one of the seven remaining \n     patient pavilions. However, these buildings were vacated in \n     1993 and 1995. Ominously, the state has designated the \n     buildings ``surplus property'' and is looking to sell them on \n     the open market. Thus our battle continues.\n       We restored the Guaranty--the soul of this city. We are on \n     our way to restoring Darwin Martin--the treasure of scale, of \n     form and of relationship of interior to exterior. Kleinhans \n     Music Hall and the Roycroft Inn are also to be included in a \n     tablet of success. However, Federal support is waning. As you \n     state in the opening of the conference, Wright wrote that the \n     ``Prairie begins west of Buffalo.'' We must do our best to \n     see that our treasures do not become dust on the prairie. It \n     happened to the Larkin building. It may yet happen to those \n     of Richardson. So again I say the burden is unduly forced on \n     men and women like you to remind us of the symphony that \n     continues to play around us, like this great symphonic \n     interplay we have here in Buffalo. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/24/senate-section/article/S9903-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NATIONAL UNDERGROUND RAILROAD NETWORK TO FREEDOM ACT, S. 887\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues \nto join me in cosponsoring legislation that will commemorate the \nphysical as well as spiritual triumph over one of our Nation's most \ntragic legacies. This legislation is designed to help the National Park \nService present a dramatic chapter in American history; the \nperseverance of the quest for liberty that saw hundreds of thousands \nrisk their lives so that they might live free. The National Underground \nRailroad Network to Freedom Act, S. 887, will give, for the first time, \nFederal recognition and acknowledgment to this avenue of hope for those \nwho sought freedom from tyranny and oppression.\n  The Underground Railroad was a loosely organized system of escape \nroutes for hundreds of thousands of enslaved African-Americans. Average \nmen and women, who shared a love of freedom and a hatred of the \ninstitution of slavery, committed themselves to help free a people by \noffering food, shelter, clothing, money, or whatever would assist \npassengers along the Underground Railroad. Typically, a stop along the \nUnderground Railroad would be a farmhouse or a church where passengers \nwould be hidden in the attic or the basement, or behind false walls or \neven under floorboards. A person on the railroad would be concealed \nuntil it was determined that it was safe to travel to the next site. \nThis scenario was repeated over and over again until the passenger \nreached safety in the North or in Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean.\n  Although largely clandestine, the Underground Railroad is a tangible \nexample of the extent that resistance to slavery existed during the \n18th and 19th centuries. Indeed, some 380 sites--28 of which are in New \nYork--have been documented in a National Park Service study as sites \npotentially significant to the Underground Railroad movement. It is \nlikely that there are more sites about which we will never know. Of the \nsites that do exist, it is important to highlight their role in \nabetting the elimination of the shameful practice of slavery.\n  It is important to our national heritage that we recognize and \nremember the bravery of those who risked their lives to make the \njourney along the Underground Railroad and those who provided sanctuary \nto them. This legislation will help raise awareness about these \nlocations along the Underground Railroad, enhancing the chances that \nthe sites will be maintained or restored. We must recognize and \npreserve these historic sites, which represent the extraordinary \nefforts, perils, sacrifices, and triumphs of those who risked their \nlives so that they might taste freedom. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin cosponsoring this important measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/24/senate-section/article/S9905-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9905-S9906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO ENTREPRENEUR WALLY AMOS\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pay \ntribute to my good friend Wally Amos. ``Famous Amos'' known to many \nAmericans as the founder of Famous Amos Cookies and the father of the \ngourmet chocolate chip cookie industry, is an example to all of us. He \nis an example because of his dedication to our country as a veteran of \nthe U.S. Air Force, and for what he has accomplished as an entrepreneur \nand businessman. He is a citizen of this country who has reaped great \nsuccess but has not neglected his responsibilities to the community. \nAnd even more than that, Mr. President, Wally Amos brings a powerful \nand inspirational message to people in all walks of life.\n  I have said over and over that I believe that small businesses and \nentrepreneurship are the foundation of the economic engine of this \ncountry. Wally Amos has for some time now written a monthly column \nsubtitled ``Grow Your\n\n[[Page S9906]]\n\nBusiness,'' and I would like to take just a few moments to highlight \nseveral principals that he has offered as a result of good and bad \nexperiences he has lived though: First, effort doesn't always equal \nresults. You grow a business by assessing your personal strengths and \ncontributing them to the efforts of the team. Second, some of the \ngreatest personal growth comes as a result of some of the most \nchallenging experiences. What you give attention to grows. Rather than \ngive attention to what you don't have, focus on what you do have. \nThird, fear creates anger, resentment, anxiety, frustration, and worry, \nnone of which will help you succeed in business. Fourth, be passionate \nabout your business. Demonstrate that you care for your employees and \nbusiness associates. People are your most important asset. Fifth, your \nemployees have a vested interest in your success. Sixth, dogmatic \nbehavior and stubbornness have created long-term success. The quickest \nway to failure is to believe that your way is the only way.\n  Mr. President, in every job Wally Amos has had, he always started at \nthe bottom and worked his way to the top. I hope that others will look \nto the example of citizenship and entrepreneurship of Wally Amos and be \ninspired as I am. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/24/senate-section/article/S9905-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ST.

Woodward, the New Hampshire winner of the Sallie Mae \nFirst Class Teacher's Award, which recognizes the Nation's outstanding \nelementary and secondary school teachers in their first year of \nteaching. Susan was selected for her outstanding dedication to teaching \nand her love for her students in her first year at Mastricola Middle \nSchool in Merrimack, NH.\n  Ms. Woodward received her bachelor of arts degree from Rivier College \nin Nashua, NH, in 1995. She graduated summa cum laude and was \nvaledictorian of her class. Ms. Woodward joined the staff of the \nMerrimack School District as a substitute, and is currently employed as \na full-time French teacher at Mastricola Middle School.\n  Dedicated, creative, hard-working and inspirational are all words \nwhich describe Ms. Woodward. A perfectionist by nature, Susan uses a \nvariety of instructional techniques, auditory and visual, so her \nstudents are always active participants in their learning. She makes \nher classes fun, employing a marvelous sense of humor, fairness and \ncompassion. Ms. Woodward believes every student has potential, every \nstudent is special, and makes every effort to be available for her \nstudents.\n  Active inside and outside the classroom, Ms. Woodward is a good role \nmodel for her students. Whether staying after school helping her \nstudents or dancing at a school dance, Ms. Woodward is always available \nfor advice and support.\n  The mark of a great teacher is one who cares, unconditionally, about \nthe success and well-being of students. Mr. President, as a former \nteacher myself, I understand the challenges, responsibilities and \ndedication involved with teaching. I admire and respect Ms. Woodward \nfor establishing herself as an irreplaceable teacher in the school \ndistrict of Merrimack. Most importantly, she is helping to shape the \nlives of the young students who are the future of New Hampshire and the \ncountry. I am very honored to have Ms. Woodward as a teacher in the \nGranite State. The Sallie Mae Award has indeed gone to a first-class \nteacher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/24/senate-section/article/S9906-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 105-31\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH.

Mr. President, as the ranking Democratic member of the \nSenate Commerce Committee, I am proud to support the nomination of Ms. \nSheila F. Anthony to serve as a Commissioner of the Federal Trade \nCommission [FTC]. The FTC is now functioning with only four \nCommissioners. Because of the Commission's myriad of responsibilities, \nit is imperative the agency operates with maximum participation of its \ndesignated Commissioners to ensure its efficiency.\n  The primary duties of the Federal Trade Commission are: First, to \nprotect consumers from unfair and deceptive practices, and second to \nensure the operation of an efficient and competitive market-place. As \npart of its administrative responsibilities, the Commission administers \na number of Federal statutes, including the Federal Trade Commission \nAct, which provides the Commission its consumer protection authority, \nand the Sherman, Clayton & Robinson-Patman antitrust statutes, as well \nas the Fair Credit Reporting, Fair Debt Collection Practices, and Truth \nin Lending Acts. A few of the Commission's specific duties include \nsafeguarding the public from false advertisement of goods and services, \ntelemarketing fraud, unfair pricing of products, unfair mergers and \nacquisitions, illegal boycotts, and other unfair methods of \ncompetition.\n  Ms. Anthony's record reveals she is well qualified to serve as a \nCommissioner on the FTC.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2248 which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2248) to authorize the President to award a \n     gold medal on behalf of the Congress to Ecumenical Patriarch \n     Bartholomew in recognition of his outstanding and enduring \n     contributions toward religious understanding and peace, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport\n\n[[Page S9908]]\n\nswift passage of H.R. 2248. This bill is identical to the bill that I \nintroduced along with Senator Sarbanes as original cosponsor. Both \nbills authorize the presentation of the Congressional Gold Medal to His \nAll Holiness, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, leader of the \nOrthodox Christian Church.\n  It is fitting that we recognize the tremendous leadership this \nreligious figure provides to nearly 300 million people worldwide during \nhis upcoming visit to our country.\n  While many consider countries such as Russia and Greece to be \nOrthodox Christian strongholds, the fact is that nearly 5 million \nUnited States citizens of Greek, Russian, Ukrainian, and Serbian \ndescent are Orthodox Christians. The contributions of these Americans \nto our rich history and culture exemplify the values, ideals, and \ndreams of this great Nation.\n  The Patriarch Bartholomew has followed a calling in his life--to \nselflessly serve not only people of Greek origin, but millions of \nbelievers from all over the world, through his strong faith.\n  Patriarch Bartholomew was enthroned as the 270th spiritual leader of \nthe Orthodox Christians in 1991. This new title came with enormous \nresponsibilities and burdens. But, the Patriarch Bartholomew was \nprepared to meet the task. Not only has he fulfilled the demanding role \nas preeminent leader of Orthodox Christians, he has dedicated himself \nand used his station to promote worthy, noble causes.\n  Mr. President, in the name of religious unity and cooperation, \nPatriarch Bartholomew is working to promote interfaith dialog between \nthe Orthodox Church, and the Roman Catholic Church, leading Protestant \ndenominations, Muslim leaders, and various other faiths.\n  He has also sought to strengthen the bonds between Judaism and \nOrthodox Christianity. In 1994, the Patriarch worked side by side with \nRabbi David Schneier and the Appeal of Conscience Foundation to \ncosponsor the Peace and Tolerance Conference, bringing together \nChristians, Jews, and Muslims for human and religious freedom.\n  And Patriarch Bartholomew's compassion is far-reaching. In the war-\ntorn countries of the Balkans, he has helped to advance reconciliation \namong Catholic, Muslim, and Orthodox communities.\n  As a citizen of Turkey, Patriarch Bartholomew is deeply concerned \nabout the need to sustain the cause of peace. He has been a dynamic \nleader in efforts to ease Greek-Turkish tensions and to promote \ninternational cooperation, adherence to international law, and respect \nfor human rights of victims of aggression.\n  Mr. President, Patriarch Bartholomew, also referred to as the ``Green \nPatriarch'' has a sincere commitment to the environmental legacy we \nwill one day leave to our children. Together with global leaders, he \nconvened an international environmental symposium emphasizing the \nhealth and well-being of the world's oceans. The Patriarch is also a \ncosponsor of an annual conference addressing the protection of our \nglobal environment.\n  Mr. President, in October of this year, Patriarch Bartholomew will \nvisit the United States to offer his spiritual message of unity, \ncompassion, and brotherhood. It is my belief that Congress should honor \nthe work of this great leader in recognition of his outstanding and \nenduring contributions to religious freedom, tolerance, world peace, \nenvironmental protection, and human rights.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I call upon my colleagues to support \nbestowing the Congressional Gold Medal upon a visionary for our times, \nEcumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. I would also like to take the \nopportunity to extend thanks to my 48 colleagues in the Senate who have \nlent their bipartisan support to this effort.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator D'Amato, \nchairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs, in urging immediate passage of H.R. 2248.\n  Patriarch Bartholomew will be visiting the United States from October \n19 through November 17, 1997. This bill awards the Congressional Gold \nMedal to Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of \napproximately 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide. The occasion \nof this legislation is to recognize Patriarch Bartholomew's outstanding \ncontributions to world peace and understanding during his tenure as \nhead of this ancient branch of Christianity and to honor Patriarch \nBartholomew's first visit to the United States as Patriarch. As a \nGreek-Orthodox American and member of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of \nthe Annunciation in Baltimore, I am particularly gratified to join in \nthis tribute.\n  During his American visit Patriarch Bartholomew will meet with \nthousands of Orthodox faithful and will take the opportunity to convey \nhis message of reconciliation to Americans of all backgrounds and \nbeliefs. His All Holiness has been a leader in ecumenical understanding \nand has convened important meetings which have brought together \nparticipants of all religious backgrounds. In 1994, in cooperation with \nRabbi David Schneier and the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, he \ncosponsored a Peace and Tolerance Conference in Istanbul where \nChristians, Jews, and Muslims joined together to discuss important and \npressing issues.\n  As spiritual head of world Orthodoxy, Patriarch Bartholomew has been \na leader in the quest for peace throughout the world, particularly in \nEastern Europe, the Balkans, and the Middle East. He has vigorously \nspoken out against extremists and those who would use violence to \nachieve their ends and has counseled respect for all peoples, \nirrespective of their nationality and religion; his ministry has been a \ncall to our best virtues.\n  From his historical seat in Istanbul, Turkey, Patriarch Bartholomew \nhas served as a mediator between East and West, Christians and Muslims, \nand as a force for openness and tolerance in the newly emerging \nindependent countries of Eastern Europe.\n  As he pursues the goal of peace, Patriarch Bartholomew is equally \nvigorous in his desire to preserve and promote the Earth's environment \nas a reflection of God's creation. Working with the European \nCommission, the Worldwide Fund for Nature, and his Royal Highness \nPrince Philip, he has cosponsored significant international conferences \non the environment, including one scheduled for this month on the \nfuture ecological health of the Black Sea.\n  I believe it is most fitting that the visit and the accomplishments \nof Patriarch Bartholomew should be recognized and honored by this Gold \nMedal as it will reflect the appreciation of the American people for \nhis ministry of peace and reconciliation.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH.
