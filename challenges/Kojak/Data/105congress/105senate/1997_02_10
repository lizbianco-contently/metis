Mr. President, today the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business until 1 o'clock this afternoon. At 1 o'clock, the \nSenate will resume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 1, the \nconstitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget. By unanimous \nconsent, Senator Wellstone will be recognized to offer an amendment or \ntwo at 1 p.m. We hope to be able to complete all debate on Senator \nWellstone's amendments today.

I also remind my colleagues that the \nSenate is scheduled to adjourn for the President's Day recess on \nThursday of this week. In addition, tomorrow President Clinton is \ncoming to the Capitol for a meeting, and also for Senators' \ninformation, the funeral for Ambassador Harriman is scheduled for \nThursday. Therefore, this week will be busy as we continue to make \nprogress on the balanced budget amendment and consider any nominations \nthat may become available.\n  I might mention that it is possible we could have a vote on the U.S. \nTrade Representative this week, and it's even possible on Congressman \nRichardson, who is up for U.N. Representative. As always, we will try \nto keep all Senators advised on the schedule for the remainder of the \nweek, as well as any ordered rollcall votes.

Mr. President, the President of the United States has now \nsubmitted his budget, a plan that extends for 5 years, a plan that \ncontinues us on the path of deficit reduction, a plan that will \ncontinue to reduce the role of the Federal Government in the life of \nthe country, but one that will emphasize the priorities that he \nstressed in the most recent campaign--an emphasis on improving \neducational opportunity in the United States, a desire to preserve the \nimportant priorities of caring for our senior citizens through the \nMedicare Program, of also preserving the social safety net, and at the \nsame time reforming the welfare program to provide that people who are \nin need of assistance go to work, where possible. All of these are \ncontained in the President's latest budget submission.\n  I have heard a fair amount of criticism from various circles about \nvarious elements of the President's plan. I think it's appropriate to \nrespond to those criticisms so that people who are\n\n[[Page S1146]]\n\nwatching this debate unfold have a balanced view of what the President \nhas proposed.\n  One of the criticisms that I have heard is that the President is \nproposing significant increases in Federal spending. Mr. President, if \none looks at the fairest measure of what is happening to Federal \nspending, one comes to quite a different conclusion. I have prepared \nthis chart that shows what has happened since 1992, back when the \ndeficit was $290 billion. It shows what has happened to Federal \nspending as a percentage of our national income. Also described is the \ngross domestic product. It is perhaps the fairest measure of what is \nhappening to the Federal budget, because it looks, in inflation \nadjusted terms, at what is happening to Federal spending.\n  One can see by this chart that back in 1992 we were spending, at the \nFederal level, nearly 22 percent of our national income. In fact, it \nwas 21.8 percent. Because of the 1993 budget deal that has done a \ndramatic job in reducing the Federal deficit by both cutting spending \nand also raising income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent in this \ncountry, you can see what has happened. Spending, as a share of our \nnational income by the Federal Government, has gone down--20.8 percent \nin 1996. Revenue went up, narrowing the gap between spending and \nrevenue, and as a result, reducing the deficit. You can see, according \nto the President's plan, that Federal spending stabilizes for 1 year at \n20.8 percent of national income and then starts declining each and \nevery year until Federal spending declines to 19 percent of our \nnational income.\n  Mr. President, that is dramatically lower than in any year under \neither the Reagan administration or the Bush administration. In fact, \nif you look back in terms of what the Federal Government was spending \nas a percentage of our national income in the years of President Reagan \nand President Bush, what you will find is that spending ranged between \n22 and 23 percent of our national income. And so President Clinton's \nplan, which is to take us to 19 percent of our national income going to \nthe Federal Government, is a dramatic reduction and put us at the \nlowest levels that we have experienced for a very long time.\n  Another thing that we have heard is that the President's plan uses a \nrosy scenario.\n  Mr. President, I am a former tax commissioner of my State. One of my \njobs was to project the revenue of the State of North Dakota. One of \nthe reasons I am here is I did a pretty good job of that. We are \nconservative. We were able to develop substantial surpluses because we \nhad accurate projections of our income. That is critically important at \nthe national level. And in order to make a determination as to whether \nor not this administration has been guilty of rosy scenarios perhaps it \nis most helpful to look at the record. What did they project and what \nhas happened? Mr. President, the record is abundantly clear.\n  This chart shows from 1993 to 1995 the projection for 1996 and what \nhas happened. The blue line is the Office of Management and Budget \ncontrolled by the President. The red line is the Congressional Budget \nOffice controlled by Congress. The green line is what has actually \nhappened with the deficit. Interesting: What one finds is that both OMB \nand the Congressional Budget Office have been overly pessimistic. The \nfact is the deficit has declined much more sharply than either of them \npredicted. That is the fact. That is the record. The deficit during the \nterm of this President has declined much more sharply--on average $50 \nbillion a year more--than this administration predicted. No rosy \nscenarios here. They have adopted a very conservative fiscal outlook \nnot only in the 4 years that they have had responsibility for it but \nalso looking forward. In fact, they are right in the mainstream of the \nblue chip economic forecasters that our major corporations rely on for \ntheir forecasts.\n  Mr. President, we have also heard criticism that the President's plan \nis back-end loaded; that is, 75 percent of the savings are in the last \n2 years of this 5-year budget plan. Mr. President, I would like to see \nless back-end loading as well. I think it would be better if we have \nless in the way of back-end loading. But our critics on the other side \nof the aisle I think have a credibility problem because if you do a \nfifth of what they proposed last year in the budget resolution that \nthey passed right in this Chamber, you take this deficit reduction path \nwhich is the blue line, and you fit President Clinton's 1998 budget \nsubmission in his proposed deficit reduction path and put the two \ntogether, look what you find. They are almost identical. This is what \nour friends on the other side of the Chamber here voted for just last \nyear. It was OK then. But all of a sudden now the President proposes a \ndeficit reduction path that is almost identical to the one they \nproposed, and all of a sudden it is a gimmick.\n  I think we can test the credibility of that statement just based on \nthe facts. If one looks at the historical record to make judgments on \nwho has credibility with respect to deficit reduction and who does not, \nlet us just look at the last three administrations. Let us look at the \nfacts that nobody can dispute.\n  These are the actual budget deficits year by year during the Reagan \nadministration, the Bush administration, and the Clinton \nadministration. Look what we see. In 1981 at the start of the Reagan \nadministration the deficit was $79 billion. It exploded promptly. Two \nyears later we were up to $208 billion. It kept going up to $221 \nbillion. Only at the end did we see the deficit start to come back \ndown. Then the Bush administration took over, and it was all red ink. \nHe took the deficit from $153 billion and ran it up to $290 billion.\n  This is historical fact. There is no question about these numbers. \nThese are the official numbers of the Federal Government. In fact, \nthese numbers come from the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Then President Clinton came into office, and each and every year the \ndeficit has declined. In fact, we have gone from a deficit of $290 \nbillion in the last year of the Bush administration--this chart shows \n$116 billion deficit for the most recent year. Actually it was somewhat \nbetter than that. When the final numbers came in, the deficit was down \nto $107 billion. So there is a dramatic reduction in the budget deficit \nduring the Clinton years.\n  Another way of looking at that is to look at these deficits with what \nis really the best way to measure, and that is as a percentage of our \nnational income. That is the best way to measure it because that takes \naccount of the inflationary changes over time. So you are comparing \napples to apples instead of apples to oranges.\n  There we see the deficit record of this administration in comparison \nto the previous two administrations in an even more stark way. Because \nwhen President Reagan came into office, the deficit was 2.6 percent of \nour national income. Within 2 years, it was up to 6 percent of our \nnational income. Then it worked its way back down to 3 percent. Again, \nPresident Bush took over, and in each and every year as a percentage of \nour national income the deficit went up--went up, went up until it was \n4.7 percent of our national income by the last year of the Bush \nadministration. And in the 4 years of this administration, each and \nevery year, largely because of the 1993 budget deal, which every \nDemocrat--or virtually every Democrat--voted for and every Republican \nvoted against, we got the deficit going down; not talking about \nreducing the deficit but finally results. It went from 3.9 percent of \nour national income. And this chart shows down to 1.5 percent of our \nnational income in the most recent year. Actually, it was somewhat \nbetter than that, as I indicated on the other chart. We actually got \ndown to 1.4 percent of our national income.\n  Not only is that good performance when we match against the \nhistorical record of the United States but, if we look at other \nindustrialized countries, we see that we now have the lowest deficit of \nany of the major industrialized countries in the world as measured \nagainst the size of our national income. In fact, other countries in \nEurope have a deficit as much as 7 percent of their national incomes. \nMost of them are in the 4 and 5 percent range.\n  So the United States has not only done well matched against its own \nhistorical record during the Clinton administration but has done \nremarkably well in comparison to what has happened in other major \nindustrialized countries. Partly because we have had that kind of very \nsuccessful deficit reduction, we have seen a remarkable\n\n[[Page S1147]]\n\neconomic progress in the United States. And the list is a long one of \nthe positive economic results that have come because we put in place a \nplan that actually reduced the budget deficit. That took pressure off \nof interest rates, and that had the very helpful effect of spurring \neconomic growth in this country.\n  Let us just look at some of the very positive results.\n  First of all, we have seen 11 million new jobs created in this \ncountry in the 4 years of this administration--11 million new jobs. \nThat is a remarkable record. We have also seen unemployment come down. \nUnemployment has dropped a full 2 percentage points. caca \ndldllflldlksdklmcdl We have seen inflation at very low levels. In fact, \nwe have the best record of sustained low levels of inflation in 20 \nyears.\n\n  Those are not the only outstanding economic results. We have also \nseen median household income up, the largest increase in a decade. We \nhave seen the largest decline in income inequality in 27 years in this \ncountry. I think that is something of great concern to anybody who is \nworried about the future of America. That has happened as a result of \nan economic plan that was put in place in 1993.\n  There are 1.6 million fewer people in poverty. That is as of last \nyear. That is now over 2 million fewer people in poverty, the largest \ndrop in 27 years.\n  The poverty rate for the elderly in America is at 10.5 percent, its \nlowest level ever, lowest level of elderly poverty in the history of \nour country, and the biggest drop in child poverty in 20 years.\n  These are facts. This is a remarkable economic record and one of \nwhich this administration can be justifiably proud.\n  We used to talk in America a lot about the misery index. Our friends \non the other side of the aisle always used to like to talk about the \nmisery index and how bad a thing that was and how bad the situation was \nin America. Well, we have good news to report because the misery index, \nwhich is a combination of the unemployment and inflation rate, is at \nits lowest level in 28 years--lowest level since 1968.\n  These are facts. These are facts of deficit reduction because of a \nplan that some of us had the courage to vote for in 1993, a plan that \nworked--a plan that has made dramatic progress in reducing the budget \ndeficit but one that has also had extremely good effects in the rest of \nour economy, creating jobs, building economic growth, lowering poverty, \nand doing a whole series of things that have made America now the most \ncompetitive nation on the face of the globe.\n  For a number of years there, we were very concerned that the United \nStates could not remain competitive, and we thought the Asians were \npassing us. We thought the Japanese were passing us. We were concerned \nthe Germans were on the march and on the move and we were stopped dead \nin our tracks.\n  For the last 2 years, when the experts analyzed the competitive \nposition of the countries, the major industrialized countries in the \nworld, the United States was No. 1. We have resumed our top position. \nIt is due in no small measure to the economic plan that we put in place \nin 1993.\n  Some who are listening might say, well, this is a Democratic Senator \nspeaking, and he is being partisan in terms of analyzing who should get \nthe credit for what has happened since that 1993 financial plan was put \ninto place. It is not just the view of this Senator. It is not just a \nreview of the facts that lead us to this conclusion. Mr. Greenspan, \ntestifying last year at about this time, said the deficit reduction in \nPresident Clinton's 1993 economic plan was:\n\n       An unquestioned factor in contributing to the improvement \n     in economic activity that occurred thereafter.\n\n  Mr. Greenspan is not a partisan. Mr. Greenspan, in fact, I think is a \nprominent member of the other party, but he acknowledges what is true, \nand what is true is very clear. This administration has made the hard \nchoices. They made them in 1993, when a lot of us stood up and joined \nthem in making the hard choices, and we paid a terrible price in this \nparty at the polls in 1994 because those hard choices did cut spending. \nYes, they did raise revenue, raised incomes taxes on the wealthiest 1 \npercent in this country.\n  I had a woman stop me the other day in Fargo, ND, and she said, ``You \nhave to quit raising taxes down there in Washington.'' I asked her if \nshe made $140,000 a year. She said, ``Oh, certainly not.'' I said, \n``Well, you did not have your taxes raised. You did not have your taxes \nraised unless you are making $140,000 a year. Your income taxes have \nnot gone up.''\n  That is the reality. That is the truth of the matter. I think as we \ngo through this budget debate we ought to remember precisely how we got \nto where we are. The fact is that 1993 budget plan, which some of us \nvoted for that has made such a profound difference, by the year 2002 \nwill reduce the indebtedness that would have otherwise occurred by $2.5 \ntrillion. Incredible. You look back to 1993. All of the projections \nwere that the debt and deficits were going to skyrocket, they were \ngoing right off the charts. But we took action. Some of us voted for a \nplan that has produced real results, and the day before yesterday Mr. \nRaines, the head of the Office of Management and Budget in this \nadministration, was able to report that by the year 2002 the 1993 \nbudget plan will have reduced what would have otherwise occurred in \nterms of the growth of the debt by $2.5 trillion.\n  Those were hard choices that had to be made in 1993, and they were \nmade, and the result is that we are in very a fortuitous position of \nhaving more to do, we need to do more, but we are pretty close to where \nwe want to get.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes remaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/10/senate-section/article/S1145-6", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1147-S1148]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, before the Senate is the question of the \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States. I \ntestified 2 weeks ago before the Judiciary Committee on this question.\n  I believe deeply in the need to balance the Federal budget. We have a \nresponsibility to do that because just over the horizon, even with all \nthe progress that has been made here, we have the demographic time bomb \nlying out there, and that time bomb is the retirement of the baby boom \ngeneration. When they start to retire, they are going to dramatically \nincrease the number of people who are eligible for our major Federal \nprograms. In fact, in very short order, they are going to double the \nnumber of people who are eligible for Social Security and Medicare and \nother programs like veterans' benefits. So, while enormous progress has \nbeen made, we have to do more. We have to do more.\n  Some say the answer is an amendment to the Constitution. Properly \ncrafted, I would support an amendment to the Constitution. But the one \nbefore us is not properly crafted.\n  Let me just give three reasons why I believe it is not properly \ncrafted. First, the balanced budget amendment before us in this Chamber \nwill not balance the budget at all--not at all. Boy, would the American \npeople be surprised to find out, if this passes, that come the year \n2002, when the budget is supposed to be balanced, the debt is still \nincreasing. Won't they be surprised after having been told that the \nSenate and the House have passed a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Why is that the case? Why would the debt be increasing even after the \nyear 2002 if we have a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution?\n  The answer is very simple. The definition of balanced budget that is \nin this amendment is not the definition of a balanced budget at \nall, because it includes every penny of Social Security surplus that is \ngoing to accrue to the Federal Treasury between now and the year 2002 \nand in the years thereafter. This balanced budget amendment, so-called \nbalanced budget amendment, would loot and raid the Social Security \ntrust fund of $450 billion over just the next 5 years, take every penny \nof Social Security surplus, throw that into the pot, and call it a \nbalanced budget.\n\n  No private employer in this country would be able to take the \nretirement funds of their employees and throw those into the pot and \nsay they balanced their operating budget. In fact, that would be a \nviolation of Federal law. That is what the Federal Government is doing \ntoday for Social Security\n\n[[Page S1148]]\n\ntrust fund surpluses, and under this so-called balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution, that flawed principle would be enshrined \nin the Constitution of the United States.\n  I often wonder, what would Thomas Jefferson think of putting in the \nConstitution of the United States a definition of a balanced budget \nthat included every trust fund dollar and call that a balanced budget? \nI wonder what Benjamin Franklin would think of that. I do not think \nthey would buy that, and we should not buy it.\n  The second major problem with this balanced budget amendment is it \nmakes inadequate provision for a national economic emergency. We know \nthat the right policy today is to cut spending and balance the budget. \nThat is precisely what we ought to do. That was precisely the wrong \nthing to do in the depths of the Great Depression, because raising \ntaxes and cutting spending in the midst of the Depression simply would \nmake the Depression longer and deeper. We have to pass an amendment \nhere that can stand the test of time. The one before us now simply does \nnot.\n  The third and final point: The balanced budget amendment before us \nnow assumes that the Court will enforce this amendment. Can you \nimagine? We can have a situation in which the Supreme Court Justices \nare sitting around a table, just a block from here --in fact, I can \nalmost see the Supreme Court through those doors--and we would have the \nJustices of the Supreme Court sitting around a table writing a budget \nfor the United States, deciding perhaps to raise taxes to balance the \nbudget, deciding they are going to cut funding for transportation or \neducation, deciding what is going to happen that affects America in a \ndisaster, perhaps an earthquake in California or some calamity in \nFlorida. We are going to have unelected judges sit around a table and \ndecide the budget of the United States. Is that really what we are \ngoing to do?\n  I can tell you this, I come from a rural State. I do not think any of \nthose Justices know much about agriculture. I do not think they know \nmuch about farming. I do not think they know much about the cattle \nbusiness. I do not think they know much about rural America at all. \nMost of them are from more populous areas.\n  So I just say there are fatal flaws in this balanced budget amendment \nthat is before us today, and we ought to take steps to improve it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I believe that we have special order time \nfor 12:30 to 1?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. THOMAS. We will expect several more of my associates here, but I \nwill begin that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/10/senate-section/article/S1147-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1148-S1151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. It is interesting to stand here beside these budgets that \nhave gone on for 26 years--this is less than that--and to then have to \nsay we have not balanced the budget in all that time. Yet, we hear \nconstantly that we do not need to do anything differently than we have \nbeen doing. It is hard to imagine that you are going to have different \nresults if you do not do something different.\n  I was interested in the comments of the Senator from North Dakota. \nEach of us has a little different idea about what has happened and what \nhas occurred in terms of economics. Each of us has a little different \nidea about why we made some progress over the last several years in \nreducing the deficit. Certainly one reason is we raised taxes so that \nthe average payment of taxes in this country is now about 40 percent of \nthe income to families. You can balance the budget that way if you want \nto continue to let Government grow. Continue to raise taxes; that is a \nway to balance the budget. That is partly what this whole discussion is \nabout.\n  Interestingly enough, the Senator talked about the balanced budget \namendment looting Social Security. I was going to ask the Senator, if \nhe was still here, whether Social Security income is in the budget that \nhe talks about that the President is going to balance by 2003. Of \ncourse it is there. All the trust funds are there that he says you \ncannot put into a balanced budget amendment. They are in the budget \nthat the Senator brags about balancing. If you took the Social Security \nout of it, by that time you would have to raise $700 billion additional \nto do that. This is a unified budget.\n  So, it is interesting how we seem to have different views. I guess if \nwe did not have different views, why, there would not be any discussion \nabout this. We would either do it or not. Basically, one of the \ndifferences, I think, between those of us here who want to have a \nbalanced budget amendment to ensure that we, in fact, in the future \nhave a balanced budget and have fiscal responsibility is whether you \nwant more and more Government or whether you want a balanced budget to \nhave something to do with holding down the size of Government and the \nincrease in taxes. That is the choice. If you are going to use the \nbalanced budget amendment simply to grow, and use the balanced budget, \nas the President has this year, to have an increase in spending by $1.5 \ntrillion, then that is a choice. The other choice is to allow families \nto have more of their own money and spend it as they choose, to have a \nsmaller central Government and move some of those activities to local \ngovernments, to States and counties. So that is the decision.\n  It has been, I think, a most interesting discussion. Of course, the \nbudget is, I think, the key to what we do here. Obviously, there are \nmany other things that the Government must do and that the Congress \nmust do and the administration must do, but it all pretty much turns \naround what you do with the budget. The budget is a guideline of where \nyou go, what your priorities are, what your spending is. It is also a \nguideline of your idea of how large Government is, as opposed to a \nreduced size Government. It has to do with how much tax you intend to \nlevy. So the budget is the key to where we have been. We talked about \nit for years and will continue to, I suppose, forever. It has a great \ndeal to do with what you believe is the responsibility of this Congress \nand the responsibility of the Government, and the responsibility of you \nand me, Mr. President, to establish a spending pattern in which we are \nresponsible for the spending we incur and not pass it on to all of our \nchildren and on to future generations, which is precisely what we have \ndone now.\n  I hear some on the TV saying, ``Well, a balanced budget isn't that \nimportant. The deficit really isn't that important.'' The interest \npayment on the deficit this year will be about $250 billion, almost as \nmuch as defense. It will soon be more than defense. If it continues as \nprojected, it will be $330 billion a year out of the budget to pay \ninterest on the debt. So it is important. It has to do with \nresponsibility.\n  The Senator from North Dakota mentioned Jefferson. Jefferson had a \nstrong feeling about budgets. Let me quote from the desk of Thomas \nJefferson:\n\n       I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our \n     Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for \n     the reduction of the administration of our Government. I mean \n     an additional article taking from the Federal Government the \n     power of borrowing.\n\n  Thomas Jefferson said if you are going to use it, you ought to pay \nfor it. And certainly he's exactly right.\n  I think we need to look at the benefits of having a balanced budget. \nWe have talked about it a great deal. It is not just a benefit to the \ncountry, it is not just a benefit to the economy, it is a benefit to \nyou and me in our lives.\n  It's a benefit to you and me in what we have to pay to do the things \nwe have to do. On an $80,000 mortgage, the savings per year with a \nbalanced budget amendment with a reduction in interest could be $1,272 \nfor the average family. On a $15,000 car loan, monthly payments would \nbe reduced by 200 bucks. It's a real benefit for us, as well as being \nthe financially and morally responsible thing to do.\n  Some say, ``Just do it, we don't need an amendment.'' Good idea. The \nevidence, however, is that that is not the case. The evidence is that \nwe have talked about it for 26 years, through good times and bad. We \nsay, ``Well, you have to leave it flexible enough for emergencies.'' I \ncertainly agree with that, and this balanced budget amendment has that \nprovision. But we have done it through good times and bad. We\n\n[[Page S1149]]\n\nhave wanted to spend more than we have been willing to pay in, and \nthat's what it is about.\n  We say, ``Just do it.'' I don't think there is any question but what \nthe President's budget doesn't just do it. The President's budget \ndoesn't get us there. The President's budget doesn't balance the budget \nover a period of time.\n  Really, there is very little reason to oppose a balanced budget \namendment. There are a number of reasons that are given, a number of \nexcuses that are given. Social Security is one. Almost everyone who \nlooks at it says, if you want to save Social Security, it needs to be \npart of the integrated budget. Right now, there is a surplus in Social \nSecurity. We know there will not be later, and we will have to make \nthat accommodation.\n  If you take Social Security out of it, I wonder how many things will \nbe put into the Social Security Program by the Congress so they would \nbe off budget. We have been through that before. We have seen that \nhappen before.\n  Oversight by the court? How many States are there that have a \nbalanced budget amendment of some kind? There are 40, I believe. We do \nin Wyoming in my home State. The court's job is to say if you haven't \nbalanced the budget in terms of revenues equaling expenditures, then \nyou fix it. That is the authority that they should have.\n  An emergency? It provides for an emergency with 60 votes, a \nsupermajority. If we have an emergency, 60 votes would not be hard to \nget.\n  Mr. President, I think we will be going forward for some time now, \nfor a couple of weeks, talking about the balanced budget amendment, \ntalking about the benefits that it has to this country, the benefits \nthat it has to American families. And I am hopeful that we have now \ncome to the position where we will say, ``Look, let's pass this \namendment, send this amendment to the States, and three-quarters of the \nStates will have to ratify it.'' I believe there is strong feeling \namong the American people, that among all things, we ought to be \nfinancially and fiscally responsible, that we ought not to pass on \nthese debts to our offspring.\n  So, Mr. President, a number of us have come to the floor this morning \nto talk about that. I believe very strongly that it is the responsible \nthing to do. I believe that the amendments that we will have are not \ndesigned to strengthen our responsibility but, indeed, to kill the \namendment so that there will not be the constant of fiscal \nresponsibility applied to our future budgeting. And, therefore, I feel \nvery strongly that it ought to pass.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share some of those thoughts. I now \nyield to my friend, the Senator from Iowa, for 10 minutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nWyoming. He has made very clear the need for this amendment. Most \nimportantly, he has stressed what can legitimately be stressed on the \nfloor of this body: that the political laboratories of our American \nsystem of Government, our State governments and our State legislatures \nhave had much success with constitutional requirements for a balanced \nbudget, making those State legislatures, be they controlled by liberals \nor by more conservative people, have a sounder fiscal policy, and a \nsounder spending policy than what we have had in the U.S. Congress. \nThis is all due to the fact that each one of those State legislators \ntakes an oath to uphold the laws and the constitution of their State, \nand when those respective constitutions require a balanced budget, they \nare carrying out their duty, not only to be fiscally sound, but also \ncarrying out a constitutional mandate that they swore to uphold.\n  So those of us who support a constitutional amendment suggest that we \nneed the fiscal discipline that will come from a constitutional \namendment, which would not be necessary if the Members of the Congress \nin the last quarter century had been as responsible as the Members of \nCongress in the first 175-year history of our country. During that \nperiod of time, except during wartime, we had balanced budgets, in a \nmajority of the cases, and had just a general understanding that it was \nour responsibility for a present generation to live within its income \nand not put off, as we have been doing for the last quarter of a \ncentury, the debt to children and grandchildren.\n  We are at it again in 1997, like we have in most of the recent \nCongresses, trying to get just one or two more votes to pass a \nconstitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, which takes a \ntwo-thirds vote. When you are one or two votes short of, over the last \ndecade, getting it passed, that means that the vast majority of the \nMembers of this body feel it necessary to amend the Constitution but, \nquite frankly, coming up just a few votes--last year, just one vote--\nshort of the required two-thirds vote to pass it.\n  So all of the hue and cry that you hear from the other side, from the \nopponents of this approach of amending the Constitution to require a \nbalanced budget, represents a minority of this body, a small minority \nof this body, just a third or just a little over a third. This year we \nhope that the opponents are just a little bit less than a third, so we \nget the two-thirds necessary to pass it.\n  These are the diehards who still believe that it's fine for us to \nspend in our generation and let our children and grandchildren pick up \nthe bill for our living high on the hog.\n  We have heard several concerns which have been raised by the \nopponents of a balanced budget amendment, and I believe that these \nconcerns are simply a mask for the opposition to the balanced budget \namendment. I want to address those concerns.\n  First of all, some in Congress have argued that the balanced budget \namendment would result in the Federal courts becoming heavily involved \nin the budgetary process that was meant by our constitutional writers \nto be a legislative prerogative. It is my firm belief that such a \nconcern is completely unwarranted. It is just another excuse not to \nenact a balanced budget amendment, which the American people want by \nhuge margins, and which will force fiscal discipline on those who are \nmaking this argument against this constitutional amendment. Experience \nhas shown that the Federal courts are very reluctant to enter into the \nbudgetary issues and the political controversies.\n  In order for Federal courts to hear a case, the person filing a \nlawsuit must have what lawyers call ``standing to sue.'' That is, the \nperson must show that he or she has suffered a unique injury resulting \nfrom the balanced budget amendment and that this injury can be \ncorrected by the Federal courts. If the person suing the Government \ncannot meet these requirements, then he or she has no standing and the \ncourt will not hear the case.\n\n  For several reasons, I believe that it is unlikely that the courts \nwould determine such a person has standing to bring a case under the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  The courts are very strict in insisting that standing requirements be \nmet by citizens who wish to sue the Government. In case after case, the \nFederal courts have refused to permit citizens to challenge Government \naction solely on the basis of being a taxpayer. Therefore, there is \nabsolutely no reason to fear a flood of litigation over the \nimplementation of the balanced budget amendment.\n  The most important reason I do not expect to see a flood of Federal \ncases is that once the balanced budget amendment is passed and \nratified, Congress, taking the oath to uphold the Constitution, will \nnaturally abide by it. With the force of a constitutional amendment \nmandating fiscal responsibility, we will be obligated to produce a \nbalanced budget. By obeying the constitutional law, there will be no \nreason for any citizen to take Government to court.\n  Having seen such an amendment work in my home State of Iowa, I am \nconfident that it will force us here in Washington to be disciplined in \nour spending. In my view, the courts will have no need to become \ninvolved in the budget.\n  Clearly, the balanced budget amendment does not provide any basis for \nthe court to micromanage the budget process, as has been indicated by \nthe opponents of this amendment. Without mentioning the issue of \njudicial review, the sponsors of the resolution have refused to give \ncongressional sanction to the courts to involve themselves in the\n\n[[Page S1150]]\n\nbudgetary decisions. I believe that explicitly putting language on the \nissue of judicial review in the balanced budget amendment implies that \nthe Federal courts might have power that we do not intend them to have \nand that they should not have.\n  Furthermore, should there be any unwarranted infringement in the \nprocess by the Federal courts, which, as I have stated, is highly \nunlikely, the Congress has the right, under article III of the \nConstitution, going back for 200 some years, to limit the Federal \ncourts' jurisdiction.\n  Another baseless concern which has been raised regarding the balanced \nbudget amendment is that it will allow the President to impound funds. \nAgain, this is simply false. There is nothing in the balanced budget \namendment giving the President new powers in the budget process. He \nmust submit a balanced budget to the Congress. But beyond that, his \nrole is not changed in any way.\n  In fact, the balanced budget amendment reaffirms the Supreme Court's \nruling that the President is required to faithfully execute the law and \nto spend funds as directed by statute. The President therefore does not \nhave impoundment authority over the Social Security trust fund since he \nmust spend it.\n  Arguments against the balanced budget amendment on the grounds that \nit gives the President some new impoundment powers are simply \nunfounded. So, Mr. President, I think we can conclude that it is now \ntime to pass this amendment. The American people are tired of all the \nexcuses we have been hearing from a small minority of people who oppose \namending the Constitution to force fiscal discipline upon the Congress. \nThey know that we have to impose fiscal discipline on Washington if we \nare to preserve the American dream for future generations of our young \npeople.\n  The American people are smart enough to know the empty excuses that \nhave been heard today, and particularly those involving the courts, are \nmere delaying tactics meant to derail the balanced budget amendment.\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we cannot \nallow ourselves to lose our focus on the major purpose of the balanced \nbudget amendment--putting an end to the Federal deficit and keeping the \nbudget balanced in the future. Let us keep our eyes on the ball and not \nbe distracted or deterred by phony arguments. Senate Joint Resolution 1 \nhas been carefully considered and analyzed by its supporters on both \nsides of the aisle. We must not allow a vocal minority and narrow \npartisan concerns to derail this critically important legislation and \nput the American dream in jeopardy. I say we need to send the balanced \nbudget amendment to the States and let the American people decide.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of passage of the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1. When we \nvote on Senator Durbin's amendment later today, I will urge my \ncolleagues to oppose that measure.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Illinois seeks to skirt the three-\nfifths majority vote required by Senate Joint Resolution 1 to approve \nthe deficit. This gaping hole would give Congress the ability to knock \nthe teeth out of the constitutional amendment with a simple majority \nvote. The three-fifths requirement was placed in the balanced budget \namendment so that Congress could not run deficits except during times \nof war or serious threat.\n  The Durbin amendment adds two additional situations and neglects to \ndefine them. In addition, it overrides the desire of a balanced budget \nby three-fourths of the States which would be necessary for the \namendment's ratification. Senator Durbin's amendment gives Congress \nexcuses for not balancing the budget. The American people are tired of \nexcuses coming from Washington.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to comment on the attacks \nthat have been continued and have increased in intensity against this \ncommonsense amendment.\n  Our opponents are conjuring up fatalistic and doomsday predictions \nabout the future with their crystal balls. They are right to be \nconcerned about a possible economic recession and the insolvency of our \nSocial Security system. But they are wrong about the cause and the \nsolution. If we fail to control our future, it will control us. We need \nto fear the future only if we fail to pass this amendment.\n  If there were only one social injustice in America today, it would be \nthe mountain of debt we are leaving to our kids, grandkids, and those \nnot yet old enough to vote today. An inheritance of debt is a cruel \nlegacy. They will be left to wonder if we failed to remember the \nRevolutionary battle cry, ``No taxation without representation.''\n  Congressman J.C. Watts stated in his recent speech:\n\n       If things continue as they are, by the time [those people] \n     are 25, the tax they could pay will be about 84 cents on the \n     dollar. That's more than a shame. It's a scandal.\n\n  I concur. Let us quit cosigning on our kids' behalf without their \nconsent.\n  The opponents of the balanced budget constitutional amendment say \nthat some of us consider the Constitution to be a draft. I need to \nremind those opponents that the Constitution is being amended on a very \nregular basis without a majority vote each time it is amended by the \njudicial courts.\n  Opponents of the amendment also use the argument that it would be \nunconstitutional. I have never heard anyone declare a provision in the \nConstitution as unconstitutional. How could that be possible? Think \nabout it.\n  Senate Joint Resolution 1 has wide bipartisan support. That is the \nonly way we could get 62 original cosponsors to the amendment. The \npresent administration has stated working together is the key to \naction. I wholeheartedly agree. We should not care who gets the credit \nfor balancing the budget, Republicans or Democrats, Congress or the \nPresident, as long as it gets done.\n  This is something that the administration pays lip service to, but \nthen proclaimed an all-out war on the balanced budget amendment even \nthough they submitted a proposal just a few days ago stuffed and \noverstuffed with new Government programs that we cannot afford.\n  The President's budget purportedly brings the budget into balance by \nthe year 2002. He has front-loaded his budget proposals with catchy, \npretty little initiatives tied up in illusory little bows.\n  Mr. President, you cannot fill a leaking bucket from a dry well. \nAmericans must know that long after this President has left office, \nCongress will no longer be able to avoid the mess. Tax hikes loom large \non the horizon for many Americans in 2002 under President Clinton's \nplan--the exact year that the budget amendment might take effect.\n  The administration has declared war on the will of the American \npeople as well. Let us take a look at some recent numbers from a CBS \npoll released February 4, 1997. When the American people were asked the \nquestion, ``Do you favor a balanced budget amendment?'' 76 percent of \nthose polled said ``yes.'' But when they were asked if the Federal \nbudget would be balanced by 2002, 84 percent said no. This tells me the \nAmerican people do not believe that the political leaders of today have \nthe will to pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment. This \nlack of will is what creates cynicism and apathy in the American \npeople.\n  Why don't we just give the individual States the opportunity to \nratify the balanced budget amendment? Three-fourths of the States have \nto pass it before it becomes part of the Constitution. That is a tough \ntest. We need to give the States this opportunity to force the Federal \nGovernment to come to grips with its finances just as the State \ngovernments are required to do. I found the best decisions are made \nclosest to the people. The American people know best how a decision \nmade here in Washington will affect them and their daily lives. Giving \nthe States the opportunity to ratify the amendment would bring the \nbudget closer to the people.\n  The administration likes playing the underdog, hoping to get sympathy \nvotes against the amendment. They are insisting this could do severe \ndamage to some important Government programs and the economy. This is \nshown by the proposed budget for fiscal years 1998 through fiscal year \n2002.\n  The President's plan sets up Congress and future administrations to \ndo the heavy lifting. If we are to balance the\n\n[[Page S1151]]\n\nbudget by 2002, drastic cuts in programs will have to be made in the 2 \nyears after the President leaves office. The President's proposed \nbudget acknowledges that the deficit will increase, from about $107 \nbillion in 1996 to $121 billion in 1998. That is not responsible and \ncourageous leadership for next year, let alone the next 50 years. \nResponsible leadership requires the tough decisions to be made now, \ninstead of continuing to ignore the problem and forcing future leaders \nto balance the budget when a slower economy may make it more difficult \nto get it done.\n  As the late Senator Paul Tsongas said, ``There are a lot of votes in \ndeficit spending. There are no votes in fiscal discipline.'' Former \nSenator Paul Simon also said, ``People in public office like to do \npopular things, and there is no popular way to balance the budget.'' To \nthese two highly esteemed former Democrat Senators, a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment is the only guarantee to fiscal discipline. It \nwould require Congress and the President to make some unpopular, but \ndesperately needed actions to control Federal spending. If we have the \nbest economy in the post-World-War II era, why can't we balance the \nbudget in fiscal year 1999, and make the necessary cuts now, instead of \nlater when uncertainty of the future economic condition is greater.\n  I challenge the Members of this body and the President of this great \nNation to balance the budget now, while the economy is growing. This \nwould cause the economy to flourish even more, reducing interest rates \nand guaranteeing investors that a balanced budget will occur. It is \nalso Social Security's only hope.\n  The Federal Government should be in the business of doing a few \nthings well, instead of many things poorly. Our Federal budget is \npockmarked with programs that do not work as intended, whose missions \nare obsolete, and have grown out of control. The balanced budget \namendment would force the Government to prioritize programs, and then \nperform with better results. The American people have always been \nfearful of an overly intrusive and powerful Federal Government.\n  There is still a certain amount of anti-federalism in each of us. The \nnatural response to the constraints put on Government by this amendment \nwould be a limited government. This leads me to point out the \nadvantages of a biennial budget. A biennial budget would complement the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment by allowing Congress to spend \nmore time ironing out the details of a budget. A biennial budget would \nalso allow Congress more time for oversight, making sure the various \nagencies and departments are effectively, accurately, and honestly \nperforming their mission. It would also allow longer range planning by \nthe Federal agencies, and State and local governments. The current \nannual budget and budget reconciliation process causes shortsighted \nplanning. A biennial budget would allow more time for Congress to \nprioritize the agencies' and departments' functions.\n  American essayist, Artemus Ward said, ``It ain't the things we don't \nknow that hurt us--It's the things we do know that ain't so.'' I am \ntalking about capital budgeting. A few opponents of the amendment have \ncalled for capital budgeting. As the U.S. Senate's only accountant, I \ncan tell you that you are not being told the whole story.\n  It is misleading to speak about the need for a capital budget at \nthe Federal level, as though it is an idea which has been championed \nfor some time in this Chamber. It is being used solely as a means to \nconfuse the issue on the appropriateness of the balanced budget \namendment. The comparison has been made to the practice in State \nbudgeting of separating capital and operating expenses, and paying for \ncapital improvements through the method of issuing debt. The Federal \nbudget has even been compared to the family budget and a home mortgage.\n\n  There are some distinctions which need to be made with the practice \nof sound capital budgeting in our States and homes and what has \noccurred here. First, a plan must be in place to replace or expand \nfacilities and equipment based on its reasonable economic life. I would \nquestion whether or not the Federal Government even has an inventory of \nour existing facilities and equipment, let alone a plan for its \nreplacement or expansion.\n  Second, both the States and our families borrow with a purpose, and \nwith the full intent and capability of repayment of both the interest \nand the principal over a fixed period. The annual cost of this debt \nrepayment is included within the annual budget. We not only lack a \ncapital budget, we incur debt for day-to-day expenses. No State or \nfamily, if it hopes to remain solvent, incurs debt for the cost of \noperations or day-to-day living with the intent of only paying the \ninterest.\n  This is exactly what we have been doing since 1969. Given the \naffinity of the Federal Government to borrow for normal day-to-day \nliving, I can only guess at the problems we could generate if we were \nto create additional debt to finance capital improvements. It is a \nreasonable premise of borrowing that you don't loan money to a person \nwho has shown that they cannot be trusted to repay what they already \nowe.\n  I will conclude with the famous words of Benjamin Franklin: ``Work \nwhile it is called today, for you know not how much you may be hindered \ntomorrow. One today is worth two tomorrows; never leave that till \ntomorrow which you can do today.'' Now is the time for hard work and \nseriousness.\n  We must pass the balanced budget constitutional amendment. I urge all \nAmericans to write or call your Representatives and Senators and tell \nthem to pass the balanced budget amendment now. No more excuses--the \nfuture of our children and grandchildren and parents and grandparents \nis at stake.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/10/senate-section/article/S1148-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1151-S1152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DAIRY FARMERS AND MILK PRICING\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the dairy farmers of northeastern \nPennsylvania, and for that matter the entire State of Pennsylvania, and \nfor that matter the entire Nation, are suffering very materially \nbecause of low milk prices. It is a national calamity, where dairy \nfarmers all across the country are facing the prospect of bankruptcy \nbecause the costs of producing milk have risen so tremendously and the \nprice of selling milk has decreased very rapidly in the course of the \npast several weeks and several months.\n  Because of this emergency state, Senator Santorum and I and others on \nthe Pennsylvania delegation and really others in the Congress have been \ntaking a close look at what is happening on the pricing of milk. This \nmorning, the Secretary of Agriculture, Daniel Glickman, accepted the \ninvitation from Senator Santorum and I and others in the Pennsylvania \ndelegation to travel to Keystone College, located on the outskirts of \nScranton, PA, to meet with and to hear the concerns of farmers. We had \na very large crowd, hundreds of people. I am reluctant to say quite how \nmany until I read tomorrow morning's newspapers, perhaps as many as \n1,000 farmers.\n  At that time, we heard the economic plight of the farmers in very \ngraphic and very emphatic terms. The highlight of the meeting occurred \nwhen a woman named Mrs. Swetter made the point, very, very \nemphatically, about the imminent difficulties faced by the farmers and \nhow answers were needed now. This Mrs. Patricia Swetter made that point \nwith special gusto, as did quite a number of the other farmers who \nspoke at the hearing.\n  Secretary Glickman responded that there would be an effort made to do \nwhat was possible now but commented about the difficulties of an \nimmediate solution. That prompted a discussion on one point which I \nthink has the prospect of doing something immediately, and that is \ndelinking the price established by the Cheese Exchange out of Green \nBay, WI, and have the Secretary of Agriculture develop an equivalent \nprice for cheese.\n  Now, some may wonder why the talk of a price for cheese on the \ndiscussion of a price of milk. The reason is that the price of cheese \nis a very key component in establishing the price of milk. For every 10 \ncents on an increase in the price of cheese, the price of milk goes up \n$1 per hundredweight. There have been some indicators that the price of \ncheese is not accurate as it has been currently established. The \nSecretary responded in a dialog that a\n\n[[Page S1152]]\n\nnumber of us had--the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Glickman, the \nfarmers who were there, myself--that he would be willing to work now to \ndevelop an equivalent price of cheese, so that we could have a \nreevaluation as to the price of milk. There has been some indication \nthat there has been some manipulation of the price of cheese. It may be \nthat this is a subject which ought to be a matter for a hearing by the \nJudiciary Antitrust Subcommittee. It may also be that there ought to be \na hearing from the Agriculture Subcommittee of Appropriations, or from \nthe Agriculture Committee, on the pricing of milk, taking a close look \nat the issue of developing an equivalent price for cheese.\n\n  I intend, Mr. President, to submit to the Senate a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution to urge and/or direct the Secretary of Agriculture to \nmove promptly on this issue of the price of cheese, with a view to \nhaving some immediate modification on the price of milk. Secretary of \nAgriculture Glickman has stated his willingness to do so, recognizing \nthe plight of the farmers but, obviously, requiring a sufficient \nevidentiary base to be able to make that modification.\n  So we are in the process now--my staff and I started in mid-morning--\nto try to make the determination as to the price of cheese in America, \nbecause the price established by the so-called Green Bay Cheese \nExchange is about one-half of 1 percent, and may well not--in fact, \nprobably does not--reflect the price of cheese across the country.\n  When we talk about helping the farmer, we talk about a great many \nitems. We talk about increasing exports, which we are working on \nsystematically, we talk about programs to increase cheese consumption \nat schools on programs purchased by the Federal Government. But the \nissue of milk pricing is something which requires our attention now.\n  It is true that the Secretary of Agriculture has a second track to \nchange the price of cheese under a procedure that calls for public \nhearings and inputs, but that doesn't eliminate the basic authority. \nThe Secretary of Agriculture explained to me that he does have the \npower to go on a separate track and to unilaterally delete the price of \ncheese from the Cheese Exchange and to establish an equivalent price \nfor cheese. That is a matter we are pursuing, and I think a sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution would be a very substantial impetus to move that \nprocess along.\n  So I thank the Secretary for coming to northeastern Pennsylvania.

In an era when nearly half of all couples married today \nwill see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both \ninstructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment \nof ``till death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the \ntimeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics \nmake our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Wilford and Jerry \nAcker of Weaubleau, MO who on May 10, 1997, will celebrate their 50th \nwedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we \ncan celebrate a similar milestone.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 1.\n  The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution, S.J. Res. 1, proposing an amendment to \n     the Constitution of the United States to require a balanced \n     budget.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n\n       Pending:\n       Durbin Amendment No. 2, to allow for the waiver of the \n     article in the event of an economic recession or serious \n     economic emergency with a majority in both houses of \n     Congress.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak in \nfavor of the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, this amendment has come up repeatedly during my tenure \nin the U.S. Senate, and I have consistently supported the balanced \nbudget amendment because of my deep-seated view that the Congress needs \nthis discipline if we are to balance the budget on a permanent basis. \nIt is a very fundamental principle that people ought to live within \ntheir means--if you or I do not, we end up in the bankruptcy court--and \nthat governmental entities must live within their means. The only \nexception to this issue of living within one's means has been the \nGovernment of the United States of America, which goes into further \ndebt each year with deficits of $100 billion or $200 billion, or more, \nestablishing a national debt in excess of $5 trillion.\n  This issue came into sharp focus for me recently when my wife and I \nwere blessed with two grandchildren. We would certainly never think of \nimposing our financial obligations on our grandchildren, or spending \nmoney on their credit cards for them to pay at some later date. But \nthat is precisely what we have done as a society. We have undertaken a \nvariety of methods to try to move toward a balanced budget with Gramm-\nRudman and the so-called automatic sequestrations. That did not work. \nNothing has worked, which is why I believe, in the final analysis, we \nneed to move to the balanced budget amendment.\n  We had the vote last year, coming within one vote of having the \namendment pass. The President is opposed to the balanced budget \namendment. But I do believe that just the pendency of the amendment has \nbeen a very substantial impetus moving the administration, the \nPresident, and the Congress to balance the budget without a \nconstitutional amendment.\n\n[[Page S1153]]\n\n  President Clinton has laid before the Congress and the country what \nhe submits is a plan to balance the budget by the year 2002. But the \nreality is, upon looking at the fine print, that it is unlikely to \nachieve that result because most of the cuts are in the last 2 years. \nWhen we come to that point, there is the inevitable impetus to \neliminate those cuts. But to the extent that the pendency of the \nbalanced budget amendment will move us to balance the budget without an \namendment, that is so much to the good. Ideally, it would be preferable \nif we could balance the budget without having a constitutional \namendment. But regrettably, that has not been our experience.\n  It is always difficult to turn down worthwhile programs for Federal \nGovernmental expenditures, and it is very, very difficult, painful, and \nreally, at the present time, impossible to have tax increases with a \nCongress that is controlled by the Republicans and, I think, properly \ndeclining to even entertain tax increases. So when we do have the \nmandate of a balanced budget, it is apparent to everyone--it is \napparent to all 535 Members of Congress, and it is apparent to our \nconstituents. How frequently have we all heard the cry or the comment \nof a constituent coming to see us, ``I have a very important program \nthat is meritorious and ought to be financed,'' and, at the same time, \ninsisting that the taxes not go up and that the budget be balanced?\n  I think it is important, Mr. President, as we go over this balanced \nbudget amendment, that we allow sufficient flexibility for our \nGovernment to respond in times of crises or emergency. I share the \nconcern that the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, \nhas expressed in offering his amendment. But I think that the \nunderlying resolution covers the problem in the appropriate way by \ncalling for a supermajority, or 60 votes, in order to waive the \nprovisions of the balanced budget in the event that there is a \nrecession, an economic crisis, which requires that. Therefore, I intend \nto vote against the Durbin amendment.\n  There has been very considerable comment about whether Social \nSecurity ought to be excluded from the balanced budget amendment. After \nvery considerable thought, Mr. President, it is my conclusion that \nSocial Security should be excluded. I say that notwithstanding my \nrecognition of the problems there will be to balance the budget now if \nwe exclude Social Security. But I submit that it is an artificial way \nof balancing the budget, which says that we ought to make expenditures \nwhich are not in excess of our income if we include Social Security, \nbecause those funds really are a trust fund to pay Social Security \nrecipients at a later day. So what we are doing is saying we are going \nto spend more money, which we really can't afford now, by invading the \ntrust fund, and we will put off for tomorrow what we are not willing to \nface up to today, to find a way to pay the Social Security recipients \nwhen the due date arises.\n  We know very well that the so-called baby boomers will present a \ncharge on the Social Security trust fund at a later date--2020--which \nwe will be unable to pay unless we find some way to raise taxes or some \nway to make other cuts which are unrealistic in the context of what we \nmight expect at that time. It may be that in crafting a balanced budget \namendment, excluding Social Security, we will have to implement it on a \nschedule which is realistic which will account for excluding those \nsurplus funds at the present time. But when we talked about Social \nSecurity initially we were talking about an insurance fund concept. We \nwere talking about setting aside the money in a way where it would be \nthere to pay those benefits at the time when one reached the age for \nSocial Security.\n  So that it is my very, very strong view that as a matter of sound \nfinancing that Social Security ought to be excluded. And this body has \nresponded on many occasions when that issue has been presented. My late \ncolleague, Senator John Heinz, was one of the major exponents for \ntaking Social Security offbudget--not the only exponent but I recall \nthe eloquent speeches which he made. And I recall many sense-of-the-\nSenate resolutions where we talked about putting Social Security \noffbudget because it is a trust fund.\n  I remember well during the tenure of James Baker, the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, when there was an unusual invasion of the trust fund. I \ntook the floor at that time and made a comment that there was really a \nfraudulent conversion which I believed was the case, and have \nanalogized it to my experience as district attorney of Philadelphia \nwhen there was a trust fund and a fraudulent conversion. The people who \ntook the money out of that trust fund were guilty of a criminal offense \nbecause, if it is set aside for a specific purpose and the trustee \ninvades the fund for some purpose other than for which it was intended, \nthat is a conversion and an invasion.\n  So while I believe very strongly that we ought to have a balanced \nbudget amendment, I think if it is to be realistic and not a double set \nof books that Social Security ought to be kept offbudget.\n  Mr. President, I think that in constructing a timetable for a \nbalanced budget amendment it is entirely possible to accommodate to the \nlesser amount of income which we have from Social Security payments in \norder to see to it that our current income aside from Social Security \npayments matches our current expenses, and that is the only way to \ntruly have a balanced budget which I think we ought to have. And an \namendment is the way to impose the discipline to be sure we will have \nit for the future.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his willingness to \nlead off in our efforts to pass the balanced budget amendment. \nNaturally, I disagree with him on the Social Security issue. But I know \nthat he is a person of eminent qualification and one who does what he \nbelieves is right.\n  I have had many years of opportunity to know the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania, and I have a lot of respect for him.\n  Mr. President, today we begin the second week of one of the most \nimportant debates that has ever taken place in the U.S. Senate. The \nsubject matter goes to the heart of the Founding Fathers' hope for our \nconstitutional system--a system that would protect individual freedoms \nwith the maxim of limited government.\n  In the latter half of this century, however, the intentions of the \nFramers of the Constitution have been betrayed by multiple Congress' \ninability to control their spending habits. The size of the Federal \nleviathan has grown to such an extent that the very liberties of the \nAmerican people are threatened.\n  Like some of the provisions of the Constitution, the proposed \nconstitutional amendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, is an appropriate \naddition to constitutional limits on the powers of the Federal \nGovernment designed to increase the freedom of the people by limiting \nthe freedom of the Federal Government to act in ways that are harmful \nto the people. It is identical to the balanced budget amendment that \nwas passed by the House of Representatives in the last Congress. A \nnumber of our new Members voted for it at that time. It has broad \nsupport in the country and among Democrats and Republicans in that we \nneed to ensure a sound fiscal discipline in our budgeting process in \norder to leave a legacy of a strong national economy and a responsible \nnational Government to our children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, our Nation is faced with a $5.3 trillion--going to \n$5.4 trillion--national debt that gets worse every year that we run \nbudgetary deficits. The Government is using capital that would \notherwise be available to the private sector to create jobs, and to \ninvest in the future of this country. Increasing amounts of capital are \nbeing wasted on merely financing the debt because of spiraling interest \ncosts. This problem presents risks to our long-term economic growth and \nendangers the well-being of our elderly, our working people, and \nespecially our children and grandchildren. The debt burden is a \nmortgage on our children's and our grandchildren's future.\n  The total debt now stands at almost $5.3 trillion. By the end of this \ndebate it may very well reach $5.4 trillion. That means every American, \nevery man, woman, and child in this country has an individual debt \nburden of about $20,000 per person. It took us over 200\n\n[[Page S1154]]\n\nyears to acquire our first trillion dollars of debt. We have been \nrecently adding another $1 trillion to our debt about every 5 years. \nWhile the trends on this front seem to be better, the fact is we are \nstill running sizable deficits every year. And, unless we take prompt \nand decisive action, those deficits will continue to rise again this \nyear, next year, and year after year. In fact, if you look at the \nPresident's budget, he even waits until he is out of office before they \nhave to make the tough decisions to really balance the budget by the \nyear 2002.\n  Yet, Mr. President, opponents of the balanced budget amendment claim \nthat there is no problem. They repeatedly point to the marginal \nslowdown in growth in debt over the past few years as though all our \nproblems are solved. They say President Clinton has already dealt with \nthis problem.\n  They are dead wrong. Only inside the beltway can people claim that \nwhen the debt is exceeding $5 trillion and still on the rise that we \nare on the right track. Everyone on Capitol Hill knows and the \nCongressional Budget Office has confirmed that we are currently not on \na glidepath to a balanced budget, or to the balanced budget that the \nPresident may suggest. According to CBO's most recent projections, our \n4 years of declining deficits that followed the enactment of President \nClinton's record-setting 1993 tax hike will come to a grinding halt \nthis year. What lies ahead is a familiar path of steadily increasing \ndeficits rivaling anything we have ever seen before unless we take \naction to put us on the road to long-term fiscal discipline and \nbalanced budgets.\n  As this chart behind me shows, the Congressional Budget \nOffice predicts that under current policies the deficit will begin to \nrise this year and continue to rise throughout the foreseeable future. \nThe Congressional Budget Office projects the deficit will rise to $124 \nbillion in fiscal year 1997 and continue rising to $188 billion in \nfiscal year 2002. The deficits just keep rising until in 2007 our \nannual deficit is projected to be $278 billion. Added up, these \ndeficits will add a total of more than 2 trillion additional dollars to \nthe debt from now--in 1997--until the year 2007.\n\n  There is no balanced budget in this chart. And I have to tell you, I \ndoubt that there ever will be without a balanced budget constitutional \namendment putting the fiscal discipline into the Constitution that will \nrequire us to live within our means. The simple fact is that with every \nadditional dollar that we borrow we throw more coal on the fire of the \nrunaway train that we are all riding on.\n  The sad reality is shown by this stack of unbalanced budget \nsubmissions. The President's budget submission, which promises a path \nto balance in the year 2002, causes me substantial concern that this \npile is just going to keep getting higher.\n  And this only lists the last 28 years of unbalanced budgets since the \nlast balanced budget in 1969. Actually, there have only been eight in \nthe last 66 years. But the last 28 years have all been unbalanced. Each \none of these volumes represents one of those unbalanced budgets during \neach of those 28 years.\n  The sad reality is shown by this stack of unbalanced budget \nsubmissions. The President's budget submission which promises us a path \nto balance in the year 2002 just makes it very clear, if you believe in \nthe Congressional Budget Office projections, that this stack is just \ngoing to grow that much higher over the next number of years.\n  For example, the President's new budget projects a modest surplus in \nthe year 2002 but also requires a 75-percent deficit reduction to get \nthere in the 2 years after he leaves office.\n  Now, get that. Up through the year 2000, this President's budget does \nnot require much sacrifice or much effort to try to balance the budget. \nBut in the years 2001 and 2002, 75 percent of the cuts have to take \nplace, and we all know around here that that is basically impossible to \ndo.\n  So the game continues, the same game we have put up with for 28 \nyears, and it is pathetic, is what it is. This just indicates more of \nthe same status quo, an avoidance of the tough decisions and deferral \nof the costs to the next guy, or should I say to our children.\n  Additionally, the Senate Budget Committee has suggested that \nrecomputing the numbers under CBO's more conservative economic \nassumptions puts the President's budget off balance in the year 2002 to \nthe tune of an additional $66 billion. So the President's budget that \nhe submitted just last week is not going to balance.\n  The point is that we cannot yet congratulate ourselves for a job well \ndone. There is hard work ahead for each of us to do, and there is no \nassurance of success. Based on the sad history illustrated by each of \nthese 28 years of unbalanced budget submissions and the continued \nresistance of the President to take on the tough choices during his \nactual tenure in office, success is in serious doubt.\n  That is one of the reasons why we need a balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment. It has been called an insurance policy that \nwe will get the budget actually balanced in the year 2002 and, more \nimportantly, that we will keep it balanced thereafter.\n  I would also note that it comes as no surprise that these increases \nin our Nation's debt mirror increases in Federal spending. The first \n$100 billion budget in the history of the Nation occurred as recently \nas fiscal year 1962--that was the whole budget--more than 179 years \nafter the founding of our Republic. It took only 9 years for that \nfigure to double, and in just another 6 years Federal spending had \ndoubled again to $400 billion in 1977. I know, I was here. With another \n6 years came another $400 billion increase in the Federal budget, and \nby 1986 our Nation had seen its first $1 trillion annual budget. Today \nwe face an annual budget for fiscal year 1997 projected to exceed $1.6 \ntrillion, as is the case under the budget recently submitted by the \nPresident.\n  The Federal Government's appetite for spending the American people's \nmoney is the engine that has been driving this debt up and up because \nit has been easier to take the money in the form of a hidden tax like \ninterest costs and future taxes, than in the form of a direct tax.\n  One of most pernicious effects of the enormous deficit beast is the \ninterest costs required to feed it. Interest on the public debt in 1996 \namounted to some $344 billion. That is roughly $50 billion more than \ntotal Federal revenues in 1975. In other words, we spent less than $300 \nbillion in 1957. In 1996, just 20 years later, gross interest costs \ntook nearly 25 percent of all Federal revenues and more than half of \nall individual income tax revenue. And as this chart shows, net \ninterest payments on the debt make up the third largest charge of our \nFederal budget.\n  It is the red pie that is taken out of the total pie--the third \nlargest payment in the Federal budget--exceeded only by defense \nspending and Social Security.\n\n  It is really amazing when you look at it: Social Security spending, \n22 percent, defense spending is 18 percent, and net interest is 15 \npercent. And it is going up every year and will go up exponentially \nunless we do something about it. And yet we have the same people around \nhere year after year saying, ``Oh, let us just exercise our will and \nlet us just do it.'' That is what they said for every 1 of these 28 \nyears of these unbalanced budgets, and that is what they will be saying \n10 years from now without any balanced budget, if we do not have the \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  Opponents of the balanced budget amendment suggest that we cannot \nafford to create a constitutional impediment to deficit spending \nbecause they believe that balancing the budget will result in decreased \nsocial spending.\n  I do not personally understand the logic of continuing to waste such \na large portion of our budget on interest on the rationale that we \ncannot afford to cut spending. What we cannot afford to do is continue \nto throw away so much of our budget on interest payments. Think of how \nmuch we could do on crime control, defense, disaster relief, health, \nscience, and education if we had $344 billion available next year \ninstead of paying interest against the national debt with that money.\n  To help my colleagues put this in even better perspective, gross \ninterest on the debt in 1966 amounted to more than the entire defense \nbudget of $266 billion; 99 percent of Social Security payments, $347.1 \nbillion; 64 percent of\n\n[[Page S1155]]\n\nall discretionary outlays, $535.4 billion, and nearly 45 percent of all \nmandatory programs of $784.9 billion.\n  The $334 billion of gross interest payments on the debt in 1996 could \nhave covered our entire health spending, including Medicare and \nMedicaid, that is, $293.6 billion, all veterans-related entitlement \nspending, $18.8 billion, unemployment compensation, $22.6 billion, the \ncost of Federal law enforcement activities of $8 billion, and we would \nstill have $1 billion to spare.\n  Last year, in fact, we spent more money on net interest payments on \nthe debt than we did for the combined budgets of the Department of \nCommerce, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Education, \nthe Department of Energy, the Department of Justice, the Department of \nthe Interior, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the \nDepartment of Labor, the Department of State, and the Department of \nTransportation. Just think about that.\n  Interest on the debt is the fastest growing item in the annual \nFederal budget. According to the current Congressional Budget Office \nprojections, gross interest on the debt will continue to rise \nsubstantially over the next 5 years from $360 billion in 1997, to $412 \nbillion by 2002, and by 2007 just the interest on the debt is projected \nto be $493 billion.\n  If we keep going like we are, we are going to be paying almost \neverything on interest that could be used to solve a lot of problems in \nour society. This $495 billion is just $50 billion shy of our entire \ndiscretionary budget for the current fiscal year.\n  Over the past 4 years of short-lived deficit reduction, we have paid \nroughly $1.3 trillion in interest on the public debt. That is more than \nthe Federal Government took in during all of 1994. Without the gross \ninterest on the debt, we would not have had a deficit in 1996. In fact, \nwe would have run a budget surplus of $237 billion.\n  But we cannot even begin to think about reallocating this money to \nmore productive uses until we begin to reduce our debt. If interest \nrates go back up, the problem will be increased exponentially. Self-\npropelled interest costs will continue to eat a larger share of our \nNational Treasury, destroying our choices to fund new programs and \neroding our ability to keep the commitments we have already made. This \nis serious stuff.\n  And even if we are successful in passing a budget this year that will \nbalance our budget by the year 2002, we will never begin to reduce our \ndebt unless we can provide some assurance that such balanced budgets \nwill become the rule rather than the exception. That is what the \nbalanced budget amendment is geared to do.\n  Mr. President, both sides will recite lots of numbers and figures \nduring the course of this debate. One such figure is our current $5.3 \ntrillion national debt. But how does one communicate the implications \nof our staggering debt?\n  In 1975, before this recent borrowing spree, the Federal debt \namounted to approximately $2,500 per person. That was each American's \nshare of it in 1975, and the annual interest charges were roughly $250 \nper taxpayer. At present, the Federal debt amounts to about $20,000 per \nperson, with annual interest charges that each person in this country, \neach man, woman, and child in America, has to pay, totaling nearly \n$1,350 per person, or roughly $2,975 per taxpayer. That is at today's \ninterest rates, which will go even higher if we do not get things under \ncontrol.\n  The Congressional Budget Office predicts that in the year 2002, total \nFederal debt will be more than $6.8 trillion. That means roughly \n$24,000 of debt for every man, woman, and child in America, with annual \ninterest costs projected to be over $3,100 per taxpayer.\n  These last figures would mean a nearly tenfold increase in per-capita \ndebt and a nearly twelvefold increase in annual interest charges per \ntaxpayer since 1975. Over time, the disproportionate burdens imposed on \ntoday's children and their children by a continuing pattern of deficits \ncould include some combination of the following: Increased taxes, \nreduced public welfare benefits, reduced public pensions, reduced \nexpenditures on infrastructure and other public investments, diminished \ncapital formation, diminished job creation, lower productivity \nenhancement and less real wage growth in the private economy, higher \ninterest rates, higher inflation, increased indebtedness to and \neconomic dependence on foreign creditors, and increased risk of default \non our Federal debt.\n  Senator Simon would always make this point: If we keep going like we \nare going, ultimately we are going to have to monetize the debt--that \nis, print cheap money--where it will cost you a bushelful of dollars to \nbuy a loaf of bread like it did in Germany in the 1930's, and then \nwrite off all the debt on cheap dollars. But the United States of \nAmerica as we know it will be gone at that point.\n  Mr. President, this is fiscal child abuse and it must end. But, as I \nindicated earlier, there is no end in sight. After 4 years of declining \ndeficits--financed partly with the largest tax increase in history--we \nhave not reduced our staggering $5.3 trillion national debt 1 penny. We \nhave only slowed the growth in the national debt.\n  More important, as my Republican colleagues and I predicted would \nhappen during the debate on the President's 1993 budget package, the \nCongressional Budget Office now predicts--and if you look at this \nchart--it now predicts that annual deficits will resume their upward \nclimb beginning this year from an annual deficit of $124 billion in \n1997, to $188 billion in the year 2002, and then exceeding $200 billion \nthe next year and reaching a near record $278 billion high in the year \n2007. Even OMB's estimates from the President's newly proposed budget, \nwhich predict lower debt totals than CBO, project that gross Federal \ndebt will top $6.6 trillion, exceeding 66 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct by the year 2002.\n  That means, according to their own estimates, the Clinton \nadministration's self-proclaimed victory in bringing down the deficit \nwill result in an additional $1 trillion or more being added to the \nnational debt between now and the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, we do need to do more. It is time for Congress to pass \nSenate Joint Resolution 1, to permanently restore the fiscal \nenvironment in which the competition between tax spenders and taxpayers \nis a more equal one--one in which spending decisions will once more be \nconstrained by available revenues. The time has come for a solution \nstrong enough that it cannot again be evaded for short-term gain. We \nneed a constitutional requirement to balance our budget. Senate Joint \nResolution 1 is that solution. It is reasonable, enforceable, and \nnecessary to force us to get our fiscal house in order.\n  There are those who oppose the balanced budget amendment because they \nsay that Congress and the President are already committed to balancing \nthe budget by the year 2002. As a matter of rhetoric, that is true; as \na matter of what people say, that is true. But as a matter of real \nworld politics, it is clear that the bridge between such rhetoric and \nreality is a rather long one.\n\n  Since 1978 alone, there have been no fewer than five major statutory \nregimes enacted which promised to deliver balanced budgets. This \nincludes Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. But there has not been a single \nbalanced budget since 1960.\n  Here are the 28 succeeding budgets. In about every one of these it \nwas promised there would be an effort made to balance it, every one of \nwhich is unbalanced right up to today.\n  Notwithstanding all of these budget plans and the five statutory \nattempts to require a balanced budget that I have mentioned, the \nnational debt has increased by roughly $4.5 trillion since 1978. In \nother words, nearly 85 percent of our current national debt has \naccumulated during the period of time in which Congress has operated \nwithin statutory budget frameworks designed to ensure the types of \nfiscal discipline that would be required under Senate Joint Resolution \n1.\n  While I support the efforts of the past and commend the dedication \nexpressed by leaders of both political parties to reaching a balanced \nbudget, I seriously doubt whether, without the weight of a \nconstitutional requirement to balance the budget, we will achieve \nbalance by the year 2002. Even if we did, there is nothing to prevent \nfuture Congresses from yielding to the inherent political\n\n[[Page S1156]]\n\npressures that would lead to renewed deficit spending. We need a \nconstitutional amendment if we are truly committed to solving this \nproblem.\n  Mr. President, the proposed constitutional amendment will help us end \nthis dangerous deficit habit in a way that past efforts have not. It \nwill do this by correcting a bias in the present political process \nwhich favors ever-increasing levels of Federal Government spending.\n  In seeking to reduce spending bias in our present system--fueled \nlargely by the unlimited availability of deficit spending--the major \npurpose of Senate Joint Resolution 1 is to ensure that under normal \ncircumstances, votes by Congress for increased spending will be \naccompanied either by votes, A, to reduce other spending programs or, \nB, to increase taxes to pay for such programs. For the first time since \nthe abandonment of our historical norm of balanced budgets, Congress \nwould be required to cast politically difficult votes as a precondition \nto politically attractive votes to increase spending.\n  The American political process is skewed toward artificially high \nlevels of spending. It is skewed in this direction because Members of \nCongress have every political incentive to spend money and almost no \nincentive to forego such spending. It is a fiscal order in which \nspending decisions have become increasingly divorced from the \navailability of revenues.\n  The balanced budget amendment seeks to restore Government \naccountability for spending and taxing decisions by forcing Congress to \nprioritize spending projects within the available resources and by \nrequiring tax increases to be done on the record with record votes. In \nthis way, Congress will be more accountable to the people who pay for \nthe programs, and the American people, including our future generations \nwho must pay for our debts, will be represented in a way they are not \nnow represented. Congress will be forced to justify its spending and \ntaxing decisions as the Framers intended, but as Congress no longer \ndoes.\n  Senate Joint Resolution 1 represents both responsible fiscal policy \nand responsible constitutional policy. Passage of this resolution would \nconstitute an appropriate response by Congress to the desires of the \npeople and the States for a constitutional amendment on this issue.\n  The Senate must approve Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced \nbudget amendment. It is the right thing to do for ourselves, our \nchildren, our grandchildren, and future generations, and it will give \nus back responsible and accountable constitutional Government. The \nfaithful stewardship of public funds that was so prized by our Founding \nFathers can be restored for 21st century Americans.\n\n  The virtues of thrift and accountability can be rekindled by this \nvery 105th Congress, so I urge Senators to join with me and the other \n61 sponsors of Senate Joint Resolution 1 in support of the bicameral, \nbipartisan, consensus balanced budget amendment which has taken years \nto develop and for which we have fought for over 20 years.\n  This is the thing to do. This is the chance to do it. This is the \nchance to do what is right. I hope our colleagues will do so.\n  I apologize to my colleague who has been on the floor, who would like \nto call up an amendment, so I yield the floor to him at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me first of all thank my colleague \nfrom Utah for his remarks. He has been a real leader on this. He is \ntenacious; he never, never gives up. I have tremendous respect for his \nwork as a Senator, even though we are in profound disagreement on this \nquestion. But I would like to thank him for kind of matching what he \ndoes on the floor of the Senate with the kind of words he speaks.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dr. \nRebecca Constantino, who is a fellow in our office, be granted the \nprivilege of the floor during the debate on the amendment I am about to \npropose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 3\n\n(Purpose: To state the policy of the United States that, in achieving a \nbalanced budget, Federal outlays should not be reduced in a manner that \ndisproportionately affects outlays for education, nutrition, and health \n                      programs for poor children)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Redesignate section 8 as section 9 and after section 7 add \n     the following:\n       ``Section 8. It is the policy of the United States that, in \n     achieving a balanced budget, Federal outlays must not be \n     reduced in a manner that disproportionately affects outlays \n     for education, nutrition, and health programs for poor \n     children.''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me read this amendment slowly and \ncarefully, because I am hoping to get a very strong vote in favor of \nthis amendment, and I hope it will be an up-or-down vote. This is a \npretty important matter amending the Constitution, and if this is going \nto be done--it may or may not be done--we better do it well, we better \ndo it carefully.\n  This amendment says:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States that, in achieving a \n     balanced budget, Federal outlays must not be reduced in a \n     manner that disproportionately affects outlays for education, \n     nutrition, and health programs for poor children.\n\n  What this amendment is saying, and I will give plenty of historical \nand economic context for it, is that we should go on record and make it \nvery clear that if, in fact, this constitutional amendment to balance \nthe budget is passed, which then locks us into this goal, will make the \ncommitment that we are not going to, as we did in the last Congress, \ndisproportionately cut programs that affect, quite often dramatically, \nthe nutritional or health or educational status of poor children in \nAmerica.\n  The reason that I offer this amendment is that I think we need to \nhave some focus on this question. There can be arguments made, and \nthere have been, on whether or not we ought to amend the Constitution. \nThere can be arguments made about whether or not this is a mistake vis-\na-vis our fiscal and monetary policy to make sure recessions don't \nbecome depressions. There are arguments both ways.\n  Senator Durbin has an amendment on the floor that says, look, if we \nneed to move forward with an economic plan that puts the budget out of \nbalance during a downturn in the economy, it should just be a \nrequirement of a majority vote. I think that amendment is on the mark.\n  I see the budgets over the years. There could be an argument of whom \nto blame. I wasn't here during the decade of the eighties or prior to \nthat time. We can argue it both ways. I think historians are going to \nwrite about a piece of legislation which was euphemistically called the \nEconomic Recovery Act which dramatically cut tax rates. I think it \nbecame rather regressive, because most benefits went to higher income \ncitizens, at the same time of dramatically increased expenditures in \nthe Pentagon. I think President Bush once called it voodoo economics. \nAll of it was to lead to economic growth. People would have more money \nwith a tax cut, productivity, jobs. It would lead to eliminating the \ndebt. Actually, quite the opposite happened.\n  That was actually borrowed money and borrowed time. It was politics \nof illusion. I really appreciate the focus of Senator Hatch on no \nlonger having that illusion and the message from the people in the \ncountry that we should get our economic house in order and our \npolitical house in order. But what I am asking Senators to do, because \nI think we really owe it to the people we represent, is to make a \ncommitment that one more time, as we go about achieving a balanced \nbudget, Federal outlays must not be reduced in a manner which \ndisproportionately affects outlays for education, nutrition and health \ncare programs for poor children.\n\n[[Page S1157]]\n\n  I hope this amendment will not be tabled. I offer this amendment with \npassion and with commitment to a matter that I think is very important. \nI think there should be an up-or-down vote, and I hope it will be \nadopted.\n  Mr. President, why the amendment? Well, because of recent history. \nThe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities issued a report entitled \n``Bearing Most of the Burden: How Deficit Reduction During the 104th \nCongress Concentrated on Programs for the Poor.'' I will just read a \nfew of their conclusions:\n  More than 93 percent of the budget reductions in entitlements have \ncome from programs for low-income people. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that legislation enacted during the 104th Congress \nreduced entitlement programs by $65.6 billion from 1996 to 2002. Of \nthat, almost $61 billion out of the $65.6 billion comes out of low-\nincome entitlement programs, the largest reductions in the supplemental \nsecurity income program and programs for the elderly and the poor.\n\n  Please remember, I say to my colleagues, that one out of every five \nchildren in America today is poor. Mr. President, I read an article the \nother day with great interest of how you, as the Senator from Missouri, \nhave teamed up with other Senators, like Senator Coats, and you have \nyour own commitments to really not turning our gaze away from the \nconcerns and circumstances of one out of every seven Americans, many of \nthem children, but you are committed to doing something.\n  We might have different ideas of what to do. I think that is \ncommendable, and I know you well enough to know that you have that \ncommitment. What I am worried about is deficit reduction based on the \npath of least political resistance, because I think that is exactly \nwhat we did in the last Congress. That is to say, we are afraid to take \non powerful interests, so, instead, what we do is we go after the \npeople who are not the heavy hitters, who are not the big givers, who \nare not well connected, and those people, all too often, in the Senate \nare voiceless and they are faceless and they are powerless and they are \ndisproportionately poor children in America.\n  I hope my colleagues will at least support this amendment. If this \npasses, it happens one time. Let's get it right. If we are going to \nlock ourselves into balancing the budget and deficit reduction, let's \nlock ourselves into humane and fair priorities that we are not going to \ndisproportionately cut programs that affect the educational and \nnutritional and health care status of children.\n  Mr. President, other than entitlements, 34 percent of the reduction \nin nondefense programs that are not entitlements came from \nnonentitlement programs for people with low incomes. Those low-income \npeople programs accounted for only 21 percent of overall funding, but \nthey were disproportionately cut as well.\n  Just looking at the 104th Congress, I offer this amendment to make \nsure that we make a commitment that we are not going to cut such vital \nprograms. Sometimes we are just too generous with the suffering of \nothers. Let's not be too generous with the suffering of poor children \nin America.\n  The Concord coalition had this to say. Martha Phillips the executive \ndirector, on November 26, 1996:\n\n       Balancing the Federal budget--\n\n  And this has been a goal of the Concord coalition--\n\n     and keeping it in balance is critically important, but \n     balance ought not to be achieved principally on the backs of \n     the poor. Every program should be on the budget cutting \n     table. No programs, groups or special interests should be \n     exempt or get a free ride when the budget is being balanced. \n     But neither should the needy be singled out to bear a \n     disproportionate share of the load.\n\n  They go on to say--this is the Concord coalition, I say to my \ncolleagues, committed to deficit reduction. The Concord coalition goes \non to say, under the able leadership of Senator Rudman and Senator \nTsongas, who passed away--a real loss for our country--the Concord \ncoalition goes on to say:\n\n       Even though the 104th Congress, which passed the laws, and \n     the President, who signed them, did not plan to target \n     deficit reduction efforts on programs affecting low income \n     people, that was nevertheless the result of both actions that \n     were taken and those that were not.\n\n  (Mr. ROBERTS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, there is another interesting statement \nfrom the Committee on Economic Development. By the way, I would like to \ncongratulate the business community in our country. The Committee on \nEconomic Development over and over and over again, over the last \nseveral years, have said, from the point of view of economic \nperformance for our Nation, we must invest in the health, skills and \nintellectual character of our children. We must do that.\n  I quote, as a part of a letter that was written November 26, 1996, by \nthe senior vice president and director of research of the Committee on \nEconomic Development:\n\n       Second, in an unfortunate surrender to misplaced ideology \n     and political opportunism, our leaders in both political \n     parties have increased the magnitude of the financing problem \n     by insisting that tax reductions be included in their \n     balanced budget plans.\n\n  That was their view. By the way, I think we are going to have to look \nvery closely at some of those budget proposals. My understanding is the \nJoint Tax Committee, in projecting the majority party's tax cuts over \nthe next 10 years, has identified close to $500 billion in the first 5 \nyears more targeted toward middle-income people and the second 5 years \nmore targeted toward wealthy, high-income people.\n  What is going to be the offset? Cuts in the nutritional and \neducational and health care programs for poor children in America? If \nthat was the case, that would be unconscionable. If there was some sort \nof budget deal that leaves these children out in the cold, that would \nbe unconscionable.\n  The senior vice president of the Committee on Economic Development \ngoes on to say:\n\n       Third, as a result of the fiscal pressures created by these \n     two factors, the burden of budget austerity has fallen \n     disproportionately on those parts of the budget, and those \n     parts of society, that offer the least political resistance.\n\n  Actually, I have been saying that over and over again. I guess we are \nin agreement. I am pleased to hear them actually state it that way.\n  For the budget that means that the discretionary annually \nappropriated programs, including those public investment activities for \na society--it quite simply means the poor.\n  Now the quote:\n\n       As David Stockman observed a decade ago, politics triumphs \n     over policy in seeking out weak clients rather than weak \n     claims.\n\n  This amendment asks us not to let politics triumph over policy. This \namendment asks us to seek out the weak claims, not the weak clients.\n  This amendment says we go on record that when we balance the budget, \nwe will not cut disproportionately those programs that affect the \nhealth care, nutritional and educational status of poor children. We \nought to have 100 Senators voting for that. We can go forward to \nbalance the budget. We can go forward with deficit reduction. But given \nthe way we did it in the last Congress, and the evidence, I must say to \nmy colleagues, it is irreducible and irrefutable that we ought to at \nleast make this commitment.\n  Mr. President, the Washington Post in an editorial written today had \nthis to say:\n\n       The balanced budget debate is only in part what it purports \n     to be--an argument over the deficit, savings, growth, and the \n     shifting of cost to the next generation. It is also a sharp \n     debate over social policy, conducted in fiscal code. If you \n     decide to balance the budget, the question immediately \n     becomes, at whose expense? The budget is by its very nature a \n     redistributive device. On balance, it tends to move money \n     from people who are better off to those who are not. If you \n     narrow the deficit, will it end up doing more of that, less \n     or about the same?\n\n  This editorial goes on to make the argument that if we are going to \ndo it, we ought to do it on the basis of a standard of fairness. We did \nnot do that in the 104th Congress.\n  This amendment asks the U.S. Senate, in the 105th Congress, Democrats \nand Republicans, to go on record that if we are going to balance the \nbudget, we are not going to do it on the basis of the path of least \npolitical resistance and not going to go after weak clients. We are \ngoing to go after weak claims. And we are not going to end up passing \nbudgets that disproportionately cut programs that affect the health, \nnutritional and educational status of poor children in America.\n  If I were to get 100 votes, I would feel like I have died and gone to \nHeaven. I\n\n[[Page S1158]]\n\nreally would. I am so hopeful that my colleagues will vote for this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, in an interesting poll result, the Committee for \nEducation Funding points out that whereas there is support for the \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget--and there is. I have \nbeen opposed to it. You have to ultimately follow your conviction and \nvote for what you think is right or wrong. Senator Hatch clearly takes \nanother position, and he votes his conviction. No one would ever say \notherwise.\n  But it is interesting that public opinion polls show--according to \nthe Committee for Education Funding--that 90 percent of Americans \nsupport maintaining or increasing Federal support for education. When \ndirectly asked if they would support a balanced budget constitutional \namendment that reduces funds for education, nearly 70 percent \ndisagreed. So this amendment just asks us to be clear about how we \nintend to do this.\n  Mr. President, just a little bit more context. I am going to get a \nchance to speak on this amendment today, and then I guess we will go \nback to the Durbin amendment and tomorrow get a chance to speak and \nthen have a vote.\n  We are, as I said the other day on the floor of the Senate, in many \nvaried ways a model for much of the world. I mean, we should be so \nproud of our country, the diversity of our country, so proud of our \neconomic performance, so proud of our leadership in the world, so \nproud, I think, of really helping to create a world where we no longer \nhave to think so much about a nuclear war that could be the end for our \nchildren and grandchildren. But there is at least one way in which we \nare not a model, one area in which I think in recent years we have been \nmoving in the wrong direction. And that is in fulfilling our national \nvow of equal opportunity. That kind of national commitment is in need \nof refurbishing and renewal.\n  I bring this amendment to the floor because more than 35 million \nAmericans are poor. That is one out of every seven citizens. In 1994, \nof poor children under the age of 6, nearly half lived in families \nbelow half the poverty line. That figure has doubled over 20 years. The \nnumber of people who work and are poor and work full time, 52 weeks a \nyear, 40 hours a week, and still are poor has dramatically increased as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, minorities are poorer than the rest of Americans. \nAfrican-Americans are close to 30 percent, Hispanics at a little over \n30 percent, and female-headed households are even poorer, and 44.6 \npercent of the children who live in such families are poor. In 1994, \nalmost half of all children who were poor in America lived in female-\nheaded households. So what we have here is one out of every five \nchildren poor, but it is getting closer to one out of every four \nchildren. One out of every two children of color are poor. \nUnfortunately, we cannot turn our gaze away from this reality, a strong \nconvergence between poverty and race and gender and children in \nAmerica.\n  I am asking us to go on record to be for fairness in how we do this \ndeficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, let me give a few examples of the kinds of programs \nthat I am talking about when I say that we should go on record that we \nwill not disproportionately cut these programs that affect the \nnutritional health and educational status of children.\n  Let me start out with the Women, Infants, and Children Program. Let \nme make a point with my colleagues, because sometimes I am going to \ngive a lot of examples. I am going to talk about women and children. I \nwant to translate these statistics into personal terms.\n  But, first, as a teacher, I think I have said it before on the floor \nof the Senate, but I want to say it again. I was a college teacher for \nover 20 years. I have been in a school in Minnesota probably about \nevery 2 weeks ever since I was elected. It is just crystal clear to me \nthat the most important educational program in the United States of \nAmerica--you know we talk about higher education. I was a college \nteacher. It is a big issue. It cuts across affordable higher education, \ncuts across a broad section of the population that people are very \nfocused on, and it should be.\n  But as a matter of fact, I think the most important educational \nprogram is to make sure that every women who is expecting a child has \nan adequate diet, rich in vitamins, minerals, and protein. It is just a \nfact. It is just a fact. The evidence is irreducible and irrefutable \nand it is medical evidence. If we do not make sure that every woman \ncarrying a child has an adequate diet, all too often her child will be \nborn severely underweight, her child will be born with an impairment \nthat may mean that no matter what we do in our public schools, that \nchild will never have the same chance as probably all of our children, \nSenators' children, or grandchildren. It is the essence of the American \ndream. It is the goodness of our country, for us to say that every \nchild, no matter what race or gender or income of family, will have the \nsame opportunity to reach her full potential or his full \npotential. That is what my father, who was a Jewish immigrant from \nRussia, taught me about our country. That is the greatness of our \ncountry. It is not too much for me to ask my colleagues to go on record \nthat in balancing the budget we will not make any cuts in the most \nimportant educational program, the Women, Infants, and Children \nProgram.\n\n  In 1996, Mr. President, WIC provided assistance for 7.2 million \nwomen, infants, and children. That was about 60 percent of the eligible \npopulation. There are about 11 million women and children that are \neligible. So, some women and some infants and some children are left \nbehind.\n  Mr. President, let me talk a little bit about the WIC Program. It was \nestablished as a pilot program in 1972 and it was made permanent in \n1974. It is administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Who is \neligible? Pregnant or postpartum women, infants, and children up to the \nage of 5 are eligible. Mr. President, how many people does it serve? \nMore than 7 million people get WIC benefits every month, and \nparticipation has risen steadily. Children are the largest category of \nWIC recipients. Of the average 6.89 million people who received WIC \nbenefits each month, 3.5 million were children, 1.8 million were \ninfants, and 1.6 million were women.\n  Mr. President, this is a program that is a huge priority or should be \na huge priority for this Senate. It is a success story. Sometimes we \nharp on the complexity of it all like we do not know what to do. I am \nin agreement with every single Senator that says some of these \nGovernment programs ought to be reevaluated, some of them do not work \nwell. But from the point of view of decency, of fairness, of justice, \nof saving money--what is the figure? For every $1 we invest in the \nWomen, Infants, and Children Program, it is $3 less we spend in medical \nassistance later on.\n  WIC is a huge success story. The Women, Infants, and Children Program \nreduces fetal deaths and infant mortality. WIC reduces low birth rates \nand increases the duration of pregnancy. WIC improves the growth of at-\nrisk infants and children. WIC decreases the incidence of iron \ndeficiency anemia in children, improves the dietary intake of pregnant \nand postpartum women, and improves weight gain in pregnant women. \nPregnant women participating in the Women, Infants, and Children \nProgram receive prenatal care earlier. I think, Mr. President, about \nevery 2 minutes in America a child is born to a woman who had no \nprenatal care. Children enrolled in WIC are more likely to have a \nregular source of medical care and are better immunized. Children who \nreceive WIC benefits demonstrate superior cognitive development. WIC \nsignificantly improves children's diet. WIC is cost effective.\n  I am just asking my colleagues to make a commitment that we will not \ndisproportionately cut this program as we move forward to balance the \nbudget because in the last Congress we disproportionately made cuts in \nprograms that affected those citizens who did not have the political \nclout here, who did not give the big dollars, who are not the heavy \nhitters, who are not the well connected. This is a distorted priority \nif we at least do not make a commitment on behalf of these children.\n  Mr. President, I will give some examples from the Women, Infants, and \nChildren Program, but I want to first of all call attention to my \ncolleagues to a special report in Time magazine February 3, 1997, ``How \na Child's Brain Develops and What It Means for Child Care Welfare \nReform.'' Mr. President, I\n\n[[Page S1159]]\n\ncongratulate Time magazine for this issue. I really believe that we \nwill see major change in how we think about our priorities here as a \nresult of the kind of research that Time magazine reports on. \nBasically, if I had to summarize this whole issue, the conclusion is as \nfollows: If you do not make sure that women expecting a child have an \nadequate diet, if you do not make a commitment to these children when \nthey are young, if you do not make sure that they do not have not only \nadequate nutrition and adequate health care, but if you do not make \nsure that they do not have intellectual stimulation, a nurturing and \ncaring environment--and by the way, Government cannot do all of that. \nThe President knows that. Much of that is up to the family. If you do \nnot make sure that that does not happen, then by age 3 for many of \nthese children, it is almost close to all over; certainly by age 5.\n\n  I think that what we are going to see and more of the concern that \nwill come out, and it will be compelling, if we do not make the \ninvestment, if we do not do everything to make good things happen at \nthe local and community level, and realizing people need resources to \nmake sure that for these children we invest in the intellect and the \ncharacter of these children, or many of them will therefore not make \nit. What a waste that would be for our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I have said before on the floor of the Senate and \ntoday is my day to try and give this context because I think so much of \npolitics is personal, I have learned so much as a grandfather. Because \nour children are all older and we had our children when we were very \nyoung, I forget what it was like. Now when we have the grandchildren \nover, I have said on the floor of the Senate before, you take a 2-year-\nold and you watch him or I watch our granddaughter, it is amazing. \nBeing in the same room, in the same house, and every 15 seconds they \nfind something interesting and new. The President is smiling. He may \nhave seen the same thing. What is going on is that these small children \nare experiencing all the unnamed magic of the world that is before \nthem. We ought to ignite that spark for all of our children. We do not \nwant to pour cold water on that spark, and we have, for too many \nchildren. Actually, it does not make much of a difference whether it is \nmy grandchildren or anyone else's grandchildren, they are all God's \nchildren. I think it is time for us to move beyond symbolic politics \nand it is time to stop giving the speech and having the photo \nopportunities next to the small children unless we are willing to make \nan investment.\n  Mr. President, at 23 years old, Elaine became pregnant and soon after \nshe was laid off of her $9 an hour office job. Since she was pregnant \nshe had difficulty finding another job. She did find one at $6 an hour. \nWith little resources, she immediately learned about the Women, \nInfants, and Children Program which she says is the reason her baby was \nborn healthy and strong. Her initial guidance from the WIC office in \nReno, NV, taught her the basic nutritional information. I am just \nreading from this example. We have collected stories from people around \nthe country. All too often we just speak in statistics here, or \nstrategy or tactics. I want to try and translate this amendment into \npersonal terms as it affects people's lives. Every month Elaine \nattended nutritional classes and received vouchers for items like milk, \ncheese, peanut butter, and beans. She said, ``I had no idea what I was \nsupposed to eat and what was right for my baby. The public nurses were \nall so nice and helpful, I never felt bad. They wanted me to have a \nhealthy baby as much as I did. I knew nothing about babies, like breast \nfeeding and stuff. They taught me all that.'' After Elaine gave birth \nto a healthy boy, she would take him to the WIC clinic where he was \nexamined.\n  The same nurses who guided her through the pregnancies guided her \nthrough the initial steps of child rearing. Not only did she learn the \nbasics of taking care of her son, but she continued to receive \nfinancial assistance. Says Elaine, ``The formula cost $160 a month and \nI did not have it. WIC gave it to me, and I'm not sure what I would \nhave done without that help.''\n  Eventually, Mr. President, Elaine returned to her office job at a \nrate of $9.60 an hour, and she was no longer eligible for WIC, and she \nshould not have been. She now lives independently with her son. ``WIC \nsaved me. I really don't know how I would have survived. It helped me \nsurvive on an emotional level and with finances. I was really \nsurprised. I always thought these kinds of programs were for `low-\nlifes,' but they were a lot like me. I just had hard luck and needed \nhelp. I got it.'' And Elaine's son got it. That is the difference \nbetween Elaine's son having a really what we would call successful and \nfull life versus what might have happened to her son if she had not \nreceived this assistance.\n  Is it too much for me to ask colleagues to go on record that we will \nnot disproportionately cut the Women, Infants, and Children Program? \nReally, we should not cut it at all. This amendment doesn't even ask us \nto do that. Actually, we ought to fully fund it now. I don't understand \nsome of these proposals here in Washington--some from the White House. \nWhen we don't actually fully fund some of these programs, I don't know \nexactly how we figure out which children go without health care, which \nchildren go without the nutritional help they need, which children are \nnot in the Head Start programs. Who makes that decision? We know how we \ncan make a difference and be helpful. We have some proven, credible \nprograms that have worked, that are key to children, key to what we are \nabout as a country. I am just saying, let us at least make a commitment \nthat these programs are not the programs that we disproportionately \ncut.\n  Mr. President, let me now move on and talk about the Head Start \nProgram. Mr. President, the Head Start Program is a program that began, \nas I remember, back in 1965, or thereabouts. It is a program which, in \nmany ways, is not perfect, but it has lived up to its title, which is \nthat we do, as a Nation, just what the program says; we give children \nfrom some really difficult and tough circumstances, from low-income \nfamilies, a head start. That is the goodness of America, what we are \nabout. Yet, Mr. President, in 1996, the Head Start Program reached only \n17 percent of eligible 3-year-olds and only 41 percent of eligible 4-\nyear-olds. In the United States, almost 4 million children are eligible \nfor Head Start, because children 1 and 2 could be receiving or \nparticipating in this program. But it served just over 800,000 of those \nover 4 million children. Roughly, 3.2 million children are not being \nserved.\n  The President's budget proposal says we will, by 2000, 2001, fund \nHead Start for another 1 million children. I still don't understand how \nwe can make the collective decision not to fully fund it. How do we \nexplain to people in the country, or more important, how do we explain \nto children?\n  Jonathan Kozol--and I recommend Jonathan's work--wrote a book called \n``Amazing Grace: Poor Children and the Conscience of America.'' He \nwrote another book called ``Savage Inequalities: Public Education in \nAmerica.'' His writing is so powerful. In an article he recently wrote \nfor a journal called Tikun, a very interesting journal, he writes at \nthe end:\n\n       Millions of children in sequestered neighborhoods, like the \n     South Bronx, do not know what they have the right to hope \n     for. Their eyes ask questions that you and I and all of us \n     have yet to answer.\n\n  Their eyes ask questions that, as Senators, we have not answered. One \nof those questions is, how can a country, how can a Congress, that \npurports to love children do so precious little to help some of the \nchildren that are the most vulnerable citizens with the direst need?\n  Mr. President, across the freeway from the comforts of Disneyland is \na housing division, a stone's throw from the lavish and affluent hotels \nthat serve tourists. In a corner apartment lives Rene, a lively, \nexuberant, and bright 8-year-old. She is in the second grade where she \nis doing well in school. In fact, every morning Rene runs to school \nexcited to learn. Too many of our children are running into the arms of \npolice, rather than into the arms of parents and teachers.\n\n  We pay a price for not investing in our children. We pay a price for \nnot investing in poor children in America. Rene attended two years of \nHead Start, which, according to her mother, was ``a Godsend.'' At Head \nStart, Rene learned\n\n[[Page S1160]]\n\nthe fundamentals of schools, such as her colors, the alphabet, and \nwriting her name. More importantly, Rene and her family learned about \nschool. For Rene, learning about school at Head Start meant more than \nacademics. It meant her mother learned about nutrition and eating \nright. It meant her mother learned how to interact with and talk to \nteachers. Her mother learned how to prepare Rene for school, things \nlike clean clothes and breakfast. It meant her mother learned about \nreading to Rene. It meant her mother learned that Rene needed a \nstructure, a set time to eat dinner and to go to bed. Head Start taught \nthis. Learning about school meant Rene learned to interact with her \npeers. She learned about sharing. She learned how to listen, how to \ntake directions. Rene learned about curling up and being read to. She \neven learned to brush her teeth. Rene, Mr. President, represents one of \nthe many children who have benefited from Head Start. Said her mother, \n``Before Rene got in this program, I knew nothing about what she \nneeded. I was kind of scared for her to go to school. I didn't do so \ngood in school, and I was getting ready for the same with her. Her \nteachers cared about her and me. They wanted to work with us, too. I \nknew they cared.''\n  Remember, Mr. President, that the Head Start teachers who did so much \nfor Rene and began her on the path to school success earn about $17,000 \na year. Also, keep in mind that for every Rene that benefited in Head \nStart, two are turned away. For every Rene that benefited in Head \nStart, two are turned away.\n  I am asking Senators to make a commitment with this amendment, in an \nup-or-down vote, that we will not, in balancing this budget, \ndisproportionately cut programs that affect the educational, health \ncare, or nutritional status of children. WIC is one example, and the \nHead Start Program is another. I don't think that is too much to ask.\n  Marcus, a shy and quiet first-grader, finds himself in the \nprincipal's office for the third time in a week. According to his \nteacher, Marcus is either overagitated, annoying other students in \nclass, or else listless and disinterested in the tasks at hand. Marcus \nusually doesn't understand what is happening in class. He does not yet \nknow all of his colors, his numbers, or the alphabet.\n       Though many of his classmates attended a Head Start Program \n     and learned the initial steps toward understanding school and \n     learning, Marcus did not. He represents one of the 1.2 \n     million children who, though eligible, could not participate \n     in the Head Start Program.\n\n  Mr. President, in Minnesota, my State, only 40 percent of the \nchildren who are eligible for Head Start have access to it. In other \nStates it is much lower.\n\n       The program near his home was full. Not only was it full \n     but there was a year waiting list when Marcus' grandmother \n     tried to sign him up. Though there was room in another \n     program, it was too far for his grandmother to take him. \n     Instead, Marcus stayed home, sometimes alone, while his \n     grandmother worked. Marcus is conspicuously behind his \n     classmates. While his classmates scurry around the teacher to \n     be read to, he had not yet held a book or had ever been read \n     to. Marcus does not even know how to write his name.\n\n  Let me pick up on that.\n  He had not held a book, and he had never been read to. Why don't we \ngo on record, in all of this haste to balance the budget, that we will \nnot balance the budget on the backs of poor children, and we will not \nmake cuts which would make it impossible for a child like Marcus to \nhave a book read to him in a Head Start Program?\n  There are a lot of homes that do not have any books at all. I read \nsomewhere that one of the factors that most explains how well children \ndo in school is the number of books that are in the home. Mr. \nPresident, there are many homes where the parent or parents can't \nafford any books. I would just suggest to my colleagues that one of the \nmost important things we could ever do is to make sure that children \nhave access to those books or that someone can read those books and \nnurture those children and stimulate those children.\n  Peter Hutchinson, superintendent of schools in Minneapolis, made an \nexcellent suggestion that I am going to try out speaking at the \nlegislature next week speaking about children. Peter Hutchinson, Mr. \nPresident, said something that I think is appealing to you; a wonderful \nvoluntary effort. He said, ``You know, Paul * * *'' and he has two \nteenagers--``we have all of these wonderful children's books in the \nhome but the children are older now. Why don't we get those books in \nthe other child's home? Let us get those books out of our homes. Let's \nget bookmobiles and get them into the homes of those children. And let \nus get them to those Head Start Programs and make sure that all of our \nchildren get that stimulation.''\n  That is what I am talking about today.\n\n       Marcus did not know how to write his name nor did he know \n     how to recite the alphabet. In a phrase, Marcus is not a part \n     of the culture of the school. He did not come to school ready \n     to learn. Marcus' teacher is concerned and anxious about him. \n     He is far behind his classmates, and she has little, if any, \n     time to help him catch up. As weeks progress, he falls \n     further behind and is more frustrated. Already Marcus hates \n     school and learning, counting the days until summer vacation. \n     He knows he is different. He knows he does not understand but \n     also knows there is not much he can do.\n\n  Here is a child who is utterly defeated. I meet children. I travel \nthe State. I travel the country and I meet with children who are age \n10, age 8, who can't look me in the face, who look down. They have no \nconfidence. They don't believe they are going to be teachers. They \ndon't believe they are going to be doctors. They don't believe they are \ngoing to be successful business people. They don't believe they are \ngoing to be lawyers. They don't believe they are going to be \narchitects. They don't believe they are ever going to be Senators or \nRepresentatives. None believe they will ever be President. They have \nnone of that hope. It is gone.\n  Can't we make a commitment as a Senate knowing full well \nthe importance of family and community? But can't we at least get some \nresources for the communities and neighborhoods and families so that we \ncan support our children?\n\n  I will tell you something. I am absolutely convinced that when \nhistorians write about this time period of the decade of the 1980's \nmoving into the decade of the 1990's, the ultimate indictment of our \ncountry will be the way in which we have abandoned our children and \ndevalued the work of adults who work with those children. Think about \nit for a moment.\n  I am not off the topic. I love to take my grandchildren to the zoo. \nBut if you work at the zoo, you get paid twice the salary, twice the \nwage, that a woman or a man makes working in a child care center. We \npay people who work for the zoo twice as much money as we pay men and \nwomen who work with children. What in the world does that say?\n  When I was a teacher at Carleton College in Northfield, MN, I would \nmeet students, and they would say, ``In all due respect, we do not want \nto be college teachers. We want to work with these children when they \nare young, 1, 2, 3, or 4 years of age, because we know that is such a \ncritical time.'' But many of them would then go on and say, ``But we \ncan't. We can't support the family. We would make $6 an hour with no \nhealth care benefits.''\n  What are we saying? Let us dig into our pockets. Let us not spend \nmoney on wasteful programs. Let us cut. Let us balance the budget. Let \nus be fiscally responsible. But, please, let us make a commitment with \nthis amendment that we are not going to balance the budget on the backs \nof poor children. Please let us invest in certain areas of life in \nAmerica, starting with our children.\n  Marcus' teacher said:\n\n       I just don't know what could be done for him. I know that \n     he needs a lot of one-on-one attention and love, but I just \n     do not have the time or the resources. Every day I feel him \n     slipping, and, frankly, it breaks my heart. He is a good boy \n     and a smart boy. I feel as if he is being punished for what \n     we did not do for him. I am worried that he will always hate \n     school and suffer until he can leave. He tries so hard. \n     Sometimes I want to cry.\n\n  That is what this debate is all about. It is about people. It is \nabout children.\n  I say to my colleague from Utah that I really believe there can be \n100 Senators voting for this. I am not bringing this amendment to the \nfloor because I want to point the finger at other colleagues. I am not \nbringing this amendment to the floor to force an embarrassing vote. I \nam bringing this amendment to the floor in good faith and in good \nconscience really hoping that my\n\n[[Page S1161]]\n\ncolleagues will support it because, otherwise, I will just tell you, \ngiven our track record of deficit reduction based on the path of least \npolitical resistance, we are, with this constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget, going to lock ourselves into very stoic priorities, \nand we will make these cuts, and I believe in the absence of some \ncommitment, we will make cuts in these very programs that affect these \nvery children.\n\n       By August of 1996, in West Monroe, Louisiana, there was \n     already a waiting list for Head Start for August 1997. Zora \n     Cheney has been a Head Start teacher there since 1965. She \n     was there at the very beginning. Not only does she see the \n     need for it, but she lives the success. According to Zora, \n     without Head Start the lives of many children would be in \n     words ``a disaster.''\n\n  I visit Head Start programs all across Minnesota. Another outstanding \nfeature is parental participation--high-participation parents--in \nmeeting with the teachers and in talking about the children. This \nprogram is a really important investment in poor children.\n\n       We get kids here, so many kids here, that need us and would \n     not endure later school years without it. I have seen some \n     kids who come in, and it is obvious they are not cared for \n     enough and that the home family needs help. While Zora's \n     program emphasizes the traditional things that we discuss \n     with Head Start, like building on language, learning shapes \n     and colors and developing social skills, it does so much \n     more. Says Zora, ``We are concerned with everything about \n     that child. We want the parents to learn how to feed them, \n     how to dress them, how to parent them.'' She continued, ``I \n     have had children come to school, and I know they have been \n     sleeping on the floor. I know they need so much at home. We \n     work with other groups. We refer the families to get things \n     like furniture and doctor appointments.'' When asked the most \n     significant contribution that Head Start in West Monroe, \n     Louisiana has made to the community Zora replies, ``For many \n     its the first place that they feel safe.''\n  I have other examples that I will go through tomorrow, but I just \nwanted to give some examples of some children, and I am going to be \ndoing this over and over and over again, actually thanks to the people \nin Minnesota--I am just going to bring to the floor of the Senate the \nlives of children so that we can get some votes on their behalf because \nI will tell you something. For example, the Senator from Utah--and this \nis not meant to challenge him--on these children's issues he is \neffective and he is a powerful Senator for children. I know that. So I \ndo not feel like I am spitting in the wind when I come out here to \nspeak or I do not think I make a mistake with this amendment. I am just \ntrying to get my colleagues to make this commitment because I know so \nmany of them care so deeply about children.\n  The amendment says we make a commitment that we will not put into \neffect disproportionate cuts in programs that affect education--I \ntalked about that--nutritional and health care programs for children.\n  According to the Childrens Defense Fund, 10 million children, one in \nseven children in America, are without any health care coverage at all, \nand I think that close to about a million children a year have been \ndropped from coverage because actually more and more people are getting \ndropped from employment-based coverage, or what has happened, employers \nwill cover the adult but they do not cover the children.\n  It used to be that people could get coverage for everyone in their \nfamily. Who are these 10 million uninsured children? Nine in ten, 88 \npercent, have parents who work. Nearly two in three, 64 percent have \nparents who work full time. These are children of working poor \nfamilies. More than three in four, 77 percent, are white. Sometimes we \ndo a little bit too much by way of stereotyping and always assume we \nare talking about African American people or Hispanics. Two-thirds live \nin families with income above the poverty level, and more than three in \nfive, 61 percent, live in two-parent families. Each year since 1989--\nthis was the statistic I was struggling for--900,000 fewer children on \nthe average have received private coverage.\n  I think actually it is real important for me to make this point about \nwhat this amendment is talking about and also some of the legislative \ninitiatives that will be taken in this Senate in the 105th Congress. We \nare talking about working poor families. We are talking about people \nwho are not old enough for Medicare, and even if, by the way, you \nreceive Medicare in my State of Minnesota people do not have \nprescription drug costs covered and elderly people still live in terror \nof catastrophic expenses if they are no longer to stay at home and the \nnursing home costs, or we are talking about families that are not poor \nenough to qualify for medical assistance. They fall between the cracks. \nThey work, they work hard, they are barely above the poverty-level \nincome and they are not fortunate enough to have an employer that \nprovides them with health care coverage. So their children are at risk. \nThese families live paycheck to paycheck.\n  What does this translate into? More than half of uninsured children \nwith asthma never see the doctor during the year. More than half of \nuninsured children with asthma never see the doctor during the year. \nMany of these asthmatic children are hospitalized with problems that \ncould have been prevented. One-third of uninsured children with \nrecurring ear infections never see the doctor. Many suffer permanent \nhearing loss. Children with untreated health problems are less likely \nto learn in school. If you have an ear infection, if you suffer \npermanent hearing loss, if you are not treated for asthma, if you do \nnot have dental care, if you come to school with an infected tooth, \nwith a tooth with an abscess and you cannot even get dental treatment, \nyou are not likely to do as well in school.\n  Mr. President, it will actually save money when we invest in \nchildren. Each dollar invested to immunize a child saves between $3.40 \nand, some say, $16 in direct medical costs, and it goes on and on. In \nevery other advanced economy children get better health care coverage \nthan in America.\n\n  So, Mr. President, here we have children with undiagnosed vision \nproblems who do not get glasses and do not even see the blackboard. We \nhave children who suffer from asthma, we have children who have ear \ninfections and can suffer hearing loss, we have children who are in \npain and discomfort and have trouble concentrating, we have children \nwho are not treated early for lead paint poisoning and these children \ncan suffer permanent mental retardation, and we have 10 million \nchildren in America who are uninsured.\n  Given this shameful statistic, is it too much to ask my colleagues to \nmake the commitment that in our effort to balance the budget we are not \ngoing to make any disproportionate cuts that affect the health care \nstatus of poor children in America? We are not doing near enough right \nnow.\n  That is all this amendment does. I am fearful, on the basis of what \nwe did in the last Congress, that when push comes to shove, we will not \nhave a deficit reduction plan locked in by this constitutional \namendment to balance the budget based upon a standard of fairness, that \nwe will embark upon once again deficit reduction based upon the path of \nleast political resistance, and those Americans who will \ndisproportionately be asked to sacrifice are the very Americans who \ncannot tighten their belts any longer--poor children in America. This \namendment goes to the very heart of who we are and what we are about.\n  I do not know. My colleague from Utah may speak to this. Maybe there \nis a strategy on the other side--not the other side as if we are not \nfriends, but we have majority party and minority party. I am in the \nminority party--to basically vote against all the amendments. I hope \nnot. And one more time, I really hope that we will have an up-or-down \nvote on this amendment. I introduce this amendment with respect for \ncolleagues. I think it speaks to a terribly important matter. I really \nhope that people will vote for it. I really believe most Senators agree \nthat these are not the areas where we are going to make \ndisproportionate cuts. I really think most Senators agree.\n  Mr. President, I will speak more to this amendment, but for right now \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to express my regard for the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota. He is very sincere, and he always \nmeans well, and, frankly, I care a great deal for him.\n  Having said that, I do want to point out that this is a \nconstitutional amendment we are talking about here, and I need to take \njust a few minutes to respond to some of the comments\n\n[[Page S1162]]\n\nthat my friend and colleague, Senator Wellstone, has made.\n  Let me begin by saying that I do not know of any other Member of this \nbody more genuinely concerned about the children in this country and \nparticularly those in poverty, unless it is myself. He works hard for \nthese unfortunate people, these unfortunate kids, as do a lot of us, \nand I give him credit for that. When Senator Wellstone speaks on these \nissues, he speaks from his heart, and we all know that. Regardless of \nthe differences on this amendment, you still have to give him credit \nfor that.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, the efforts to try to help children \nby exempting programs that affect them from the balanced budget \namendment's purview will have precisely the opposite effect. As a \nmatter of fact, we are throwing their future away unless we pass this \namendment. We are saddling them with historic debt that literally is \ngoing to cause them to spend the rest of their lives working to get out \nfrom under the debt that we in our generation are leaving, or should I \nsay the past generations because it is more than just our generation.\n  The Senator has circulated a new section 8 that would become part of \nthis amendment if it was passed. Let us have no illusions. Senator \nWellstone, the distinguished Senator from Minnesota, is not going to \nvote for this constitutional amendment no matter what happens, even if \nwe accepted this section. But we could not, because this section says:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States that, in achieving a \n     balanced budget, Federal outlays must not be reduced in a \n     manner that disproportionately affects outlays for education, \n     nutrition, and health programs for poor children.\n\n  He has circulated a whole number of amendments exempting the Women, \nInfants, and Children Program, a program I support, Head Start, a \nprogram I support, and education positions which I support. His current \namendment exempts, as it says here, outlays for education, nutrition \nand health programs for poor children from disproportionate cuts.\n  If we care about children in this country--and I know we do; I don't \nthink there is a person in the Senate who would not say that he or she \ncares--the most important thing we could do is pass this balanced \nbudget amendment. Without it, it is our children and our grandchildren \nwho will inherit the legacy of these astronomical debts, and they are \ngoing up by leaps and bounds. It is our children and grandchildren who \nwill be called upon to pay the price for our years of profligacy, and \nthey will pay that price with higher taxes, higher interest rates, \nfewer jobs, and economic instability. Thus, the amendment that we must \nsupport in order to save the children is not one which would gut the \nbalanced budget amendment. To ensure the well-being of future \ngenerations, we need to pass the balanced budget amendment. It is the \nonly hope for our children.\n  One of the things that is difficult for me to understand is why some \nwould argue or assume that exempting certain programs from the balanced \nbudget regime would somehow save or help those programs. Just the \nopposite is the case. If there is a program worth preserving, and I \nsuggest those programs are, we ought to make sure these programs are \nfunded responsibly and not with rubber checks. What is the point? \nExempt a program from the budget so it would be allowed to go bankrupt \non its own? Is that what the point is? That is simply the kind of \nreasoning that has led us to a $5.3 trillion national debt, going to \n$5.4 trillion in the next couple of months.\n  Mr. President, several self-proclaimed liberals are making these \npoints as well as myself, notably Representative Joseph Kennedy, among \nothers, the Representative from Massachusetts. They have become staunch \nsupporters of the balanced budget amendment. Joe Kennedy is one of them \nbecause, as a self-professed liberal, he believes and other liberals \nbelieve, who are supportive of the amendment, that balancing the budget \nis the only way to protect and preserve the worthy programs for the \nneedy. We are not doing anyone any good by bankrupting the Government \nand spending an increasing amount on interest on debt. Representative \nKennedy last week suggested that interest was the primary villain, \ncrowding out good social spending programs. Imagine what we could do \nwith the hundreds of billions of dollars we spend on interest every \nyear?\n  No, the way to ensure the preservation and stability of critical \nprograms and help the most needy in our society is to foster fiscal \nintegrity. This is not the first time we have seen an amendment that \nsought to carve out a loophole in the balanced budget amendment, nor \nwill it be the last. But I would like to ask my colleagues to consider \nwhat the balanced budget amendment would look like if we really did \nexempt all of these different parts of the budget because we like some \nparts better than others. Anything affecting children, gone; seniors, \ngone; investments, disasters, all manner of social spending, all gone \nfrom the amendment if these folks have their way. So what is left? What \nwould those who propose this barrage of exemptions and loopholes leave \nunder the balanced budget amendment? Absolutely nothing. And everybody \non this floor has some favorite program, that is what has led us to \nthis morass and this mess. We all would like to save something. We all \nwould like to do something.\n\n  I have to say, it is pretty hard to fight against children's \nprograms. I don't know anybody who wants to do that, and if they have \nto compete, they will compete very well and respectably for their share \nof the Federal budget. They always have and they will. I have to admit, \nI wish there was more money for these programs. I wish I could do more \nfor those programs. But the best thing I think I can do for them is \npass a balanced budget amendment that puts the fiscal responsibility \ninto this system.\n  Look, what do they leave under the balanced budget amendment? \nNothing? That is what it all comes down to. These kind of amendments \ntug at the heartstrings of all Americans, and they try to make those \nwho sponsor the balanced budget amendment look mean. But the truth is, \nif you really care about children, senior citizens, and disaster \nvictims, you will vote for the balanced budget amendment. You will vote \nfor a Federal Government with the fiscal strength to be there for them. \nYou will vote for a balanced budget amendment because, without that, \nyou will never be able to protect these programs and these people. And \nyou will vote for a balanced budget amendment without loopholes such as \nthe distinguished Senator from Minnesota is sincerely advocating here, \nbecause everybody deserves a balanced budget amendment. I hope we \nreject these amendments and pass Senate Joint Resolution 1 as it is \nbefore us.\n  Additionally, I am not clear on the effect of the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota. This Wellstone amendment states \nthat it is the policy of the United States that, in achieving a \nbalanced budget, there should not be disproportionate cuts to poor \nchildren's programs. What is this, a sense-of-the-Constitution \nresolution? Is that what we put in the Constitution? I don't think so.\n  I know it is not intended as an insult, but it kind of is, in a way, \nby suggesting we are not going to do right by our children. The \ndistinguished Senator says we are not doing right now by our children \nbecause there is just not enough money. I can agree with that. I can \nagree I wish we had more money, I wish we could solve every social \nprogram there is. But no nation on Earth has ever completely solved \nthem, and certainly no nation that is not fiscally responsible. And \nours is the most fiscally responsible Nation in the world, or at least \nit has been up to the last 60 years.\n  In the last 60 years--in just the last 28 years, we have had 28 \nstraight unbalanced budgets that are demonstrated by this. We have two \npiles here, one behind the other. It would be a lot higher than double \nmy size if we put the other pile on top of this one. These are \nunbalanced budgets over each of the last 28 years. That is only part of \nit. We have only balanced the budget 8 times in 66 years. No wonder we \ncannot do enough for our children. No wonder we do not have the money \nto take care of these social needs. It is going to get worse and the \npeople who are going to get hurt the most are children.\n  Look at Social Security. When I talk to seniors, there are those who \nwant to\n\n[[Page S1163]]\n\ntake Social Security out of the purview of the balanced budget \namendment, and that will be one of the big votes on this amendment. I \ntalk to seniors. They are concerned about children, too, and they are \nconcerned that most all the social spending now is going towards \nseniors, and very few dollars are going to children. Part of that is \nbecause we do not have a fiscally responsible Congress that has to try \nand divvy up the money so they work in the best interests of all \nAmericans.\n  Now, we have had a Congress that just said, ``Just keep borrowing and \njust keep spending and you can just keep doing that ad infinitum, \nforever.'' We all know that is not the case. Our priorities do shift \nfrom time to time.\n  Again, I get back to the Wellstone amendment, is this a sense-of-the-\nConstitution resolution? What does ``disproportionate'' mean? My gosh, \ndo you realize what constitutional authorities would do with a word \nlike that? What does that mean? Does this limit across-the-board budget \ncutting? Is that what it does? Our priorities shift from time to time, \nas we do the budgets. Congress has to be free to allocate resources \nwithin a balanced budget rule. It has to be free to do that. We cannot \nwrite something like this into the Constitution.\n\n  How do we decide what is disproportionate? To senior citizens, they \nmight think that spending on children is disproportionate, rather than \nspending on them. To children's advocates, spending on seniors is \ndisproportionate to what we should be spending on children. We have to \nbattle these things out. That is what we are elected to do. But we need \nto do it within the constraints of a balanced budget amendment so we \nreally get down to the matter of setting priorities.\n  I happen to believe if we set priorities, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota will be right in there pitching for the priorities of \nchildren, and so will I.\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I think we will be able to win on this, \nto the extent we have the votes to win it.\n  Furthermore, on this disproportionate business, how do we decide \nwhich programs affect children? Do we do it on the basis of program \ntitle, or by surveying recipients to see the actual use of the money? \nIs that how we do it?\n  Madam President, it is pretty clear that if you put something like \nthis in the Constitution, you create more problems than you solve. It's \npretty clear that if you start advocating for any one select part of \nthe budget to be outside the budget, because you want that protected \nfrom budgetary restraint, that you are hurting everybody. It's pretty \nclear if you prefer one group over another, you're going to have a lot \nof conflict among groups.\n  If you do that, you darn well better do it within a balanced budget \nconstraint, so the people know what is going on, and not just think the \nmoney is going to come from somewhere, which is about the attitude we \nhave had around here for the last 60 years, and certainly for the last \n28 years, every year we had an unbalanced budget. And in current years, \nwhere we said this is a balanced budget for the first time--give me a \nbreak, not one of them has been and nobody has thought any would be.\n  I have to tell you, I think it is going to be a budget charade this \nyear as well. The President's budget, according to CBO, is already $66 \nbillion in debt, and the budget will be balanced in the year 2002, that \nis assuming current interest rates, that is assuming current rosy \nscenarios, that is assuming we continue to have no minor or major \nrecession. All of those things are ifs.\n  We should reject this and similar amendments and pass the balanced \nbudget amendment that will lead a stronger future for our children and \ngrandchildren away from bankruptcy and debt, which is where we are \nheaded if we don't get smart and do what is right. To exempt anything \nfrom the budget is almost an insult to everybody who serves. It is an \ninsult to everybody who serves in the Congress.\n  We are here to try and do what is right. I believe the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota, myself and others, who similarly feel the depth \nof these problems, will be able to fight very, very well for these \nparticular items in the budget, but within a balanced-budget concept. \nIf we do that, I think we will have more money in the end, more real \ndollars to help children than we are going to have if we don't pass \nthis balanced budget amendment. So I hope that our colleagues will vote \nthis down.\n  Just so people will know right off the bat, I probably am going to \nmove to table every amendment that comes up. I don't want anybody to \nfeel badly about it. We think that is the only orderly way to proceed.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, if I might make a comment to the Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to yield for a comment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Obviously, he has his right, as any Senator does, to move \nto table any amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is what we have always done.\n  Mr. LEAHY. But I hope no person in the public will be fooled by that. \nThe result is still going to be the same as an up-or-down vote would \nbe.\n  Madam President, the Senator from Utah has virtually a blood oath \nfrom the Republicans to vote against anything that might try to protect \nSocial Security, children, or anything else in this proposed \nconstitutional amendment. So he would have the votes, I assume, to win. \nBut I hope the American public will not think this is a procedural \nthing. This is very much a vote on the merits on any motion to table \nthat the Senator from Utah might make to defeat an amendment.\n  He does have an absolute right, as any of us do, to move to table at \nsome appropriate time. I hope he will allow enough time, of course, for \ndebate, but he does have that right. But the vote on that motion to \ntable should be viewed as if it were a vote on the merits.\n\n  I further ask the distinguished Senator from Utah how much longer he \nwill take.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will only be a minute. I will say this, I agree with the \nSenator. The fact we move to table an amendment doesn't necessarily \nmean the substance of that amendment or the substance of that vote \nshould be ignored. It is just a procedural way of handling the matter \nthat I think we are going to have to do in an orderly way. But I think \nthe vote will still mean who voted for it and who voted against. I \nalways felt that way. I don't have any problem with that.\n  I also would just like to say that I don't think there are any blood \noaths around here either. I hope some Democrats who have cosponsored \nand my fellow Republicans will vote to sustain the motions to table, \nbut I don't know of any blood oaths, nor do I know of any all-profound \ncommitments that people have made. I just believe that people know this \ngame is about to come to an end and that this is a chance to pass a \nbalanced budget amendment to put our fiscal affairs in order, and that \nthis is the last chance. This involves both Republicans and Democrats \nwho have worked hard to come up with this consensus amendment in the \nbest interest of our country. I understand there are different \nsincerely held beliefs on this matter. But in any event, I do not agree \nwith my colleague.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I know the Senator from Vermont wants to speak, and \nthen I will, after the Senator from Vermont speaks, respond to some of \nmy colleague's points. I don't understand, I will say to my friend from \nUtah, he talks about tabling the amendment because this is an orderly \nway to do it. I don't understand why an up-or-down, yes-or-no vote \nisn't just as orderly. What is the problem with an up-or-down vote as \nopposed to tabling? It is just as orderly.\n  The second thing--I guess it is less a question, and I don't know if \nmy colleague, who is a good friend, meant it in this way--I don't think \nthis is a game. This is less a question than, I guess, a response. I \ndon't think it's a game at all. I don't think it's a game to these \nchildren, and it is not a game to me. I just want to be clear about it. \nIt is an amendment offered out of respect. It is an amendment that I \nbelieve is profoundly important for our country. It is an amendment I \nhope Senators will support. It is not a game. It is not a game.\n\n[[Page S1164]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, it may not be to the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota, but I really believe it is time to pass a \nbalanced budget amendment, and this is the context in which this is in.\n  With regard to tabling, we have always done it and intend to table \nthe amendments if we can, and that is a right that we have. It is not \nmeant to hurt the Senator or his position, it is just a matter of \nprocedural choice, which I--and I just want to make it clear up front--\nwill probably do on all, if not most all, amendments that come before \nthe body on this matter.\n  I realize the distinguished Senator from Minnesota is very sincere, \nthat he would not bring this amendment to the floor if he didn't mean \nit and it wasn't meaningful to him. I am not meaning to disparage his \namendment at all, other than I think it would be a terrible way of \nwriting the Constitution, putting words in the Constitution that would \nbe almost impossible to define and I think would, basically, gut the \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Even if we put it in, even if somehow or another we could find some \nway of putting it in the amendment, I don't believe we would have the \nvote of the Senator from Minnesota anyway.\n  To make a long story short, it is one of a long series of amendments \nthat are intended to defeat the balanced budget amendment, and I hope \nmy colleagues will vote to table.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, normally, I would speak in response to \nthis, but I understand the distinguished Senator from Texas needs a few \nminutes to introduce a bill. Without losing my right to the floor, I \nyield to my distinguished colleague from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Madam President. I thank the Senator from \nVermont.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Hutchison pertaining to the introduction of S. \n294 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield to the Senator from Vermont and appreciate his willingness to \nlet me introduce this bill on the day the officer is being buried. \nThank you.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I should note a couple things from the \ndebate that my good friend from Utah has stated. He said he is in favor \nof a balanced budget amendment. I know he has been very sincere about \nthat. My difference is I am in favor of a balanced budget. The two are \nnot necessarily the same. We have been voting closer and closer to a \nbalanced budget each of the last 4 years.\n  We have seen, after the enormous increase in deficits and the \nnational debt that grew up with Presidential budgets throughout the \n1980's, for actually 12 years, beginning in the early 1980's straight \nthrough 1992, where we saw a tripling of the national debt--I do not \nwant to sound partisan, but I point out those were all Republican \nbudgets and Presidents, Republican Presidents who got virtually every \nsingle thing they ever asked for. In fact, the only appropriations bill \nthat President Reagan ever vetoed--the only one--was one that did not \nspend as much money as he wanted. Yet he had, with his budgets, nearly \ndoubled the national debt. The debt had taken 200 years to build up to \nthe point where he became President. Within 8 years he doubled it. It \nwas nearly tripled by the time his successor, another Republican, \nfinished office.\n  So we actually built up the debt during that time--we are spending \nover a half a billion dollars every working day just in interest on \nthat. We would not have a deficit today had there not been so much debt \nbuilt up during the Reagan and Bush administrations.\n  In the last 4 years, under President Clinton, the deficit has come \ndown every single year. No President, Republican or Democrat, has done \nthat in my lifetime. I think he ought to get some credit for it. Now he \nhas submitted another budget that will bring it into balance by the \nyear 2002.\n  We have endured a number of gimmicks, from the dumping of thousands \nof dollars of cash on the ground to even a debt ticker. Now we have \nthis stack of books being represented as the unbalanced budgets of the \nlast 28 years. They are not the budgets for the last 28 fiscal years. \nLet us make this very clear. The stack of books over there are not the \nbudgets for the last 28 years. They are not the budgets of the United \nStates at all. The stack of books are a mishmash of documents. Some are \nproposed budgets by past Presidents. Some are proposed appendices of \nthe proposed budgets. Some are simply analyses of the proposed budgets. \nActually, the stack is as much a gimmick as a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget is a gimmick--as everyone from the Wall Street \nJournal, on the right, to newspapers like the Los Angeles Times and the \nWashington Post, more to the left, have pointed out.\n  In fact, here is a copy of last year's budget resolution. It is a \nlittle tiny thin thing. This, incidentally, brought the deficit down \nfor the fourth year in a row. It is not a very picturesque thing. It is \nnot a gimmick. It is actually something we vote on. And by voting on \nit, we brought the deficit down.\n  President Clinton made it very, very clear. All it takes to balance \nthe budget is our votes and his signature; not a constitutional \namendment. It also takes some courage on our part.\n  Many of us have shown that courage over the last 4 years in bringing \ndown the deficit. I am proud to be one of those. I am proud to be one \nof those who voted against the economic plan that built up those huge \ndeficits in the first place. Because we are willing to cast specific \nvotes is why I support the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota, \nSenator Wellstone.\n  I share his strong commitment to keeping America's children healthy \nand strong. He has stated this not just on the floor of this body but \nin individual talks with Senators. It is a deeply held view on his \npart. As one who has chosen to protect the lives of those in the next \ncentury, I share his view of that. I believe in strong families and a \nstrong family structure in this country. Families prosper only if their \nchildren go the bed fed, not when their children go to bed hungry.\n  Last Congress, we had this Contract With America--or contract on \nAmerica. It seems like deja vu all over again. If you read the fine \nprint of that contract, as the Senator from Minnesota has, and the \nbalanced budget plan in there, it repealed the School Lunch Act that \nprovides lunch to 26 million children. The Contract With America \nlegislation repealed the WIC Program, special supplemental nutrition \nprogram for women, infants, and children, that provides nutritious \nfoods to 6.9 million women and children. That Contract With America \nlegislation repealed the Food Stamp Program, which is a nutritional \nsafety net, a very modest one for 28 million people.\n  Now we beat back the repeal of the School Lunch Act with the help of \nthe Senator from Minnesota. We beat back the repeal of the WIC Program \nwith the help of the Senator from Minnesota and we beat back the repeal \nof the Food Stamp Program with the help of the Senator from Minnesota \nand the Senator from North Dakota and others who were here on the floor \ntoday. We beat them back because people saw what was in the so-called \nContract With America.\n  But with the balanced budget amendment you do not see how this is \ngoing to be done. Nobody wants to bring up the enabling legislation, \nthe details for future Congresses, or most likely for unelected judges \nto decide. How can we guarantee--I will ask this question of the \nSenator from Minnesota, is there any way you can guarantee that we \nwould not repeal the School Lunch Act or the WIC Program or the Food \nStamp Program without at least some of the protections of your \namendment? Is there any way we can be sure we protect them?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, the answer is no, absolutely not, on \nthe basis of what was attempted. Also on the basis of some of the cuts \nmade in the last Congress, the evidence is quite to the contrary. The \nevidence is, in the absence of some assurance and some sort of \ncommitment in spite of all the\n\n[[Page S1165]]\n\nspeeches made and words uttered, we will make disproportionate cuts in \nthe programs that affect health, nutrition, and educational status of \nthese children.\n  If the Senator from Vermont would not mind if I go on briefly and \nrespond to some of the comments made by my colleague, the Senator from \nUtah. First of all, sort of a clarification about how you define \n``disproportionate.'' It is pretty simple. Again, the evidence, and I \nam interested if somebody wants to argue with it, in the last Congress \n93 percent of the budget reductions in entitlements came from programs \nfor low-income people. Madam President, 93 percent. All you need to do \nis figure out the percentage of the overall entitlement programs that \nare low income and you do not cut by more than that.\n  We have the same thing with discretionary. You do not have to be a \nrocket scientist to understand what the amendment says. You cannot \ndance around it. Second, in all of the amendments we introduced and all \nthe amendments that the majority party is introducing, in this whole \nconstitutional amendment there will be implementing legislation to work \nout the final details.\n  Third, Madam President, as to the Constitution and whether you can \nhave policy in the Constitution, I am not a lawyer, but article III \nsays:\n\n       The judicial power of the United States, shall be invested \n     in one supreme Court, in such inferior courts as the Congress \n     may from time to time ordain and establish. The Judges, both \n     of the supreme and inferior Courts, shall hold their offices \n     during good Behaviour, and shall, at stated Times, receive \n     for their Services a Compensation which will not be \n     diminished during their Continuance in Office.\n\n  It certainly seems as if we have such policies in the Constitution \nright now.\n  Madam President, what troubles me the most about the comments of my \ncolleague from the Senator from Utah, first of all, he talks about this \namendment giving an exemption. There is no exemption. This amendment \njust says give them what we did last time. Make a commitment that we \nwill not disproportionately cut programs that vitally affect the \nnutritional, educational, and health care status of poor children in \nAmerica. I gave examples of those programs in the way they work and \nwhat they mean to children. That is all it says and no more. Senators \nshould be clear on what they are voting on.\n  Finally, Madam President, and I want to be clear if I could get the \nattention of my colleague from Utah, I do not want him to think I say \nthis without giving him a chance to respond, but in all due respect to \nmy good friend from Utah, when we talk about bringing the deficit down \nand real interest rates down, and that is the way to help children, a \nlot of the children that I have talked about, Senator, do not have that \nfuture. If we do not make a commitment that we will make sure that they \nhave adequate diet, adequate nutrition, that they come to school \nprepared to learn, that they come to school in good health, they are \nnot going to have this future.\n  For gosh sake, we should not in the name of deficit reduction savage \npoor children in America today. You do not want an up-or-down vote? You \nwill vote to table. Fine. But this amendment is substantive. It speaks \nto the very real problem of the deficit reduction based on the path of \nleast political resistance, picking out the most vulnerable citizens. \nIf we do not make a commitment that we are not going to cut these \nprograms that are so vital to poor children's lives--as a matter of \nfact, we should be investing much more--then these children do not have \na future.\n  Deficit reduction, I am all for. Balancing the budget, we should do \nit. But instead of focusing on poor children in America, why do we not \nfocus on the subsidies that go to oil companies, tobacco companies, \npharmaceutical, big insurance companies, and a whole lot of other \ncorporate welfare? Why do we not focus on the $17 billion over 2 years \nmore than the Pentagon requested wanted for the Pentagon? There are \nother places to make the cuts, but I say to my colleague from Utah, and \nI am sorry to say with indignation, this is anything but an abstraction \nto the children I am talking about.\n  Your argument about how the best thing for these children is to make \nsure we balance the budget because real interest rates will come down--\nby the way, the Federal Reserve ought to bring the real interest rates \ndown right now if everybody is right, I am not sure they are about the \nConsumer Price Index having overstated inflation, what in the world are \nwe talking about even the possibility of real interest rates going up? \nThey ought to be going down. Above and beyond that point, it does not \ndo the children that I am talking about today one bit of good to talk \nabout balancing the budget in the future when you balance the budget on \ntheir backs. That is what we did the last Congress. That is what we did \nthe last Congress.\n  I am just saying, Senators, we should do this on the basis of some \nstandard of fairness. I still think I can get 100 votes for this. I \nhope the Senator from Utah tomorrow, after we have a little bit more \ntime for final debate, will not move to table this. I hope he will \nsupport it. With all due respect, the evidence does not suggest that \nwith the absence of this assurance we will not make these cuts in \nexactly these decisive areas of life that so crucially affect the \nquality, or if we do not make this commitment, the lack of quality of \nthe lives of poor children in America. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I know there are 2 minutes left before we \nend debate on this amendment. I acknowledge my colleague is sincere. It \ndoes not negate the fact we have to live within budget constraints or \nthis country will go down and children will be the first to be hurt. \nThat is why this amendment is so important. You cannot make any \nexceptions.\n  If you make exceptions, then it does not become important. It does \nnot work and it will not be the constraint that we need, it will not be \nthe fiscal discipline, that it will make a difference whether this \ncountry really continues to be the greatest country in the world or not \nand whether it can do for children and families what we would all like \nto do. The best thing we can do is pass this amendment and pass it \nwithout exceptions, like my good friend who is very sincere thinks we \nought to do.\n  I just want to bring that to the attention of everybody, that it \ntakes guts to stand up and do what is fiscally responsible, because it \nis easier to offer spending through all these constituencies then it is \nto have to make priority choices. This amendment will force us to make \npriority choices. I think that is critical in any kind of nation that \nreally wants to call itself great.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, last week I talked about the balanced \nbudget movement from a historical perspective. I discussed the fact \nthat when our country started out as a new nation, policymakers felt a \nmoral and ethical obligation to balance the budget year after year \nafter year, and they did that. However, as time evolved, a process was \ndeveloped under which programs were funded based on demand. This \nprocess produced what are called entitlement programs. It created a \nblank check. As a result of these entitlements and the corresponding \nlack of accountability, there is no longer the same concern to balance \nthe budget that existed during the time of the Founders.\n  I wanted to talk a little bit this afternoon from the perspective of \na family man who has grown up in America, from the perspective of a \nsmall businessman who has had to start his business from scratch. Those \nobligations that I faced as a family man and those obligations that I \nfaced as a businessman are pretty much the same obligations that we are \nfacing as a Congress, as the leaders of this country, this great \ncountry called America.\n  Thus far, we have had two amendments presented before this body \nwhich, in effect, provide for exceptions to a balanced budget \namendment. One is the Durbin amendment, and the most recent one is the \nwelfare amendment. These amendments are unnecessary. We already have a \nprovision to meet emergencies in the balanced budget amendment proposal \nthat is before us. Madam President, 60 percent of the vote in the House \nand 60 percent of the vote in the Senate, or 261 votes in the House and \n60 votes in the Senate, and we will be able to waive the provisions of \nthis amendment to meet those national emergencies.\n\n[[Page S1166]]\n\n  Madam President, I understand I will have an opportunity later on to \ncontinue with some of my remarks and that there is an order on the \nfloor for another amendment.\n  I will continue my remarks at another time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 3:30 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will now proceed to the consideration \nof the Durbin amendment No. 2, on which there shall be 2 hours of \ndebate equally divided.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Colorado, so he can finish his statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator for yielding. I would now like to \nfinish my comments that I began a few minutes ago.\n  The Wellstone amendment would provide funding for education, \nnutrition, and health programs for poor children. So, again, as I was \nspeaking about earlier, I want to talk about this from the perspective \nof a family man and also a small businessman. Joan, my wife, and I \nstarted like most American families. After we got our education, we got \njobs. We earned a salary and worked hard to save money so that we could \nincur our first major debt as a family. For most families in this \ncountry, their first major debt is when they purchase a home. They are \nable to incur that commitment only after they have enough income saved \nup to go ahead and qualify to buy that first house.\n  Most families in America work hard to pay down that debt because they \nunderstand that if they pay down that debt, then, in effect, they are \nbeginning to free up their resources so that at some later date they \ncan meet the educational needs of their children, the nutritional needs \nof their children, and they can meet the health care needs of their \nchildren. They also, hopefully will be able to save enough of their \nresources to get their children started out in life. In addition, by \npaying off that debt, they begin to build up a reserve in their home \nthat they will be able to use in case of emergency.\n  That is not unlike the situation that we have here in America. That \nis why it is important that we get deficit spending under control and \nthat we have a balanced budget amendment that will say to the Congress \nthat it can't spend more money than it brings in.\n  Our debt today is greater than $5 trillion. Every year, for the last \n28 years, we have continually added to that debt. We have been going in \na different direction than the average American family. If we really \nwant a better future for our children and grandchildren, we do not need \nto establish more Government programs that will cause the deficit to \nrise instead of fall. Instead, eliminating the deficit is the most \nunselfish thing that we can do for our children and grandchildren.\n  Now, as a small businessman, a veterinarian, when I started out, I \nhad to go to the local banker to take out a loan. The largest portion \nof that debt went to purchase a building so that I could take care of \nmy clients and their animals' needs. As time moved along, I worked hard \nto pay down that debt that I had incurred. I knew that the sooner I \npaid down that debt, the better I would be able to serve my clients \nbecause a smaller debt load would begin to free up my resources for \nother uses. Instead of paying out money on interest, I was able to buy \nnew equipment and bring in more help so that I could take better care \nof my clients.\n  I think that these two situations, as a family man and as a \nbusinessman, are not unlike what we face as a country. If we, as \nMembers of Congress, face our responsibility as custodians of this \ncountry's future, we simply have to eliminate deficit spending. Despite \neverybody's good intentions, the trend has been in the opposite \ndirection--our national debt has grown larger every year. I think that \nthe most unselfish thing we can do for our children and grandchildren \nis to eliminate deficit spending and assure them a prosperous future. \nThat is why I am supporting a balanced budget amendment. The only way \nthat we will gather the courage and discipline to address our budgetary \nproblems is if we have a constitutional requirement to balance the \nFederal budget.\n\n  Now, many will argue here on the floor that we need to protect \nparticular programs. And lots of times they will couch their arguments \nin terms of certain benefits for our children. But what they really \nwant is to save their own jobs and programs. Because additional waivers \nor exceptions to the balanced budget requirement will preserve the \ndeficit spending status quo, their primary concern cannot really be our \nchildren's future. The balanced budget amendment and eliminating \ndeficit spending is the approach that concentrates on providing for our \nchildren's future. It is unselfishly saying that we want a better life \nfor our children and grandchildren. That is why I am such a strong \nsupporter of a balanced budget amendment.\n  I wanted to share with Members of this body my experience as a family \nman and a small businessman. I don't think that the Federal budget is \nunlike what the average American family or small businessman faces on a \ndaily basis. They understand the need to eliminate deficit spending, to \npay down their debt. I just hope that this body has the same foresight \nthat many American families and small business people in this country \nhave.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time to the Senator from Utah. Thank \nyou.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 2\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is my understanding that under the \norder of the Senate, there is to be 2 hours of debate, if I am not \nmistaken, with 1 hour to be controlled by me and the other hour by the \nSenator from Utah, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you. I yield 10 minutes to my colleague from North \nDakota, Senator Conrad, at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and my colleague from Illinois.\n  Madam President, first of all, I thank him for offering the amendment \nhe has put up, which we will be voting on in just 2 hours. I think it \nis a critically important amendment. Before I discuss that amendment, I \nwould like to talk about what I have heard here today, because I have \nheard a lot of talk about how we are going to balance the budget. I \nheard a lot of talk about how we are going to eliminate deficits, and \nall of it is going to be done with this balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution.\n  I thought to myself, maybe they really don't know that, in fact, this \nisn't a balanced budget amendment at all, because even if you pass this \namendment, the debt will continue to rise. Isn't that surprising? We \nhave heard all of this brave talk about how this amendment is going to \nbalance the budget. We have heard all of this talk about how it is \ngoing to eliminate deficits. Yet, if we pass it, and if it is \nimplemented, the debt will continue to rise.\n  I asked June O'Neill, the head of the Congressional Budget Office, \nwhen she came to testify before the Senate Budget Committee, ``What is \nthe deficit this year?'' She said, ``Well, Senator, the projected \ndeficit for this year is $124 billion.'' I said, ``Is that right, $124 \nbillion?'' She said, ``Yes, that's the deficit.'' I said, ``Well, how \nmuch is the debt going to go up this year?'' Well, she wasn't sure of \nthe number. I looked it up in a table before I asked the question. I \nsaid, ``Well, would it surprise you to find out that the debt, subject \nto limit, will be increasing $255 billion this year?'' She wasn't \nsurprised by that. Of course, none of us who serve on the Budget \nCommittee are surprised by that.\n  The difference is that the deficit they are talking about in this \namendment and the deficit she was talking about before the Budget \nCommittee is the so-called unified deficit. That is when you put \neverything into the pot--all the income, all of the outgo, and you call \nthat the unified deficit. The problem with that is, every penny of \nSocial Security surplus is going in. That is about $70 billion this \nyear of trust fund money that they are using to say they have balanced \nthe budget.\n  That is not a balanced budget. In fact, by law, in the United States \nthat\n\n[[Page S1167]]\n\nis not a balanced budget. But they are going to put it into the \nConstitution of the United States that it is. Is that really what we \nwant to do? Do we want to phony up what is a balanced budget and put a \nphony description of a balanced budget in the Constitution of the \nUnited States? Boy, I do not want any part of that game. Are we going \nto say in the Constitution of the United States that it is a balanced \nbudget when you take every penny of Social Security surpluses and throw \nthose into the pot and call it a balanced budget? If any private \nemployer in this country tried to take the retirement funds of their \nemployees and put them into the pot to balance their operating budget, \nthey would be in violation of Federal law. That is called fraud. Yet, \nthat is what we are talking about here. Their defense is, ``Well, we \nare doing it now.'' Yes, we are doing it now. We have been doing it for \n13 years. It does not make it right. And it certainly is not something \nwe should put in the Constitution of the United States.\n  The first question the people of the United States ought to insist be \nanswered by our colleagues on the other side of the aisle is, What \nbudget is being balanced? We need to ask that question, the most basic \nquestion of all, because by any serious definition of a balanced budget \nthis amendment to the Constitution of the United States that they are \noffering is not a balanced budget amendment at all.\n  This is the description. It says, ``Total receipts shall include all \nreceipts of the United States Government. Total outlays shall include \nall outlays of the United States Government.'' That seems to make \ncommon sense. But the problem is that you are taking all of those trust \nfund surpluses.\n  Look at what they are. In 1998, the fiscal year that we are working \non the budget, $81 billion of Social Security surplus. Under this \namendment that they want to put in the Constitution of the United \nStates, the organic law of our country, they want to take every penny \nit of it to claim they have balanced the budget. In 1999, $169 billion \nwill be the cumulative surplus by that time of those 2 years; 2000, \n$263 billion; 2001, $361 billion of Social Security surpluses, every \npenny of it going into the pot to claim they have balanced the budget. \nWhat a hoax. What an absolute hoax to call this a balanced budget. By \n2002, $465 billion of Social Security surpluses, and they will have \ntaken every penny, they will have spent every penny, in order to claim \nthat they have balanced the budget.\n  That does not pass any kind of credibility test. For us to be \nentrenching that principle into the Constitution of the United States--\nI thought about this very hard 2 years ago when it came down to my \nvote. I thought to myself, I don't know what the political \nramifications are. I don't know how this will be read. But I know one \nthing. I am not putting my name on an amendment to the Constitution of \nthe United States, the organic law that has made this the greatest \nnation in human history, and put my name on an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States that says that a balanced budget is \none that uses every penny of the Social Security surplus to call it a \nbalanced budget. No. I am not signing up to that kind of deal.\n  Look at what we are talking about. By the year 2013, $1.8 trillion of \nSocial Security surpluses, and they are going to take every dime and \nclaim they have balanced the budget.\n  Let me turn now to the amendment of my colleague from Illinois, an \namendment that I think is critically important because I think there \nare three failures to this balanced budget amendment that is before us \ntoday. No. 1, it raids Social Security surplus funds to claim balance; \nNo. 2, it does not have adequate provision for a national economic \nemergency.\n  Madam President, we know right now that the right thing to do is cut \nspending and balance the budget, without question. I have spent a great \ndeal of my time offering balanced budget plans in this Chamber. I \ndeeply believe it is the right thing to do to secure the economic \nfuture for our country. There is a right way to do it and a wrong way \nto do it, and unfortunately the amendment before us, the underlying \nconstitutional amendment, is the wrong one; wrong because it loots \nSocial Security trust funds; wrong because it does not have adequate \nprovision for national economic emergencies.\n  But let me be clear. While it is the right thing to do now to cut \nspending and balance the budget, that was precisely the wrong thing to \ndo in the depths of the Depression. Cutting spending, raising taxes in \nthe depths of the Depression would only have made that calamity last \nlonger and be deeper. That is the economic reality. And we are passing \nan amendment here not just for today, not for the next 5 years, not for \nthe next 10 years, but perhaps for the next 200 years. It ought to be \nan amendment that can stand the test of time. This one, the underlying \namendment, fails that test.\n  The Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, has come to us and \nrecognized that we ought to amend the balanced budget amendment to take \naccount of national economic emergencies.\n  He is saying that when we get into a situation, especially a \ndepression, this country ought to be able to take fiscal policy that \nwould help this country emerge. The Senator from Illinois has put his \nfinger right on it, one of the key weaknesses of this amendment.\n\n  Henry Aaron, director of economic studies at Brookings Institution, \nsays, ``One does not need to be a primitive Keynesian to believe that a \nrequirement forcing tax increases or spending cuts during an economic \nslowdown could be catastrophic. Yet, the need to mobilize a three-\nfifths majority, not just in the Senate but in the House of \nRepresentatives as well, heightens the possibility that such policies \nwould result because of incapacity to mobilize the necessity \nsupermajority in both Houses.''\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side who are moving this amendment \nmay say, ``Well, all we have to do is get a three-fifths vote to waive \nthese provisions in the event of a national economic emergency.'' I \nthink that is cold comfort, Madam President. All we have to do is look \nback at some of the decisive moments in history to see that it isn't \neasy to get a three-fifths vote in this Chamber. On the eve of World \nWar II we could not get a three-fifths vote to institute a draft. If \nthere ever was a national emergency, it was World War II, and we \ncouldn't get a three-fifths vote to institute a draft. In fact, we \ncouldn't get a majority vote to institute a draft.\n  Madam President, we don't want to hold the economic future of America \nhostage at in a time of national economic emergency. That does not make \nsense.\n  Robert Solow, the Nobel laureat from MIT, said, ``The balanced budget \namendment would force perverse actions by Congress, easily turning a \nsmall recession into a big one and a big one into a disaster.''\n  We ought to pass the Durbin amendment because it makes economic \nsense. We ought to do that.\n  This chart shows what we have learned in terms of evening out the \neconomic cycles. This chart shows real economic growth from 1870 to \n1995. You can see these wide swings, these wild swings, in economic \nactivity up until about 1950. Then these economic stabilizers that we \nput in force in this economy eliminated these wild swings that lead to \nso much pain, so much suffering, and so much devastation. That is what \nthe Durbin amendment addresses. It says let us not eliminate these \neconomic stabilizers. Let us not be in a situation in which we handcuff \nthe American economy in the midst of a national economic emergency. Let \nus not be in a circumstance in which we cannot do what we know works to \neliminate disastrous economic consequences. That just makes common \nsense.\n\n  I hope we will support the Durbin amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, the Senator from North Dakota has been \nvery eloquent. The problem is that what he seems to be arguing for is a \ncontinuation of the status quo. For instance, on Social Security, at \nthe very time he is arguing that it is immoral and that it is a rape of \nthe trust, that it is a ripoff to keep Social Security within the \npurview of the balanced budget amendment, he supports a President who \nis doing exactly that.\n  That is what the President's budget does. That is what every budget \nof\n\n[[Page S1168]]\n\nevery President has done ever since we started the unified budget \nsystem. And it just makes little or no sense to take it out of the \nFederal budget, out of the unified system, because if it cannot stand \non its own, which Social Security can, then why would we make any \nselectivity. The fact is it is a gimmick to take it off budget, and it \nis a risky gimmick at that. What they are trying to do is really defeat \nthe balanced budget amendment.\n  Then to argue that we have to take care of economic emergencies, \nwell, what are economic emergencies? I must be able to list at least \n3,000 of them right now that could occur to which everybody could argue \nthat the balanced budget amendment does not apply.\n  It is one thing to argue for the status quo. I have seen 28 years of \nit. I have been here 21 of the 28 years. And I have to admit I fought \nfor a balanced budget every one of those years, and there have been a \nnumber of us who have done so, but we have been in a distinct minority \nas unbalanced budget after unbalanced budget has been passed.\n  Now they are saying let us keep the status quo. Even though this \ngimmick is going to take Social Security off budget and subject to all \nbudgetary matters, we should take it out of the balanced budget \namendment, as though Social Security cannot stand on its own. Come on. \nThat would be one of the most risky things we could do. Every item \nought to be on budget.\n  Social Security is the largest item in the Federal budget. It ought \nto be in the budget. And we can work around the problems that are \nconcerning the Senator from North Dakota and others who argue that. To \ntalk about economic emergencies and try to write that into the \nConstitution, everybody knows that is a gutting amendment that would \ndestroy the balanced budget amendment.\n  To say that you cannot get a three-fifths vote is an insult to \neverybody who believes in this country and who is patriotic and who \nreally believes that the country should go forward. If we have a true \neconomic emergency, we will be able to get the three-fifths vote, and \nthere will be a lot of us who are conservative who will be voting for \nthe three-fifths vote.\n  The fact of the matter is if it does not measure up, then that three-\nfifths vote will not be granted. And a lot of these very same people \nwill be saying, ``Oh, this is the most important thing in the world,'' \nas we go into another year of unbalanced budgets. That is what we have \nbeen doing.\n  I hear these people saying, ``Oh, we can do it. Just do it. Just do \nit.'' I have heard that for 21 solid years. We have never done it yet \nin the last 28 years. What makes us think that ``let's do it'' means we \nare going to do it the next year. The fact is the President's budget is \nnot going to be in balance, according to the CBO; the one he sent us is \nnot balanced. And keep in mind the last 2 years are where all of the \nbudget cuts have to occur in order to be in balance, according to the \nPresident, or there will not be any tax relief to the American people.\n  So, look, we know that these amendments are intended to gut the \nbalanced budget amendment. People who are arguing for them may be doing \nit sincerely, and I presume they are. But they are people who are not \ngoing to vote for this balanced budget amendment no matter what we do. \nThey are not for it no matter what we do. We heard the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota. Why, he has four or five major items that he \nwould exclude from any budgetary restraint. There are others who would \nexclude Social Security from any budgetary restraint. And there are 98 \nothers in this body who would also like to exclude some of their \nspecial projects.\n\n  The best we can do is work together on the unified budget and face \nthe music and make priority choices within a budgetary constraint \nsystem, and if we do that we will save this country, we will protect \nour children, protect our seniors, protect those who need it, and we \ncan. Otherwise, we are going to monetize the debt in order to stave off \nbankruptcy, and that means ruining our country, having interest rates \ngoing out of sight and inflation through the roof.\n  We are talking about saving the country right now. That is what we \nare talking about. With these gutting amendments, if any of them pass, \nthe balanced budget amendment will become a lot less effective.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, just to respond to my distinguished \ncolleague from Utah, the Senator from Utah says, well, it is OK for us \nto put in the Constitution of the United States a definition of a \nbalanced budget which assumes that you are going to loot Social \nSecurity trust funds, and every other trust fund, for that matter, \nbecause the President did it in his budget submission.\n  I say that is a mighty weak defense of a constitutional provision. We \nare not talking about a statute here. We are talking about the organic \nlaw of the United States.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point, just on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me complete my thought, and then I would be glad to.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator would.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Then I would be glad to yield.\n  The fact is we are talking here about an amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States. This amendment does not lead to a \nbalanced budget. The debt continues to increase even if this is passed. \nThat is not a balanced budget, No. 1.\n  No. 2, the President's budget, which is done on a unified basis in \nthe same way as this constitutional amendment, is also not a balanced \nbudget. And I have said that clearly.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have said it publicly, and I have said it privately. It \nis not a balanced budget, because although this amendment claims \nbalance and the President's budget claims balance, they are taking \ntrust fund money in order to claim balance. That is not a balanced \nbudget. It defies our own law. Our own law says you should not count \nSocial Security trust funds.\n  Second, the difference between Social Security and other funds is it \nhas a dedicated revenue source. We impose a tax, a regressive payroll \ntax on the workers of this country and the employers of this country, \nand that fund is in surplus. And so when you mix it in with everything \nelse, you are taking the surpluses generated by that stream of revenue \nthat is being generated for a purpose. The purpose is to prepare for \nthe baby-boom generation. But all the money is being spent. It is being \nspent for another purpose. That is wrong. And it is dead wrong to \nenshrine that flawed principle in the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Third point. The Senator from Utah says three-fifths \nvote, requiring that is an insult to those who serve here. Not at all. \nIt has nothing to do with insults. I could turn that on the Senator \nfrom Utah and say his requirement of a three-fifths vote is an insult \nto democracy. In democracy, majority vote prevails. We do not have \nsupermajorities. I do not choose to do that.\n  I do not think it is a matter of insult. I think it is a matter of \nreality. Do we really want to be in a circumstance in which this \ncountry faces an economic emergency and we have to have a supermajority \nvote to respond when we know from our own past that it has been \ndifficult to muster a three-fifths vote. Even on the eve of World War \nII, to institute a draft, we could not do it. I submit to this Chamber \nand to the American public, the wiser course is the amendment of the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I listened to these arguments, and I did \nnot make the argument that we should have Social Security in the \nbalanced budget amendment because the President is doing it. Everybody \nhas done it because it is a unified budget that requires everything to \nbe on budget. And on the other side of that coin, starting about the \nyear 2014 Social Security goes in deep deficit. What are we going to \ndo, keep that off budget so that we do not have to face the music, so \nwe can keep borrowing?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 3 minutes of the Senator from North Dakota \nhave expired.\n\n[[Page S1169]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I will use my own time. I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. The fact of the matter is, you cannot budget without \nputting everything on budget and you cannot handle it right. And the \nPresident is doing what the Secretary of Treasury said he should do, \nand that is keep all items on budget. There are 31 trust accounts, at \nleast in the Federal Government. Are we going to take them all off \nbecause somebody makes the unfounded allegation that we are ripping off \nthe trust funds? The fact is, the only way not to rip them off is to \nkeep everything on budget. And that is a pretty important point.\n  I do not see how you can argue to take it off budget. It just makes \nsense that we face all the music here, not just part of it, and that we \ndo not make any exceptions so that we have to make priority choices if \nwe are going to have a balanced budget amendment.\n\n  The Senator is right on one thing and that is this amendment does not \nrequire a balanced budget. We can choose not to balance the budget. All \nwe need to do is get a supermajority.\n  This is not a pure democracy in this country. This is a \nrepresentative democracy, and the Senate is a perfect illustration of \nhow we do not always have a majority vote. The fact of the matter is, \neach State has two Senators, regardless of population, and that gives a \ndisproportionate amount of voting power to some States over others.\n  The House of Representatives is a purer democratic body, and our \nFounding Fathers in their wisdom understood this. They also would \nunderstand, if you are going to do a balanced budget amendment, you \nhave to keep everything on budget. And it still does not rebut my \npoint, which is that this is a gutting amendment. This amendment \nbasically says when we have an economic emergency we can go off budget, \nthe amendment does not apply. Again, I ask you, what is an economic \nemergency? There is a wide disparity of belief as to what is, and we \nprovide for a way around that by a three-fifths vote, which I think, in \na true economic emergency, will be easily obtained here and should be \neasily obtained here.\n  In response to the supermajority requirement, the Senator from North \nDakota raises the vote on war, a military threat. Senate Joint \nResolution 1 provides a lower threshold for votes to waive the balanced \nbudget rule in times of war or national security emergency. With regard \nto economic emergencies, during the past 15 years Congress has passed \nemergency unemployment compensation by supermajorities every time but \nonce, and it can be legitimately argued that the once was a time when \nthey should not have. Disaster relief has been enacted by a similar \nsupermajority every time except twice over the last 7 years.\n  What is wrong with requiring people who have not balanced a budget in \n28 years and who keep saying the same things, what is wrong with \nrequiring some fiscal restraint of these people? It is apparent that \nCongress is not going to live with fiscal restraint unless it is \nimposed upon them, and the only way we can impose it--after five tries \nin the last few years of budget restraint by statute, none of which \nhave worked--the only way you can impose it is through an amendment to \nthe Constitution that everybody in this body and in the other body is \nsworn to uphold. I think it is just that simple.\n  There is room for legitimate disagreement here, I am sure. I do not \nmean to imply that my colleagues are not sincere in every word that \nthey are saying. But, on the other hand, I think those of us, the vast \nmajority in this body, who will vote for this are sincere as well. We \nhave seen 28 years of sincerity. People were sincere in trying to get \nbalanced budgets during those years, but they did not do it. The reason \nthey did not do it is because they did not have to do it and it was \neasy to borrow. It was a lot easier to borrow and mortgage the future \nof our children than it was to face the music. Our amendment will \nrequire we face the music.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, words do not change reality. You can call \nit a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates. It is an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, \nbut it is not a balanced budget. The simple fact remains, if you pass \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Utah and it is fully \nimplemented, the debt continues to go up. You can say that is a \nbalanced budget but it is not. It is simply not. The reason it is not \nis because the Senator from Utah is taking every penny of the Social \nSecurity trust fund surplus and throwing that into the pot and saying \nhe has balanced the budget. It is not a balanced budget. No private \nemployer could do that. It would be a violation of Federal law.\n\n  On the question of three-fifths vote, it is very interesting----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minute of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. May I have 30 more seconds?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. On this question of national economic emergency, it is \nvery interesting that all these arguments about supermajority go right \nout the window because they themselves provide for a simple majority in \nthe case of a national security emergency but not in the case of a \nnational economic emergency. That is a fatal flaw in this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I hear the distinguished Senator, but what \nhe fails to say is that we are continuing that system without any \nrestraint if we do not pass the balanced budget amendment. I think the \nSenator from North Dakota, not deliberately, has made several \nmisleading statements, to some of which I would like to respond.\n  He says the balanced budget amendment does not balance the budget if \nit does not exclude Social Security. Of course he fails to mention that \nin the long run everyone knows Social Security is going to run huge \ndeficits and that it is not always going to run surpluses. This tends \nto balance out. If we follow his suggestion, we do nothing but continue \nthe current system. His own President is including Social Security \nbecause he has to, because it is part of the overall unified budget. By \nthe time today's children are retiring, Social Security will be running \nannual deficits of $7 trillion each year. Unless we keep Social \nSecurity on the budget and make it work and resolve it, in current \ndollars, it will be a $7 trillion deficit a year.\n  He also fails to mention that this huge deficit would not count under \nthe Social Security amendment that he supports. The amendment he \nsupports would call this $7 trillion deficit a balanced budget. You \ntalk about hoax; I don't see how anybody can argue that. Yet they do. \nThe fact is, we are in trouble and what are we going to do? Just the \nstatus quo? Just keep doing year after year what we are doing; \nmortgaging our children's future and making it so this, the greatest \ncountry in the world, becomes the least great country in the world? \nThat is where we are headed if we do not do something about it.\n  The Senator from North Dakota also described the balanced budget \namendment as looting Social Security. What a half-truth. The balanced \nbudget amendment does not touch one penny in Social Security. That \nwhole argument is nothing more than an accounting preference. The \nSocial Security trust funds will be still invested in the greatest \nsecurities in the world, and that is American securities, U.S. Treasury \nbills, if you will. That is the only thing they can be invested in. \nThat is going to happen whether we pass a balanced budget amendment or \nif we do not. So, this is a phony argument and, frankly, it would be \nliterally--literally--a risky, risky gimmick to take Social Security \nout of the major budget because, on the one hand, there are surpluses \ntoday, but they are all invested in American securities. Starting about \nthe year 2013, we have huge deficits; not surpluses, but deficits. \nShould we take it out when we have surpluses and not put it in when we \nhave deficits? No. You keep it in all the time and you work with it and \nyou\n\n[[Page S1170]]\n\ndo what is right. That is what the Secretary of the Treasury did. That \nis what he suggested. That is what he said is the right way to do it. \nBy the way, that is also what the President just did in sending up his \nbudget.\n  So, if we do nothing here, we have business as usual, another, a \n29th, year of unbalanced budgets. I would feel a lot better if some of \nthese people who are bringing up these amendments would be voting for \nthe balanced budget amendment. But, no, these are amendments to gut the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, could you please tell me how much time is \nremaining to me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 42 minutes for the Senator from \nIllinois, 38 for the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Dakota, \nSenator Conrad, for supporting my amendment and joining in the debate. \nHe has raised two very important issues. One relates to the future of \nSocial Security and its involvement in balancing the budget. The other \nrelates directly to my amendment, to whether a supermajority vote will \nbe required in the House and the Senate in times of a national disaster \nor a national economic emergency for the Congress to decide to spend \nmore than we have received in tax revenues that year.\n  The Senator from Utah, the chairman of the committee, has spoken in \ncommittee and on the floor. His point is made and made clearly. He \nbelieves that Social Security should compete with all the other Federal \nprograms. He believes that it should be there with no special \ntreatment, should not be excluded, should be brought to the debate and \ntreated the same way. I respect his point of view. I disagree with it.\n  But in order to bring this back to my amendment, I would like to \nfocus on the debate which started last Thursday and continues this \nafternoon.\n  Consider this possibility. If we are successful in balancing the \nbudget in fiscal year 2002, as proposed by President Clinton and \nvirtually all of the leadership in Congress, we will applaud, \ncongratulate ourselves and believe, I think rightly, that our economy \nis in stronger shape. And now let's take a hypothetical.\n  In the next year, 2003, there is a downturn in the American economy. \nThis is not an extraordinary event. In fact, history tells us that once \nevery 5 years we face such a downturn. So our budget is in balance and \nthe next year, millions of Americans, because of this recession, are \nout of work; men and women who have been paying Federal taxes, no \nlonger working. Naturally, they are not paying the taxes.\n  On the other side of the coin, they are men and women who need a \nhelping hand. They are men and women who need unemployment compensation \nfrom the Government. They are men and women who may need, in dire \ncircumstances, food stamps to feed their children from the Government. \nThey may also need Medicaid for hospitalization care of their children \nwhile they are unemployed from the Government. They may be determined \nto go back to work and headed for a job training program to get them \nqualified for another job, that training program coming from the \nGovernment. They may decide it is time to get that advanced degree or \ncollege degree and need to ask for a loan from the Government. In each \nof these instances, people who are not paying taxes, working families \nwho, through no fault of their own, are out of work, turn to the \nGovernment for a helping hand.\n  Any economist is going to tell you your books are not going to be in \nbalance that next year. Congress will then have to decide whether in \nthe year 2003, in this hypothetical, we will not have a balanced \nbudget, because we don't want to relegate millions of unemployed \nAmericans to the ash heap of economic history. We want to make certain \nthey have the same chance other families have had to get back on their \nfeet, and that is the purpose of the Durbin amendment.\n  How will we reach that decision? Under the amendment to the \nConstitution being offered by the chairman, the Senator from Utah, it \nwould take a three-fifths vote of the House and the Senate, approved by \nthe President in order for us to decide, yes, in the year 2003, we are \ngoing to waive the requirements of a balanced budget in order to get \nthe economy moving again, in order to get people back to work, not to \nrisk going more deeply into the recession.\n  The chairman stands and says this supermajority requirement, this 60-\npercent requirement, is not unreasonable. Surely, he says, the House \nand the Senate, faced with this economic challenge, will rise to the \noccasion, cast partisanship aside, avoid the personalities, rally \naround the flag, stand behind the families. I say to the chairman and \nto others of like mind, history suggests it might not be that easy.\n  In the desk of each Senator is a publication known as the Senate \nManual. It contains a lot of information about the rules of the Senate, \nand it also contains the Constitution of the United States.\n  I ask the chairman to consider the following: When our Founding \nFathers wrote the Constitution, which we are seeking to amend with this \nresolution, there were 13 colonies organized under the Articles of \nConfederation. And they said that 9 of the 13 colonies would have to \nratify the Constitution for it to go into effect.\n\n  Think about this: The birth of our Nation, the creation of the United \nStates of America, and turning to 13 legislatures in 13 colonies, this \nConstitution was given to them, asking them to be a part of our Federal \nsystem.\n  What if we had given them the Constitution with a supermajority \nrequirement in each of the legislatures? What if we had said to them, \n``Just to make certain that you don't do anything rash, we are going to \nrequire a 60-percent vote from the legislature of each colony to ratify \nthe Constitution, and it will take 9 of the 13 colonies to do it''?\n  Mr. President, I am not certain we would be a federal nation today, \nbecause if you reflect on the votes actually cast in each of the 13 \ncolonies, you will find, unfortunately, that 5 of the 13 did not meet \nthe supermajority requirement. Only 8 of the colonies would have met \nthe chairman's supermajority requirement.\n  So, though he believes we can rise to the occasion in economic \nrecession, history tells us that even in the creation of this Republic, \na supermajority requirement would have complicated things, slowed them \ndown. I don't know if we would be standing today on the floor of the \nSenate of the United States of America. It is anyone's guess. But the \nsuggestion that a supermajority requirement is something easy to come \nby belies history.\n  What my amendment says is that a majority is necessary to make this \ndecision. So, if we face a natural disaster--the big one in California, \na hurricane in Florida, a hurricane in North Carolina--or a national \nrecession, that we will come together as a national legislature and \ndecide for that given year we will waive the requirement of a balanced \nbudget because of a national economic emergency, a national disaster.\n  The chairman suggests people will abuse this. They are going to call \neverything a national economic emergency. I don't think so. I think \nhistory tells us over the last 4 years, with the Clinton \nadministration, with both a Democratic Congress and a Republican \nCongress, there has been a real commitment to deficit reduction.\n  The chairman is standing next to his leaning tower of unbalanced \nbudgets and suggesting to us that this is going to go on forever. But \nif the chairman would look closely over the last 4 years, he will see \nthey are somewhat different than the other 24 years, because we have \ncome to a bipartisan conclusion that we should and can reduce the \ndeficit in a responsible way.\n  President Clinton's administration, with the cooperation of a \nDemocratic Congress and a Republican Congress, have brought 4 straight \nyears of deficit reduction. This is the first time that has occurred in \nthis century and far into the last century. So it suggests Congress has \nthe message and has the goal in mind and is moving toward it in the \nright way.\n  The chairman has said to us many times, this is something the \nAmerican people want, a balanced budget, and he\n\n[[Page S1171]]\n\nis right, not just by our empirical evidence of visiting our States and \nspeaking to our constituents, but also by sophisticated polling time \nand again. People come forward and say, ``Let's have a balanced \nbudget.'' But I say to the chairman, I will also add a couple things to \nthat.\n  If you would ask them whether they want to protect the Social \nSecurity trust fund as part of balancing the budget, they want that in \nan overwhelming way.\n  If you would ask them whether or not it is right for our Nation to \ncome to the rescue of families unemployed in the midst of a recession, \nfor the Nation to come together to offer things to families to get back \non their feet, I think you will find an overwhelming response. Because \nthe bottom line for most American families, whose senses are dulled by \nall this economic theory rhetoric, is whether or not they are doing \nwell for themselves.\n\n  Are people in their households working? Do they have a job? Do the \nkids have a chance for a bright future? Is our economy expanding, \ncreating good-paying jobs? I think that really is a bottom-line \nquestion. In election after election that is the test we are held to.\n  This amendment does not meet this test. This amendment, by requiring \na supermajority vote, says that this Senate of the United States and \nthe House of Representatives will hold itself to such a standard as to \nquestion whether or not we can rise to the occasion when there is an \neconomic necessity.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered \nby Senator Durbin to protect jobs for working families. Without it, \nmillions of Americans may well lose their livelihood if adequate steps \nare not taken to prevent real damage to the economy from the proposed \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Proponents of the balanced budget constitutional amendment claim that \nit will help American families. They predict dire consequences without \na constitutional requirement to force a balanced budget. But, we know \nbetter. President Clinton's budget gets us to balance by 2002, and \nAmerican families don't need or want to lock themselves into a \nbudgetary straightjacket.\n  Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin and over 1,000 economists have \ntold Congress that the balanced budget constitutional amendment is a \nmistake. Because the amendment turns off the economy's automatic \nstabilizers, ``it could turn slowdowns into recessions, and recessions \ninto more severe recessions or even depressions,'' according to \nSecretary Rubin.\n  Without the automatic stabilizers, the Treasury Department estimates \nthat the 1990 recession might have led to 9 percent unemployment--\ninstead of 7.7 percent. That would have cost the country over 1 million \nadditional jobs.\n  The fundamental problem with the amendment is that it requires a \nbalanced budget even in times of recession. The depression of the \n1930's was made far worse because Congress repeatedly cut Federal \nspending and raised taxes trying to keep the budget in balance. This \namendment could easily condemn us to repeat that unacceptable history.\n  Surely, we can't ignore the views of over 1,000 economists who agree \nthat this amendment mandates ``perverse actions in the face of \nrecessions.'' The last time we failed to heed the warnings of the \nNation's economists, at the beginning of the 1980's, the deficit \nskyrocketed and hundreds of thousands of Americans lost their jobs.\n  Of course, supporters of the amendment say this will never happen. \nThey tell us that if an economic depression is on the horizon, the \nproposed constitutional amendment allows Congress to waive the balanced \nbudget requirement with a three-fifths vote. But it is reckless for \nCongress to gamble in this way with the economy.\n  The Durbin amendment is needed to avert these serious threats to the \neconomy and to American families. Under the Durbin amendment, a \nconstitutional majority could waive the balanced budget amendment's \nrequirements if there is an economic recession or serious economic \nemergency in the country.\n  The amendment protects the country during times of military \nemergency, and it should also protect families during an economic \nemergency. I urge my colleagues to support the Durbin amendment.\n  Finally, I want to ask the Senator a question, if I might.\n  I have listened with great interest to the Senator's explanation. I \nfind it enormously powerful and extremely compelling. After listening \nto the interpretation of both the balanced budget amendment and the \nSenator's anti-recession amendment, one has to draw the conclusion that \non the one hand Americans who have great wealth will not be \nsignificantly impacted by the implementation of the balanced budget \namendment during a recession.\n  The very wealthy do not rely on the kinds of programs that you have \nmentioned. So their lives will not be adversely affected if this \nmeasure is actually put in the Constitution.\n  On the other hand, as the Senator has pointed out, working families, \nchildren of working families, and parents of working families have the \ngreatest risk under this amendment. If I understand the position of the \nSenator from Illinois, it will be the sons and daughters of working \nfamilies that will suffer because Pell grants will be cut. It will be \nthe children in Head Start--children of working families--that will \nhave their education put at risk. It will be mothers and fathers of \nworking families who will not receive assistance from job training or \njob dislocation programs during times of economic calamities. It will \nbe their parents, those who have toiled in the factories, served in the \nArmed Forces, lifted this country out of depressions, and been the \nbackbone of this Nation, whose Social Security and Medicare checks are \nput at risk.\n  I wonder whether the Senator's arguments reach this issue of \nunfairness inherent to the balanced budget amendment. Because, it seems \nto me that one group of Americans, those hard-working Americans, have \nthe most to risk. And those that are the wealthiest individuals or the \nmost successful corporations have the least to risk. I wonder whether \nthe Senator agrees with that observation.\n  Second, if the Senator believes that is true, then what does he \nbelieve is the position of the organizations that represent working \nfamilies.\n  Where do the workers stand on this? Are they for this? Do they think \nthat their futures are more secure by putting the balanced budget \namendment in the Constitution? They say no.\n  What about those groups that have fought for the rights of children, \nday in and day out, year in and year out, what is their position? Do \nthey say yes? They say no.\n  Do those groups that have been fighting to ensure decent health care \nfor American seniors come to us and say, ``This balanced budget \namendment is in the best interest of our seniors,'' or do they say, \n``Do not pass this measure, at least not without the Senator's \namendment?''\n  I am just interested if the conclusions that I draw from the \nSenator's excellent argument, particularly as it relates to the adverse \nimpact economic downturns would have on hard-working Americans, is \nsomething that the Senator is very concerned about as well.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague, the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I think his point is well taken. I might add this. He has specified \nvarious groups that have come forward with reservations about this \namendment. He and I both understand that in a time of economic turmoil, \neconomic recession, some of the most vulnerable Americans are not even \nrepresented in Washington by a special interest group. They are the \nworking poor, getting up every morning, and going to work, 40 hours a \nweek, struggling to get by, barely beyond the minimum wage, often \nhusbands and wives, sometimes working two jobs, trying to make ends \nmeet, trying to keep their families together.\n  That is what concerns me. They will be the first casualties in a \nrecession. They will be the ones laid off. They will be the ones who \nwill have to then make a decision about their lives and to get back on \ntrack. And what we are saying, I believe the Senator from Massachusetts \nand I agree, is that at various points in the modern history of America \nthere have been opportunities\n\n[[Page S1172]]\n\nfor them created through Government programs that have helped.\n  Oh, certainly they need their own personal responsibility, their own \ninitiative. But the door was there for them to walk through. If that \ndoor is bolted shut with the supermajority requirement, these families, \nthe working poor, the groups that the Senator from Massachusetts has \noutlined, they will be the first casualties. That is why I offered the \namendment. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for speaking on \nbehalf of the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  As he has pointed out, the economic issues and strength of our \ncountry is really the backbone for all of the hopes and dreams of \nworking families. His amendment goes right to the core issue about what \nthis impact would be at a time of economic cycles. I think anyone that \nunderstands the history of the economic strengths and weaknesses of our \ncountry would see that we should learn lessons from the historic past.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment does not benefit from that kind of \nhistorical perspective, the underlying amendment. The Senator's \namendment certainly does. I look forward to supporting the Senator's \namendment. I thank him for bringing this matter to the attention of the \nSenate today.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator and reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has reserved the balance \nof his time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I would like to recognize the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire, but first let me take 1 minute.\n  I heard the dialog between the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts and the distinguished Senator from Illinois, and I have \nto say that I am fully familiar with all those groups. And about 78 \npercent of the American people--between 68 and 78 percent of the \nAmerican people--have always been for this balanced budget amendment. \nThey come from all walks of life, from every group. The reason they do \nis they are deathly afraid that if we do not get this spending under \ncontrol, the very people that my good friends have been talking about \nare going to be hurt the most. There is no question about it.\n  To just keep arguing that we can continue to do business as usual, as \nhas been argued here, that is the biggest joke of all.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. BOB SMITH. I thank my colleague from Utah for yielding and thank \nhim for his strong leadership on this issue which he has done for so \nmany years as we wait to see the long hoped for amendment finally reach \npassage.\n  I was somewhat taken by the comments on the Durbin amendment made by \nmy colleague. This is again an effort obviously to weaken the \namendment. It is an interesting question about what an economic \nrecession would be. How would one define it? Would it be just a general \nfeeling of anxiety about the economy? Would that be an economic \nrecession?\n  I might also add, that in difficult economic times you will see areas \nof the country where certain pockets of the country, certain areas of \nthe country there would be an economic downturn and other areas there \nmay be an economic upswing. So the areas of the country where there is \nan economic downturn, how do we define where the amendment and when the \namendment would kick in?\n  It is obviously a weakening amendment. It is interesting, Mr. \nPresident, that for years and years and years we have heard from the \ncritics, we do not need this amendment. We do not need a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. All we have to do is balance it. We \nhave not done it yet. So I am waiting. And those people who say that we \nought to do that, without the amendment, keep offering amendments to \nweaken what we are trying to do.\n  This is a very historic debate that we are in today. Not only is it \nhistoric in the sense that there have been a number of efforts in the \npast to have a balanced budget amendment, but it is historic in the \nsense that if we fail, our children are going to pay the consequences. \nI think they are going to judge us not in a very kind way if, in the \nfuture, in the outyears, if they look back upon this time when we had a \nchance to deal with this in the Constitution and did not do it.\n  I am pleased and proud to be on the side of Senator Hatch in this \ndebate. I think he is on the side of the American people. Frankly, not \nonly the American people today, but tomorrow and for many, many years \nto come. We have had a number of efforts, starting in 1935 in the 74th \nCongress. That was the first measure designed to require an annually \nbalanced budget, and introduced by a Democrat, Senator Tydings of \nMaryland. The next year, the first proposed amendment to balance the \nbudget constitutionally was by Harold Knutson of Minnesota, a \nRepublican, in 1936. It was a bipartisan idea, and it began as early as \n1935. Since then, we have had some 30 measures that in some form or \nanother have come before this Congress.\n  The balanced budget amendment is not a Republican proposal. It is a \nbipartisan proposal. It always has been. Not only have all Senate \nRepublicans cosponsored the resolution, but many Democrats have, as \nwell--not as many as we would like, but many have. We hope we will get \nthe other two or three that we might need.\n  Senate Joint Resolution 1 was approved by the Judiciary Committee \nwith the support of three Democrats--Biden, Torricelli, and Kohl. In \naddition, six other Democrats, Bryan, Graham, Baucus, Breaux, Moseley-\nBraun, and Robb, as well as Senator Kohl. So we have bipartisan \nsupport. This is not a partisan issue. Preserving the United States of \nAmerica for our children is not a partisan issue.\n  Former Senator Paul Simon remains a very active and vocal proponent \nof the amendment and helped to lead the fight here on the floor 2 years \nago when it was up on the floor. Perhaps even more recently, the late \nSenator Paul Tsongas, whom we all knew and respected, who recently \npassed away, stated: ``What you have here is a sad case of pursuit of \nself as opposed to pursuit of what is in the national interest. The \nbalanced budget amendment is simply a recognition of that human \nbehavior.'' Paul Tsongas was right.\n  Secretary of Education Richard Riley was the Governor of South \nCarolina. He stated:\n       I have opposed the amendment in the past, thinking it was a \n     `political cop-out.' The deficit problem has gotten so bad, \n     that I have now decided to support it.\n  That is the issue here. It has gotten bad. We have not had the \npolitical courage, collectively, to balance the budget. You can say all \nyou want, that we do not have to put it in the Constitution, but while \nwe say that, the debt keeps going up, and it is now $5 trillion. Where \ndo we stop, $50 trillion? When we get to $10 trillion, we will not be \nable to service the debt because a $10 trillion debt will cost you $1 \ntrillion in interest alone. The entire Federal budget is a little over \n$1.5 trillion, so two-thirds of the budget will be interest if we \ncontinue along this line. It needs bipartisan support, and I am glad \nthat it has it. I hope it has enough.\n  The last time the Federal Government had a balanced budget was 1969. \nThe total debt was $366 billion. Today, it is $5 trillion. In less than \n10 or 12 years, it will be almost $10 trillion if we continue with the \ncurrent rate of spending.\n  Yet, we still have those who come to the floor and say we do not need \nan amendment, we do not need to clutter the Constitution. The Founding \nFathers knew what they were doing; they did not put it in there; we do \nnot need it; we can balance the budget. When? Each year that the \nFederal Government spends more than it takes in, billions are added to \nthe overwhelming weight of our national debt.\n  Even if we pass this, by the time we get things in order, we will add \nhundreds of billions of dollars to the debt, Mr. President. In fiscal \nyear 1998, we will pay approximately $1 billion a day--$1 billion a \nday--in interest on the debt. In the fiscal year 1997, the gross \ninterest we pay to the service of debt will total $360 billion, the \nsecond largest expenditure in the entire budget. It is $100 billion \nmore than we spend on defense. Mr. President, $100 billion more than we \nspend on defense we spend to service the debt in 1997.\n  What could we have done with all the money we have paid to service \nthat debt? Now, that is a very interesting topic. We get criticized a \nlot here in the Senate for fantasizing. Let me fantasize about what we \ncould do with all that money.\n\n[[Page S1173]]\n\n  I came to Congress in 1985. What if we had passed a balanced budget \namendment to the Constitution that year and achieved balance in 1990? \nImagine what we could have been doing with that money, which by now \nwould have accumulated to $1.7 trillion. We could have built 97 space \nstations. We could have increased funding for the EPA 261 times. \nImagine the potential of crime control programs if the Department of \nJustice just received 98 times more than this year's level. If we \nbalanced the budget in 1985 and continued the current rate of spending, \nwe could have done all of those things. If you did not like them, fund \nsomething else.\n\n  What if Congress had balanced the budget in 1970 and kept it \nbalanced? That was the year after we started the deficit spending. What \nif we actually had a $5 trillion surplus? We could preserve both \nMedicare and the Social Security Program for our children. Veterans \nbenefits and services could be increased by 116 times. We could provide \ntax refunds instead of tax increases. Instead of imposing fees to enter \nour parks, we could increase funding for national parks by 4,000 times.\n  So when you hear the people come to the floor and say it does not \nmatter, we do not need to clutter the Constitution, that is not \ncluttering the Constitution. That is a well-needed amendment. Had we \ndone this in 1970--true, we would not need the amendment. That is why \nwe have the amendment process, Mr. President. The U.S. Constitution \nshould be amended only in the gravest of times, only when it is \nnecessary. How much graver can you get than the kind of debt we are \npassing on to our children? How much graver can you get than a $10 to \n$15 to $20 trillion debt? That is where we are headed.\n  It has been changed 27 times, this Constitution. It affects every \nsingle Government activity and all Federal spending and touches the \nlife of every man, woman, and child in our Nation, this issue of debt. \nA constitutional requirement makes it impossible for Congress to shirk \nits duty to make responsible fiscal decisions. That is what this debate \nis about: discipline by a constitutional requirement. No copout. You \ncannot have Senators coming on the floor, giving all these excuses, \nbecause it is in the Constitution. So they will have to do it. We may \ndisagree on what we want to cut or what we have to do to balance that \nbudget. We may disagree on that, and we will have that debate, vote, \nand take our lumps one way or the other, but we have to do it. We have \nto do it. That is what we have to do now. Congress will have to come up \nwith cures for the Nation's financial woes, not just Band-Aids, and not \njust words.\n  In a very few years, Mr. President--I am sure Senator Hatch and \nothers have said this on the floor--in a very few years, interest rates \non the debt plus entitlements will equal 100 percent of the Federal \nbudget. That is the good news. The bad news is it is continuing to \nexpand, that interest is consuming more and more and more of that pie, \nincluding the entitlement pie, because, theoretically, if we do not \nstop it, it will consume everything. If you think of your homes, your \nbusinesses, you can only go to the bank so many times and then they put \nthe stop on, the cap on the credit card, the cap on your credit, and \nsay, ``Now you have to live within your means,'' that is what this \namendment will force this Congress to do.\n  Despite compelling evidence of the need for immediate deficit \ncontrol, legislative budget controls have failed to produce a budget \nsurplus since 1969. We tried it with Gramm-Rudman. It sounded good. \nWhat happened? When we went to the sequester, when the rubber hit the \nroad and we had to make the decision, we changed the law. We copped \nout. You cannot change this law. If we pass it into the Constitution, \nit is constitutional, you have to do it.\n  Deficit spending is no mystery, although some would prefer it remain \nso. In fact, on Thursday, the Senator from North Dakota displayed a \nchart titled, ``We Cut the Deficit in Half.'' While it is true that the \ndeficit projections are decidedly better than the May 1996 estimates, \nwhat actually accounts for the rosier outlook? The welfare reform \nlegislation we passed last year had the greatest budgetary impact of \nany piece of legislation passed by the 104th Congress, according to \nCBO. This was the bill which President Clinton had to be dragged \nkicking and screaming to sign. And he apologized for signing it, but he \nsigned it. That is the important thing. In addition, in his recent \nbudget request, the President now proposes to add $22 billion in new \nspending to that welfare bill. Yet, he wants us to trust legislative \nremedies. Legislative remedies don't work, folks, because of human \nnature--the temptation to spend.\n\n  With a balanced budget constitutional amendment, we don't have to \nworry about the whims and indulgences of a President, or Congresses, in \nyears to come. Congress would have to stick to a strict budget just \nlike American families and businesses. We need to pass this amendment. \nWe need to pass it now. We should have passed it years ago. We could \nhave passed it 2 years ago. We lost by one vote. All we are doing, my \ncolleagues, is giving the American people a chance to have this go to \ntheir State legislatures so that they, then, can act to either approve \nor disapprove what we do. We are giving them the opportunity.\n  Over the last 60 years, total Federal expenditures have increased by \nmore than 800 percent. By 2020, if we do not raise taxes, we can zero \nout all Federal spending, except interest on the debt, and still not \nbalance the budget. That is why we need it now.\n  Now, it's interesting that when we think about balancing the budget, \nwe think about it in terms that are perhaps away from home--this big \nissue balancing the Federal budget, don't spend this or that. Let me \ngive an example. In New Hampshire, my State, the average citizen pays \nas much as $38,000 more on a 30-year mortgage for an $80,000 home as a \nresult of the budget being out of balance. A student in New Jersey pays \nalmost $9,000 more toward a 10-year loan. In just 1 year, a car owner \nin South Dakota could save $180 on an average auto loan, if we balance \nthe budget and keep it balanced. The Concord Coalition estimates that \nthe average family's income is $15,000-plus a year lower because of the \ndeficits of the past 20 years. It impacts everyone--whether you work or \ndon't, whether you have children or whether you don't. We can improve \nwages. We can create jobs. A 2-point cut in interest rates would not \nonly reduce loan payments for families, but it would produce more jobs, \nperhaps 4\\1/2\\ million more in 10 years. For businesses, a 2-point \npercentage reduction in rates would lower investment costs and enhance \nthe incentive to invest.\n  I don't want to have to explain to my children someday, as we look \nback on this debate, why I stood here and mortgaged away their future. \nI am standing on this floor today, proudly in the sense that I support \nthis amendment, but in a way ashamed that we have to. A baby born today \ncan expect that over $187,000 of his or her lifetime income will be \nused just to pay interest on the debt--$187,000.\n  Paul Tsongas, our former colleague, described Congress' deficit \nspending as ``generationally immoral.'' He was right. He was right a \nlot. I wish some of the colleagues on the other side of the aisle would \nhave listened to their former colleague. We must look for a real long-\nterm solution to address the retirement of the baby boom generation and \nthe explosion of entitlement programs that will accompany this shift. \nWe must not push off these disasters and leave them to my children and \nyour children to solve. In simple terms, when we all shuffle off this \nplanet at some time--hopefully, later rather than sooner--you would \nprobably like to leave your assets to your children. Do you sit up at \nnight and dream about leaving them your debts, your mortgage, your car \npayments? Or would you like to leave whatever you were able to build up \nas assets?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BOB SMITH. May I have 2 more minutes?\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 2 more minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. BOB SMITH. I thank my colleague. The conclusion is that there is \na light at the end of this tunnel. You know what stands in the way of \nthat light, Mr. President? About three votes--three votes. Maybe two. \nSenator Hatch is counting the votes. I haven't been counting them all. \nBut it's two or three votes, two or three U.S. Senators\n\n[[Page S1174]]\n\nwho are probably on the fence. That is the difference. That is how \nclose it is. We lost it by one vote 2 years ago.\n\n  Votes do matter. That is the difference between trillions in more \ndebt and mortgaging our future or not. Senator Rudman, my New Hampshire \ncolleague, said to me one time, ``There are only two things that can \nhappen if we don't stop this insane process. First, we can continue to \ndeficit spend and just cause sheer chaos when we can't pay our bills \nand go bankrupt. Or, second, we can print more money and sit around \nwith 200, 300 percent inflation.'' We should all think about what that \nwould do to our daily lives.\n  There is no other option if we don't balance the budget. It is \ninsane. Every American--man, woman, and child--in this country knows it \nis insane. They know it. You know you would not put up with it with \nyour school board, your business, or your local government, town \ngovernment; but you let the Federal Government, the Congress men and \nwomen spend you into oblivion. There is a light at the end of the \ntunnel, and I hope that the U.S. Senate and the Senators won't block \nthat light. I hope this month the Senate will show the American people \nthat they are interested in the future of our country and our children. \nThank you very much.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his contribution \nto this debate. I agree with him that there are many leaders in both \npolitical parties who come to this issue with complete sincerity. He \nhas noted my predecessor, Senator Paul Simon of Illinois, the late Paul \nTsongas of Massachusetts, Warren Rudman, and the list goes on--men and \nwomen who have taken the time to analyze this situation and have come \nto the conclusion that a balanced budget amendment is in the best \ninterest of this Nation.\n  I respect all of those people, but I respectfully disagree with them \nwhen it comes to the specific language of this amendment. There is a \nreason why the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Rubin, after 26 years on \nWall Street, came before our Judiciary Committee and testified that \nabsent an amendment, such as the one I am offering today, this \nprocedure that we are enshrining in the Constitution will tie our hands \nin times of economic emergency and recession. It will turn recessions \ninto deeper recessions or even depressions. We can't justify that, in \nthe name of clinging to the old school language of the balanced budget \namendment. The Senator from New Hampshire says we may be within one or \ntwo votes.\n  I say to the Senator from New Hampshire, if we can sit down in a \ncalm, bipartisan way and address two aspects of this balanced budget \namendment, the supermajority gridlock when it comes to a national \ndisaster or national economic emergency, and protection of the Social \nSecurity trust fund, I would daresay to my friend from New Hampshire \nthat we would not be quibbling over two votes. This amendment would \nleave the floor of the Senate and the House with the kind of \nsubstantial bipartisan majority which would say to the legislatures \nacross America that this amendment is a better one, a better version. \nBut you know what happens in this town, in ``Wonderland, DC.'' Special \ninterest groups get dug in. You can't change a word. If you touch a \nword of it, you are betraying all of the trust that has been given you. \nPlease, how seldom we rise to amend this Constitution. Should we not do \nit in a way that is responsible, in a way that meets the requirements \nof our future?\n  You know, during the worst days of our budget deficits, during the \nReagan and Bush administrations, there were many Members of the House--\nmost are not serving now--that I served with, who used the balanced \nbudget amendment as a figleaf for their fiscal recklessness. They would \nrush down and vote for these unbalanced budgets. They would lard up \ntheir districts. They would vote for big spending here and there. And \nthen, when people said, ``Well, how do you explain doing this when it \nproduces such deficits?'' ``I am for a balanced budget amendment, I \nwant to amend the Constitution, and I want to make it against the law \nfor people to do what I am doing. That shows you how sincere I am.''\n\n  Now we are like generals fighting the last war. That mentality, that \nlanguage, brought to 1997 is what we want to put in and enshrine in \nthis Constitution, saying that the wording and terms are inviolate, \nignoring the realities. And, yet, the Treasury Secretary and over 1,000 \nrecognized experts on the economy have come forward and warned us. They \nhave warned us to think twice about this. It may have a surface \npolitical appeal. But how on God's green Earth is it going to work?\n  The chairman spoke eloquently in the debate on Thursday regarding my \namendment and said, ``The very purpose of this provision of the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois is to make a balanced budget \namendment easier to waive.'' He went on to say, ``Instead of trying to \nfind ways to avoid fiscal responsibility, we ought to be working toward \npassing a strong balanced budget amendment that will help us to keep \nout of recessions in the first place.''\n  I would like to say to the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee that if he can help us craft an amendment that will \nabolish recessions in the American economy, I will certainly consider \nit carefully. But I do not think we gain anything by suggesting that a \nbalanced budget amendment will put an end to the business cycle. With \nor without this amendment we will someday face a recession, and the \nquestion is, How will we respond?\n  For those who question whether or not this Senator from Illinois will \nvote for a balanced budget amendment, I have voted for five balanced \nbudget amendments--five versions that protected Social Security, \navoided the supermajority gridlock, and addressed important issues that \nprotect the American people particularly in times of recession.\n  I would also like to make note of another element. Some say that this \nwill lead to irresponsible behavior by the Senate and the House; that, \nif the Durbin amendment is adopted requiring only a majority vote, the \npeople will exploit this amendment. I do not think the critics have \ntaken a close look. If the critics of this amendment will read it \ncarefully, they will see that, in my amendment, anxiety is not the \nbasis for waiving the balanced budget. They will see that it requires, \nin fact, specific action by the House and by the Senate for waiving.\n  First, there must be an economic recession, or a serious economic \nemergency in the United States.\n  Second, Congress, must declare that there is such a recession, or \nserious economic emergency, by joint resolution.\n  Third, that resolution must be adopted by a majority of the whole \nnumber of each House.\n  Fourth, that resolution must become law, which means it must be \nsigned by the President, or enacted over his veto by two-thirds vote of \nboth Houses.\n  I do not believe that any future Congress will view this as an escape \nhatch to ignore the requirements of a balanced budget. If they do, it \nwill be at their own political peril.\n  I believe that the requirement which I have in my amendment to the \nbalanced budget amendment will require public accountability, a record \nvote, and the determination by the House and the Senate that, in fact, \nwe do face an economic emergency.\n  The chairman has also said we do not need the Durbin amendment; that \nwhat we need to do is to run a surplus in our Treasury so we have a so-\ncalled rainy day fund that we can turn to to take care of working \nfamilies who have lost their jobs. Unfortunately, the lead witness \ncalled by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to testify on behalf \nof the balanced budget amendment, former OMB Director James Miller, who \nis living proof of the redemption of politics, a man who has presided \nover a series of deficits as OMB Director and now is totally committed \nto a balanced budget since he no longer holds that position, came \nbefore us and said that, if he could change one thing in this balanced \nbudget amendment, he would allow the Federal Government to establish a \nrainy day fund, or a stabilization fund.\n\n  Mr. Miller knows, I know, and I think most do, the language being \noffered by the chairman in Senate Joint Resolution 1 does not allow the \ncreation of a surplus, or this rainy day fund, to be there when our \neconomy is in need. That, I think, is a serious shortcoming.\n  Chairman Greenspan of the Federal Reserve Board, a man credited by \nboth\n\n[[Page S1175]]\n\npolitical parties despite controversy of having used monetary policy to \nstabilize our economy, was testifying before the Budget Committee when \nI asked him point blank, ``Are you for a balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution?'' He said that we should not put ``detailed economic \npolicy'' into the Constitution. I asked him about the automatic \nstabilizers, the Government coming to the rescue of an economy because \nof a recession. He said, ``It is far better to have a surplus or rainy \nday fund.''\n  I am sorry to tell Chairman Greenspan that the balanced budget \namendment before us today does not give us that option. It does not \ngive us that option and, because it does not give us that option, is \nfatally flawed.\n  Let me speak to the supermajority vote again. Not only would a \nsupermajority vote result in too many of our predecessors failing to \nratify our Constitution but a supermajority vote--think about this for \na moment. Think about it in the context of the last 24 months, the last \n24 months when this Government was in such chaos and gridlock that we \nhad Government shutdowns. Because of the requirement of a supermajority \nvote? No. Because of the requirement of a majority vote to extend the \ndebt limit of the United States. Facing the need to pass a debt limit \nbill simply acknowledging our obligation for debt already incurred, or \nabout to be incurred, we could not do it by majority vote. Without that \ndebt limit extension, Federal law required that the functions of \nGovernment stop. The Government was shut down not once but twice for a \ntotal of 27 days at the cost to taxpayers of over $1.4 billion for the \nfailure of Congress to muster a majority vote.\n  Now we hear from the proponents of this amendment, ``Trust me. If we \nget into trouble, if there is a regional economic recession, if there \nis a disaster, a Midwest flood, or hurricane in Florida, surely this \nCongress will come together and do the responsible thing.'' Well, we \nsaw, unfortunately, in recent memory when the Congress did not rise to \nits responsibility, or rise to the occasion, and allowed these terrible \nGovernment shutdowns for lack of a majority vote. And now we are \nputting in the Constitution of the United States clear language to \nrequire a supermajority to respond to a national economic emergency.\n  The Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, said on Friday that past \nCongresses have passed economic stimulus packages in times of recession \nwhen they were needed with the necessary 60 votes, including 1993. \nUnfortunately, his recollection was not accurate. The inability to \nobtain 60 votes prevented enactment of antirecession legislation in \n1993, and even the President's deficit reduction package, which turned \nout to be a tremendous boost to the economy, passed this body only when \nthe Vice President voted with an ``aye'' vote. By supermajority it \nnever would have occurred, and I am not certain where we would stand \ntoday in terms of our economic situation.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what we need to do for families is to \nresist the higher interest costs on the mortgages, student loans, \nconsumer purchases, auto loans, et cetera. If Congress can get its \nfiscal house in order, more jobs will be created and those jobs will be \nmore secure. If Congress stops borrowing so much, we will have a more \nstable economy, which, of course, can help us to avoid these economic \ndownturns in the first place. The only way we are going to get there is \nto quit piling the 29th unbalanced budget and the 30th and the 31st on \ntop of each other.\n  The fact of the matter is the balanced budget amendment is flexible \nenough to respond to most needs--in fact, all needs. Put it that way. \nBut it is serious enough to stop Congress from continuing the pattern \nof borrowing year after year which has kept the economy from growing as \nwell as it could have.\n  My colleague from Illinois has introduced an amendment that seeks to \nwaive the provisions of Senate Joint Resolution 1 for any fiscal year \nin which there is an economic recession or serious economic emergency. \nAs such, the Durbin amendment seeks to avoid the three-fifths vote \nrequired by Senate Joint Resolution 1 to waive the balanced budget \nrule. This three-fifths majority was placed in the balanced budget \namendment so that a simple majority of the Congress could not run \ndeficits except in important situations--those recognized by a \nsupermajority of the Members. Efforts such as the Durbin amendment \nwould blow a huge hole in the balanced budget amendment.\n  The terms used in the Durbin amendment is undefined. The \ndetermination of an economic recession or serious economic emergency \ncould easily be manipulated by a spendthrift Congress as a way to avoid \nthe discipline of the balanced budget amendment. Thus, the amendment \nwould create a giant loophole that would swallow the balanced budget \nrule.\n  Remember, also, that if the balanced budget amendment is waived for a \nrecession, it is waived for all spending in that year. In other words, \nthis amendment would permit deficit spending for any number of wasteful \nprojects that are in no way related to the so-called economic \nemergency. Just remember President Clinton's 1993 attempt to push \nthrough a multi-billion dollar boondoggle under the guise of trying to \nend a recession which had in fact already ended. In short, Mr. \nPresident, if you take your finger out of the hole in the dike, the \nwhole town is going to be flooded.\n  One of the arguments made in favor of this amendment is that without \nit, the balanced budget amendment will somehow inhibit the functioning \nof the so-called automatic stabilizers. Mr. President, I believe the \nimportance of automatic stabilizers has been overstated and, in any \ncase, the balanced budget amendment will not inhibit their functioning. \nMoreover, the Durbin amendment does not respond to the concerns raised \nabout the automatic stabilizers. It simply allows Congress to avoid the \nbalanced budget rule by a lower threshold.\n  Just to be clear on what these stabilizers are supposed to do, the \nnotion of automatic stabilizers has to do primarily with the belief \nthat in an economic downturn, there is a decrease in tax revenues and a \nconcomitant increase in unemployment compensation and other welfare \npayments.\n  The claim that the automatic stabilizers have moderated the business \ncycle is based on the assumption that the relative increases in \nGovernment spending associated with automatic stabilizers causes \nautomatic, effective counter-cyclical fiscal policy. It is argued that \nsuch increased spending is the key to moderating both the depth and \nlength of recessions and that the balanced budget amendment will \nprevent that spending from occurring.\n  I believe the characterization of the effectiveness of the automatic \nstabilizers has been overstated.\n  When appearing before the Senate Budget Committee just last month, \nCBO Director June O'Neill was asked a question about the relationship \nbetween automatic stabilizers and the apparent moderation in the \nbusiness cycle over the last half-century. She cited better monetary \npolicy and the Nation's move from away an agricultural based economy, \nwith the inherent ups and downs that go along with agriculture, as \nfactors at least as important as automatic stabilizers in minimizing \nrecessions. Additionally, the move to a service economy and better \ninventory management practices have reduced the fluctuations associated \nwith inventory overstocks and the factory economy.\n  Further, a financial markets expert pointed out to the Judiciary \nCommittee that the primary reasons why the business cycle has moderated \nin recent years are, first, monetary policy, which is controlled by the \nFederal Reserve Board; and second, the increasing efficiency of private \nmarkets, because of better information and other factors. These have \nnothing to do with automatic stabilizers or fiscal policy.\n  It is relatively well-recognized that the perceived moderation of the \nbusiness cycle over recent decades is due to many factors. For example, \na December 2, 1996 article in the Washington Post affirmed, ``The \nsuccess in finally halting the U.S. economic roller-coaster has been \nthe result of many elements * * *''\n  The Post article cited ``new technologies, the deregulation of many \nindustries, and the increased\n\n[[Page S1176]]\n\nglobalization of business and finance,'' as some of the most important \nchanges that helped stabilize our economy. Global trade enables us to \nexport what would otherwise be oversupply thus avoiding a bust cycle.\n  Further, that article quoted Herb Stein, a former chairman of the \nCouncil of Economic Advisors, who noted that ``[b]ecause the economy is \nso big and so diversified and so open to the world economy, a shock \nwould have less impact now.'' Thus, an event that may have sent the \ncountry into a recession in 1890 would only be a localized disturbance \ntoday.\n  Another major factor in helping to tranquilize recessions that the \nPost recognized is that we are no longer on the gold standard. ``After \nthe United States was no longer obligated to defend the price of gold, \nand the nation's deficits in international transactions could be \nfinanced easily by that world capital market, the Fed had far more \nability to set interest rates according to the needs of the domestic \neconomy.''\n  So while these automatic stabilizers may have had some effect, there \nare clearly many other major factors that have brought our economy to \nthe level of consistency we enjoy today.\n  Certainly the automatic stabilizers are no justification for \nbalancing the budget only eight times in the last 65 years. Let's face \nit. Our deficits have not been countercyclical, they have been \ncounterproductive. While business cycles have come and gone over the \nlast four decades, our deficit habit has not. Our deficits are \nstructural and largely permanent, not cyclical.\n  I also want to note that the notion of a country spending itself out \nof a recession is now rejected by many economists. One commentator has \nwryly stated that the theory of spending and borrowing out of a \nrecession ``is the game-plan that propelled Argentina and Bolivia to \neconomic superpower status in the 1970's.'' More recently, Japan has \ntried to do this and the result has been continued recession and larger \ndebt. On the other hand, a number of the world's up-and-coming \ncountries are enjoying booming economies while keeping their national \nbudget in balance or even surplus. Perhaps we should be more concerned \nthat we do not spend ourselves out of prosperity.\n  But even if we assume that automatic stabilizers are important, Mr. \nPresident, the balanced budget amendment will not impede their use.\n  The balanced budget amendment in no way prevents us from running a \nsmall surplus, which could be used to offset the effects of an economic \ndownturn, thus avoiding a deficit. In fact, a number of experts the \nJudiciary Committee has heard over the years have suggested we do so. \nFred Bergsten, a noted economist and former Treasury Department \nofficial, suggests we create a habit of regularly shooting for a small \nsurplus, rather than absolute balance, which will allow us to use \nfiscal policy within the balanced budget rule better than we can now \nwithout it, with chronic, structural deficits.\n  Even if we drop below an intended annual rainy day surplus, the \nbalanced budget amendment has anticipated this sort of need. A three-\nfifths vote in Congress will allow the balanced budget rule to be \nsuspended for a year. That way, we have the flexibility to run \nreasonable deficits if we need to. The three-fifths requirement makes \nsure that we do not waive the amendment unless it is a true need and \nnot just an attempt to avoid the tough choices.\n  Some have suggested that the necessary three-fifths will be hard to \ncome by. The history of the votes in Congress demonstrate that in \nactual circumstances of economic need, the Congress has had little \ndifficulty achieving the vote that would be required under the balanced \nbudget amendment, despite the fact that no such requirement was in \nplace.\n  The Congress has voted a number of times to extend the emergency \nunemployment compensation program. During the past 15 years, according \nto the Congressional Research Service, there is only one instance where \nthe extension of this important program failed to garner a \nsupermajority of votes in either Chamber. Indeed, in many cases even \nhigher supermajority requirements would have been fulfilled. In times \nof real need, Congress will get a three-fifths vote.\n  Some have also argued that the Durbin amendment is needed because \nCongress is too slow to respond to recessions. Well, they are half \nright. Congress is too slow to respond to recessions. Almost everyone \nagrees that when Congress tries to spend the country out of an economic \ndownturn, their attempt either has little effect or they make things \nworse by spending as the economy is already recovering and then sowing \nthe seeds of a future recession.\n  But the Durbin amendment does nothing to address this concern. It \ndoes not speed up congressional action--I'm not sure anything can. All \nit does is change the vote required from three-fifths to a majority. \nAnd since history clearly shows that we get the three-fifths when we \nneed it, all this amendment would do is make it easier to waive the \nbalanced budget rule when we don't really need it.\n  Finally, Mr. President, when he introduced his amendment the Senator \nfrom Illinois told a story about a friend who needed temporary help \nfrom the Government in his transition from one job to another. There is \nno doubt that this is a meaningful and laudable use of our precious \nresources.\n  But it seems to me that we do all the working people of America a lot \nmore good if we balance the budget, and thus reduce the number of \nrecessions that they must endure, than if we create a loophole in the \nbalanced budget amendment to allow future Congresses to easily increase \nthe already crushing burden of debt. We ought to be less concerned \nabout when we can spend more, and more concerned about when we must \nspend less.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment seeks to waive the provisions of Senate \nJoint Resolution 1 for any fiscal year in which there is an economic \nrecession or serious economic emergency in the United States as \ndeclared by joint resolution. As such, the Durbin amendment seeks to \navoid the three-fifths vote majority prescribed by Senate Joint \nResolution 1 in avoiding the requirement that receipts match outlays \nfor any given fiscal year. This three-fifths majority was placed in the \nbalanced budget amendment so that a simple majority of the Congress \ncould not run deficits except in important situations--those recognized \nby a supermajority of the members. Efforts such as the Durbin amendment \nwill render Senate Joint Resolution 1 useless.\n  The Durbin amendment is wholly unnecessary. A brief analysis of \nhistorical fact will demonstrate that in circumstances of national \ndisaster or economic downturn, the Congress has had little difficulty \npassing remedial legislation with supermajority support.\n  The history of votes in this body demonstrates that in actual \ncircumstances of economic assistance for unemployment or disaster \nrelief, the Congress has had little difficulty achieving the \nsupermajority vote that would be required under the balanced budget \namendment. The Congressional Research Service helped me do some \nresearch on voting patterns in this area. I want to present for you the \nresults of my research because I think it is illustrative.\n  Let me summarize the results briefly: On the question of responding \nto economic recessions, the Congress has voted a number of times to \nextend the emergency unemployment compensation program. During the past \n15 years, I count only one instance where the extension of this \nimportant program failed to garner a supermajority of votes in either \nChamber, based on Congressional Research Service data.\n  Similarly, in the area of disaster relief, over the past 7 years, I \nfound that in virtually every circumstance, emergency spending bills \nplaced before the House and Senate passed with supermajorities, on the \norder required by the balanced budget amendment, even though no such \nrequirement was in place.\n  Let me go into more detail on the unemployment compensation votes. \nH.R. 3167, which became Public Law 103-152, extended the emergency \nunemployment compensation program [EUCP] in November 1993. This \nconference report passed the House with a vote of 320 to 105 and passed \nthe Senate, 79 to 20. The underlying bill achieved similar majorities, \npassing the House 320 to 105, and the Senate 79 to 20. In March 1993, \nanother emergency unemployment compensation bill passed the Congress \nand became Public Law 103-6. The\n\n[[Page S1177]]\n\nsupermajority on H.R. 920 in the Senate was 66 to 33, and the vote in \nthe House was 254 to 161.\n  In 1992, the House passed the conference report on H.R. 5260, to \nextend the EUCP, by a vote of 396 to 23. The Senate acted similarly, \npassing the bill, which became Public Law 102-318, by a vote of 93 to \n3. Also in 1992, the Senate passed H.R. 4095 to extend the EUCP by a \nvote of 94 to 2. The House passed the same bill, which became Public \nLaw 102-244, by a vote of 404 to 8.\n  In 1991, the House passed S. 1722, to provide emergency unemployment \ncompensation, by a vote of 294 to 127. The Senate passed the same bill, \nwhich was vetoed by the President, by a vote of 69 to 30. Similarly, \nthe House passed the conference report on this bill by a vote of 300 to \n118 and the Senate passed the measure 65 to 35. Earlier in 1991, the \nHouse passed H.R. 3201, to provide emergency unemployment compensation, \nby a vote of 375 to 45. This measure became Public Law 102-107. The \nSenater passed it by voice vote. Finally, H.R. 1281 was passed in March \n1991, providing funding for the Unemployment Compensation \nAdministration [UCA]. This bill passed the House with a vote of 365 to \n43. It passed the Senate by a vote of 92 to 8. The conference report on \nthis bill, Public Law 102-27, passed with tallies of 340 to 48 and 93 \nto 3, respectively. In 1990, the House passed H.R. 4404, to provide \nfunding for the UCA, by a vote of 362 to 59. The conference report \npassed 308 to 108. This bill became Public Law 101-302, after passing \nthe Senate by voice vote.\n  All the way back in 1983, the Senate passed H.R. 1718, to provide \nfunds for the Unemployment Trust Fund. The bill, Public Law 98-8, \npassed the Senate 82 to 15. Finally, the Senate voted in February 1982 \nto pass House Joint Resolution 391, to provide funding for the \nEmployment and Training Administration, by a vote of 95 to 0.\n  What do these vote tallies indicate? They demonstrate that the Durbin \namendment is completely unnecessary. During the past 15 years, my \nresearch reveals only one instance where a vote to provide unemployment \ncompensation during a period of economic recession did not pass by a \nsupermajority. One time in 15 years. That's remarkable.\n  Similarly, in the area of disaster relief, Congress has \noverwhelmingly acted by supermajority votes in responding to crises.\n  In fiscal year 1995, the House and Senate voted on H.R. 1944, which \nprovided $7.2 billion disaster aid, mostly to help with recovery \nefforts in Los Angeles from the 1994 earthquake. The bill passed the \nSenate with a vote of 90 to 7--a clear supermajority. In the House, the \nbill passed with 276 votes--also a supermajority.\n  The 1994 fiscal year Disaster Supplemental Appropriations bill, H.R. \n3759, received similar treatment. That bill, to provide nearly $10 \nbillion in new appropriation for the emergency expenses of the Los \nAngeles earthquake, humanitarian assistance and peacekeeping \nactivities, as well as for Midwest flood assistance and highway \nreconstruction from the San Francisco earthquake, passed the House by a \nvote of 337 to 74--not really close, was it, to the 261 required for \nthe three-fifths vote. The same measure passed the Senate by a vote of \n85 to 10.\n  The 1993 fiscal year disaster supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. \n2667, providing nearly $3 billion for emergency relief from the \nwidespread flooding in the Midwest and other natural disasters, passed \nthe House by a vote of 400 to 27. The Senate adopted it by voice vote.\n  In 1992, the disaster relief supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. \n5132, passed the Senate by a supermajority vote of 61 to 36. The bill \nprovided $2 billion in new budget authority for fiscal year 1992, \nincluding funds for disaster assistance and loans to respond to the Los \nAngeles riots and the Chicago tunnel collapse and subsequent flooding. \nIn the House, the same bill passed by a vote of 244 to 162.\n  Also in 1992, the defense and disaster supplemental appropriations \nbill, H.R. 5620, providing $10 billion in grants and loans to help \nvictims of Hurricane Andrew, Typhoon Omar and Hurricane Iniki, passed \nthe Senate by a vote of 84 to 10, it passed the House by a vote of 297 \nto 124. Finally, the 1992 supplemental appropriations bill passed the \nSenate with a vote of 75 to 17. This bill provided $8 billion for \nOperations Desert Shield and Desert Storm as well as other moneys for \ncommunities recovering from other natural disasters. The same bill \npassed the House by a vote of 252 to 162. The conference report passed \nthe House by a vote of 303 to 114.\n  Last, the 1990 continuing appropriations bill, House Joint Resolution \n423, provided disaster assistance generally. This bill passed the House \nby a vote of 321 to 99, and passed the Senate by a vote of 97 to 1.\n  During the past 7 years, we have voted many times on emergency \ndisaster funding programs. I count only two situations where a \nsupermajority was not reached--this despite the fact that no \nsupermajority was needed.\n  The facts are hard to refute. The Durbin amendment clearly has little \nor no factual basis when compared to the voting record of the Congress. \nWhen the situation warrants, either because of economic recession or \nnatural disaster, this body has had little difficulty achieving a \nsupermajority of votes to pass needed spending programs. The balanced \nbudget amendment has the flexibility necessary to respond to true \nemergencies. Creating loopholes like the Durbin amendment only serve to \nmake deficit-spending as a matter of course easier.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I think the chairman, the Senator from \nUtah, concluded that automatic stabilizers do have some impact. I think \nthat the chairman would agree with me that for a person who has lost \nhis job or a person who has lost her job, the prospect of turning to \nthe Government for unemployment insurance to continue to keep your \nfamily together not only stabilizes your situation while you search for \nanother job but helps to stabilize the economy.\n  I think the Senator from Utah would agree with me that unemployed \nworkers seeking retraining and additional education to find a job in \nfact help to stabilize our economy. And that is exactly the point of \nthis debate.\n  I would concede every point made by the chairman about all of the \nother stabilizers that have evolved in our economy if he would concede \nthat there is still a legitimate role of specific programs which step \nin to help the unemployed family.\n  Let me give you an illustration of this which has been used in this \ndebate before. This is an illustration of the business cycle in America \nfrom 1870 forward. The spikes on the top of the line are the good news. \nThat is when the economy was expanding, businesses were growing, \nfarmers were doing well, and jobs were being created.\n  But every time we dip below this line, we see unemployment, \nbusinesses going out of business, farmers quitting, heading to town. \nAnd look at these spikes in the economy on the negative side leading up \nuntil about 1945 or 1947--much more pronounced, much more dramatic, \ndeeper recessions, depressions, millions of Americans put out of work.\n  But what happened after the mid-1940's? We see the downturns, but \nthey are barely noticeable in comparison to what occurred before that \ntime.\n  Automatic stabilizers. The things which the Senator from Utah noted--\nglobal economy, monetary policy, so many other things--but what happens \nare the things I have noted as well. Families out of work had a place \nto turn. It was no longer survival of the fittest. If you had personal \nresponsibility, if you were held accountable, you had a means to get \nback on your feet.\n  Last Thursday, in this debate I talked about my friend, Bob Bergen, \nwho lost his job at the factory in Springfield. Bob came by my house \nyesterday in Springfield, and we were talking about it. I said, ``Bob, \nremind me. How did you get out of that factory job?'' which he had been \nat for 22 years. They closed down the factory, and he got into the \nbusiness of furnaces and air-conditioning. I said, ``What was the name \nof the program?''\n  ``The JTPA Program. I signed up for it, and I went to the community \ncollege. I took the courses, and when they closed that plant, I was \nready to do something with my life.''\n  JTPA is a Federal Government program. It is one of the automatic \nstabilizers we have used in the past. To\n\n[[Page S1178]]\n\ndiscount that or dismiss it and say that it has nothing to do with Bob \nBergen now in a good business in Springfield, IL, employing his son, I \nmight add, as are so many millions of others, is to ignore reality.\n  Let me address one other point raised by the chairman.\n  The chairman says that my use of the term ``economic recession'' is \njust not precise enough. I call the attention of the chairman to Senate \nJoint Resolution 1, to his own language, which allows, in section 5, \nCongress to waive all the provisions of the balanced budget amendment \nin times that ``the United States is engaged in military conflict which \ncauses an imminent and serious military threat to national security.''\n  What does it mean? Troops in the field, troops under fire, whether or \nnot we suspect that might occur or it already has? These sorts of \nthings suggest that whatever the language of this constitutional \namendment, our implementing legislation is going to have to be there to \nmake certain that it is explained in detail.\n  At this time I yield to the ranking Democrat, Senator Leahy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  I do support the Durbin amendment. I stated earlier that I wish it \nwould not be tabled, that we would have a straight up-or-down vote, but \nI think the American public understands what the vote means.\n  I was interested in hearing my friend, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, the senior Senator from Utah, oppose the Durbin amendment \nlast week by saying the proposed constitutional amendment does not need \nthe flexibility of the Durbin amendment in times of economic crisis \nbecause we can build up yearly surpluses to handle tough times. The \ndistinguished chairman said:\n\n       The balanced budget amendment in no way prevents us from \n     running a reasonable surplus which could be used to offset \n     the effects of an economic downturn. This surplus would allow \n     us to use fiscal policy within the balanced budget rule \n     better than we can now without it.\n\n  Not quite so. The constitutional amendment does not have that \nflexibility. It is very specific as it is written, and it prohibits \nthis use of a rainy day fund. Indeed, those who support it--proponents' \nown witnesses before the Judiciary Committee over the course of the \nlast two Congresses--pointed this out and suggested the language be \namended to provide for such a rainy day fund. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois was present at those hearings this year when they were \nsaying just that.\n  Fred Bergsten in 1995 and James Miller in 1997, the witnesses brought \nby the proponents of the constitutional amendment, criticized the \nlanguage before us for not including the possibility of accumulating \nsurpluses in a rainy day fund. That is what we do to prepare for \neconomic downturns in my own State of Vermont.\n  So I hope we might pay attention to the Durbin amendment. I hope we \nmight support it.\n  The distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, \nchallenged the other side to explain the language in this proposed \nconstitutional amendment to say how it is going to work; what do the \nwords mean; what sections do what? In fact, nobody has taken up the \nByrd challenge. I urge the proponents to accept the challenge of \nSenator Byrd, if they can--I suspect they cannot--and say just what the \nwords mean.\n  If you read the words, they say, ``Total outlays for any fiscal year \nshall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.'' Then they \nprovide for waiver by a three-fifths majority --come on, that is not \ngoing to happen. The rainy day fund is out. It would require outlays, \nspecifically, those saved in the rainy day fund, to be expended in a \nlatter year and thereby exceed the total receipts for that fiscal year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter opposing the so-\ncalled balanced budget amendment for the Coalition for Budget Integrity \nbe printed in the Record. This is a coalition of approximately 150 \norganizations that oppose amending the U.S. Constitution to add a 28th \namendment on budgeting. The organizations range from labor unions and \nchildren's advocacy groups, to seniors' groups, teachers, religious and \nsecular charities, environmental groups, nutrition groups, and \nveterans.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                               Coalition for Budget Integrity,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 1997.\n\n                  Oppose the Balanced Budget Amendment\n\n       We, the undersigned organizations, strongly urge you to \n     oppose a balanced budget amendment to the United States \n     Constitution.\n       The proposed constitutional amendment is not the answer to \n     the nation's economic problems. The proposed balanced budget \n     amendment is likely to damage the economy more than \n     strengthen it. The amendment would require larger spending \n     cuts or tax increases in years of slow growth than in years \n     of rapid growth, precisely the opposite of what is needed to \n     stabilize the economy and avert recessions. The amendment \n     thus risks making economic recessions more frequent and \n     deeper.\n       A constitutional amendment would also be likely to limit \n     public investments which are critical to long-term economic \n     growth because the amendment fails to distinguish public \n     investments needed for growth from other areas of government \n     spending. The amendment would largely deny the federal \n     government a basic practice that most businesses, families, \n     and state and local governments use--borrowing to finance \n     investments with long-term payoffs.\n       This amendment has no place in the Constitution of the \n     United States. It would inappropriately draw the judicial \n     branch of government into the determination of fiscal and \n     economic policy. The amendment also undermines the important \n     constitutional principle of majority rule by establishing a \n     three-fifths vote to allow a budget to go unbalanced.\n       The American public has a right to know how a balanced \n     budget will be achieved before a balanced budget amendment is \n     enacted. Which important programs--education, health care, \n     social security, transportation, job training, environmental \n     protection, housing--will either be dramatically cut or \n     eliminated threatening America's vital interests?\n       We strongly urge you to oppose the constitutional balanced \n     budget amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n       AFSCME.\n       ACORN.\n

Mr. President, paralleling the position of the 1,060 \neconomists who banded together to oppose this constitutional amendment, \nthe 150 organizations that make up the Coalition for Budget Integrity \nargue that the proposed amendment is likely to damage the economy more \nthan strengthen it. They note that the amendment would require spending \ncuts or tax increases at just the wrong times. They are concerned that \nthe constitutional amendment would likely limit public investments by \nfailing to distinguish public investment from Government spending and \nfailing to allow for a capital budget. They correctly observe that the \nconstitutional amendment would draw the judicial branch into the \ndetermination of fiscal and economic policy and undercut the \nconstitutional principle of majority rule with supermajority three-\nfifths requirements to raise the debt limit and waive the provisions of \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. President, I also want to commend the honesty of Jack Kemp, who \nappeared yesterday on the NBC News television program, ``Meet The \nPress.''\n  Jack Kemp was quite honest in his appraisal of the so-called balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Jack Kemp said yesterday on national television:\n\n       I have never been enamored with putting a budget balanced \n     amendment into the Constitution. . . . I would not vote for \n     the Stenholm balanced budget amendment because it clearly is \n     a trap into which, I think, a future Congress would end up \n     keeping taxes high or raising taxes in a recession. . . . \n     It's a recipe for a future disaster for this country.\n\n  Jack Kemp said what I believe many Members of Congress privately \nbelieve, but are too afraid to say in public.\n  I believe Jack Kemp was right to speak his conscience and I hope more \nMembers of Congress will follow his courageous lead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes, 15 seconds. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time remains to us?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I give control of our remaining time to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me first of all react to the Senator \nfrom Vermont's inclusion of Jack Kemp's remarks of yesterday into the \nRecord. Jack Kemp does not support our balanced budget because he feels \nit is not strong enough in one respect; it does not require the tax \nlimitation that Jack Kemp believes is necessary. Over the years I have \ndebated this at length with Congressman Kemp. He knows that what our \namendment does is a substantial movement in the right direction. While \nI would have liked tax limitation over time, we know that is a vote \nthat cannot be won on the floor of the Senate or the House. That is why \nwe have left tax limitation up to the true limiters, and that is the \nelectorate, to decide if a tax increase should produce a change in the \nmakeup of the U.S. Congress. So we are not going to put our Government \non automatic pilot, as would be the subtle insinuation of Senator \nDurbin in arguing that, somehow, this amendment is not flexible enough \nand therefore we need his majority-vote waiver.\n  Let me talk about putting whims in the budget process, because I \nbelieve that is exactly what would be done if you favor the Durbin \namendment. It does not require this Senate to make tough choices, and \nit creates almost an unlimited opportunity for deficit spending. The \nbalanced budget amendment as we have proposed it, and as it has been \nintroduced on the floor of the Senate by Senator Hatch, is flexible \nenough. It allows deficit spending if 60 percent, or three-fifths of \nthe majority of the Congress, vote that way. If there is a true long-\nterm emergency, the votes will be there to respond to it.\n  Let me cite some examples. The Senator from Illinois knows these \nexamples. He has participated, as have I, in a fair number of them. \nFrom 1962 to the present, there have been 12 economic stimulus packages \npassed by Congress. All 12 have received three-fifths votes in the \nCongress. So, every time there was a true emergency and collectively \nthe Senate or the House decided it was just that, the three-fifths \nmajority written into this balanced budget amendment was garnered. In \nother words, when there is legitimacy, and not just the easy pass go \nthat we have had now for decades upon decades, that has built the stack \nof unbalanced budgets here on this table, but when it was really \nnecessary, the record clearly shows that the support of three-fifths of \nthe Congress was there.\n  Of course, there was one so-called economic stimulus package that did \nnot pass at first. We got involved in a\n\n[[Page S1180]]\n\nfilibuster in 1993 on a so-called stimulus package, but at that time a \nrecovery was already underway. Every economist in the country said, \n``We are in a recovery; why are you pumping more deficit spending into \nthe economy and risking a surge of inflation?'' And, of course, we did \nfilibuster, and that deficit spending package failed, largely because \nit was nickel-and-dime kind of stuff, to build a swimming pool here or \npaint a mural there or create some kind of make-work somewhere else. It \nhad nothing to do with job training to a great extent, or job creation. \nYet some were pushing it, even when economists were saying, ``Yes, in \nfact, the economy is recovering.''\n  But even when that first, large bill did not pass in 1993, an \noverwhelming majority of the Congress still showed compassion for those \nactually in need; we soon passed a stripped-down bill, which extended \nunemployment benefits.\n\n  While we do not use the word ``emergency'' in the balanced budget \namendment, clearly an emergency is whatever three-fifths of the \nCongress term it is. That is a reasonable test of what is a true \nemergency. So, those 12 economic stimulus packages that I referred to \nsince 1962 were deemed by the Congress to be important enough to garner \nthe three-fifths vote. Therefore the other day, several weeks ago, when \nthe President said, ``If you had a little flexibility in there for a \nrecession,'' and he was visiting with those of us who were proponents \nof this amendment, then he ``would show some kind of interest in it.'' \nI said, ``Well, it is there, Mr. President. You need to recognize that \nwe saw those needs and that is why we put inside the amendment the \nthree-fifths requirement that would be necessary to deficit spend.''\n  Some have said that recessions are often regional, that there are \neconomic areas within our country that fail to respond to recovery, and \nthat economics shifts occur unevenly. They say, without the Durbin \namendment, it would be hard to provide relief in those cases. If that \nis the case, why has there not been why has there not been a long list \nof regional recession relief bills that have been defeated? Or that \nhave passed only narrowly? No, the Congress has responded in time of \nneed and that is why all of these bills have gotten the three-fifths \nvote that we thought was a necessary safeguard for this amendment.\n  The Durbin amendment is based on a fundamental mistake. Let me repeat \nthat. The Durbin amendment is based on what I believe to be a \nfundamental mistake. Regularly balanced budgets do not harm the \neconomy, but saying they do is the mistake he makes. He assumes, as \ndoes the Secretary of the Treasury, that somehow balanced budgets are \ndangerous for the economy, or could create or worsen a downturn. And \nyet economists, liberal and conservative, argue a that balanced budgets \nwill lead to a sustained 2- to 2.5-percent drop in the overall interest \nrates. They would create jobs and a higher standard of living.\n  I see that as an economic stimulus. The balanced budget amendment \nwould create economic stimulus. Regularly balanced budgets would help \nthe economy. And yet we still recognized the need for putting into the \namendment some flexibility in the case of a recession and Congress \nneeding to respond to it.\n  The Durbin amendment simply guts the balanced budget amendment. It \nwould let a majority waive the requirement for a balanced budget on a \nwhim. It does not require that there be a real recession, merely that \nCongress declare one. It would not just allow the amount of deficit \nspending supposedly necessary or unavoidable because of an economic \nemergency--it would allow unlimited deficit spending.\n  If you go back and look at history, you find that economic growth was \ngreater, and average unemployment was lower, during those periods in \nwhich budgets were regularly balanced.\n  In fact, if Congress had passed the balanced budget amendment the \nfirst time I voted for it in 1982, the typical family's income would be \n$15,500 higher today. That is not my number, but was estimated by the \nConcord Coalition. According to the General Accounting Office, if we \nbalance the budget and keep it balanced, after 20 years, our children's \nstandard of living will be between 7 and 36 percent higher.\n  Deficits are the problem. The debt is the threat to the economic \nsecurity of our children, our seniors, and those who are vulnerable to \nchanges in the economy. Former Senator Paul Simon brought in liberal \neconomists who told us that the debt and deficit are so big, deficit \nspending is now useless as an economic stimulus.\n  The evidence does not show that balancing the budget makes recessions \nmore severe. Investors Business Daily pointed last week to a 1986 study \nthe National Bureau of Economic Research that said, when you adjust for \nthe different way data were collected before World War II, prewar and \npostwar recessions did not really differ significantly in length and \nseverity.\n  While the balanced budget amendment already, with its three-fifths \nvote requirement, anticipates the need to respond to a serious, long-\nterm economic problem, the Durbin amendment seems concerned with a \nrapid response to short-term swings. But Congress has a notoriously bad \ntrack record when it comes to short-term responses to the economy.\n  Every economic stimulus or anti-recession bill since 1949 was passed \nby Congress after the recession was over. But the Durbin amendment \nstill requires Congress to vote to waive the balanced budget \namendment--meaning it does not allow a prompt response, just an easy \nevasion.\n  The Durbin amendment has nothing to do with so-called automatic \nstabilizers. The balanced budget amendment already allows for automatic \nstabilizers. Section 6 of the balanced budget amendment allows for the \nhonest, good-faith use of estimates in legislation that implements a \nbalanced budget. Read the committee report: If Congress makes good-\nfaith, reasonable estimates of receipts and outlays, and then mid-year \nchanges in the economy cause a temporary deficit, that would not \ntrigger a three to five vote. Unemployment benefit checks, for example, \nwould still go out.\n  The problem is that we now have permanent deficits, in good times as \nwell as bad.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  We do not need a loophole in the balanced budget amendment--like the \nDurbin amendment. We need to change the bleak status quo. Our $5 \ntrillion debt--growing by more than $8,000 a second--proves that we \nhave a long-term problem. This stack on the Senate floor of the last 28 \nunbalanced budgets--14 of which promised balance but did not deliver--\ndemonstrates that this problem requires a permanent solution. If we \npass the balanced budget amendment, we will create an economic bill of \nrights for the 21st century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me draw to a conclusion my debate on \nthis amendment, because I hope that we can table this amendment. I see \nno reason to write that kind of language into the Constitution. We have \ngiven clearly the kind of flexibility that the Congress has needed in \nthe past to respond.\n  It isn't by accident that we picked three-fifths. When you go back \nand analyze past actions of Congress and economic stimulus packages \nthat meet the definition of an emergency or what's needed for \nrecessionary recovery, that is exactly what this amendment is designed \nto respond to. I believe it does, and I hope that our colleagues will \njoin with us in tabling this effort.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I understand I have 4 minutes remaining; \nis that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I will use this to conclude my \nremarks.\n  I want to first thank my colleague, the Senator from Utah, for this \ndebate, for his fairness throughout this debate and the prior debate, \nthough we clearly disagree on a very important issue. I thank him for \nthe fairness with which he has handled this debate and allowed me the \nopportunity to express my point of view.\n\n[[Page S1181]]\n\n  I said at the beginning of this debate I don't think there is a more \nserious vote that a Member of the House or Senate could make, absent a \nvote on whether the United States goes to war, than a vote on whether \nwe amend this Constitution. When you think that on only 17 occasions in \nthe 205 years, since 1791 have we actually amended this great document, \neach of us should pause and reflect and make certain that what we bring \nto the legislatures of this Nation for consideration is the very, very \nbest.\n  What we are talking about today, I think, is a critically important \npart of this debate. It is important because, as the Senator from \nVermont, who was kind enough to join me in this debate, said, we are \ntalking about the ability of the American people through their \nGovernment to respond to an economic emergency.\n  There are those who would argue we need a supermajority, and history \ntells us in the last 2 years, the requirement of a majority vote \nresulted in gridlock and Government shutdown and national \nembarrassment. I worry that at some future date in the midst of an \neconomic downturn, after this budget has been pared back dramatically \nto reach balance, when there are people and groups in this town, like \nhungry dogs on one bone, trying their very best to preserve something, \nrequiring a supermajority vote to step up and help working families get \nback on their feet could be an invitation to gridlock at a time when \nthose families need us the most.\n  Mr. President, I close by making a final request to the fairminded, \nto the judicious chairman of this committee in asking him for one last \nconsideration, and that is that we have the yeas and nays on the merits \nof this amendment. I think I know the outcome, but let us preserve in \nthis debate an up-or-down vote on this question. Let us give, in the \ncourse of this debate, to the American people our best judgment on the \nmerits.\n  Let us not have this question, I think critical question, masked by \nsome procedural vote that will suggest that this amendment on its face \ndoes not merit a yea-and-nay vote in the Senate. I think it does, and I \nwould gladly give that right to any Senator in their effort to improve \non a modification of a document which we all value and revere, the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will only take a few minutes. I want to \nthank the distinguished Senator from Illinois for the kind way he has \nconducted himself on this amendment. He has a wonderful personality. He \ndid a very good job in our committee, and I think he has done a very \ngood job here on the floor.\n  In all honesty, his amendment would drive huge loopholes into the \nbalanced budget amendment and make it, basically useless, because \nalmost anybody could claim almost any type of event as an economic \nemergency. That would trigger his amendment and do away with the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n\n  There is one thing I would like to clarify. My good friend from \nVermont talked about Fred Bergsten. Fred Bergsten suggested we shoot \nfor a small annual surplus to be used during the course of each fiscal \nyear. Mr. Bergsten is a Keynesian who believes fiscal policy will work \nbetter if the cycles are above the zero balance line rather than below. \nThe fact the past surpluses accumulated in past years cannot be used \nwithout a three-fifths vote puts a lock on our savings, so such savings \nwill not be used willy-nilly. But the best use of surpluses will be to \npay down our debt. If Congress decides to use accumulated surpluses, it \nwill be easier to get a three-fifths vote to use savings than to \nborrow, and that is the point I am making.\n  Let me just conclude with the thought that the Durbin amendment is an \nunnecessary loophole that would, basically, make the balanced budget \namendment, once a part of the Constitution, very ineffective. Congress \ncan respond appropriately to real needs, but we need the increased \nprotections of Senate Joint Resolution 1 to protect future generations.\n  I worry about our children and our grandchildren and their children. \nI worry about whether people are going to have good jobs in the future. \nI worry about whether it is going to take a bushel barrel of dollars to \nbuy a loaf of bread. I worry about whether we are going to monetize \nthis debt, as the distinguished liberal Democrat Senator from Illinois, \nSenator Durbin's predecessor, Paul Simon, has always said will happen. \nIf we monetize this debt, this country, as we know it, will be gone, \nbecause people will no longer believe in the credit of the United \nStates. If we inflate our economy to pay off our huge national deficits \nand debt, we are ultimately going to wind up where we will have \ninflation that would eat every working person's lunch every day.\n  If you really love the poor, if you really love senior citizens, if \nyou really love our children and grandchildren, if you really love the \nfuture of this country, then we can't have loopholes like this blown \ninto the balanced budget. We have to stand up and vote for a strong \nbalanced budget amendment. It is difficult, I have to admit. It makes \nlife a little more difficult for us as Members of Congress, but don't \nyou think it is time to end these unbalanced budgets? Here are 28 of \nthem, the last 28 years, and without this amendment, it will go on \nforever and our children's future will be gone.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I move to table, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois \n[Mr. Durbin]. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. \nSantorum] is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 64, nays 35, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 7 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--64\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith, Bob\n     Smith, Gordon H.\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--35\n\n     Akaka\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Santorum\n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 2) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 on\n\n[[Page S1182]]\n\nTuesday, February 11, there be 60 minutes of debate, equally divided, \nin the usual form prior to a vote on or in relation to the Wellstone \namendment No. 3, and following the expiration or yielding back of the \ntime, the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Wellstone \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, there \nwill be no further votes this evening. It is my understanding that \nSenator Boxer intends to make a statement relative to the \nconstitutional amendment. Also, the President of the United States will \nbe visiting with congressional leaders tomorrow on the Senate side of \nthe Capitol--in fact, in the President's Room just off the floor of the \nSenate Chamber. Therefore, it is my hope that when the Senate convenes \nfollowing the weekly policy party luncheons, there will be a short time \nagreement for debate prior to a vote on or in relation to the Wellstone \namendment regarding underprivileged youth. Members should expect a vote \nrelative to the Wellstone amendment in the 3 o'clock timeframe \ntomorrow. Also, the Senate could be asked to confirm the nomination of \nCongressman Richardson to be Ambassador to the United Nations. \nTherefore, a rollcall vote is expected with respect to that nomination.\n  I thank my colleagues for their cooperation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Before he leaves the \nfloor, I would like to personally thank the newly elected Senator from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin, for his leadership on this extremely \nimportant amendment that he offered the Senate, which would have made \nthis balanced budget amendment a much more attractive amendment to the \npeople of Illinois, to the people of California, to the people of all \nof our States--to the Nation.\n  A very interesting poll just came out in the February 9 edition of \nThe Los Angeles Times, some people, when asked in the abstract, said \nthey would support a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, \nunder any circumstances. However, about 39 percent of the people polled \nsaid they would not support the balanced budget amendment if it could \nmean cuts in areas that they overwhelmingly approve of, such as \nMedicare, Social Security, and Medicaid.\n  I learned at a very early age from my parents what it was like to \nlive through a depression. There was no safety net then in the 1930's, \nand people were literally committing suicide because there was no \nsafety net. They didn't know what they were going to do for their \nfamilies, and they were absolutely filled with despair.\n  We have learned a lot since then, and Senator Sarbanes, with his \ncharts, has shown us that we learned a lot since the Great Depression, \nand that we have the ability to soften those recessionary periods. Yet, \nin this inflexible amendment that is before us, it would take a \nsupermajority, Mr. President, to act on behalf of the American people. \nNow, I did not come here to this great Senate to have my hands tied in \nthe case of a recession, a depression, or a natural disaster.\n  I want to thank my friend from Illinois for raising that issue as \nwell. He has gone through the Midwest floods, as I have gone through \nthe California floods, earthquakes, and fires, and there but for the \ngrace of God goes every single one of us in this Chamber. And if we \ncannot act as a majority, without the requirement of a supermajority, \nto meet the needs of the people, then what are we doing here?\n\n  By rejecting this amendment of the Senator from Illinois, which he \nwas so eloquent in explaining, I truly believe that this amendment, as \nit stands, is dangerous. It is dangerous for our people.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator from California yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am delighted to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator made reference to this earlier, and I think \nthe very able Senator from California is on to an extremely important \npoint here. I want to illustrate it with this chart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators in the rear of the Chamber will cease \nconversations. Take the conversations outside the Chamber.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what we are talking about here, because we \nhave voted down this extremely important amendment, is, how are we \ngoing to act in this U.S. Senate to ease the pain of people during \nrecessions or other economic emergencies. People who are jobless, who \nhave no health insurance or who can't afford to pay their rent?\n  I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Well, as the Senator has noted, as economists across \nthe country have commented, and as the chart beside me shows, since \nWorld War II we have been able to ease the business cycle because we \nexperience automatic stabilizers during an economic downturn. We start \nrunning deficits because we are not collecting taxes and we are paying \nout unemployment. If you try to balance the budget, or if you are \nrequired to do so by constitutional amendment during an economic \ndownturn, you are going to return our economy to these boom-and-bust \ncycles that we experienced throughout the first part of this century \nand we are going to lose the ability to have this kind of movement in \nthe business cycle, which is much better for our people.\n  The Senator is absolutely correct. With this amendment, we are going \nto be dooming ourselves to going back and turning economic downturns \ninto recessions and recessions into depressions, as the Senator has \npointed out.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly. I would say to my friend that you have to learn \nfrom history. If we can't learn from history, we are doomed to fail the \npeople. Some of us have heard about these depressions from our parents. \nLook at the Senator's chart. We can clearly see what has happened since \nWorld War II. We have spared our people from the deepest, darkest days \nof recession and depression.\n  By rejecting the amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois, \nwhich would have given this U.S. Senate and the House the ability to \nact without requiring a supermajority in times of recession, this \nbecomes a very radical amendment to the Constitution.\n  Does my friend not agree?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I agree absolutely with that. We at the moment have the \nbest unemployment situation in 20 years; the best performance on \ninflation in 30 years. We have now brought the deficit down as a \npercent of the gross national product to the best ratio in 25 years. We \nare making progress on all of these fronts. We have the strongest \neconomy in the world.\n  People come in with this radical notion of amending the Constitution \nof the United States. All we need to do is continue to make the hard \ndecisions that are made with respect to the budget. It is one thing to \nbalance the budget. Those are the tough decisions. Those are the ones \nwe ought to make and not put an amendment into the Constitution of the \nUnited States which is going to deny us the ability to deal with \neconomic downturns and recessions when they occur. The amendment they \nare talking about putting into the Constitution of the United States \ndoes not abolish the business cycle. It does not eliminate economic ups \nand downs. Yet with this amendment, we run the risk of going back to \neconomic cycles with very deep downturns when our people are really \nsuffering through depression. We have not had that since World War II. \nAnd I for one don't want to go back to it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to thank the senior Senator from Maryland for his \nleadership on this. I have the honor and privilege of serving with him \non the Banking Committee, where he is the ranking member, and on the \nBudget Committee, where we serve together. So we have a chance to \ndebate and discuss these issues. A great privilege it is always to have \nthe participation of my friend from Maryland because he brings such \ninsight.\n  I say to my colleague that he and I have voted for balanced budgets \nin the past. That is why this amendment debate is really a figleaf. As \nmy friend pointed out, it does not do one thing to balance the budget.\n  I am going to show some most extraordinary newspaper articles which\n\n[[Page S1183]]\n\nhave appeared as editorials or as op-eds. The writers of those articles \ncall this balanced budget amendment what it is--a technique for people \nto say, ``Oh, I voted to balance the budget,'' even though in many \ncases these colleagues didn't vote for the one budget in 1993 that my \nfriend from Maryland and I voted for along with a bare majority of the \nSenate which has set this country on a course of 4 years of declining \ndeficits and has set this country on a course of economic prosperity. \nWe have far to go, but we are moving in the right direction. The vote \nthat mattered, I say to my friend, was the vote that we cast, the tough \nvote--and some people lost their seats because of it--that made the \nactual changes in budgetary policy which has cut this deficit from $290 \nbillion when George Bush left office to where it is today at about $107 \nbillion. That was the tough vote.\n  This vote is an easy vote. We are just setting the stage for the \nStates to call conventions in order to ratify the amendment. And even \nif it is approved by the States, in the end, there is a real \npossibility that there will be a disagreement and the courts will be \ncalled upon to try to resolve the situation.\n\n  So it makes no sense. That is why 1,100 economists condemn the \nbalanced budget amendment as unsound and unnecessary. I know that this \nstatement has been quoted time and time again.\n  I see that my friend is on the floor now with some very important \nnumbers. I am happy to yield to him.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to support the very perceptive statement of the \ndistinguished Senator from California about the reduction in the \ndeficit subsequent to the enactment of the 1993 budget, which, as the \nSenator pointed out, was passed on the tie-breaking vote of the Vice \nPresident.\n  In 1992, the deficit was $290 billion. We have brought it down 4 \nyears in a row. It is now at $107 billion. Four years in a row we have \nhad a steady decline in the deficit. We brought it down from $290 \nbillion to $107 billion, and, as a percent of our gross product, the \ndeficit has dropped from 4.9 percent in 1992 to 1.4 percent in 1996. \nThe last time the deficit was this low as a percent of our gross \ndomestic product was in 1973. This is the best performance in 23 years \nin reducing the deficit as a percent of our gross domestic product. \nThis is a very good record. We are going to continue the progress. We \nare going to continue to bring the deficit down, both in absolute terms \nand as a percentage of our GDP.\n  Let me show you a chart which compares what we have succeeded in \ndoing in this country and what is happening in the other major \nindustrial countries.\n  This chart compares various nations' deficit as a share of GDP. The \nUnited States is now at 1.4 percent. Here is Japan, 3.1; Germany 3.35; \nCanada 4.2; France 5; the United Kingdom 5.1; Italy 7.2. We have the \nbest performance of any of the major industrial countries.\n  We have an economy now with 5.4 percent unemployment, the best \nunemployment in 20 years. We are at less than 3 percent inflation, the \nbest inflation performance in 30 years. The deficit of 1.4 percent of \nGDP, the best since 1973. That is a vertical comparison with our past \nperformance in this country.\n  Then we look to see how we are competing with other countries. This \nchart shows we have the best performance of any of the G-7 countries. \nThis economy is working. We ought not now to take this, as the Senator \nhas described it, radical step of trying to amend the Constitution of \nthe United States and perhaps dooming ourselves in some future crisis \nto be unable to confront the economic circumstances of the time. As the \nSenator has pointed out, that is what these over 1,100 economists \nacross the country are saying.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend and colleague.\n  I think the record is clear. We are making progress, and what we \nought to be doing now is debating how we make further progress. Instead \nwe are spending many, many hours discussing an amendment to the \nConstitution which does not one thing to continue this progress.\n  These economists, including 11 Nobel laureates in economics from \nStanford University, the University of California at Berkeley, New York \nUniversity, Carnegie-Mellon, Yale, and MIT--you can't have a better \ngroup of people who know what they are talking about. Some of what they \nsay is, ``We condemn the proposed balanced budget amendment to the \nFederal Constitution. It is unsound and unnecessary.''\n  I received a degree in economics many years ago, and I know that \neconomists choose their words carefully because economics is not an \nexact science. As a result, economists try very carefully to measure \ntheir tone and measure their words. So when you have 1,100 economists \nsigning on to this, and using the word condemn, this is serious \nbusiness. Now, maybe there are colleagues in the Senate who could stand \nup to some of these people and tell them they are incorrect, but I have \na hard time believing that.\n  Let me sum up what they said. And it just parallels what the Senator \nfrom Maryland has shared with us.\n\n       The amendment is not needed to balance the budget. The \n     measured deficit has fallen dramatically in recent years from \n     $290 billion in '92 to $107 billion--\n\n  They say:\n\n       The deficit is 1.3 percent of gross domestic product, a \n     smaller proportion than that of any other major nation.\n\n  The Senator from Maryland has said this very same thing. They go on \nto say:\n\n       Congress and the President can reduce the deficit to zero, \n     balance the budget or even create budget surpluses without a \n     constitutional amendment.\n\n  These 1,100 economists close by saying:\n\n       There is no need to put the Nation in an economic \n     straitjacket. Let the President and Congress make fiscal \n     policy in response to national needs and priorities as the \n     authors of our Constitution wisely provided.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I am so honored to be in this Senate representing \nthe largest State in the Union. It truly is an honor. I am humbled by \nit. I am humbled by our Constitution. And so I think we need to be \npretty humble when we think of how we are going to vote on this. I \nthink we have to be humble. I think we have to look at what the experts \ntell us. I think we have to look at the facts as they have been laid \nbefore us by my friend from Maryland. Our economy is moving in the \nright direction.\n  Having a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution would in fact \nput us in a straitjacket, would in fact tie our hands, would in fact \nmake it very difficult for us to get out of an economic crisis when we \nmay have to temporarily go out of balance while we take care of it.\n  Let me ask a question of my friend from Maryland, who is still in the \nChamber.\n  In his State he has been fortunate not to have had the number of \nnatural disasters that I and the people of my State have had to face. \nHe knows this place, however, because he has been here a long time, and \nthe people of Maryland keep sending him back for a reason--because he \nis wise. So I ask my friend, under this amendment as it is proposed--\nand particularly since this Senator Durbin's recession amendment was \ndefeated--California was in a horrible recession, the worst in the \ncountry. We moved from an economy that was heavily supported by jobs in \nthe defense sector, to an economy without the great dependence it once \nhad on defense sector jobs, and we had a very hard time. We made \ninvestments that softened the blow but still it was tough. Then we got \nhit with an unbelievable earthquake called the Northridge earthquake. \nBecause the Federal Government acted swiftly, because we could act \nwithout having to have a supermajority, we were able to pump $11 \nbillion into the California economy to rebuild the infrastructure. We \nare rebuilding the universities. We are rebuilding hospitals. We are \nrebuilding people's lives.\n  I say to my friend, I will offer an amendment to waive the \nrequirements of a supermajority in case of natural disasters such as \nearthquakes, fires, floods--where people are homeless and in trouble.\n  Under the amendment as it stands now, however, if any State had a \ndisaster like that which occurred in California, with $11 billion of \ndamage and people hurt and suffering, does my friend believe we could \nget the required supermajority to act swiftly?\n  I have very grave doubts about it, because I have seen us have a hard \ntime even getting 51 votes. I ask my friend,\n\n[[Page S1184]]\n\nwould he want to be here representing a State that had a disastrous \nflood or earthquake or any other natural disaster and have this \namendment in place which requires a supermajority?\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator from California asks a very appropriate \nquestion. In a sense, she answered it right at the end with the \nobservation that she herself has, as I have, seen instances in this \nChamber when we were scrambling to get a simple majority in order to \nprovide disaster relief to one or another State in the country that had \nbeen devastated by a natural disaster. And many Members said, ``Well, \nwe don't really want to do that. Yes, it's a difficult situation, but \nwe don't want to make this response.''\n  I have seen the very able Senator from California personally work the \nfloor of the Senate in order to try to get a majority vote in order to \nrespond to what her State had been stricken with, and she was \nsuccessful, I must say. But suppose you had to get a supermajority in \norder to do it. Past experience does not bear out the assumption that \nyou can just get a supermajority willy-nilly. In the past, we have had \nto scramble simply to get a majority.\n  The amendment contains a provision that states that you cannot raise \nthe debt limit unless you have a supermajority, and obviously unless \nyou can raise the debt limit and borrow additional funds, you are not \ngoing to be able to respond to the disaster, and particularly not \nrespond to it immediately, which is often what is required. But time \nand time again in this Chamber I have seen the leadership sweating \nbullets in order to get a simple majority in order to deal with a debt \nlimit issue. So it just defies past experience for Members to stand \nhere and say, ``Oh, we will get the supermajority.'' As the Senator \nfrom California has pointed out, it is tough enough to get the \nmajority, the simple majority.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I give my friend an example. The San Francisco \nearthquake, Loma Prieta, which was way back, we are still rebuilding \nfrom, I say to my friend. And we had a freeway go down, just a \ndisaster, and we got the funds to rebuild the freeway. About 2 years \nago on the floor of this Senate a Senator said we have to back off this \nbecause we are building it in a different fashion and it is costing too \nmuch money.\n  I stood up as one of the two Senators from California and explained \nthat if we rebuilt it the same way it was prior to the earthquake, it \nwould fall down again. We had to put a little more into it to make sure \nthat the structure was as safe as possible--to ensure that the \nresidents traveling on the freeway would be safe.\n  Well, I won that vote, but I have to tell you it was close, I say to \nmy friend.\n  Under this constitutional amendment, there is no way I could have \ndone that because it would have required a supermajority--we would have \nneeded to be out of balance for a short period of time because of the \nunanticipated funds required to respond to the disaster. And I say to \nmy friend that, if any State experiences a multibillion dollar \ndisaster, unless you can come on the floor and convince colleagues to \ncut other programs, you are going to be in deep trouble. That is the \nother reason why this is a very, very radical amendment.\n\n  I want to say to my friend, I so appreciate his participating in this \ndiscussion. It means a lot to me that he is here. As a matter of fact, \nit reminds me of one time out in California when he was at a forum with \nme, when most people had gone home. It was a situation very similar to \ntonight.\n  But I want to say to my friend, as we sit on the Budget Committee \ntogether, there is one figure who comes before the Budget Committee \nthat my colleagues on the other side of the aisle just think is the \nbest. They credit this person with everything good about the economy, \nand his name is Alan Greenspan. I think Alan Greenspan is doing a good \njob. I sometimes disagree with him, but overall I think he has done a \ngood job. Where is Alan Greenspan on this constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget? Let me say--I am not going to read his whole \nstatement, but I think this sums it up:\n\n       As a consequence, what I am concerned about is that it is \n     very difficult to implement technical economic policy through \n     the Constitution. I don't like the idea of embodying concrete \n     economic issues in the Constitution, which is going to have \n     to stay in the Constitution for 50 or 100 years or more.\n\n  So I find it really interesting that on every single economic issue, \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle--who all support this \namendment; I do not think there is one of my colleagues on the other \nside who is going to vote the other way--have abandoned Alan \nGreenspan's leadership, where they have followed him down every other \neconomic road. Again, I ask my colleagues to be a little humble on \nthis. We do not have all the answers. None of us has all the answers. \nBut, certainly, if you are going to walk away from someone who you \nthink has been right on target, keeping inflation under control, \nkeeping the economic recovery going, and he is telling us not to do \nthis, it seems to me fairly arrogant to disregard it.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues what I think is a terrific \neditorial that appeared in the Los Angeles Times. As a matter of fact, \nit is so good I am going to read you most of it. I honestly think this \nsays it the way it is. It speaks for me.\n\n       Balanced Budget Plan: Looks, 10; workability, zero.\n       This seductive idea won't stand up under close inspection.\n\n  Here is what it says:\n\n       No. 1 on the legislative menu of the new 105th Congress is \n     a Republican-backed constitutional amendment to require a \n     balanced budget by the year 2002 and every year thereafter. \n     What could have more first-glance appeal? But amending the \n     Constitution, despite the political symbolism, is not the way \n     to go about controlling government spending.\n       On Tuesday, President Clinton voiced his strongest \n     opposition yet, appropriately characterizing the proposed \n     amendment as a ``straitjacket'' that pays little regard to \n     the vagaries of the economy. For instance, it would not \n     provide the flexibility needed to deal with recessions . . .\n\n  My friend and I from Maryland, we have gone through this, I think, in \na detailed way. It says:\n\n       . . . it would not provide the flexibility needed to deal \n     with recessions, when Federal funding might have to rise as \n     revenues drop. The proposal would allow suspension of the \n     balanced budget requirement only if three-fifths of each \n     House approved. That's not much of an escape valve, \n     considering how long it takes Congress to act on most \n     problems . . .\n\n  We know that. It takes us time to gear up around here, as the \nPresident is going to learn as he enjoys his stay in the Senate. So, in \ntime of recession, we are often behind the curve as it is. We come in \nthe second quarter, after the recession.\n\n       The amendment, pushed through the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee on Thursday, generally fails to spell out how a \n     balanced budget would be achieved. The difficult decisions on \n     what spending to cut or how to raise revenues are not \n     addressed but simply are left to future Congresses--and \n     everyone knows how difficult and seemingly endless budget \n     negotiations can be in the Capitol . . .\n\n  The article closes by saying:\n\n       The amendment--which will be put before the States' \n     legislatures if it wins approval in the House and Senate--has \n     drawn opposition from a broad spectrum of economists and \n     fiscal experts. It should. The amendment is irresponsible \n     governance, fiscally reckless and a false political star.\n\n  The Los Angeles Times is not known for such strong language. It is \nvery measured. The editorials are very measured. So let me repeat that:\n\n       The amendment is irresponsible governance, fiscally \n     reckless, and a false political star.\n\n  The last article which I want to mention comes from the USA Today, on \nMonday, February 3, 1997. The headline reads:\n\n       This is cheap political grandstanding. There is an easier \n     way to balance the budget: Just do it.\n\n  ``Just do it.'' It says, ``Balance The Budget? Yes. But An Amendment? \nNo.''\n  So, whether it is our worry about being in a straitjacket when there \nis a recession or a natural disaster, or whether it is our worry about \nthe Social Security trust fund--which absolutely will be hit if an \namendment does not carry the day to exempt it--or whether it is our \nworry about Medicare--all of these areas are at great risk if we \ncontinue with this proposal, which has been condemned by 1,100 \neconomists. Editorials all over the country have pointed out that \npassing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution is just not a \nwise thing to do.\n\n[[Page S1185]]\n\n  We can and must balance the budget. I voted for six balanced budgets. \nI am very proud of that. I am proud to see the deficit coming down. It \nis a serious matter. I hope, however, my colleagues will have the \ncourage to walk away from an idea that seems wonderful on its face, but \nif you look behind the door, you will see the pitfalls there.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, for your kind courtesies. I thank my \ncolleague from Maryland for participating in this discussion with me. I \nhope, as we go down the road on this debate, we will have some more \ncolleagues step away from this at-first-glance politically popular idea \nand realize that it will put us in an economic straitjacket with no way \nto respond to recessions or other economic emergencies or crises. So it \nis putting us into a straitjacket which can only harm the people.\n  To close: ``Balance The Budget? Yes. But An Amendment? No.''\n  There is an easier way to balance the budget: Just do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the Wellstone amendment, No. 3.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I commend the very \nable Senator from California for her very fine statement. She clearly \nunderstands the pitfalls that are involved in a balanced budget \namendment and, I think, has spoken eloquently to the issue. She has \nalso spoken with a very deep personal knowledge of the situation \nconfronting her and her State when she has had to deal with these \nnatural disasters. I simply want to underscore, again, for those who \nsay, ``well, we will easily get a supermajority in order to waive the \nprovisions of this amendment in an emergency situation,'' that I saw \nthe Senator working literally day and night just to get a majority in \norder to deal with a natural disaster and, as she pointed out, coming \nup with close votes in order to do it.\n  She succeeded, which is very much to her credit and reflected her \nvery effective advocacy. But had a supermajority been required, she \nwould have fallen short. So I want to thank her for her very strong \nstatement.\n  Mr. President, I know it is late into the evening, and I am not going \nto take long, but I want to take just a few minutes to speak to the \nissue before us, and I hope at a later point to make a longer \nstatement.\n  First of all, I want to point out, as we deal with this amendment to \namend the Constitution to require a balanced budget, it is very \nimportant to understand that the budget we are talking about balancing, \nthe U.S. budget, does not have a capital budget to it. Everyone gets up \nand says, ``well, the State governments do it, the local governments do \nit, private individuals do it, corporations do it, why shouldn't the \nFederal Government do it?''\n  None of those other entities balance a capital budget as well. They \nall provide for capital budgets that are financed by borrowing. That is \nwhat State governments do. They have a requirement to balance the \noperating budget, but they then sell bonds. Why do States and \nmunicipalities issue bonds? Why is there a municipal bond market? \nBecause they borrow in order to fund the capital budget.\n  We don't have a capital budget at the Federal level, and anyone who \nis really serious about trying to write requirements into the \nConstitution, which, by the way, I think are extremely difficult to do \nbecause you can't provide for every contingency, but if you had any \ndegree of seriousness, would first provide for a capital budget. You \nwould set capital investments apart and say, ``all right, we recognize \nwe make investments in the future and we capitalize them, and we borrow \nto fund the capitalization.''\n  That is what people do when they buy a home. Although it is said that \neverybody has to balance their budget, people don't balance their \nbudget every year. It is wise and prudent financial policy, if your \nincome is adequate to the task, to borrow in order to buy a home, to \nborrow in order to buy a car.\n  If individuals had to operate under this amendment's balanced budget \nrequirement, the vast majority of people in this country would not be \nable to buy an automobile and they would not be able to buy a home, \nbecause they couldn't produce the cash with which to make the full \npayment in the year they incur the obligation, which is what this \namendment is requiring of the Federal Government.\n  So that is the first point to make. You are talking about trying to \nbalance a budget that includes within it your capital expenditures, \ninstead of setting them aside and funding the capital expenditures \nthrough a capital budget, which is financed by borrowing and which \nmakes prudent economic sense. After all, the highway or the building is \ngoing to last you for 20, 30, 40 years, and it makes sense to borrow, \nto amortize it over that period of time and have the use of it right \nfrom today out into the future.\n  The second point I want to make about the balanced budget amendment \nis in the post-World War II period, we have used what are known as \nautomatic fiscal stabilizers in order to ameliorate economic downturns. \nWhen the economy begins to go soft, the Federal budget automatically \nshifts toward deficit, for two reasons: First, people are losing jobs, \nand because they are no longer working, they are not paying taxes into \nthe Treasury; therefore, the revenues into the Government decrease. \nThis happens automatically. We don't take any action around here for \nthat to happen. It just occurs. Because people are no longer working, \nthey are no longer earning, and those people, at least, are not paying \ntaxes into the Treasury.\n  Second, at the same time, automatically expenditures increase, \nbecause we pay out unemployment insurance. If you have been working, \nyou become unemployed, you are entitled to draw unemployment insurance. \nSo those payments go up.\n  The consequence of those two things happening--and there are other \ntransfer payments also that go up in the course of an economic downturn \nor a recession--the deficit widens. But that deficit serves to cushion \nthe economic downturn, because it helps to sustain purchasing power in \nthe economy that would otherwise go into decline. Cushioning occurs \nbecause by providing unemployment insurance, you help to hold the \neconomy up and to check the downturn.\n\n  Now, that happens automatically. It doesn't require a conscious \ndecision. If the recession is bad, we often then go on to make \nconscious decisions here about ways to try to bring the economy back. \nBut under normal circumstances, this cushioning is sufficient to \nmoderate the economic downturn.\n  Because we have followed this policy essentially since the end of \nWorld War II, we have been able to check the boom-and-bust cycle of our \neconomy, which we had previously been experiencing. Of course, that is \na very good thing, because you don't put your economy and your people \nthrough the absolute wringer of a major economic downturn.\n  The fact of the matter is, as the economy goes soft, you begin to run \nthese deficits. If you try to offset the deficit, either by cutting \nspending or raising taxes or a combination of the two, in an economic \ndownturn, you would only drive the economy further down. The economy, \nthe business cycle is swinging downwards, and if you compound that \nswing by a policy of trying to eliminate the deficits which arise from \nthat downturn, you only make the downturn worse, and we have \nexperienced that in our history, during the Great Depression.\n  This is why these automatic stabilizers are so important, and this is \nwhy, in many respects, this amendment is so dangerous.\n  This chart beside me measures real economic growth from 1870 to 1995, \nand it shows the ups and downs in economic growth in our economy, \nbeginning in 1870 and running through until 1995. The essential thing \nthe chart shows is that since World War II, we have essentially been \nable to avoid deep economic recessions or, indeed, depressions.\n  One of the reasons--not the only reason, but one of the reasons--we \nhave been able to do that is because we have had these automatic \neconomic stabilizers which have kept the economy from coming down into \ndeep negative growth. Only a couple of times have we actually had a \ndownturn that took us into negative growth. Most of the time we get \nmovements, they remain in the\n\n[[Page S1186]]\n\npositive level, and, as you can see, we have not in recent history \nexperienced the kinds of deep moves we experienced pre-World War II.\n  That is why the Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary Rubin, in \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee about this amendment to the \nConstitution, said he was fearful that what it would do is turn an \neconomic downturn into a recession and a recession into a depression.\n  Amendment supporters say, ``Well, if that happens, we'll get a \nsupermajority around here, we will waive the provisions of the \nConstitution, and we will take action.''\n  There are a number of difficulties with that response. First of all, \nthe automatic stabilizers work automatically. No one has to recognize \nthere is an economic downturn. Often, we don't see an economic downturn \nis happening until much later, until it is well into its cycle.\n  Only a few years ago, Alan Greenspan thought the economy was doing \nwell and said so. Later, it turned out that at the moment he said that, \nthe economy was already into a downturn, but it wasn't recognized, it \nwasn't seen. Later, when all the figures came in, we went back and saw \nthat we had already gone into a downturn. This amendment is going to \ncost us these automatic fiscal stabilizers that operate without the \nneed for congressional action, and that cushion a recession that we \nmight not even know to exist.\n  Second, we have a lot of arguments around here about whether we have \na downturn, how serious a downturn is, how you have to respond to it.\n  Franklin Raines, the Director of OMB pointed out the other day before \nthe Budget Committee that a lot of our difficulties are regional \ndepressions, not national depressions. Much of the country might be \ndoing all right, but a region of the country may be in severe trouble \nand needs help in order to address the situation in which to find \nitself.\n  Of course, then it is going to be extremely difficult to get a \nsupermajority because most communities will not be experiencing a \nrecession or downturn and their representatives will not want to waive \nthis provision.\n  I can remember during the administration of President Bush when we \ntried to act on extending the unemployment insurance. It took us \nmonths, months, months, and months before we were able to do it. And \nall the time the economic downturn was getting worse. As a consequence, \nall the time we were falling further and further behind the curve.\n  The fact of the matter is, is that the earlier you can act, and \nparticularly if you can act automatically, through stabilizers, the \nquicker you can check the downturn. If the downturn gains momentum, \nbegins to build up steam in that direction, the amount of corrective \naction that has to be taken in order to turn it around is much greater. \nThe prudent thing is to act early on, because then you do not suffer as \nmuch damage because you do not go as deep into the decline.\n  But this balanced budget amendment is a virtual guarantee that that \nkind of early action will not be taken and that we will always be \nplaying catch up with the economic cycle.\n  The many distinguished economists who have spoken out, and to whom my \nvery able colleague from California has made reference, have focused, \namongst other things, on this aspect of the situation. We ought not to \ngive away lightly the benefits that have come to us by developing \neffective fiscal policy to help restrain the movements of the business \ncycle. We have not eliminated it. I assume my colleagues who are \npushing this amendment do not for a moment suggest they somehow have \nfigured out a magical way to eliminate the business cycle. But we have \ndeveloped policies that have ameliorated the business cycle.\n  I do not want to go back to these deep declines in the economy. We \nought not to be in the situation where, as in the 1930's, we would rue \nthe day that we denied ourselves the capacity to respond to that kind \nof an emergency so that we actually had to experience something \napproximating economic devastation before we were prepared to take \naction.\n  Why would you do that? Why would you want to do that? Is the economy \nnot working well? Let us look at that issue for just a moment.\n  The unemployment rate today is 5.4 percent. It has been down in the \nlow range of 5 percent now for many months. It is a very good \nperformance. The last time we had a performance anything like that over \na sustained period of time was 20 years ago.\n  What about the inflation rate? The inflation rate is under 3 percent. \nIt has been there now for the last 4 or 5 years--about or under 3 \npercent. The last time we had a performance on the inflation front that \nwas that good was 30 years ago.\n  So we are doing very well on unemployment and inflation.\n  We have created 11.5 million jobs over the last 4 years. Other \ncountries envy us in terms of what we are doing. But, amendment \nproponents say, we still have a problem with the deficit? What about \nthe deficit? Let us take a look at the deficit.\n  Are we making any progress on reducing the deficit? Can someone \ncontend that we are not making any progress on the deficit-reduction \nfront and, therefore, we need a constitutional amendment, as risky and \nas radical as it might be, in order somehow, some way to compel some \nkind of action? We should note, however, that the amendment does not \ncurb the deficit at all? You are still going to have to make the budget \ndecisions with respect to the budget--your spending and tax decisions \nwith respect to the budget. Have we been doing that already?\n  In 1992, the deficit, in current dollars, was $290 billion. Since \nthen, we brought the deficit down in each of the succeeding 4 years. \nThe deficit now is $107 billion. And the President has submitted a \nbudget plan that will eliminate the deficit by the year 2002.\n  Some have criticisms of that plan. Others praise it. I think it is a \npretty good plan but it is not written in stone and it is up to the \nCongress to deal with it now in consultation with the administration. \nBut in any event, there is a plan to bring it down and eliminate the \ndeficit by the year 2002.\n  I think the President has pretty good credibility in putting forward \nthis plan on the basis of his record.\n  We ran large deficits in the 1980's and into the early 1990's. It was \nnot just the administration that did that, the Congress was complicit \nin it as well. After all, you do not get a budget unless we in Congress \npass it. Although I do want to point out that through those 12 years, \nin all but 1 year the budget passed by the Congress had a lower deficit \nfigure than the budgets submitted to the Congress by the \nadministration.\n  In other words, in every year but one the Congress was able to do a \ntighter budget than what the administration had submitted to the \nCongress. Had we passed the administration's submitted budgets, as \nproposed to us, the deficits would have been larger, not smaller. We \ndid not increase the deficits. We in fact lowered the deficits.\n  But now in the last 4 years we have made this very impressive \nprogress and we are on the path to a balanced budget. The way you make \nthis progress is you make decisions on the budget each year. None of \nthis progress was made because there was an amendment in the \nConstitution. And if you put an amendment in the Constitution, the \nprogress still will not be made.\n  The progress can only be made when you vote the budgets, when you \nmake the spending and the tax decisions that are contained within the \nbudget, the consequences of which then give you your deficits or your \nbalance. That is when you make the decisions. And we have been making \nhard decisions, particularly the 1993 economic plan, which passed this \nbody on the tiebreaking vote of the Vice President.\n  A lot of people criticized that plan. People said ``Oh, this is going \nto have devastating consequences on the economy.'' It was a combination \nof spending cuts and some tax changes. But what it produced was a \nreduced deficit and an economy that has worked exceedingly well over \nthe last 4 years, an economy that other countries look at with a great \ndeal of envy.\n  These are the absolute figures on reducing the deficit. Let us look \nat the measure of the deficit as a percent of the gross national \nproduct, which is a very important measure. It enables us to compare \nwith our own performance over time and with other countries. Because as \nyou strengthen your economy, you can bring your deficit down and it\n\n[[Page S1187]]\n\nbecomes a smaller percentage of the GDP and becomes easier to handle. \nIt is like an individual's situation. If he has more income, he is \nbetter able to handle the deficit. If his economic strength grows more \nrapidly than the deficit he is trying to handle, then he gets stronger \nand more able to pay off the debt.\n  Let us look at that. This is what has happened. In 1992, the deficit \nwas 4.9 percent of GDP. That is not a good figure. I am prepared to \nstate that right at the outset. The European Community now, which is \ntrying to move toward monetary union, has established some benchmarks \nwhich it is pressing the 15 members of Europe to abide by in order to \nachieve the monetary union. And one of them is that deficit, as a \npercent of GDP, be under 3 percent--under 3 percent. That is the \nbenchmark they have set out.\n  In 1992 we were at 4.9 percent. As this chart beside me shows, we \nbrought down our deficit as a percentage of GDP to 4.1 percent in 1993, \n3.1 percent in 1994, 2.3 percent in 1995, and 1.4 percent in 1996. That \nis the best performance since 1973, 23 years ago. It is a better \nperformance than all but 3 of the 15 members of the European Union, \nthree of the smaller countries--Luxembourg, Denmark, and Ireland. Our \nprojections out into the future are very positive; according to these \nprojections, we will do even better than 1.4 percent in the future.\n\n  So we are making very significant progress toward a balanced budget. \nWe really are on the right track. The real place we ought to be \nfocusing on is on the budget process and the decisions that will be \nmade with respect to spending programs, tax programs, tax subsidies, \ntax expenditure issues, and so forth.\n  Further, our performance of 1.4 percent deficit as a percent of GDP \nis better than any of the G7 countries, the major industrial countries \nin the world.\n  I was at a Joint Economic Committee hearing this afternoon where \nChairman Stiglitz of the Council of Economic Advisers was presenting \nthe economic report of the President. He talked about how nice it was \nnow to go to international meetings with the performance of our economy \nand be able to hold out as an example to other countries what we are \ndoing.\n  Look at this chart beside, which compares the deficit as a share of \nGDP for each of the G7 nations. Here is the United States, down to 1.4 \npercent. We have a game plan now, by the year 2002 to close that out \ncompletely. Now, I know we will have arguments here about the game \nplan, but I think it is credible. It could be changed, it could be \ndifferent. I think it is credible. I think it represents a bona fide \neffort to close this out.\n  Look at this comparison: Here is Japan with 3.1 percent deficit, \nGermany, 3.5 percent; Canada, 4.2 percent; France, 5.0 percent; the \nUnited Kingdom, 5.1 percent. Italy is 7.2 percent. If you make the \ncomparisons, if you do a vertical comparison over our history, we have \nthe best performance now, deficit as a share of GDP, since 1973. That \nis how we stack up in terms of our past record. If you do a horizontal \ncomparison with other countries around the world, this is how we stack \nup. Any way you look at that, that is a pretty good performance.\n  Now, let me finally address one other point about this amendment. I \nwant to address this assumption here that you can simply get these \nsupermajorities almost by the wave of the hand if you have any kind of \nserious problem confronting you. Now there are two kinds of \nsupermajorities required in this proposed resolution, Senate Joint \nResolution 1--either a majority of the total membership of the body or \nthree-fifths of the total membership of the body, what they call the \nwhole number of the House. Now, what the ``majority of the whole'' \nrequirement means is in the Senate you would have to have 51 votes--\nalthough there is some argument, legally, about the role of the Vice \nPresident's vote in this process, an interesting debate that shows you \nthe complexity of this proposal and its potential for complications. \nThat question has never been resolved. Then there is the three-fifths \nsupermajority requirement, which of course in this body would be 60 \nvotes.\n  I want to make historical reference to one critical vote in the \nHouse, which in a historical sense we can look at and say, ``Well, that \nwas a critical vote in the history of this country. That was really a \nnational crisis, and clearly Members should have recognized it and \nshould have acted accordingly. That is the kind of situation which, if \nit arises again, we certainly would be able to get these \nsupermajorities provided for in this Senate Joint Resolution 1.'' In \n1940 the U.S. Congress, on the urgings of President Roosevelt, provided \nfor a draft for 1 year, because President Roosevelt saw the war clouds \nthat were gathering in Europe and felt the United States needed to \nundertake preparation for what might be coming. A year later, of course \nthe issue arose, since it was only for a year, about extending the \ndraft. We are now talking about the fall of 1941, only shortly before \nPearl Harbor. The President asked the Congress to extend the draft so \nthat we could continue this program of military preparedness because \nthe war clouds were even darker and more ominous.\n\n  The issue was so close in the House of Representatives that Speaker \nRayburn, exercising a very rare prerogative of the Speaker, took the \nfloor of the House at the close of the debate to urge extension of the \ndraft. The vote on that issue in the House was 203 to 202, so under the \nConstitution it carried. You had a quorum present, had a majority of \nthose voting, carrying it 203 to 202. Mr. President, 203 is--and was \nnot then--a majority of the whole number of the House of \nRepresentatives, which would be 218 today, and it is certainly not \nthree-fifths of the whole number of the House. These are the two \nsupermajorities required in this resolution.\n  Now, there you were with a crisis situation which certainly, looking \nback at it historically, you would have said, ``Well, obviously, those \nMembers of Congress will recognize what the country is confronting and \nvote to carry this forward.'' They barely did it. They cast a vote that \nwould not have worked under the supermajority requirements contained in \nSenate Joint Resolution 1.\n  I think those who say of course we will achieve supermajorities are \nbeing much too sanguine. The amendment says that the debt limit shall \nnot be increased without three-fifths of the whole number. We can \nhardly put together simple majorities in Democratic or Republican \nadministrations to achieve this goal. I have voted in this body to lift \nthe debt ceiling in Republican administrations at the request of \nRepublican Presidents and Republican Secretaries of the Treasury \nbecause I felt obviously we had to do that. We could not put the credit \nof the United States at risk. But those votes have been exceedingly \nclose and they have not come anywhere near meeting the supermajority \nrequirements contained in this Senate Joint Resolution 1. No wonder the \nSecretary of the Treasury has voiced his apprehension that we might \nrisk a default on the debt and hurt the creditworthiness of the United \nStates through the passage of this amendment to the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to think long and hard about this \namendment. It is a very radical proposal. It has a lot of surface \nappeal, as my colleague from California pointed out when she quoted the \neditorial in the Los Angeles Times. The easy vote is obviously to be \nfor it, as most people upon hearing it say it is a good idea. You \nreally have to go into it and examine it very carefully and appreciate \nthe real way you bring the deficit down is to make the budget \ndecisions, not to amend the Constitution of the United States.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This report is submitted pursuant to section 401(c) of the \nNational Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n  Executive Order 12722 ordered the immediate blocking of all property \nand interests in property of the Government of Iraq (including the \nCentral Bank of Iraq) then or thereafter located in the United States \nor within the possession or control of a United States person. That \norder also prohibited the importation into the United States of goods \nand services of Iraqi origin, as well as the exportation of goods, \nservices, and technology from the United States to Iraq. The order \nprohibited travel-related transactions to or from Iraq and the \nperformance of any contract in support of any industrial, commercial, \nor governmental project in Iraq. United States persons were also \nprohibited from granting or extending credit or loans to the Government \nof Iraq.\n  The foregoing prohibitions (as well as the blocking of Government of \nIraq property) were continued and augmented on August 9, 1990, by \nExecutive Order 12724, which was issued in order to align the sanctions \nimposed by the United States with United Nations Security Council \nResolution (UNSCR) 661 of August 6, 1990.\n  Executive Order 12817 was issued on October 21, 1992, to implement in \nthe United States measures adopted in UNSCR 778 of October 2, 1992. \nUNSCR 778 requires U.N. Member States to transfer to a U.N. escrow \naccount any funds (up to $200 million apiece) representing Iraqi oil \nsale proceeds paid by purchasers after the imposition of U.N. sanctions \non Iraq, to finance Iraq's obligations for U.N. activities with respect \nto Iraq, such as expenses to verify Iraqi weapons destruction, and to \nprovide humanitarian assistance in Iraq on a nonpartisan basis. A \nportion of the escrowed funds also finances the activities of the U.N. \nCompensation Commission in Geneva, which handles claims from victims of \nthe Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait. Member States also may \nmake voluntary contributions to the account. The funds placed in the \nescrow account are to be returned, with interest, to the Member States \nthat transferred them to the United Nations, as funds are received from \nfuture sales of Iraqi oil authorized by the U.N. Security Council. No \nMember State is required to fund more than half of the total transfers \nor contributions to the escrow account.\n  This report discusses only matters concerning the national emergency \nwith respect to Iraq that was declared in Executive Order 12722 and \nmatters relating to Executive Orders 12724 and 12817 (the ``Executive \nOrders''). The report covers events from August 2, 1996 through \nFebruary 1, 1997.\n  1. In April 1995, the U.N. Security Council adopted UNSCR 986 \nauthorizing Iraq to export up to $1 billion in petroleum and petroleum \nproducts per quarter for 6 months under U.N. supervision in order to \nfinance the purchase of food, medicine, and other humanitarian \nsupplies. This arrangement may be renewed by the Security Council for \nadditional 6-month periods. UNSCR 986 includes arrangements to ensure \nequitable distribution of humanitarian goods purchased with UNSCR 986 \noil revenues to all the people of Iraq. The resolution also provides \nfor the payment of compensation to victims of Iraqi aggression and for \nthe funding of other U.N. activities with respect to Iraq. On May 20, \n1996, a memorandum of understanding was concluded between the \nSecretariat of the United Nations and the Government of Iraq agreeing \non terms for implementing UNSCR 986. On August 8, 1996, the UNSC \ncommittee established pursuant to UNSCR 661 (``the 661 Committee'') \nadopted procedures to be employed by the 661 Committee in \nimplementation of UNSCR 986. On December 9, 1996, the Secretary General \nreleased the report requested by paragraph 13 of UNSCR 986, making \nUNSCR 986 effective as of 12:01 a.m. December 10.\n  2. During the reporting period, there have been three amendments to \nthe Iraqi Sanctions Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 575 (the \n``Regulations''), administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control \n(OFAC) of the Department of the Treasury. The Regulations were amended \non August 22, 1996, to add the Antiterrorism and Effective Death \nPenalty Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-132; 110 Stat. 1214-1319 (the \n``Antiterrorism Act'')) as an authority for the Regulations (61. Fed. \nReg. 43460, August 23, 1996). Section 321 of the Antiterrorism Act (18 \nU.S.C. 2332d), which I signed into law on April 24, 1996, makes it a \ncriminal offense for United States persons, except as provided in \nregulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury in consultation \nwith the Secretary of State, to engage in financial transactions with \nthe governments of countries designated under section 6(j) of the \nExport Administration Act (50 U.S.C. App. 2405) as supporting \ninternational terrorism. United States persons who engage in such \ntransactions are subject to criminal fines under title 18, United \nStates Code, imprisonment for up to 10 years, or both. Because the \nRegulations already prohibited such transactions, with minor exceptions \nfor transactions such as donations of humanitarian aid, no substantive \nchange to the prohibitions of the Regulations was necessary. This \namendment also notes the criminal penalties that may be imposed for \nviolations of the Antiterrorism Act and implementing regulations. A \ncopy of the amendment is attached.\n  The Regulations were amended on October 21, 1996 (61 Fed. Reg. 54936, \nOctober 23, 1996), to implement section 4 of the Federal Civil \nPenalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended by the Debt \nCollection Improvement Act of 1996, by adjusting for inflation the \namount of the civil monetary penalties that may be assessed under the \nRegulations. The Regulations, as amended, increase the maximum civil \nmonetary penalty provided by law from $250,000 to $275,000 per \nviolation.\n  The amended Regulations also reflect an amendment to 18 U.S.C. 1001 \ncontained in section 330016(1)(L) of Public Law 103-322; 108 Stat. \n2147. The amendment notes the availability of higher criminal fines \npursuant to the formulas set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3571. A copy of the \namendment is attached.\n  The Regulations were amended on December 10, 1996, to provide a \nstatement of licensing policy regarding specific licensing of United \nStates persons seeking to purchase Iraqi-origin petroleum and petroleum \nproducts from Iraq (61 Fed. Reg. 65312, December 11, 1996). Statements \nof licensing policy were also provided regarding sales of essential \nparts and equipment for the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline system, and \nsales of humanitarian goods to Iraq, pursuant to United Nations \napproval. A general license was also added to authorize dealings in \nIraqi-origin petroleum and petroleum products that have been exported \nfrom Iraq with United Nations and United States Government approval. \nThe rule also added definitions and made technical amendments. A copy \nof the amendment is attached.\n  All executory contracts must contain terms requiring that all \nproceeds of oil purchases from the Government of Iraq, including the \nState Oil Marketing Organization must be placed in the U.N. escrow \naccount at Banque Nationale de Paris, New York (the ``986 Escrow \nAccount''), and all Iraqi payments for authorized sales of pipeline \nparts and equipment, humanitarian goods, and incidental transaction \ncosts borne by Iraq will, upon approval by the UNSC committee \nestablished pursuant to the 661 Committee, be paid or payable out of \nthe 986 Escrow Account.\n  3. Investigations of possible violations of the Iraqi sanctions \ncontinue to be pursued and appropriate enforcement actions taken. \nSeveral cases from prior reporting periods are continuing and recent \nadditional allegations have been referred by OFAC to the U.S. Customs \nService for investigation. Several OFAC civil penalty proceedings are \npending. Investigation also continues\n\n[[Page S1189]]\n\ninto the roles played by various individuals and firms outside Iraq in \nthe Iraqi government procurement network. These investigations may lead \nto additions to OFAC's listing of individuals and organizations \ndetermined to be Specially Designated Nationals (SDNs) of the \nGovernment of Iraq.\n  Since my last report, three civil monetary penalties totaling \n$102,250 have been collected from one financial institution and two \nindividuals for violation of the prohibitions against transactions with \nIraq. Additional administrative procedures have been initiated and \nothers await commencement.\n  4. Pursuant to Executive Order 12817 implementing UNSCR 778, on \nOctober 26, 1992, OFAC directed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to \nestablish a blocked account for receipt of certain post-August 6, 1990, \nIraqi oil sales proceeds, and to hold, invest, and transfer these funds \nas required by the Order. On December 13, 1996, OFAC directed the \nFederal Reserve Bank of New York to transfer the interest accrued on \nthe blocked account to the U.N. escrow account established pursuant to \nUNSCR 778, to match contributions in excess of $30 million by other \ncountries.\n  5. The Office of Foreign Assets Control has issued a total of 653 \nspecific licenses regarding transactions pertaining to Iraq or Iraqi \nassets since August 1990. Licenses have been issued for transactions \nsuch as the filing of legal actions against Iraqi governmental \nentities, legal representation of Iraq, and the exportation to Iraq of \ndonated medicine, medical supplies, and food intended for humanitarian \nrelief purposes, the execution of powers of attorney relating to the \nadministration of personal assets and decedents' estates in Iraq and \nthe protection of preexistent intellectual property rights in Iraq. \nSince my last report, 23 specific licenses have been issued.\n  6. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from August 2, 1996, through February 1, 1997, that are directly \nattributable to the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the \ndeclaration of a national emergency with respect to Iraq are reported \nto be about $1 million, most of which represents wage and salary costs \nfor Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in the \nDepartment of the Treasury (particularly in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the Office of the Under \nSecretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the General Counsel), the \nDepartment of State (particularly the Bureau of Economic and Business \nAffairs, the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, the Bureau of \nInternational Organization Affairs, the Bureau of Political-Military \nAffairs, the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, and the Office of the \nLegal Adviser), and the Department of Transportation (particularly the \nU.S. Coast Guard).\n  7. The United States imposed economic sanctions on Iraq in response \nto Iraq's illegal invasion and occupation of Kuwait, a clear act of \nbrutal aggression. The United States, together with the international \ncommunity, is maintaining economic sanctions against Iraq because the \nIraqi regime has failed to comply fully with United Nations Security \nCouncil resolutions. Security Council resolutions on Iraq call for the \nelimination of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, Iraqi recognition of \nKuwait and the inviolability of the Iraq-Kuwait boundary, the release \nof Kuwaiti and other third-country nationals, compensation for victims \nof Iraqi aggression, long-term monitoring of weapons of mass \ndestruction capabilities, the return of Kuwaiti assets stolen during \nIraq's illegal occupation of Kuwait, renunciation of terrorism, an end \nto internal Iraqi repression of its own civilian population, and the \nfacilitation of access of international relief organizations to all \nthose in need in all parts of Iraq. Six years after the invasion, a \npattern of defiance persists: a refusal to account for missing Kuwaiti \ndetainees; failure to return Kuwaiti property worth millions of \ndollars, including military equipment that was used by Iraq in its \nmovement of troops to the Kuwaiti border in October 1994; sponsorship \nof assassinations in Lebanon and in northern Iraq; incomplete \ndeclarations to weapons inspectors and refusal of unimpeded access; and \nongoing widespread human rights violations. As a result, the U.N. \nsanctions remain in place; the United States will continue to enforce \nthose sanctions under domestic authority.\n\n  The Baghdad government continues to violate basic human rights of its \nown citizens through systematic repression of minorities and denial of \nhumanitarian assistance. The Government of Iraq has repeatedly said it \nwill not be bound by UNSCR 688. The Iraqi military routinely harasses \nresidents of the north, and has attempted to ``Arabize'' the Kurdish, \nTurcomen, and Assyrian areas in the north. Iraq has not relented in its \nartillery attacks against civilian population centers in the south, or \nin its burning and draining operations in the southern marshes, which \nhave forced thousands to flee to neighboring states.\n  The policies and actions of the Saddam Hussein regime continue to \npose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and \nforeign policy of the United States, as well as to regional peace and \nsecurity. The U.N. resolutions affirm that the Security Council must be \nassured of Iraq's peaceful intentions in judging its compliance with \nsanctions. Because of Iraq's failure to comply fully with these \nresolutions, the United States will continue to apply economic \nsanctions to deter it from threatening peace and stability in the \nregion.\n                                                  William J.

We wanted this country to go into the 21st century as \na Nation in which every American who was willing to work for it could \nhave a chance--not a guarantee, but a real chance--at the American \ndream. We have worked hard to achieve that goal, and today our economy \nis stronger than it has been in decades.\n\n\n                          the economic record\n\n  The challenge we faced in January 1993 was to put the economy on a \nnew course of fiscal responsibility while continuing to invest in our \nfuture. In the last 4 years, the unemployment rate has come down by \nnearly a third: from 7.5 percent to 5.4 percent. The economy has \ncreated 11.2 million new jobs, and over two-thirds of recent employment \ngrowth has been in industry/occupation groups paying above-median \nwages. Over the past 4 years inflation has averaged 2.8 percent, lower \nthan in any Administration since John F. Kennedy was President. The \ncombination of unemployment and inflation is the lowest it has been in \nthree decades. And business investment has grown more than 11 percent \nper year--its fastest pace since the early 1960s.\n  As the economy has grown, the fruits of that growth are being shared \nmore equitably among all Americans. Between 1993 and 1995 the poverty \nrate fell from 15.1 percent to 13.8 percent--the largest 2-year drop in \nover 20 years. Poverty rates among the elderly and among African-\nAmericans are at the lowest level since these data were first collected \nin 1959. And real median family income has risen by $1,600--the largest \ngrowth rate since the Administration of President Johnson.\n\n\n                          the economic agenda\n\n  Our comprehensive economic agenda has helped put America's economy \nback on the right track. This agenda includes:\n  Historic Deficit Reduction. Since the 1992 fiscal year, the Federal \nbudget deficit has been cut by 63 percent--from $290 billion to $107 \nbillion in fiscal 1996. As a percentage of the Nation's gross domestic \nproduct, the deficit has fallen over the same period from 4.7 percent \nto 1.4 percent, and it is now the lowest it has been in more than 20 \nyears. In 1992 the budget deficit for all levels of government was \nlarger in relation to our economy than those of Japan and Germany were \nto theirs. Now the deficit is smaller by that same measure than in any \nother major industrialized economy. And this Administration has\n\n[[Page S1190]]\n\nproposed a plan that balances the budget by 2002, while protecting \ncritical investments in America's future.\n\n  Investments in Education and Technology. Deficit reduction remains a \npriority, but it is not an end in itself. Balancing the budget by \ncutting investments in education, or by failing to give adequate \nsupport to science and technology, could actually slow economic growth. \nTo succeed in the new global economy, our children must receive a \nworld-class education. Every child in America should be able to read by \nthe age of 8, log onto the Internet by the age of 12, and receive at \nleast 14 years of quality education: 2 years of college should become \nas universal as high school is today. And we must make sure that every \nchild who wants to go to college has the resources to do so.\n  Expanding Markets. We have aggressively sought to expand exports and \nopen markets abroad. In the past 4 years we have achieved two major \ntrade agreements: the North American Free Trade Agreement and the \nUruguay Round accord of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, \nwhich established the World Trade Organization. Members of the Asia-\nPacific Economic Cooperation forum and the proposed Free Trade Area of \nthe Americas have committed to establishing free trade among themselves \nby 2020 and 2005, respectively. And we have opened new markets abroad \nby signing more than 200 other important trade agreements. As a result, \nU.S. exports have bombed, which means higher wages for American workers \nin export industries--often 13 to 16 percent higher than the rest of \nthe workforce.\n  Reforming Government. The strength of the American economy lies in \nthe energy, creativity, and determination of our citizens. Over the \npast 4 years we have worked hard to create an environment in which \nbusiness can flourish. And as the private sector has expanded, the \nFederal Government has improved its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. \nWe have energetically reformed regulations in key sectors of the \neconomy, including telecommunications, electricity, and banking, as \nwell as environmental regulation. And we have reduced the size of the \nFederal Government as a percentage of the workforce to the smallest it \nhas been since the 1930s.\n\n\n          continuing to create an economy for the 21st century\n\n  America's workers are back at work and our factories are humming. \nOnce again, America leads the world in automobile manufacturing. Our \nhigh-technology industries are the most competitive in the world. \nPoverty is down and real wages are at last beginning to rise. And we \nhave laid the foundations for future long-term economic growth by \nreducing the deficit and investing in education.\n  During the past 4 years, we have worked to prepare all Americans for \nthe challenges and opportunities of the new global economy of the 21st \ncentury. We have worked to restore fiscal discipline in our government, \nto expand opportunities for education and training for our children and \nworkers, to reform welfare and encourage work, and to expand the \nfrontiers of free trade. But there is more work to be done. We must \ncontinue to provide our citizens with the tools to make the most of \ntheir own lives so that the American dream is within the reach of every \nAmerican.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of certain ambulance services; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                   the ambulance services act of 1997\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the \nAmbulance Services Act of 1997 today to ensure that Medicare \nbeneficiaries are covered for necessary transport for emergency \ntreatment.\n  I am deeply concerned that Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas have \na difficult time gaining access to emergency care, and there are \nrelatively few hospitals in these areas, and patients must often travel \na great distance to reach them. The Medicare ambulance transport \nreimbursement regulations have not kept pace with changes in the health \ncare system that have occurred as a result of efforts to improve care \nwhile decreasing the cost of care.\n  In many locales, clinics and ambulatory surgery centers staffed by \nphysicians have developed the ability to provide routine emergency \ncare. The local physicians are often available at the clinic, which has \nfacilities and capability for emergency treatment. In fact, patients \nwho are transported to the hospital emergency department during the day \nwait longer to see a physician than those at the clinic, as the \nphysician must travel from the clinic to the hospital in order to see \nthe patient.\n  It is often necessary for seniors who are experiencing a medical \nemergency to be transported via an ambulance. Under current regulation, \nseniors who require ambulance transport to an emergency care facility \nmust be taken to a hospital. Therefore, the senior is left with a \ndifficult choice: be transported to the hospital facility, which may \ntake longer and is likely to involve a longer waiting time for \nemergency care, or be transported to a local facility that provides \nemergency care to other citizens, and pay for the ambulance transport \nout of pocket. Neither of these is an optimal choice.\n  As the reimbursement policy stands now, patients are required to use \na more expensive facility when it may not be necessary. It would seem \nthat allowing reimbursement for transport to nonhospital facilities \nthat provide emergency care could result in fiscal savings in that the \ncost of ambulance transport combined with a clinic visit bill would be \nless than that of ambulance transport and a hospital emergency \ndepartment bill. In addition, it would allow our senior citizens to \nhave a health care benefit that is available to other members of the \ncommunity.\n  Concerns that might arise about the medical necessity of transporting \ncertain patients to a hospital emergency department can and should \ncontinue to be addressed by local and regional emergency medical \nservice systems, based on levels of care that are available in the \narea. These systems set standards and protocols for emergency medical \nservice providers and work with the health care community in developing \nprotocols for transport and patient care.\n  Mr. President, I remain concerned about providing all of our citizens \nwith an adequate level of health care. Our seniors need to be able to \navail themselves of expeditious emergency care, without having to worry \nabout how transport for this care will be paid for. The Ambulance \nServices Act of 1997 will go a long way toward this goal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 292\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Ambulance Services Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. MEDICARE COVERAGE OF CERTAIN AMBULANCE SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Coverage.--Section 1861(s)(7) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(s)(7)) is amended by striking \n     ``regulations;'' and inserting ``regulations, except that \n     such regulations shall not fail to treat ambulance services \n     as medical and other health services solely because, in the \n     case of an emergency, the individual is transported to a \n     clinic or to an ambulatory surgical center;''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to items and services provided on or after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 293. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent the credit for clinical testing expenses for certain drugs \nfor rare diseases or conditions; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      THE ORPHAN DRUG ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Orphan Drug Act \nof 1997, legislation to extend permanently the orphan drug tax credit. \nI am pleased that my good friend and colleague from Montana, Senator \nBaucus, is joining me. Similar legislation was introduced in the House \nlast year by Representatives Nancy Johnson and Robert Matsui. I am \nconfident that they will once again introduce legislation this year to \nmake the credit permanent.\n  Mr. President, this credit encourages private firms to develop \ntreatments for rare diseases. As many of my colleagues know, we \nextended this medical research tax credit last year, but, it will \nexpire on May 31 of this year.\n  Since the 1983 enactment of the orphan drug tax credit we have seen \nvery encouraging progress in developing new drugs to alleviate \nsuffering from a number of so-called orphan diseases, those diseases \nthat afflict a relatively small number of people. Because the process \nof research, development, and approval for new pharmaceuticals is so \ncostly--running into hundreds of millions of dollars--the small market \nfor a drug discourages drug companies from undertaking it.\n  Mr. President, the incentive provided by this credit gives hope to \nindividuals who suffer from such rare but devastating conditions as \nTourette's syndrome. Huntington's disease, and neuro- fibromatosis, to \nname a few. Many\n\n[[Page S1192]]\n\ndrugs designated as orphan drugs have a much small potential market \nthan even the 200,000 patients referred to in the definition in this \ncredit--sometimes they are for conditions that affect as few as 1,000 \npersons in the United States. This means that without some incentive \nthere is simply no possibility for a firm to profit from its decisions \nto develop drugs that treat these diseases.\n  Fortunately, the orphan perception has been changing over the years \nthat this research credit has been in effect. In fact, Mr. President, \npharmaceutical companies have made great strides in discovering \ntreatments for these orphan diseases. While only seven orphan drugs \nwere approved by the FDA in the decade before the credit's initial \npassage, over 100 have been approved since and approximately 600 are \nnow in development.\n  Last year, I mentioned the first-ever treatment for Gaucher disease, \na debilitating and sometimes fatal genetic disorder. This disease \nafflicts fewer than 5,000 people worldwide, yet the company who \ndiscovered the treatment expended its time and money to search for a \ntreatment precisely because of the orphan drug credit's incentives. \nThere are other examples as well.\n\n  Mr. President, this credit's effectiveness has been tested for the \npast 14 years, and it has passed with flying colors. Few provisions of \nthe tax code can claim to have clearly reduced human suffering and to \nhave expanded our store of medical knowledge. This credit has done \nboth.\n  By helping small, entrepreneurial firms to take advantage of the \norphan drug credit, we can make it even more effective. Before last \nyear, the tax credit only served as an incentive for companies that \nearn a current-year-profit. If the credit could not be used \nimmediately, it was lost forever. For large, profitable drug companies, \nthis was rarely a problem.\n  However, for many small, start-up pharmaceutical companies, this \ncurrent-year restriction made the credit of little or no use. These \nfirms typically lose money in the early years since they put all \navailable funding into research. They only expect to see profits many \nyears into the future.\n  In order to improve the credit's usefulness, we modified the credit \nin legislation last year to allow firms to carry the credit back 3 \nyears and carry it forward 15 years. This will give small, growing \ncompanies an incentive to find ways to treat these rare diseases that \ncause so many to suffer. I have been impressed by the strides being \nmade in the biomedical field, including growing firms in my home State \nof Utah.\n  In the course of research, scientists often stumble upon treatments \nthat could, if developed, improve the lives of victims of rare \ndiseases. However, because of the high cost of drug experiments and the \nenormous expense involved in gaining FDA approval, many researchers \nreluctantly set these promising drug innovations aside. Mr. President, \nthis should not happen, not when so many are suffering from these rare \ndiseases, and we have an effective credit available that has proven its \nbenefits.\n  The following national groups officially endorse the Orphan Drug Act \nof 1997: National Organization for Rare Disorders [NORD], National \nMultiple Sclerosis Society, Tourette Syndrome Association, United \nParkinson Foundation, American Autoimmune Related Disease Association, \nLeukemia Society of American, Cystinosis Foundation, New England \nBiomedical Research Coalition, Biotechnology Industry Organization, and \nthe Epilepsy Foundation.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to join us in sponsoring this bipartisan \nlegislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthis bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 293\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CREDIT FOR CERTAIN CLINICAL TESTING EXPENSES MADE \n                   PERMANENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 45C of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to clinical testing expenses for certain \n     drugs for rare diseases or conditions) is amended by striking \n     subsection (e).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to amounts paid or incurred after May 31, 1997.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \n        Hagel, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Gramm, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 294. A bill to amend chapter 51 of title 18, United States Code, \nto establish Federal penalties for the killing or attempted killing of \na law enforcement officer of the District of Columbia, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n  THE OFFICER BRIAN GIBSON DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA POLICE PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I appreciate this opportunity. I \ncame to the floor because I want to introduce a bill today that I think \nis very important. It is the Officer Brian Gibson District of Columbia \nPolice Protection Act. I send this bill to the desk and ask for its \nappropriate referral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and appropriately \nreferred.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Madam President. I am introducing this \nbill today on behalf of myself, Senator Lott, Senator Thurmond and \nSenator Sessions, because I think that today when we are laying to rest \na person who has given his life for the public protection, Officer \nGibson, in the District of Columbia, who was brutally murdered in his \nsquad car. A person went up to his car, stuck a gun in his face and \nshot it.\n  If we cannot protect that man and make sure that he has every \npossible ounce of support that we can give to protect him, then I do \nnot know what we can do to help the crime rate in the District.\n  I hope very much that the Mayor of the District and Congresswoman \nNorton will be helpful on this. I have not yet been able to talk to \nthem though I have put in a call. But the bottom line is we are trying \nto make the Capital City good for the people who live here but also \ngood for any American or any foreign visitor, so they can come and see \nthe most beautiful symbol of America possible. And that is not the case \ntoday.\n  So we are asking for the death penalty for the murder of a police \nofficer in the District of Columbia, the same protection that a member \nof the Capitol Police now has and that police in 38 States now have. I \nthink this is one way to say that if you are going to commit a heinous \ncrime like this, you are going to face the ultimate of penalties.\n  I want Officer Gibson and his family to know that we appreciate that \nhe gave his life in the line of duty. I want them to know that in the \nfuture, in his memory, we are going to not only give the highest \npenalty to someone who would kill one of his comrades, but we will also \ngive restitution to the family that is suffering from the loss of their \nbreadwinner, their father, their husband.\n  So I will introduce this bill today. I hope that we can get immediate \naction on it because it is time for us to say that the District of \nColumbia is going to be the model Capital City. I know all of us, on a \nbipartisan basis, want to make that happen. We want to come together to \nmake this city work. After all, it is the beacon to the world for what \nis good about America. It is time that the Capital City met that test.\n  So in memory of Officer Gibson, I hope we will pass this bill. I hope \nwe will do everything possible to get the crime rate in our Capital \nCity down so that visitors from all over America will want to come and \nsee this beautiful city that is our Capital.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Coats, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Frist, \n        Mr. DeWine, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Hutchinson, Ms. Collins, Mr. Warner, \n        Mr. McConnell, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Grassley, Mr. \n        Nickles, Mr. Mack, and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 295. A bill to amend the National Labor Relations Act to allow \nlabor management cooperative efforts that improve economic \ncompetitiveness in the United States to continue to thrive, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n          the teamwork for employees and managers act of 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am introducing, together with a \nnumber of my colleagues, the Teamwork for Employees and Managers Act of\n\n[[Page S1193]]\n\n1997. This bill is identical to the TEAM Act approved by the Senate \nlast year.\n  This bill responds to a series of decisions by the National Labor \nRelations Board which have cast doubt on the legality of many forms of \nworkplace cooperation. Specifically, the Board held in the \nElectromation case that certain employer-employee committees violated \nthe National Labor Relations Act's prohibition against employer-\nassisted labor organizations.\n  This ruling has had a chilling effect on some 30,000 companies that \nhave employee involvement programs. The TEAM Act amends Federal labor \nlaw to allow voluntary workplace cooperation to continue. The \nlegislation allows employers and employees to meet together to address \nissues of mutual interest, including issues related to quality, \nproductivity, and efficiency as long as the committees or other joint \nprograms do not engage in collective bargaining.\n  This last point is important. The bill does not allow employers to \nestablish company unions or sham unions that undermined independent \ncollective bargaining back in the 1930's. Under the TEAM Act, workers \nretain the right, as well they should, to choose an independent union \nto engage in collective bargaining.\n  More importantly, the TEAM Act gives workers the opportunity for \ngreater input and involvement in the workplace. Not only does this \nallow workers to improve and expand their skills, but workplace \ncooperation also increases our productivity and competitive edge in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  This bill received bipartisan support in the last Congress, and I am \nconfident it will again this year. This bill is not about labor versus \nmanagement. It's about clarifying the law so that workers and \nmanagement can work together to their mutual benefit and to the benefit \nof our economy as a whole. I look forward to working with Members on \nboth sides of the aisle so that the TEAM Act becomes law in the very \nnear future.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today I rise in support of my colleague \nfrom Vermont in his introduction of the Team Work for Employees And \nManagement Act. I thank the Senator from Vermont for his leadership in \nhelping American workers develop the capacity to be competitive, to be \nproductive, and to maintain our standard of excellence throughout the \nworld. The Team Act, which passed both the Senate and the House during \nthe 104th Congress, but was vetoed by President Clinton, is vital to \nthe survivability and strength of our Nation's economy.\n  Our Nation's strength is a result of recognizing the importance of \nthe human resource in the equation. You simply cannot be competitive \nwithout tapping every part of the resource that you have. When we think \nof the NCAA basketball tournament next month, it is unthinkable that we \nwould send teams into competition and forbid the coaches to talk to the \nplayers. What nonsense that would be.\n  It is fundamental recognition of the fact that the people on the \ncourt will have a different perspective than the people off the court. \nThe people on the field will have an awareness of how things are going \nthat is special, different, unique, and of value.\n  The same is true in industry. No matter how hard a compassionate \nmanager tried to observe the process from outside, no matter how well \nthe engineer from the design room tries to structure the environment \nfor productivity, the person who actually is on the floor is going to \nhave the ability to say, ``This doesn't work here. It may look good in \ntheory, but it doesn't work in practice.''\n  I think that is what the TEAM Act is all about. It is about \nunderstanding and recognizing the tremendous resource that workers are, \nthat they can be to the competitive position of this country by \noutproducing, outworking, outthinking, outsmarting, and out- \ncooperating workers anyplace else in the world.\n  Most Americans would believe, and it is because we are commonsense \npeople, that it is OK for employees and employers to talk. If you would \nhave listened to the debate in this Chamber, you would have heard from \nthose on the other side of the aisle, ``Why, it's all right, it's all \nOK, it's perfectly legal right now. We don't need this.''\n  When opponents of the TEAM Act say it is perfectly legal now, we do \nnot need this law, it confounds me. Let me read from a list of things \nthat have been ruled inappropriate for nonunion employers to talk to \ntheir nonunion employees on, so the American people have an \nunderstanding of what the law is and whether it needs to be changed.\n  If you discuss the extension of the employees' lunch breaks by 15 \nminutes, that is illegal, from the case of Sertafilm and Atlas \nMicrofilming; the length of the workday, to discuss how long each \nworkday is going to be, that is illegal, from Weston & Booker Co. A \ndecrease in rest breaks from 15 to 10 minutes, that is illegal to talk \nabout with workers. What paid holidays you have--the Singer \nManufacturing case held that was illegal to talk about. The extension \nof store hours during wheat harvest season--the Dillon's company case \nsaid you cannot talk with workers about that to get their input.\n  Workers know what kind of break they need. Workers know what kind of \nworkday they would like to work. I know of one plant in my home State \nwhere workers decided they wanted to work 4 days of 10 hours a day \ninstead of 5 days of 8 hours a day and have 3-day weekends every week. \nWhy would Government stand between workers and manufacturers, between \nmanagers and employees or their associates to say you cannot discuss \nthose things, and yet that is what the law is for 8 out of 9 American \nworkers, because 8 out of 9 American workers are nonunion workers.\n  The National Labor Relations Act governs election of unions and \ncollective bargaining. Section 8(a)(2) was passed in 1935 to prohibit \nthe establishment of sham company unions, a tactic commonly used by \nemployers to defeat union organizing. These organizations pretended to \nengage in collective bargaining, but followed management's dictates and \ntypically were run by officers handpicked by management. Companies then \npretended to enter into collective-bargaining agreements with these \nsham organizations so that when a union attempted to organize the \nworkers, the companies could hide behind the exclusive representation \nand contract bar tenets of the law.\n  Vigorous enforcement of section 8(a)(2) resulted in the demise of the \ncompany unions by the early 1950's. While sham unions should continue \nto be prohibited under our labor laws--and would remain so under the \nTEAM Act--the broad prohibition that remains in effect today prevents \nthe types of legitimate cooperative working relationships that \nencourage worker participation and decisionmaking.\n  Let me give you an example. When I was Governor of the State of \nMissouri, I had the opportunity to work with companies. Like I do \ntoday, I would go and work on the assembly line. I would go and work \nwith people to learn about their jobs and talk to them about their \nconcerns.\n  One of the companies that was hauled into the justice system of the \nLabor Department for cooperating with its employees was a company \ncalled EFCO Corp. It was a small company in Missouri, having \napproximately 60 jobs. Now it has over 1,000 jobs. Much of its capacity \nwas to increase its on-time deliveries, which went from the low \nseventies up into the high nineties, and which allowed workers to start \nworking 4 days a week instead of 5 days a week, get their 40 hours in 4 \ndays and have long weekends, spend more time with their kids, \naccommodate the demands of their families. It all came from these \nprograms.\n  What was most distressing was that when EFCO wanted to be involved, \nit was said to have dominated its discussion groups or teams because \nthey provided employees with pencils and pens and allowed them to have \naccess to the financial records of the company. That was what the NLRB \nsaid was a violation.\n  You would say this company is bending over backward. It opens up the \nbooks to the workers and says: How can we do better for and how can we, \nas a team, do better, how can we as a company have the kind of \nperformance and productivity that will recommend us to the world? And \nindeed they are now a world-class company. But because they provided \nthe pens and pencils and they allowed the workers to have access to the \ncompany's financial records, the NLRB filed charges\n\n[[Page S1194]]\n\nagainst the company. This is not the kind of thing that recommends \nAmerica for leadership. It is the kind of thing that takes correction.\n  Opponents say if you talk about those things, the workers will think \nyou have union when you don't. It will be a sham union. Frankly, I do \nnot underestimate the American worker that severely.\n  Over the Christmas break I went to and worked in about five or six \nplaces in Missouri, actually on the job side-by-side with people. I \nnever met a single worker who did not know whether he or she was in a \nunion. They know. Workers know whether union dues are being deducted. \nThe know whether they are in a separate organization. It is not hard. \nThis is not above the capacity of the American worker. The idea somehow \nthat if we allow managers to talk to employees, employees will be \ntricked into thinking they have a union when they do not have a union \nis ludicrous. It underestimates the intelligence of the American work \nforce.\n\n  A second objective from the other side is, ``Well, maybe if we allow \npeople to talk, they will be just talking to certain employees who only \nhave limited views, and they will not reflect the views of employees \ngenerally.'' There is a safeguard. If there is an unfair system \nestablished where workers and employers are communicating with each \nother and it is working against the interests of the workers, it is \neasy. Workers have every right to unionize. They can form a labor \nunion. They can petition for a labor union. They can ask that unions \ncome in if they think it is unfair.\n  There is a structural guarantee of competition. If nonunion systems \nare not working well for employees, if these things are likely to be so \ndistorted or so unfair, nothing in this law, nothing in this proposal, \nin any way derogates, undermines, erodes, or otherwise lessens the \nright of a worker to petition for an election to organize or unionize a \nplant.\n  There are about 30,000 employers that would like to have such \nemployee-involvement programs. Why is it they would like to have such \nprograms? Because they have seen that when we work together we succeed. \nStrange to me, that is basically a quote from President Clinton's 1996 \nState of the Union Address. He said, and I agree, ``When companies and \nworkers work as a team, they do better, and so does America.''\n  The real truth of the matter is understood in the hearts and minds of \neveryone who has every worked on a team, knowing that when you work \ntogether, you do better than when you work at odds with each other.\n  The ability of union workers to collaborate with employers is well \nensconced. It is fought for by the unions and protected by the \nemployers, recognized as a great benefit. But why should we limit that \ngreat benefit to 11 or 12 percent of our society, to the 1 out of 9 \nworkers in America that are in unions? Why not extend this benefit to \nall workers in America saying that it is entirely appropriate for \nnonunion workers, as well as union workers, to be involved in \ncollaborating and cooperating, in providing their good judgment of how \nbest to improve the situation for workers and to improve the \nproductivity and profitability of the business?\n  No. I do not think we would send our teams to the NCAA tournament \nforbidding the players to talk to the coaches. We have too much sense \nto do that. No, I do not think that union companies are going to stop \nhaving team discussions between employees and the company owners and \nmanagers. They have too much sense to do that. And, no, I do not think \nthat this Government should stand between the owners of corporations \nand their managers and the employees who work hard and want to succeed \nand want to be productive and keep them from talking to each other, \nbecause I believe the American people have too much sense to do that.\n  I urge my colleagues to extend this benefit which now inures to the \nbenefit of 1 out of 9 workers in America to the rest of the working \npopulation. Let us give everyone an opportunity to contribute to a \nwinning effort, to succeed. That will maintain America's position as \nthe most productive and most profitable and most rewarding place, not \njust for companies, but for citizens, not just for institutions, but \nfor individuals. It is, in fact, a reason that America continues to \ndraw people from around the globe. It is the fact that we have \nrecognized the worth and value of individuals. And for us to deny their \nvalue in a commercial setting would be a substantial error which we \nmust not make.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I herewith submit a copy of \nRules of Procedure adopted by the Committee on Governmental Affairs \npursuant to rule XXVI, section 2, Standing Rules of the Senate, and ask \nthat they be printed in the Record at this point.\n  The Rules of Procedure follow:\n\n      Rules of Procedure of the Committee on Governmental Affairs\n\n     (Pursuant to Rule XXVI, Sec. 2, Standing Rules of the Senate)\n\n\n      RULE 1. MEETINGS AND MEETING PROCEDURES OTHER THAN HEARINGS\n\n       A. Meeting dates. The Committee shall hold its regular \n     meetings on the first Thursday of each month, when the \n     Congress is in session, or at such other times as the \n     chairman shall determine. Additional meetings may be called \n     by the chairman as he deems necessary to expedite Committee \n     business. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       B. Calling special Committee meetings. If at least three \n     members of the Committee desire the chairman to call a \n     special meeting, they may file in the offices of the \n     Committee a written request therefor, addressed to the \n     chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk of the Committee \n     shall notify the chairman of such request. If, within three \n     calendar days after the filing of such request, the chairman \n     fails to call the requested special meeting, which is to be \n     held within seven calendar days after the filing of such \n     request, a majority of the Committee members may file in the \n     offices of the Committee their written notice that a special \n     Committee meeting will be held, specifying the date and hour \n     thereof, and the Committee shall meet on that date and hour. \n     Immediately upon the filing of such notice, the Committee \n     clerk shall notify all Committee members that such special \n     meeting will be held and inform them of its date and hour. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 3, Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C.

Written notices of Committee \n     meetings, accompanied by an agenda, enumerating the items of \n     business to be considered, shall be sent to all Committee \n     members at least three days in advance of such meetings, \n     excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays in which the \n     Senate is not in session. In the event that unforeseen \n     requirements or Committee business prevent a three-day notice \n     of either the meeting or agenda, the Committee staff shall \n     communicate such notice and agenda, or any revisions to the \n     agenda, as soon as practicable by telephone or otherwise to \n     members or appropriate staff assistants in their offices.\n       D. Open business meetings. Meetings for the transaction of \n     Committee or Subcommittee business shall be conducted in open \n     session, except that a meeting or series of meetings on the \n     same subject for a period of no more than fourteen calendar \n     days may be closed to the public on a motion made and \n     seconded to go into closed session to discuss only whether \n     the matters enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) below would \n     require the meeting to be closed, followed immediately by a \n     record vote in open session by a majority of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee members when it is determined that the matters \n     to be discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting \n     or meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or \n     Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or \n     procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the duty of the chairman to enforce \n     order on his own initiative and without any point of order \n     being made by a member of the Committee or Subcommittee; \n     provided, further, that when the chairman finds it necessary \n     to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear the room, \n     and the Committee or Subcommittee may act in closed session \n     for so long as there is doubt of the assurance of order. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec.5(d), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       E.

(1) The Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, \n     may poll (a) internal Committee or Subcommittee matters \n     including the Committee's or Subcommittee's staff, records \n     and budget; (b) steps in an investigation, including issuance \n     of subpoenas, applications for immunity orders, and requests \n     for documents from agencies; and (c) other Committee or \n     Subcommittee business other than a vote on reporting to the \n     Senate any measures, matters or recommendations or a vote on \n     closing a meeting or hearing to the public.\n       (2) Only the chairman, or a Committee member or staff \n     officer designated by him, may undertake any poll of the \n     members of the Committee. If any member requests, any matter \n     to be polled shall be held for meeting rather than being \n     polled. The chief clerk of the Committee shall keep a record \n     of polls; if a majority of the members of the Committee \n     determine that the polled matter is in one of the areas \n     enumerated in subsection (D) of Rule 1, the record of the \n     poll shall be confidential. Any Committee member may move at \n     the Committee meeting following the poll for a vote on the \n     polled decision, such motion and vote to be subject to the \n     provisions of subsection (D) of Rule 1, where applicable.\n\n\n             RULE 4. CHAIRMANSHIP OF MEETINGS AND HEARINGS\n\n       The chairman shall preside at all Committee meetings and \n     hearings except that he shall designate a temporary chairman \n     to act in his place if he is unable to be present at a \n     scheduled meeting or hearing. If the chairman (or his \n     designee) is absent ten minutes after the scheduled time set \n     for a meeting or hearing, the ranking majority member present \n     shall preside until the chairman's arrival. If there is no \n     member of the majority present, the ranking minority member \n     present, with the prior approval of the chairman, may open \n     and conduct the meeting or hearing until such time as a \n     member of the majority arrives.\n\n\n                RULE 5. HEARINGS AND HEARINGS PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Announcement of hearings. The Committee, or any \n     Subcommittee thereof, shall make public announcement of the \n     date, time and subject matter of any hearing to be conducted \n     on any measure or matter at least one week in advance of such \n     hearing, unless the Committee, or Subcommittee, determines \n     that there is good cause to begin such hearing at an earlier \n     date. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 4(a), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       B. Open hearings. Each hearing conducted by the Committee, \n     or any Subcommittee thereof, shall be open to the public, \n     except that a hearing or series of hearings on the same \n     subject for a period of no more than fourteen calendar days \n     may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to \n     go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters \n     enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) below would require the \n     hearing to be closed, followed immediately by a record vote \n     in open session by a majority of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee members when it is determined that the matters \n     to be discussed or the testimony to be taken at such hearing \n     or hearings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of Committee or \n     Subcommittee staff personnel or internal staff management or \n     procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise expose an individual to public \n     contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly unwarranted \n     invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of an informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever disorder arises \n     during a Committee or Subcommittee meeting that is open to \n     the public, or any demonstration of approval or disapproval \n     is indulged in by any person in attendance at any such \n     meeting, it shall be the duty of the chairman to enforce \n     order on his own initiative and without any point of order \n     being made by a member of the Committee or Subcommittee; \n     provided, further, that when the chairman finds it necessary \n     to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear the room, \n     and the Committee or Subcommittee may act in closed session \n     for so long as there is doubt of the assurance of order. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec.5(d), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Full Committee subpoenas. The chairman, with the \n     approval of the ranking minority member of the Committee, is \n     authorized to subpoena the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other \n     materials at a hearing or deposition, provided that the \n     chairman may subpoena attendance or production\n\n[[Page S1197]]\n\n     without the approval of the ranking minority member where the \n     chairman or a staff officer designated by him has not \n     received notification from the ranking minority member or a \n     staff officer designated by him of disapproval of the \n     subpoena within 72 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of \n     being notified of the subpoena. If a subpoena is disapproved \n     by the ranking minority member as provided in this \n     subsection, the subpoena may be authorized by vote of the \n     members of the Committee. When the Committee or chairman \n     authorizes subpoenas, subpoenas may be issued upon the \n     signature of the chairman or any other member of the \n     Committee designated by the chairman.\n       D. Witness counsel. Counsel retained by any witness and \n     accompanying such witness shall be permitted to be present \n     during the testimony of such witness at any public or \n     executive hearing or deposition to advise such witness while \n     he or she is testifying, of his or her legal rights; \n     provided, however, that in the case of any witness who is an \n     officer or employee of the government, or of a corporation or \n     association, the Committee chairman may rule that \n     representation by counsel from the government, corporation, \n     or association or by counsel representing other witnesses, \n     creates a conflict of interest, and that the witness may only \n     be represented during interrogation by staff or during \n     testimony before the Committee by personal counsel not from \n     the government, corporation, or association or by personal \n     counsel not representing other witnesses. This subsection \n     shall not be construed to excuse a witness from testifying in \n     the event his counsel is ejected for conducting himself in \n     such manner so as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct or \n     interfere with the orderly administration of the hearings; \n     nor shall this subsection be construed as authorizing counsel \n     to coach the witness or answer for the witness. The failure \n     of any witness to secure counsel shall not excuse such \n     witness from complying with a subpoena or deposition notice.\n       E. Witness transcripts. An accurate electronic or \n     stenographic record shall be kept of the testimony of all \n     witnesses in executive and public hearings. The record of his \n     or her testimony whether in public or executive session shall \n     be made available for inspection by the witness or his or her \n     counsel under Committee supervision; a copy of any testimony \n     given in public session or that part of the testimony given \n     by the witness in executive session and subsequently quoted \n     or made part of the record in a public session shall be \n     provided to any witness at his or her expense if he or she so \n     requests. Upon inspecting his or her transcript, within a \n     time limit set by the chief clerk of the Committee, a witness \n     may request changes in the transcript to correct errors of \n     transcription and grammatical errors; the chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him shall rule on such requests.\n       F. Impugned persons. Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     is specifically identified, and who believes that evidence \n     presented, or comment made by a member of the Committee or \n     staff officer, at a public hearing or at a closed hearing \n     concerning which there have been public reports, tends to \n     impugn his or her character or adversely affect his or her \n     reputation may:\n       (a) file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     evidence or comment, which statement shall be considered for \n     placement in the hearing record by the Committee;\n       (b) request the opportunity to appear personally before the \n     Committee to testify in his or her own behalf, which request \n     shall be considered by the Committee; and\n       (c) submit questions in writing which he or she requests be \n     used for the cross-examination of other witnesses called by \n     the Committee, which questions shall be considered for use by \n     the Committee.\n       G. Radio, television, and photography. The Committee, or \n     any Subcommittee thereof, may permit the proceedings of \n     hearings which are open to the public to be photographed and \n     broadcast by radio, television or both, subject to such \n     conditions as the Committee, or Subcommittee, may impose. \n     (Rule XXVI, Sec.5(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       H. Advance statements of witnesses. A witness appearing \n     before the Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, shall \n     provide 100 copies of a written statement and an executive \n     summary or synopsis of his proposed testimony at least 48 \n     hours prior to his appearance. This requirement may be waived \n     by the chairman and the ranking minority member following \n     their determination that there is good cause for failure of \n     compliance. (Rule XXVI, Sec.4(b), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate.)\n       I. Minority witnesses. In any hearings conducted by the \n     Committee, or any Subcommittee thereof, the minority members \n     of the Committee or Subcommittee shall be entitled, upon \n     request to the chairman by a majority of the minority \n     members, to call witnesses of their selection during at least \n     one day of such hearings. (Rule XXVI, Sec.4(d), Standing \n     Rules of the Senate.)\n       J. Full Committee depositions. Depositions may be taken \n     prior to or after a hearing as provided in this subsection.\n       (1) Notices for the taking of depositions shall be \n     authorized and issued by the chairman, with the approval of \n     the ranking minority member of the Committee, provided that \n     the chairman may initiate depositions without the approval of \n     the ranking minority member where the chairman or a staff \n     officer designated by him has not received notification from \n     the ranking minority member or a staff officer designated by \n     him of disapproval of the deposition within 72 hours, \n     excluding Saturdays and Sundays, of being notified of the \n     deposition notice. If a deposition notice is disapproved by \n     the ranking minority member as provided in this subsection, \n     the deposition notice may be authorized by a vote of the \n     members of the Committee. Committee deposition notices shall \n     specify a time and place for examination, and the name of the \n     Committee member or members or staff officer or officers who \n     will take the deposition. Unless otherwise specified, the \n     deposition shall be in private. The Committee shall not \n     initiate procedures leading to criminal or civil enforcement \n     proceedings for a witness' failure to appear or produce \n     unless the deposition notice was accompanied by a Committee \n     subpoena.\n       (2) Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition by counsel \n     to advise them of their legal rights, subject to the \n     provisions of Rule 5D.\n       (3) Oaths at depositions may be administered by an \n     individual authorized by local law to administer oaths. \n     Questions shall be propounded orally by Committee member or \n     members or staff. If a witness objects to a question and \n     refuses to testify, the objection shall be noted for the \n     record and the Committee member or members or staff may \n     proceed with the remainder of the deposition.\n       (4) The Committee shall see that the testimony is \n     transcribed or electronically recorded (which may include \n     audio or audio/video recordings). If it is transcribed, the \n     transcript shall be made available for inspection by the \n     witness or his or her counsel under Committee supervision. \n     The witness shall sign a copy of the transcript and may \n     request changes to it, which shall be handled in accordance \n     with the procedure set forth in subsection (E). If the \n     witness fails to sign a copy, the staff shall note that fact \n     on the transcript. The individual administering the oath \n     shall certify on the transcript that the witness was duly \n     sworn in his presence, the transcriber shall certify that the \n     transcript is a true record of the testimony, and the \ntranscript shall then be filed with the chief clerk of the Committee. \nThe chairman or a staff officer designated by him may stipulate with \nthe witness to changes in the procedure; deviations from this procedure \nwhich do not substantially impair the reliability of the record shall \nnot relieve the witness from his or her obligation to testify \ntruthfully.\n\n\n                 RULE 6. COMMITTEE REPORTING PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Timely filing. When the Committee has ordered a measure \n     or matter reported, following final action the report thereon \n     shall be filed in the Senate at the earliest practicable \n     time. (Rule XXVI, Sec.10(b), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       B. Supplemental, minority, and additional views. A member \n     of the Committee who gives notice of his intention to file \n     supplemental, minority or additional views at the time of \n     final Committee approval of a measure or matter, shall be \n     entitled to not less than three calendar days in which to \n     file such views, in writing, with the chief clerk of the \n     Committee. Such views shall then be included in the Committee \n     report and printed in the same volume, as a part thereof, and \n     their inclusion shall be noted on the cover of the report. In \n     the absence of timely notice, the Committee report may be \n     filed and printed immediately without such views. (Rule XXVI, \n     Sec. 10(c), Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n       C. Notice by Subcommittee chairmen. The chairman of each \n     Subcommittee shall notify the chairman in writing whenever \n     any measure has been ordered reported by such Subcommittee \n     and is ready for consideration by the full Committee.\n       D. Draft reports of Subcommittees. All draft reports \n     prepared by Subcommittees of this Committee on any measure or \n     matter referred to it by the chairman, shall be in the form, \n     style, and arrangement required to conform to the applicable \n     provisions of the Standing Rules of the Senate, and shall be \n     in accordance with the established practices followed by the \n     Committee. Upon completion of such draft reports, copies \n     thereof shall be filed with the chief clerk of the Committee \n     at the earliest practicable time.\n       E. Impact statements in reports. All Committee reports, \n     accompanying a bill or joint resolution of a public character \n     reported by the Committee, shall contain (1) an estimate, \n     made by the Committee, of the costs which would be incurred \n     in carrying out the legislation for the then current fiscal \n     year and for each of the next five years thereafter (or for \n     the authorized duration of the proposed legislation, if less \n     than five years); and (2) a comparison of such cost estimates \n     with any made by a Federal agency; or (3) in lieu of such \n     estimate or comparison, or both, a statement of the reasons \n     for failure by the Committee to comply with these \n     requirements as impracticable, in the event of inability to \n     comply therewith. (Rule XXVI, Sec.11(a), Standing Rules of \n     the Senate.)\n       Each such report shall also contain an evaluation, made by \n     the Committee, of the regulatory impact which would be \n     incurred in carrying out the bill or joint resolution. The \n     evaluation shall include (a) an estimate of the numbers of \n     individuals and businesses who would be regulated and a \n     determination of the groups and classes of such individuals \n     and businesses, (b) a determination of the economic impact of \n     such regulation on the\n\n[[Page S1198]]\n\n     individuals, consumers, and businesses affected, (c) a \n     determination of the impact on the personal privacy of the \n     individuals affected, and (d) a determination of the amount \n     of paperwork that will result from the regulations to be \n     promulgated pursuant to the bill or joint resolution, which \n     determination may include, but need not be limited to, \n     estimates of the amount of time and financial costs required \n     of affected parties, showing whether the effects of the bill \n     or joint resolution could be substantial, as well as \n     reasonable estimates of the recordkeeping requirements that \n     may be associated with the bill or joint resolution. Or, in \n     lieu of the forgoing evaluation, the report shall include a \n     statement of the reasons for failure by the Committee to \n     comply with these requirements as impracticable, in the event \n     of inability to comply therewith. (Rule XXVI, Sec.11(b), \n     Standing Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n           RULE 7. SUBCOMMITTEES AND SUBCOMMITTEE PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Regularly established Subcommittees. The Committee shall \n     have three regularly established Subcommittees. The \n     Subcommittees are as follows:\n       Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n       Oversight of Government Management, Restructuring and the \n     District of Columbia.\n       International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services.\n       B. Ad hoc Subcommittees. Following consultation with the \n     ranking minority member, the chairman shall, from time to \n     time, establish such ad hoc Subcommittees as he deems \n     necessary to expedite Committee business.\n       C. Subcommittee membership. Following consultation with the \n     majority members, and the ranking minority member of the \n     Committee, the chairman shall announce selections for \n     membership on the Subcommittees referred to in paragraphs A \n     and B, above.\n       D. Subcommittee meetings and hearings. Each Subcommittee of \n     this Committee is authorized to establish meeting dates and \n     adopt rules not inconsistent with the rules of the Committee \n     except as provided in Rules 2(D) and 7(E).\n       E. Subcommittee subpoenas. Each Subcommittee is authorized \n     to adopt rules concerning subpoenas which need not be \n     consistent with the rules of the Committee; provided, \n     however, that in the event the Subcommittee authorizes the \n     issuance of a subpoena pursuant to its own rules, a written \n     notice of intent to issue the subpoena shall be provided to \n     the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee, or \n     staff officers designated by them, by the Subcommittee \n     chairman or a staff officer designated by him immediately \n     upon such authorization, and no subpoena shall issue for at \n     least 48 hours, excluding Saturdays and Sundays, from \n     delivery to the appropriate offices, unless the chairman and \n     ranking minority member waive the 48 hour waiting period or \n     unless the Subcommittee chairman certifies in writing to the \n     chairman and ranking minority member that, in his opinion, it \n     is necessary to issue a subpoena immediately.\n       F. Subcommittee budgets. Each Subcommittee of this \n     Committee, which requires authorization for the expenditure \n     of funds for the conduct of inquiries and investigations, \n     shall file with the chief clerk of the Committee, not later \n     than January 10 of the first year of each new Congress, its \n     request for funds for the two (2) 12-month periods beginning \n     on March 1 and extending through and including the last day \n     of February of the two following years, which years comprise \n     that Congress. Each such request shall be submitted on the \n     budget form prescribed by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration, and shall be accompanied by a written \n     justification addressed to the chairman of the Committee, \n     which shall include (1) a statement of the Subcommittee's \n     area of activities, (2) its accomplishments during the \n     preceding Congress detailed year by year, and (3) a table \n     showing a comparison between (a) the funds authorized for \n     expenditure during the preceding Congress detailed year by \n     year, (b) the funds actually expended during that Congress \n     detailed year by year, (c) the amount requested for each year \n     of the Congress, and (d) the number of professional and \n     clerical staff members and consultants employed by the \n     Subcommittee during the preceding Congress detailed year by \n     year and the number of such personnel requested for each year \n     of the Congress. The chairman may request additional reports \n     from the Subcommittees regarding their activities and budgets \n     at any time during a Congress. (Rule XXVI, Sec. 9, Standing \n     Rules of the Senate.)\n\n\n             RULE 8. CONFIRMATION STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES\n\n       A. Standards. In considering a nomination, the Committee \n     shall inquire into the nominee's experience, qualifications, \n     suitability, and integrity to serve in the position to which \n     he or she has been nominated. The Committee shall recommend \n     confirmation, upon finding that the nominee has the necessary \n     integrity and is affirmatively qualified by reason of \n     training, education, or experience to carry out the functions \n     of the office to which he or she was nominated.\n       B. Information Concerning the Nominee. Each nominee shall \n     submit the following information to the Committee:\n       (1) A detailed biographical resume which contains \n     information relating to education, employment and \n     achievements;\n       (2) Financial information, including a financial statement \n     which lists assets and liabilities of the nominee and tax \n     returns for the 3 years preceding the time of his or her \n     nomination, and copies of other relevant documents requested \n     by the Committee, such as a proposed blind trust agreement, \n     necessary for the Committee's consideration; and,\n       (3) Copies of other relevant documents the Committee may \n     request, such as responses to questions concerning the \n     policies and programs the nominee intends to pursue upon \n     taking office.\n       At the request of the chairman or the ranking minority \n     member, a nominee shall be required to submit a certified \n     financial statement compiled by an independent auditor.\n       Information received pursuant to this subsection shall be \n     made available for public inspection; provided, however, that \n     tax returns shall, after review by persons designated in \n     subsection (C) of this rule, be placed under seal to ensure \n     confidentiality.\n       C. Procedures for Committee inquiry. The Committee shall \n     conduct an inquiry into the experience, qualifications, \n     suitability, and integrity of nominees, and shall give \n     particular attention to the following matters:\n       (1) A review of the biographical information provided by \n     the nominee, including, but not limited to, any professional \n     activities related to the duties of the office to which he or \n     she is nominated;\n       (2) A review of the financial information provided by the \n     nominee, including tax returns for the three years preceding \n     the time of his or her nomination;\n       (3) A review of any actions, taken or proposed by the \n     nominee, to remedy conflicts of interest; and\n       (4) A review of any personal or legal matter which may bear \n     upon the nominee's qualifications for the office to which he \n     or she is nominated.\n       For the purpose of assisting the Committee in the conduct \n     of this inquiry, a majority investigator or investigators \n     shall be designated by the chairman and a minority \n     investigator or investigators shall be designated by the \n     ranking minority member. The chairman, ranking minority \n     member, other members of the Committee and designated \n     investigators shall have access to all investigative reports \n     on nominees prepared by any Federal agency, except that only \n     the chairman, the ranking minority member, or other members \n     of the Committee, upon request, shall have access to the \n     report of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Committee \n     may request the assistance of the General Accounting Office \n     and any other such expert opinion as may be necessary in \n     conducting its review of information provided by nominees.\n       D. Report on the Nominee. After a review of all information \n     pertinent to the nomination, a confidential report on the \n     nominee shall be made by the designated investigators to the \n     chairman and the ranking minority member and, upon request, \n     to any other member of the Committee. The report shall \n     summarize the steps taken by the Committee during its \n     investigation of the nominee and identify any unresolved or \n     questionable matters that have been raised during the course \n     of the inquiry.\n       E. Hearings. The Committee shall conduct a public hearing \n     during which the nominee shall be called to testify under \n     oath on all matters relating to his or her suitability for \n     office, including the policies and programs which he or she \n     will pursue while in that position.

Mr. President, on February 5, I introduced the Bear \nProtection Act, S. 263. This measure is aimed at controlling poaching \nof bears such as the American black bear which is found in Kentucky. It \naddresses several enforcement and jurisdictional loopholes that are \ncaused by a patchwork of State laws. The current inconsistencies enable \na wildly profitable underground black market for bear parts to flourish \nin the United States.\n  Mr. President, my bill would in no way affect legal hunting of bears. \nHunters would still be allowed to keep trophies and furs of bears \nkilled during legal hunts. This measure would only prohibit the sale or \nbarter of the internal organs of the bear which are referred to as bear \nviscera.\n  This bill is made necessary because of the booming illegal trade in \nbear viscera. At least 18 Asian countries are known to participate in \nthe illegal trade in bear parts. Bear viscera are also illegally sold \nand traded in large urban areas in the United States such as San \nFrancisco, Seattle, Portland, and New York City. These cities serve as \nprimary ports for export shipments of these goods.\n  Bear parts, such as gall bladders, are used in traditional Asian \nmedicine to treat everything from diabetes to heart disease. Due to the \nincreasing demand for bear viscera, the population of Asian black bears \nhas been totally annihilated over the last few years. This has led \npoachers to turn to American bears to fill the increasing demand. I, \nfor one, will not stand by and allow our own bear populations to be \ndecimated by poachers.\n  Mr. President, it is estimated that Kentucky has only 50 to 100 black \nbears remaining in the wild. Black bears once roamed free across the \nAppalachian Mountains, through the rolling hills of the bluegrass, all \nthe way to the Mississippi River. Although we cannot restore the \nnumbers we once had, we can ensure that the remaining bears are not \nsold for profit to the highest bidder.\n  Poaching has become an astoundingly profitable enterprise. It is \nestimated that over 40,000 bears are poached in the United States every \nyear. That equals the number that are taken by legal hunting.\n  Mr. President, the main reason behind these astounding numbers is \ngreed. In South Korea, bear gall bladders are worth their weight in \ngold, and an average bear gall bladder can bring as high as $10,000 on \nthe black market.\n  Currently, U.S. law enforcement officials have little power to \naddress the poaching of bears and the sale of their parts in an \neffective manner. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has \nneither the manpower nor the budget to test all bear parts sold legally \nin the United States. Without extensive testing, law enforcement \nofficials cannot determine if gall bladders or other parts have come \nfrom threatened or endangered species. This problem perpetuates the \npoaching of endangered or threatened bears.\n  The Lacey Act currently regulates the interstate commerce of wildlife \npossessed or transported in violation of State law. Inconsistencies in \nState law, however, make convictions under this statute difficult. \nUnder the current legal situation, it is impossible to determine \nwhether a gall bladder being sold in Idaho comes from a legally taken \nlocal bear or an endangered Louisiana black bear without expensive \ntesting. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Special Agent Corky Roberts illustrates \nthis point in a recent Humane Society publication,\n\n       If somebody kills a bear in the state of Washington all \n     they have to do is get it to Idaho. Technically * * *, it's \n     against the law but all it does is make it more difficult to \n     prove that the bear was taken in Washington and traded \n     illegally in interstate commerce. That's where the Lacey Act \n     has problems.\n\n  The Bear Protection Act will establish national guidelines for trade \nin bear parts, but it will not weaken any existing State laws that have \nbeen instituted to deal with this issue. My bill will also instruct the \nSecretary of the Interior and the U.S. Trade Representative to \nestablish a dialog with the appropriate countries to coordinate efforts \naimed at curtailing the international bear trade.\n  Mr. President, this measure is crafted narrowly enough to deal with \nthe poaching of the American black bear for profit, while still \nensuring the rights of American sportsmen. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in support of this much-needed legislation. Mr. President, I ask \nthat the full text of the bill be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The text of the bill follows:\n\n                                 S. 263\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bear Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there are 8 extant species of bear: Asian black bear, \n     brown bear, polar bear, American black bear, spectacled bear, \n     giant panda, sun bear, and sloth bear;\n       (2) the Asian black bear populations have been decimated in \n     recent years by illegal trade to supply the growing demand \n     for medicines and cosmetics containing valuable bear viscera;\n       (3) without immediate action to end United States \n     involvement in the lucrative black market trade in bear \n     viscera, American bear populations may suffer the same \n     devastating losses as Asian bear populations;\n       (4) increasingly, undercover operations have discovered \n     that poachers are establishing extensive smuggling networks \n     to illegally commercialize American bears;\n       (5) because it is practically impossible to distinguish the \n     viscera of CITES Appendix I bears from the viscera of other \n     bear species, there is an urgent need to eliminate the trade \n     in the viscera of all bear species;\n       (6) as a party to CITES, a world leader in wildlife \n     conservation, and a larger market for and supplier of bear \n     viscera and products, the United States shares responsibility \n     for supporting and implementing measures to stop the illegal \n     trade in CITES Appendix I Asian black bears and CITES \n     Appendix II American black bears;\n       (7) inconsistency in State prohibition of commercialization \n     of bear gall and inadequate Federal regulation of such \n     commercialization make law enforcement difficult; and\n       (8) individual States, which have the right to set, \n     maintain, and enforce quotas for the legal hunting of black \n     bears, will be assisted in their management efforts by the \n     enactment of a Federal law banning the import of, export of, \n     and interstate commerce in bear viscera.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to ensure the long-term \n     viability of the world's 8 bear species and specifically to \n     perpetuate healthy populations of American bears.\n\n[[Page S1200]]\n\n     SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States that effective long-\n     term conservation of the world's bear species, including \n     North American bears, depends in part on the prohibition of \n     the lucrative trade in bear viscera.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, on January 31 Proctor Jones spent \nhis last day of service in the UU.S. Senate. I join many of my \ncolleagues in thanking him publicly for his work.\n  Proctor Jones has been an incredible asset to the Senate and to me. \nWhen I became a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and \nWater Development in January, 1992, Proctor became my and my staff's \nmentor on the workings of this important subcommittee. He led us \nthrough the complex and confusing maze of numbers, agencies, and \nappropriations politics. Proctor was invaluable.\n  My State of Washington is a major beneficiary of public investments \ncoordinated under the jurisdiction of the Energy and Water Development \nSubcommittee, such as the Hanford Reservation, the Bonneville Power \nAdministration, and numerous ports and waterways. These entities and \nprojects are sometimes controversial, often complex, and usually \nexpensive. Proctor knew what could be accomplished and what was doomed \nto failure. He had an answer to every question.\n  Of course, that ability to divine the realm of the possible was both \na source of joy and frustration. When the answer to a request was \n``yes,'' I knew my request was a done deal and I could count on the \nfunding or report language. When the answer was ``no,'' convincing \nProctor about the error of his views was, shall we say, a daunting \ntask. But he never let me down. If something could not be done the way \nI had originally envisioned it, he would explain why it would not, and \nsuggest alternative ways to arrive at a similar outcome.\n  Mr. President, I wish Proctor the best as he starts a new career as a \npartner with his former boss and one of the most effective Senators I \nhave had the pleasure to serve with, former Senator J. Bennett \nJohnston. I will sorely miss Proctor's guidance and expertise, but know \nhe is ready for a change and new challenges.\n  Congratulations, Proctor, on your more than three decades of service \nto the greatest deliberative body on Earth. And thank you for your \nguidance to first term Senators like me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/10/senate-section/article/S1200-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONGRESSIONAL PENSION DISCLOSURE ACT\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I join as a cosponsor of the \nCongressional Pension Disclosure Act of 1997. I commend Senator Abraham \nfor his leadership in drafting this important legislation.\n  This bill will require that detailed information about the pension of \nevery Member of Congress be published twice a year as a part of a \nreport on Congress that already is required by law. Under our proposal, \neach report would show how much a Member has contributed to his \npension, how much he would receive if he retired, and any other \ninformation needed to enable the public to compute the Federal \nretirement benefits of each Member of Congress.\n  I strongly support this step because the people have a right to know \nfully and completely how their Congress works and how the congressional \npension system works. There should be nothing hidden here. Nothing \nshould be difficult for the people to determine. No calculations of \ncongressional pensions or other benefits should be murky or confusing.\n  This bill will shine some sunlight on the congressional pension \nsystem. It will be another step toward restoring the confidence and \ntrust of the American people in our National Legislature and in our \nsystem of self-government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/10/senate-section/article/S1200-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO GABRIEL LEWIS GALINDO\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a true \nPanamanian statesman, a renowned diplomat, and a good friend of the \nUnited States--Gabriel Lewis Galindo.\n  Gabriel Lewis was considered his nation's leading expert on foreign \naffairs. And, over the past 20 years he was an influential figure in \nnearly all the major issues that dominated United States-Panamanian \nrelations.\n  As Panama's Ambassador to the United States in the late 1970's, he \nplayed an integral role in helping to negotiate the Panama Canal \ntreaties, which will transfer control of the waterway to Panama in the \nyear 2000. In the end, Gabriel Lewis's abundant personal charm and \ncharisma were a guiding force behind not only the resolution of those \nnegotiations, but Senate approval of the treaties.\n  Gabriel Lewis was also a persistent and powerful voice for democracy \nin Panama. He became an outspoken and forceful opponent of the regime \nof Gen. Manuel Noriega seeking exile in the United States after being \ncharged with treason in his native country.\n  Here in the United States, he continued his tireless struggles on \nbehalf of Panamanian democracy, mobilizing support against the Noriega \nregime and leading efforts to increase United States economic pressure \non Panama.\n  After the overthrow of Noriega, Gabriel Lewis continued his \ncommitment to public service and the Panamanian people by becoming \nPanama's Foreign Minister in 1994. Almost immediately, he was working \nto improve United States-Panamanian relations. Soon after taking \noffice, he recommended that the newly elected President of Panama, \nErnesto Balladares, take in up to 10,000 Cuban refugees helping to \ndefuse a growing crisis in the Caribbean.\n  Often in this body we honor great Americans who are a tribute to \ntheir community and their Nation. But we must also take the time to pay \nhomage to those, who from abroad, are the embodiment of the values and \nprecepts we hold dear as Americans. Gabriel Lewis Galindo was just such \na man and he will be sorely missed both in his native Panama and by \nthose who knew and respected him here in the United States.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Nita, his 6 children, and \nhis 21 grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/10/senate-section/article/S1200-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1200-S1201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ESTATE TAX REFORM\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, earlier this year, I joined \nSenator Kyl and others in introducing legislation which\n\n[[Page S1201]]\n\nwould eliminate the Federal estate tax. In terms of helping families, \nencouraging economic growth, and simple tax fairness, eliminating the \nestate tax is one of the most meaningful steps Congress can take, and I \nintend to work with Members from both parties to move this legislation \nthrough Congress and on to the President's desk.\n  Mr. President, the estate tax was first instituted in 1916 as a means \nof raising revenue and redistributing wealth. It has largely failed on \nboth accounts. On the other hand, it has had a severe and adverse \nimpact upon millions of families, it has destroyed innumerable family \nowned businesses, and it has created perverse incentives that encourage \nparents to spend their savings now, rather than pass them on to their \nchildren later. As the National Commission on Economic Growth noted in \nits report:\n\n       It makes little sense and is patently unfair to impose \n     extra taxes on people who choose to pass their assets on to \n     their children and grandchildren instead of spending them \n     lavishly on themselves. Families faced with these \n     confiscatory taxes often find themselves forced to sell off \n     farms or businesses, destroying jobs in the process.\n\n  I believe the Kemp Commission was exactly right. The estate tax is \nsimply devastating to entrepreneurs and farmers. By forcing the sale of \nmany businesses, the tax causes untold hardship and turmoil in families \nalready dealing with the loss of a loved one. It has been estimated \nthat 70 percent of all businesses never make it past the first \ngeneration, while 90 percent do not make it past the second generation. \nI believe the estate tax is responsible for much of this failure.\n  Worse, this destruction of businesses and loss of jobs cannot be \njustified for budget reasons. The estate tax raises little money for \nthe Federal Government. Historically, the estate tax raises less than 2 \npercent of total Federal revenues. According to many observers, this \namount is less than the cost the estate tax imposes to both government \nand the economy.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, let me say that the estate tax is \nsimply unfair. It tells every American that no matter how hard you work \nor how wisely you manage your affairs, in the end the Federal \nGovernment is going to step in and take it away. The estate tax is \ndouble and, in some cases triple taxation, it punishes hard work and \nwealth creation, and it fails to raise the kind of revenue that could \npossibly justify the damage it causes. It has been destroying \nbusinesses and ruining lives for four generations now, and it is my \nhope we can act in this Congress so it will not afflict yet another \ngeneration of Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/10/senate-section/article/S1200-4", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                APPOINTMENT BY THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
