Mr. President, I am pleased to speak about S. 930, the \nCollege Affordability and Access Act of 1997, which I introduced \nyesterday.\n  More than 30 years ago, Congress took the historic step of \nauthorizing Federal student aid programs for the purpose of ``making \navailable the benefits of postsecondary education to eligible \nstudents.'' Since that time, millions of young Americans have been \nafforded an opportunity often denied their parents--a college \neducation.\n  During the three decades since the passage of the Higher Education \nAct of 1965, both the cost and the importance of postsecondary \neducation have grown dramatically. And, unfortunately, many once again \nfind themselves without the financial resources needed to unlock the \ndoor to a better future.\n  There was a time in Maine when a person armed with a high school \ndiploma and a willingness to work hard could expect to get a job in a \npaper mill and be assured of a very good wage for life. Today, however, \nthe situation is very different. The manager of one mill told me that \nit has been 10 years since they hired a high school graduate. \nSimilarly, if you visit the recently built recycling mill in East \nMillinocket, ME, you are likely to see a handful of computer operators \nusing specialized training to run highly technical equipment.\n  At a time when 85 percent of the new jobs require some postsecondary \nschooling, the challenge for the children of less affluent families is \nto obtain higher education, and the challenge for us is to make that a \npossibility.\n  We cannot and should not guarantee our young people success, but we \ncan and should strive to guarantee them opportunity. We have a good \nrecord on which to build, as the student aid programs of the Higher \nEducation Act have assisted countless young Americans. Those programs \ndo not, however, do enough to assist middle-class families in coping \nwith the ever-escalating cost of higher education. And they certainly \ndo not do enough to help those for whom the cost of college is a \ncrushing debt load.\n  Mr. President, much of the impetus for this bill comes from my \nexperience working at Husson College, a small college in Bangor, ME, as \nwell as from the education hearings that Senator Jeffords and I held in \nthat city. Husson's students primarily come from lower- and middle-\nincome families; in most cases, they are the first members of their \nfamily to attend college. That\n\n[[Page S5952]]\n\nmakes Husson the perfect laboratory from which to assess the strengths \nand weaknesses of our current student aid programs.\n  From my Husson experience, I came to appreciate the critical role \nof Pell Grants and student loan programs in opening the doors to \ncollege for many students. But I also learned that our current programs \ndo far too little for the many middle-class families who must largely \nbear the financial burden of opening those doors for their children. We \nalso do not do enough for those for whom the road to college ends not \nwith a pot of gold but with a pile of debt. Indeed, even at a school \nwith moderate tuition, like Husson, a student participating in the Pell \nGrant and Federal Work Study Programs can expect to graduate not only \nwith a degree but also with a debt of more than $15,000. And if this \nstudent goes on to graduate or professional school, the indebtedness \ncould easily exceed $100,000.\n\n  Missy Chasse, a student who worked for me at Husson, typifies this \nproblem. After graduating with an $18,000 debt, she decided to return \nto her home town of Ashland in rural Maine where the prospect of a job \npaying more than $20,000 is remote. Missy is now faced with a daunting \ndebt that will strain her finances for years to come. Many people, \nconfronted with this prospect, simply drop out of college or decide not \nto go at all.\n  The dilemma facing middle-class American families who have to rely on \nborrowing to educate their children was captured in a letter I recently \nreceived from Maine parents. They wrote:\n\n       We both work and are caught in the middle--too much income \n     for aid and not enough to support college tuition. Our \n     daughter has almost completed her second year of college with \n     two more to go. She has loans, we have loans, and it is \n     becoming increasingly harder to keep our heads above water. \n     We have another daughter entering college in three years and \n     we wonder how we will be able to swing it.\n\n  That the experience of this family is widespread is borne out by the \nstatistics. According to the Finance Authority of Maine, the average \nsize of the education loans it guarantees has more than quadrupled \nduring the past 10 years. The prospect of being saddled with a \nterrifying debt explains why many Maine families decide that the cost \nof college is simply too great for them. Indeed, Maine ranks a dismal \n49th out of the 50 States in the percentage of our young people who \ndecide to go on to higher education.\n  Mr. President, this is the season when Members of this body hit the \ncommencement trail, summoning up their most stirring rhetoric to \ninspire college graduates to dedicate themselves to serving others. The \nirony is that the audience is far more likely to see its future not as \none of serving its neighbors, but rather as one of servicing its debt.\n  My bill recognizes that we have a solid foundation of financial \nassistance programs. It seeks to build on that foundation by making \nneeded changes that will provide some measure of debt relief, promote \nprivate savings, and encourage employer sponsorship of education.\n\n  Specifically, the College Affordability and Access Act of 1997 has \nthree components. The first will make the interest on student loans tax \ndeductible. The second will authorize the establishment of tax-exempt \neducation savings accounts. And the third will make permanent the tax \nexemption for employer-paid tuition for undergraduate programs and \nextend it to graduate and professional programs.\n  The first component, a small step for Government that will be a big \nhelp to students, allows a tax deduction of up to $2,750 in interest \nthat individuals pay on their student loans. It will alleviate some of \nthe financial pain experienced by the recent graduate with the $18,000 \ndebt and the $20,000 salary. While the deduction will be phased out as \nthe graduate's income increases, the vast majority of those with \nstudent loans will qualify for all or part of the benefit. Through this \nchange, we will be recognizing that a loan to go to college is not the \nsame as a loan to buy a stereo, but rather an investment in human \ncapital that will pay dividends not only to the borrower but also to \nour Nation.\n  The second component will allow parents to place $1,000 per year into \na tax-exempt savings account for the education of a child. Money \nwithdrawn from the account to pay qualified education expenses will not \nbe taxed. Assuming the family puts $1,000 into the account every year \nfor 18 years and the account earns a modest rate of return, the family \ncan expect to accumulate about $35,000, which will put a big dent in \ntheir education expenses.\n  Our education policies must stop penalizing savings. Under current \nlaw, families which make financial sacrifices to save for their \nchildren's education may face the paradoxical result that they do not \nqualify for aid programs available to their less prudent neighbors. \nWhile this bill will not eliminate that possibility, it will send the \nclear message that our Government is prepared to encourage and reward \nthose who save for college.\n  The third component seeks to make greater use of the willingness of \nbusinesses to further the education of their employees. It will \naccomplish that in two ways. First, it will make permanent the current \ntax exemption for employer-paid tuition for undergraduate studies. \nSecond, it will extend this exemption to those attending graduate and \nprofessional programs.\n  Mr. President, this bill will benefit families facing the challenge \nof paying for college; it will benefit students currently pursuing \ntheir education; and it will benefit graduates struggling to pay their \ndebts. But the benefits will be far more widespread and significant. In \nits own small way, the College Affordability and Access Act will give \nus a better educated population, a more competitive economy, and a \nsociety in which the rewards are more equally shared. Most important, \nit will reaffirm our commitment to the principle that success in \nAmerica should be there for all who are willing to work for it.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to tell you this bill has attracted \nwidespread support. I ask unanimous consent that the text of a letter I \nreceived from the American Council on Education endorsing S. 930 on its \nown behalf and on behalf of 12 other educational organizations be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    American Council on Education,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1997.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I write on behalf of the higher \n     education associations listed below to commend you for \n     introducing ``The College Access and Affordability Act.''\n       Your bill will help millions of families save money for \n     college, encourage working adults to take advantage of \n     employer-provided educational assistance to upgrade their \n     skills, and help recent college graduates repay student \n     loans. These provisions will be of enormous assistance to \n     middle income families.\n       Your proposal to restore the federal income tax exemption \n     for interest payments on student loans is especially welcome. \n     In the last decade, a growing number of students have begun \n     to rely on federal loans to finance their education. While \n     the terms of federal student loans are generous compared to \n     other loans, many borrowers find that the repayment of these \n     debts restricts their personal and professional opportunities \n     after graduation. By restoring the income tax deduction for \n     student loan interest, your bill will help moderate the \n     impact of loan repayments and provide enormous assistance to \n     student borrowers. Moreover, by establishing a 2,750 annual \n     limit on the amount of interest that may be deducted, your \n     proposal will be especially helpful to graduate and \n     professional students--a category of borrowers who generally \n     incur much higher debts while in school.\n       As you know, there is widespread bipartisan interest in \n     using the tax code to help families meet college costs and we \n     are deeply grateful for your leadership in this area. My \n     colleagues and I look forward to working with you and other \n     members of the Senate as you consider this vitally important \n     legislation in the months ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Stanley O. Ikenberry,\n                                                        President.\n\n       On behalf of the following:\n       American Council on Education.\n       American Association of Community Colleges.\n       American Association of State Colleges and Universities.\n       American Psychological Association.\n       Association of American Universities.\n       Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities.\n       Association of Governing Boards of Universities and \n     Colleges.\n       Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities.\n       Coalition of Higher Education Assistance Organizations.\n\n[[Page S5953]]\n\n       Council of Graduate Schools.\n       Council of Independent Colleges.\n       National Association of Student Financial Aid \n     Administrators.\n       National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant \n     Colleges.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, this weekend the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee is going to hold a field hearing in \nMattawa, WA. We will discuss S. 200, my legislation to designate the \nHanford Reach of the Columbia River as a wild and scenic river.\n  The Hanford Reach is the last free-flowing stretch of this mighty \nriver. Protecting it for future generations is a top priority for me.\n  In 1995, I convened a group of local citizens, and I asked them to \nhelp me find the best way to protect this portion of the Columbia \nRiver. They unanimously concluded an act of Congress designating the \nreach as a wild and scenic river, with a recreational classification, \nwould be the best way to preserve this valuable resource.\n  In fact, a poll of registered voters in central Washington done last \nyear indicated that 76 percent favored designation of the Hanford Reach \nas a wild and scenic river, while only 11 percent opposed it. So the \nwill of the region is clear: The reach needs the best protection we can \ngive it to make sure it remains accessible to everyone.\n  Protecting the Hanford Reach is not about local versus Federal \ncontrol. It is about giving a natural treasure the best possible \nprotection that we can. And it is also about promoting jobs in the long \nterm and protecting our heritage.\n  What does the designation do? First, it puts central Washington on \nthe map as a home to a resource found nowhere else on Earth--a river \nunique and important enough to become part of the U.S. national wild \nand scenic river system. Second, it protects the river in its current \ncondition. It allows all of the existing uses to continue, but ensures \nthe river stays forever the way we see it today. In fact, my bill \nspecifically grandfathers in current uses protecting existing economic \ninterests and enhancing the river's future economic value to our \nregion.\n  There is much more at stake here than who manages the river. This \nissue is much bigger than that. We all know what problem we have with \nprotecting salmon. ESA listings have been made for the Snake River and \nare being considered for the Columbia. If we ever want to get ahead of \nthe salmon problem, we have to start by protecting the reach. My bill \ngives us a cheap and easy way to do just that. It simply transfers \nFederal property from one agency to another; no private lands need to \nbe acquired or jeopardized.\n  Let me reiterate, we simply can't afford to take chances with the one \npart of the river that works well--and inexpensively--for fish. \nCompared to drawdowns, dam removal and other suggestions that we have \nheard for saving salmon, permanent protection of the reach gives \nratepayers, river users and irrigators a virtually cost-free way of \naccomplishing what could be a very expensive recovery effort.\n  We have done a lot of talking about the reach, and I am convinced \nthat we are getting closer. It seems to me when you have a resource \nthat is this important to the State, reasonable people ought to be able \nto find a way to agree on the best way to protect it. I am committed to \nbringing people together around that goal and keeping them together \nuntil we finish the job.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to hearing the testimony this weekend, \nand I thank my senior colleague, Senator Gorton, for helping me put \nthis hearing together.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are in the \nmorning business hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S5953-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5953-S5954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TREND TOWARD RACIAL, ETHNIC, AND RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a disturbing \ntrend in this country, a trend that to me was highlighted by a recent \nincident in South Carolina.\n  This incident took place several weeks ago. I was aware of it at the \ntime it occurred. It has been something that has been troubling to me \nsince then, and I felt it was appropriate and important that we spread \non the Record of this Senate this particular incident, which occurred \nwhile the State Board of Education of the State of South Carolina was \ndiscussing whether it could display the Ten Commandments on the walls \nof public schools.\n  During this discussion, a member of this board provided a suggestion \nfor groups which might oppose the placing of the Ten Commandments upon \nschool walls. A direct quote: ``Screw the Buddhists and kill the \nMuslims.''\n\n  Mr. President, I find it contemptible that such an arcane, bigoted \nstatement would come from someone who is tasked with the responsibility \nof educating our children, a member of the board of education.\n  I find it even more shocking that not only would someone think this, \nbut that they would go so far as to articulate it at a meeting of a \nboard of education. Can we imagine what would have been the reaction to \nsuch a comment had it been directed toward Christians or Jews, Mexican-\nAmericans, African-Americans? I find this individual's behavior \nreprehensible, and while I find his behavior reprehensible, the larger \nissue is an increasing trend in this country toward racial, religious, \nand ethnic intolerance.\n  The Founders of this country fled persecution and intolerance in \nEurope and came to this country to be free from persecution, mostly \nreligious persecution. Our country was founded on the principle of \nequality, and our Constitution, Mr. President--this document--which \nconsists of just a few pages ensures freedom of religion and freedom \nfrom persecution.\n  In this country, we are very fortunate to have the freedoms that we \nhave guaranteed by our Constitution. These freedoms make us the envy of \nthe world and are the strength of our Nation.\n  I, however, think that, even though we have many protected rights in \nour Constitution, we have to speak out against individuals and \nespecially people who are on a board of education who say, ``Screw the \nBuddhists and kill the Muslims.''\n  Because of the liberties we have in our country, this great country \nof the United States of America, immigrants from all over the world \ndesire to come here and start a new life, just as our ancestors did. As \na result, we are becoming a much more diverse Nation, increasingly \ndiverse. The diversity within our Nation requires greater tolerance, \npatience, and a deeper level of understanding.\n  Mr. President, I am a member of a religion where, in the last \ncentury, significant persecution took place. People were killed as a \nresult of their belief in the religion that I now profess. I feel that \nwe all must speak out against religious intolerance. People who speak \nout about screwing the Buddhists and killing the Muslims--you know, Mr. \nPresident, in our country, sad as it might be, there are people who \nwould follow the leadership of a person like this and proceed to do \njust that.\n  The remarks made by this school board member reflect a deep-seated \nracial and religious intolerance and ignorance that we should not allow \nto go unnoticed. This racial ignorance and lack of understanding are \ncatalysts to intense racial intolerance.\n  I am concerned about the steady erosion of racial and religious \ntolerance in our society, and intolerance. Intolerance is often the \nbasis for much of the crime committed in America, and it is the very \nessence of hate crimes. Hate crimes are those crimes committed against \nan individual or a group because of their convictions or their \nethnicity.\n\n[[Page S5954]]\n\n  In 1995, the last records we have, the Justice Department cataloged \nnearly 8,000 hate crimes. Those are the only ones reported; many were \nunreported. This number is growing at an alarming rate. Hate crime is \nan affront to our basic commitment to religious liberty and racial \ntolerance, and it poses a challenge to our entire Nation and our future \nas a common community.\n  The remarks made by this school board member are disturbing. They are \nindicative of an increasing racial and religious intolerance and serve \nonly to incite maliciousness against Muslims, Buddhists, and non-\nChristians in general. This school board member's comments are \nillustrative of the need in this country for increased understanding \nand patience. It is also, Mr. President, I believe, a call for us to \nspeak out against this intolerance. It is this understanding and \npatience that we need to have which provides the foundation for a more \ntolerant America. Tolerance and understanding are crucial for us to \ncontinue fostering quality, dignity, and peace within America.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today as chairman of \nthe Senate Subcommittee on East Asia and Pacific Affairs to discuss and \nformally state my support for the extension this year of most-favored-\nnation status to the People's Republic of China. I want to stress at \nthe beginning that supporting China MFN is not an issue of approving or \ndisapproving China's behavior. Rather, it is an issue of how we best \nwork to influence that behavior in the future. For several reasons, I \ndo not believe that withholding MFN is an effective tool in doing that.\n  First, I firmly believe that invoking most-favored-nation status \nwould hurt the United States more than the Chinese. It would be the \neconomic equivalent of saying, ``Lift up a rock and drop it on your own \nfoot.''\n  Simply put, we are talking about American jobs. It is estimated that \nUnited States exports to China support around 200,000 American \njobs; the Chinese purchases now account for 42 percent of our \nfertilizer exports and over 10 percent of our grain exports as well.\n\n  Last year, China bought over $1 billion worth of civilian aircraft, \n$700 million in telecommunications equipment, $340 million in \nspecialized machinery, and $270 million of heating and cooling \nequipment.\n  As China's economy continues its dynamic growth, the potential market \nfor increased sales, of course, will grow as well. Our withdrawal of \nMFN would certainly be met with in-kind retaliation by the Chinese, who \nare fully capable of shopping elsewhere for their imports, as we have \nseen with Boeing and Airbus, with resulting harm to America's economy.\n  Second, revoking MFN would have a damaging effect on the economies of \nour close allies and trading partners Hong Kong and Taiwan. The vast \nmajority of Chinese trade passes through Hong Kong. Putting the brakes \non that trade would result in a 32 to 45 percent reduction--around $12 \nbillion worth--of Hong Kong's reexports from the PRC to the United \nStates.\n  In addition, it is estimated that there would be about a $4.4 billion \ndrop in income to Hong Kong, a loss of 86,000 jobs, and a 2.8 reduction \nin GDP.\n  Moreover, revoking MFN would have the greatest negative impact on the \nsouthern China provinces where Hong Kong and Taiwanese businesses have \nmade substantial investments, as well as the United States. But I want \nto stress this point. It is in these provinces that the political and \nsocial changes for the better are occurring.\n  Mr. President, on my last trip to China--my only trip to China--I \ntraveled from Beijing in the north through Shanghai and on to Guangzhou \nin the south. In Beijing, talks with the Chinese centered solely on \npolitics, Taiwan particularly. The vast majority of the population \nstill ride bicycles. The availability of western goods, while \nincreasing, is limited. The role of the party in the people's daily \nlives is still significant.\n  But as we traveled further south, I was struck by the change in \nattitudes and interests. People were much less concerned about politics \nand ideology and much more concerned about continuing trade, their \nstandard of living, as well as budding democratic freedoms. Western \nconsumer goods are widely available, the minority of people ride bikes, \nand most instead drive cars and motorcycles. The party apparatus is \nmuch less ideologically communistic and more bureaucratic.\n  In my view, there is one cause for these changes, changes in the \neveryday lives of the average Chinese citizens--commercial contacts \nwith the West, especially the United States.\n  Mr. President, by opening up their economy to market reforms and \neconomic contacts with the rest of the world, the Chinese authorities \nhave let the genie out of the bottle. If we revoke MFN, in effect \ncutting off trade with China, we only serve to retard this opening-up \nprocess, a process that we should be doing in every way to advance and \nencourage the advancement there.\n  Third, revoking China's MFN status would place it among a small \nhandful of countries to which we do not extend this normal trading \nstatus. Most favored nation is a bit of a misnomer. It is actually \nnormal relations. But we exclude that normal relationship with Cuba, \nLaos, North Korea, Serbia, and Afghanistan. We would be relegating \nChina to this grouping, and I believe it would do irreparable harm to \nour bilateral relationship and to the security and stability of East \nAsia as a whole.\n  China is very attuned to the concept of face. Placing it on the same \nlevel as the world's most outcast nations, while perhaps not \nundeserving in some fields, would needlessly provoke a backlash from \nthe Chinese which would frost over whatever strides we have made in the \npast.\n  Now, I want to make it clear that I in no way condone the policies of \nthe Chinese nor the actions. I am by no means an apologist for the PRC \nnor a proponent of foreign policy solely for the sake of business \ninterests. No one can argue that China's actions in many fields do not \ndeserve some serious response from us. The PRC has, at best, a sad, sad \nhuman rights record. It imprisons prodemocracy dissidents. It has done \nso in such numbers since the Tiananmen Square incident that there are \nno active dissidents. It prosecutes religious minorities, including \nChristians, focusing most harshly on the Buddhists in Tibet where it \nhas closed monasteries and jailed monks and nuns. And it persecutes \nethnic minorities, concentrating their attention recently on the \nTibetans.\n  The PRC consistently fails to live up to the terms of its trade \nagreements with us, especially in the areas of trade barriers and \nintellectual property rights. It has taken two separate agreements and \nseveral years to get intellectual property rights moving in the proper \ndirection, but they are still not doing what they are supposed to do.\n  It has made several decisions which call into question its \ncommitments to preserving democracy in Hong Kong, including the most \nrecent round involving the so-called Provisional Legislature. It \nignores its commitments to some international agreements.\n\n  So all in all, it is not a good situation. The question of course is, \nhow do we best deal with that?\n  Mr. President, I am the first to insist that we need to address these \nserious issues, but it is clear that our current China policy, which \nthe administration characterizes as constructive engagement but has \nrecently retooled as multifaceted is not up to the task. The Chinese \nwill continue to walk over us as long as their actions meet with little \nor no credible repercussions.\n  But while we need to make some response, it is equally clear to me \nthat most favored nation is not going to solve any of these problems. \nAs I have mentioned, its revocation would only cause more problems than \nit solves. Moreover, threatening MFN withdrawal has come to be hollow \nand meaningless. We know it and the Chinese know it.\n  It is like watching a movie you have seen several times before; you \nknow the plot, you know the actors, you\n\n[[Page S5955]]\n\nknow their roles and the dialogue, and indeed you know the outcome all \nbefore the movie even starts. With each cry of wolf we make by \nthreatening to withdraw most-favored-nation status and then do not, the \ncredibility of an already tenuous threat declines.\n  Yet, without a responsible alternative, Members of Congress are \nforced to face the Hobson's choice between voting to revoke MFN or \ndoing nothing. Many, with no constructive way to vent their policy \nfrustrations, choose revocation.\n  I am convinced it is time to rethink the United States-China policy \nand come up with a workable way to get China to act as a responsible \nmember of the international community and to live up both to the letter \nand the spirit of the agreements they have reached with us. In \naddition, I believe the United States has to be more prepared to say \nwhat it means and mean what it says.\n  On March 22, in my subcommittee, we held a hearing on exactly this \ntopic. It was the opinion of every panelist, save one, that we need a \nworkable alternative to most-favored-nation as a tool of American \nforeign policy. I hope that in the next year policymakers, both in the \nGovernment and outside it, can recognize that the old policy has failed \nand move on to try and formulate a new one. It will not be a quick or \nsimple process, but the sooner it begins the better off we will be and \nthe better for the health of our bilateral relationship.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me reiterate that I strongly support \nmost-favored-nation renewal. But at the same time, I equally strongly \nurge this administration to pursue a clear, more consistent and \neffective foreign policy towards China. Frankly, the latter will do \nmore toward setting our countries down the path of a strong \nrelationship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I rise in opposition to extending most-favored-nation \nstatus to China. I was deeply, deeply dismayed at the recent revelation \nthat a State Department report on religious persecution in China and \nhuman rights conditions in China, originally scheduled for release back \nin January, was postponed, originally until June, and then it was \nannounced that it would again be delayed and postponed until after the \nvote on most-favored-nation status, that vote that would take place now \nin the House next week.\n  I think it is unconscionable, when we consider the seriousness and \nthe import of this vote, for a report from the State Department that \nhas relevant and pertinent information regarding what is going on in \nChina today in regard to human rights and in regard to religious \npersecution, that that report should not be made available to the \nAmerican public and to Members of the House of Representatives and to \nthe U.S. Senate prior to our vote on MFN.\n  Yesterday, I wrote the President and Secretary of State Albright, \nasking them for an immediate release of that State Department report so \nthat Members of the House who are yet undecided on how they are going \nto vote on MFN will have that very important report at their disposal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that letter to the \nPresident printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1997.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express our grave \n     concern regarding the recent reports that suggest the U.S. \n     Department of State is deliberately delaying the release of \n     its findings on religious persecution throughout the world. \n     This report places specific focus on the persecution of \n     Christians and other religious minorities around the world, \n     and singles out china for especially tough criticism.\n       As the Congress begins to debate whether to renew Most \n     Favored Nation (MFN) trade status for China, it is vital that \n     all information critical to the debate be in the public \n     domain. It is our understanding that the report was to be \n     released January 15, 1997. However, it has been brought to \n     our attention that it will not be released until after the \n     Congress votes on MFN. Furthermore, State Department \n     officials have said that the report is being held up to \n     broaden its findings.\n       The oppression and persecution of religious minorities \n     around the world, specifically in China, have emerged as one \n     of the most compelling human rights issues of the day. In \n     particular, the world-wide persecution of Christians persists \n     at alarming levels. This is an affront to the morality of the \n     international community and to all people of conscience.\n       The 1996 Department of State's Human Rights report on China \n     revealed that the Chinese authorities had effectively stepped \n     up efforts to suppress expressions of criticism and protest. \n     The report also states that all public dissent was \n     effectively silenced by exile, imposition of prison terms, \n     and intimidation.\n       As the original co-sponsors of the resolution of \n     disapproval on MFN for China, it is our view, and that of \n     many others, that serious human rights abuses persist in all \n     areas of china and that the delay of this year's report on \n     religious persecution demonstrates the Administration's \n     unwillingness to engage in an open discussion of the effect \n     of U.S. policy on human rights in China. We strongly urge \n     that the State Department report be delivered in a timely \n     manner to ensure its full disclosure and debate prior to a \n     vote on the extension of MFN to China.\n           Sincerely,\n     Tim Hutchinson,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Russell Feingold,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I think to postpone the release of that report \nindicates that the likelihood that conditions in China have improved \nover the course of the last year are remote.\n  The last State Department report, the China country report issued in \n1996, was a blistering condemnation of the Chinese Government's \nrepression of their own people and the new wave of the religious \npersecution that has spread across the country inflicted by this \ncurrent regime:\n\n       The administration continues to coddle China despite its \n     continuing crackdown on democratic reform, its brutal \n     subjugation of Tibet, its irresponsibility in nuclear missile \n     technology.\n\n  Mr. President, those are not my words. Those were the words of then \nCandidate Bill Clinton in a speech to Georgetown University in December \n1991. Then Candidate Clinton was exactly right, and those very words \nare equally applicable to the policy of appeasement that has been \npromoted by the Clinton administration.\n  President Clinton, then Candidate Clinton, went on a few months later \nin March 1992 and said:\n\n       I don't believe we should extend most favored nation status \n     to China unless they make significant progress in human \n     rights, arms proliferation and fair trade.\n\n  He was right then. He is wrong now. They have not made significant \nprogress in any of those categories, human rights, arms proliferation \nor fair trade.\n  And then in August 1992, then Candidate Clinton said:\n\n       We will link China's trading privileges to its human rights \n     records and its conduct of trade weapon sales.\n\n  Of course, we all know that that strong position taken as a candidate \nwas repudiated after he was elected President. What a difference an \nelection makes.\n  So today, Mr. President, I called for the immediate release of this \nState Department report so that an intelligent and informed decision \ncan be made by this Congress when they vote in the House and, \nhopefully, when a vote yet in the future, in the coming weeks, in the \nSenate takes place.\n  I believe that the change that occurred by this administration was \nill-advised and has led to both a failed and flawed policy toward \nChina.\n  Not long ago, in the last hour, I had a conversation with former \nSecretary of State Eagleburger, who is an advocate of most-favored-\nnation status, favors extending that trading status to China once \nagain. I said, ``Things are worse in China since we adopted this \nconstructive engagement policy.'' He said, ``In what regards?'' And I \nsaid, ``In every regard.'' Whether it is human rights, whether it is \nreligious persecution, whether it is military expansionism or the \nexport of weapons of mass destruction, you name the measure, you name \nthe standard, and conditions\n\n[[Page S5956]]\n\nand situations in China are worse today than they were when we adopted \nthis policy of so-called constructive engagement.\n  One might argue that denial of most-favored-nation status is a blunt \ninstrument and is not the best way to achieve our goals, as Senator \nThomas argued a few moments ago. One might argue that. One might argue \nthat we should look at other options, that we should seek other tools, \nother instruments to convey this message to the Chinese Government. But \nfew, I believe, can stand and say that the current policy of this \nadministration has been anything other than an abject failure.\n  Some will say that it will be worse if we deny MFN. A person can \nargue that, but you cannot prove that. What can be demonstrated in all \nthese now many years of MFN is that, rather than responding by \nexpanding trade opportunities and trade relationships with the United \nStates, rather than responding by improving the conditions of the \nChinese people, they have responded by a new wave, an unprecedented \nwave, of repression upon those who would dare to express their own \npolitical opinion or their own religious faith. The logic behind the \nadministration's policy of engagement is, No. 1, that it will improve \nconditions in China. It clearly has not. According to the State \nDepartment report, this administration's own report, it has not \nimproved conditions. They have become more deplorable.\n\n  Then the administration argues that if we link human rights \nconditions in China with trade, the result will be that China will be \nisolated and the United States companies will lose markets and trade \nopportunities. I think that is interesting. In fact, Bill Clinton, in \nNovember 1993, said, ``Well, I think, first of all, I think anybody \nshould be reluctant to isolate a country as big as China with the \npotential China has for good, not only for the 1.2 billion people of \nChina who are enjoying unprecedented and economic growth, but good in \nthe region and good throughout the world. So our reluctance to isolate \nthem is the right reluctance.''\n  So this administration argues that if we link what is going on within \nChina to our trade opportunities with this Nation, this vast nation, \nthat we will isolate them, and that American companies will lose this \nopportunity for this huge bargain.\n  Now, how do they argue that? They say that other countries, European \ncountries, for instance, will rush in and fill the vacuum that is left \nwhen we pull out. They are probably right. But there is a non sequitur, \nthere is a self-contradiction, in the argument of the administration \nthat we somehow will isolate China and at the same time the other \nnations will come in and take the trade opportunities that otherwise \nwould be afforded to our companies.\n  The fact is, and everyone knows it, that less than 2 percent of our \nworld trade goes to China. Being removed from China will in no way \nisolate this great vast nation. In fact, it is impossible for us, \ntoday, to isolate China. There will be other nations who go in, just as \nwe will find other markets for our products.\n  But what is just as certain is that denying the privilege of MFN to \nthis Nation, which is so repressive toward its own people and so \nexpansionist in their military policy, by denying MFN, we can send a \npowerful and meaningful message to the tyrants in Beijing. I know of no \nother way that we can send that powerful message, and those who favor \nthe extension of MFN, to me, have not yet offered a significant and \nmeaningful alternative.\n  Now, let me just return to my call for the administration to release \nthis report. I think it is absolutely critical that the House of \nRepresentatives have before them that report before they are asked to \ncast this very important vote next week. The coming MFN vote is not \njust a vote on trade, Mr. President. It is not just a vote on what we \nstand for as a nation, though it is very much that kind of a vote. Are \nwe going to stand for anything? Are we still going to represent the \nlast best hope for freedom-loving people in this world, or are we not?\n  But it is not just a vote on that. It is not just a vote on Chinese \nmilitary expansionism, though if we have a great national security \nthreat in the decades to come, it will be from China, and it is a vote \nas to our concern about that expansionism. It is not just a vote on \nreligious persecution in China, though that ought to concern every \nfreedom-loving American. But, Mr. President, it is also a vote on this \nadministration's China policy, a policy that is, I believe, by every \nmeasure, flawed and failed.\n  Mr. President, I believe this administration deserves a vote of no \nconfidence on their China policy. That can best be given by a no vote \non extending MFN to China.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S5955-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5956-S5959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we are going to be taking up hopefully \ntoday our DOD authorization bill, I believe at 1 o'clock. Sometimes it \nis important to look beyond the bill itself.\n  There are several provisions of this bill that were very critical \nwhich were taken out, and one of them was taken out because I think it \nis certain that the President would have vetoed it, and it has to do \nwith Bosnia and with our withdrawal from Bosnia. I think it is \nimportant that we talk about that a little bit because, while we are \ntaking up our Department of Defense reauthorization bill, I can tell \nyou right now it is not adequate. It is the very best that we could \ncome up with, with the resources we had to work with, but as chairman \nof the Readiness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I \ncan assure you that it is not adequate. We are really at a critical \ntime right now, and, quite frankly, I hang this one on the \nadministration. This has been a very nonmilitary, nondefense \nadministration. We have had a difficult time getting any attention to \nour military, for the duties that they are trained to perform.\n  I would like just for a moment to cover a couple of things and how \nthis is going to affect our DOD authorization bill for this year and \nprobably next year, too.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Readiness, we have jurisdiction \nover training, over military construction, over all readiness issues \nincluding the BRAC process. As I have traveled around to various \ninstallations, I have found that we are really in serious trouble. I \nhave never been so proud of our troops for doing what they are doing \nunder adverse conditions.\n  I was a product of the draft many years ago. I came here believing in \ncompulsory service, and I still think it is a good idea for our Nation. \nHowever, I am so impressed with the quality of troops we have in this \nall-voluntary military. However, I wonder how long they can hold on the \nway they are going right now with this ``Optempo'' rate. ``Optempo'' is \na term that is used in the military that refers to the number of \ndeployment days, the number of days that these troops are away from \ntheir wives, husbands, and families, and it has gone up now in some \nareas double the amount that is considered to be the optimum. For \nexample, we normally talk about approximately 115 days a year, and it \nis up now to well over 200 in many areas. While seemingly they are \nholding on, they are dedicated, you cannot expect it to continue \nindefinitely because our divorce rate is starting to go up right now \nand our retention rate is starting to drop right now.\n  The quality-of-life issues are really a very serious problem. I think \nboth the chairman and the ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nPersonnel--Senator Dirk Kempthorne and Senator Max Cleland--are doing a \ngreat job, but I assure you when you are talking about readiness, the \npersonnel issues and the quality-of-life issues are very, very \nsignificant.\n  Going back in time just a little bit, I can remember being here on \nthe Senate floor back in November 1995 when we found out that the \nPresident of our country, Bill Clinton, was proposing to send troops \nover to Bosnia. I got to\n\n[[Page S5957]]\n\nthinking at that time, are we going to go through this same exercise \nagain? Right now, we have more troops deployed in more parts of the \nworld than we have had at any time since World War II, and yet they are \nnot over there for any purposes that relate to our Nation's security. \nOur strategic security interests are not being served. They call them \npeacekeeping missions. They call them peacemaking missions. They call \nthem humanitarian missions.\n  Mr. President, with the scarce resources that we have right now--and, \nof course, you know because you serve on the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee--we cannot continue to do this.\n  I can remember the debate that took place on this floor in November \n1995 when the President was suggesting that we send troops over to the \nnortheastern sector of Bosnia, and I remember going over there and \nseeing what it was like and seeing what our mission would be like, and \nsupposedly we were going to go over there to make peace, to draw the \nlines out so that we would have these lines of demarcation where the \nSerbs had to be over here and the Croats had to be here and the Muslims \nhad to be here, forgetting all about the fact that there are many other \nfactions there. I do not think it is even a remote possibility we could \nthe stop the Serbs, Croats, and Muslims from fighting with each other. \nThey have been doing it for 500 years.\n  Let us assume we could. If we could, we still have the Mujaheddin, \nArkan Tigers, Black Swans--we have all these rogue elements, and the \nonly thing they have in common is they hate us. Here we are sending \ntroops, proposing at that time in 1995 to send troops over when we have \nbeen sending them other places.\n  I remember--and I am not hanging this one on President Clinton \nbecause it was President Bush who initially sent troops into Somalia, \nand he sent them over in September, before he was defeated and before \nthe new Clinton administration took over. They originally were sent \nover for 45 days. Each month--and you and I were both serving in the \nother body at that time. We passed a resolution calling for the \nwithdrawal of our troops from Somalia because they were spending our \nprecious defense dollars and they were endangering their lives. And \nmonth after month after month President Clinton said, we are going to \nleave them over there indefinitely. And it wasn't until 18 of our \nRangers were brutally murdered and their nude corpses dragged through \nthe streets of Mogadishu that finally the American people woke up and \napplied enough pressure, and we were able to bring back our troops. I \ndo not want that to happen in the streets of Sarajevo. I do not want \nthat to happen in Bosnia.\n  But if you will remember, Mr. President, it was in November when they \nwere trying to sell the idea of having the support of Congress to send \nour troops over there, we had a resolution of disapproval saying we \ncan't afford to do it. We were not without compassion. We were not \nunconcerned about the plight of those poor people over there. But that \nhas been going on for many, many years. The problem was we just could \nnot afford another mission like that, and so we had a resolution of \ndisapproval. And the President and the Secretary of Defense and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Shalikashvili, said \nthat they would be over there for only 12 months. They go over in \nDecember, come back in December of the following year.\n  That was 1996. Well, anyway, this was not just approximately 12 \nmonths. This was not simply a suggestion that maybe we can get our \nmission, whatever our mission was--I still don't know what our mission \nwas over here--maybe we can get that mission accomplished in 12 months. \nIt was an absolute promise by this administration, and I have it down \nin the words of Secretary of Defense Bill Perry that they said this is \nan absolute, there are no conditions under which our troops will be \nthere beyond 12 months. I knew it wasn't true. They lied to the \nAmerican people.\n  We missed passing a resolution of disapproval, Mr. President, by four \nvotes--four votes. I can remember several, at least four people \nstanding on the floor of the Senate saying, well, it is only for 12 \nmonths, because that was an absolute at that time. We said it was not \ngoing to be 12 months.\n  I went to Bosnia. Nobody had been over there at that time. Sure, they \nwere firing guns and all of that, and I wanted to go up to the \nnortheast sector because the northeast sector of Bosnia is where we \nwere going to send our troops, we were proposing to do it at that time. \nThat's where Tuzla is, Brcko, up in that northeastern sector. I went up \nthere. In fact, I wasn't able to get up there any other way, so I \nborrowed a British helicopter and went up to the Tuzla area and landed \nup there only to find that there were some troops up there that were \nU.N. troops, not American troops, and the commanding general of the \nnortheast sector was a guy named Haukland from Norway, a great guy.\n  So I went in there. I said, ``I hear gunfire out there.'' ``Yeah, \nit's been going on for a long time. It's still going on.'' I said, \n``Well, you know, we are proposing to send troops over here and have \nthis joint effort to cause the divisions to stop the fighting up \nhere.'' I said, ``Of course, it is only going to be 12 months.'' And he \nstarted laughing. He said, ``Twelve months. You mean 12 years.'' He \nsaid, ``It is different here than it is most other places.''\n  This is the analogy that he drew. I have mentioned it in this Chamber \nbefore, but it is so accurate today to remember. We knew this in \nNovember 1995. He said, ``It's like putting your hand in water and \nleaving it for there 12 months. Then you take it out and nothing has \nchanged. It is the same.''\n  I would suggest to you, Mr. President, that when we pull out \nultimately--and I hope we can do it safely, I hope that we can have a \nminimum of terrorist activity at that time, but we know that they are \njust in a period of rest right now and they will go right back. This is \nthe dilemma we find ourselves in. The President promised we would be \nout in 12 months. He broke his promise, and we were not out. Then he \nsaid we are not going to stay 18 months beyond the 12 months, so June \n30, 1998, would be the withdrawal date.\n  I have to say that the President has us, those of us who are \nconservatives, those of us who are for a strong national defense--and I \nhave to say in a not too charitable way that we have a lot of Members \nof this body that sincerely in their hearts are not all that concerned \nabout our Nation's defense because they don't think there is a \nsignificant threat out there. How many times have you heard from this \nadministration that the cold war is over and so there is no longer a \nthreat. And I said before, I look back wistfully at the days of the \ncold war when we had one opposition, we had two superpowers, and the \nother one was the U.S.S.R. and intelligence knew pretty much what they \nhad, what kind of resources they had; they were predictable in what \nthey were doing. They were people you could predict. Now, we are faced \nwith a world environment where we have, admittedly, and it is not even \nclassified, over 25 nations that currently, today, have weapons of mass \ndestruction, either biological, chemical or nuclear. And they are \nworking on the means to deliver them.\n\n  Just in yesterday's Washington Times there was an article about how \nnow China is working on a joint project on a missile with Iran. Is Iran \na friend? No. All these people talking about how friendly China is, yet \nwe know that both China and Russia have a missile that would deliver a \nweapon of mass destruction from any place in the world to the \ncontinental United States. That is there today. We know that. It is \nlogical, if we also know--again, it is not even classified--that both \nRussia and China are selling and have sold both systems and technology \nto countries like Iran and other countries, then why would they stop at \nthis fine line, this bright line, you might say, and say they are not \ngoing to sell them a missile that would reach the continental United \nStates? That does not do anything for my comfort level. Nonetheless, we \nare involved in a situation in Bosnia right now where the President has \nsaid we are going to extend it to June of 1999.\n  Then I keep hearing whispers from these people who do not see any \nthreat out there, ``That's all right, when that time comes, when June \ngets here, we are going to go ahead and extend it for another 6 months, \nand another 6 months.'' I can tell you right now, Mr. President, there \nare people in this Chamber and people in the White\n\n[[Page S5958]]\n\nHouse who have no intentions of any kind of withdrawal from Bosnia. So \nI serve notice, as I have many times and as have other Members, when \nthat date gets here you better be ready because we are going to be \npulling out.\n  I think it is going to be necessary to be talking about this between \nnow and through the entire next year, so they can be prepared. We do \nhave NATO allies. We do not want to be insensitive to the fact that a \nlot of our NATO allies have strategic interests in keeping troops in \nBosnia. Those people in the Balkans, those in the eastern part of \nEurope that are our allies in NATO, they certainly have reason to want \nto have peace in Bosnia because it serves their strategic interests. We \nare across an ocean. It does not serve ours. While we would like to \nhave the luxury, we are faced with a depleted, almost a decimated, \nmilitary in this country. We are in a position where we cannot meet the \nminimum expectations of the American people, which is to be able to \ndefend America on two regional fronts. We know we cannot do that. Let's \nnot kid anybody, we know we could not fight the Persian Gulf war again, \neven if we wanted to today. We do not have the resources to do that.\n  It is not just that we do not have a national missile defense system, \nit is conventional forces, too. We have approximately one half the \nforce strength that we had in 1991. I am talking about one half the \nArmy divisions, one half the Air Force wings, one half the boats that \nare floating around out there. Yet people think we are in a position to \nadequately defend ourselves.\n  So, I think we need to think of this problem that we have around the \nworld and specifically in Bosnia in terms of, No. 1, what it is doing \nto our overall defense system in terms of money and personnel. If we \nshould have to call our troops in for something in North Korea and \nsimultaneously for something perhaps in Iran or the Middle East, we \nwould be in a position of having to retrain these troops that have been \nsent to Somalia or Haiti or Bosnia or one of the other places, all \nthese missions we are sending them on, because the rules of combat are \ndifferent. There is not a general out there who would not tell you we \nwould have to retrain our troops. That would take time, that would cost \nmoney, and that directly affects our state of readiness.\n  But what else? There was another promise that was made back in \nNovember 1995, and that is we would send our troops over there and this \nwhole mission, this 12-month mission, would cost between $1.5 and $2 \nbillion. It is all in the Record. That is what they said. It was \nrepeated here on the Senate floor. ``It is not going to be that \nexpensive. It's going to be between $1.5 and $2 billion.'' At that \ntime, on the Senate floor --and it is in the Record--I said it is going \nto end up costing $8 billion before it is over. And guess what, we are \nnow going through $6.5 billion.\n  There are four elements of a defense system that we can control. We \ncannot control these missions because the White House has control over \nthese missions. But what we can control are readiness, troop force \nstrength, quality of life, and modernization. Those are the four \nelements that we can control. When we now are down to the point where \nwe have an optempo of almost double what is considered to be the \nacceptable level and we have the troops that are deployed in all these \nplaces where there are no strategic interests at risk, we are spending \nthat money over there for these missions that has to come out of the \ndefense budget.\n  The other day we had a committee meeting. We had all four chiefs of \nthe services. I asked each one of them, one at a time, I said, ``We are \ngoing to come in for an emergency supplemental. We are going to have to \nnickel and dime this thing and pay for all this fun we are having over \nin these areas and all this good we are supposedly doing. It is going \nto have to come out of defense somewhere. You have four choices: \nreadiness, troop strength, modernization, or quality of life. Where is \nit going to come from?'' Not one--finally the Marine general said, \n``I'd say quality of life, because we are tough.'' So maybe that was \nthe only answer that we got.\n\n  But there is no way we can take it out of quality of life and still \nretain people. Right now in this authorization bill, by the way, we \nhave money that is in there for flight hours, which is very critical \nbecause we are losing our trained pilots. It costs $87,000 just to go \nthrough primary training for one of these pilots. What we are doing is \ntraining them for the airlines, because we are losing them. We cannot \ncompete. We don't have to be able to pay the same money the airlines \npay, but we have to be able at least to have a respectable level of \noptempo and be competitive, so we do have some money for flight hours \nin this authorization bill. Again, to do that we have to take it from \nsomeplace else. I, as chairman of the readiness subcommittee, can tell \nyou I am not at all comfortable with our state of readiness as it is \nright now.\n  I believe we should have in the authorization bill--and I had an \namendment ready but decided, since it would be certain it would draw a \nveto, that we would handle this as a separate issue--but we need \nactually to have a resolution of withdrawal, giving our commitment to \nmake sure our NATO allies know and can prepare today for our withdrawal \non June 30, 1998.\n  I went to Brussels where they had the last NATO meeting and made a \nspeech there making it abundantly clear. I found at the same time I \nmade a statement which I feel I can make on behalf of the U.S. Senate, \nthere were other people who were walking around whispering, saying, \n``Don't worry, we will not leave you high and dry.''\n  I am very much concerned. Normally we do not address these things \nuntil it gets hysterical around here. But rather than to wait to that \npoint, I am going to say right now, a year ahead of time, that we have \nenough people in this body and the body down the hall who are going to \nstop the effort to extend beyond the June 30 deadline for our troops \nremaining in the former Yugoslavia. As I say, there are two reasons for \nit. One is our state of readiness that is suffering as a result of it. \nAnd the second thing is the risk of the people and the cost of that \nrisk. That cost, that $6.5 to $8 billion it is going to cost us, is \ngoing to have to come out of somewhere, out of our defense budget.\n  The last thing I would say that is impaired by this, this issue we \nhave talked about many times, is the fact we need to finish our \nnational missile defense system that we started in 1983. In 1983--of \ncourse, that was the Reagan administration. There were a lot of people \nat that time who were very, very--they were very concerned over what \nwas going to happen. They had the foresight to say we are going to have \nto have a system to defend America against a missile that would come \nin, an ICBM, by the year 2000. So we set up a system whereby we would \nhave something deployable by 1999.\n  Up until 1992, when the Clinton administration went in, we were right \non schedule. We had an investment. We have a $50 billion investment in \nthe Aegis fleet of 22 ships right now that have rocket-launching \ncapabilities. You can stand on the floor and talk about the four \ndifferent types of potential systems that we now have an investment in \nthat would offer us a defense against a missile attack from overseas, \nbut perhaps the Aegis system is the best one because it is a matter of \nprotecting an investment, a $50 billion investment. It would only cost \n$5 billion more to be able to take the launching capability and go out \nof the atmosphere.\n  Why is that important? Because if a missile is launched from China or \nfrom North Korea or from Russia--and certainly don't assume something \ncouldn't come from Russia. It could be an accidental launch. We know \nthat. We went through that. When we had the hearings not too long ago, \nwe talked about how long it took to retarget over there and what the \nrisk was of an accidental launch or an unintentional launch from \nRussia. But if that happened, if we have this system in place where we \ncan go up beyond the atmosphere, we would have about 30 minutes to \nshoot down a missile that is coming in our direction. We know it works. \nThere is not anyone in America who did not watch on CNN what was going \non in the Persian Gulf war. We know that rockets can knock down \nmissiles. So it is a matter of getting it out of the atmosphere.\n  If you wait until it comes into the atmosphere, you have about 2 \nminutes. So the choice there is 30 minutes or 2 minutes. When you have \na system that is 90 percent paid for and it takes about $5 billion more \nand we are spending $6\n\n[[Page S5959]]\n\nor $8 billion over in Bosnia, we have to get our priorities straight. \nUnfortunately, we have a very biased media in this country that does \nnot allow a lot of this stuff to get out.\n  We can say it on the floor of the U.S. Senate and we know that we \nhave the facts. But by the time it gets reported, it shifts through the \nbeltway media and people do not realize that risk is out there.\n  So I will just say, Mr. President, since we are dealing with the DOD \nauthorization bill today, I would like to serve warning we are going to \nhave a resolution, well in advance, so our allies will know that when \nJune 30, 1998, comes, we are going to be out of Bosnia. I think it is \nbetter to go ahead and serve notice early rather than to wait to the \nlast minute.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on education, \nparticularly vocational education.\n  This past January, I introduced, with Senator Craig, S. 50, which \nprovides a $1,500 tax credit for students at vocational and technical \nschools and community colleges. S. 50, today, has the support of 11 \nother Members, including the majority leader.\n  Recently, the tax credit for vocational training found a place in \nSenator Roth's budget reconciliation package.\n  The provision provides a 75-percent tax credit for up to $2,000 in \nexpenses at a community college. Now, for the average student spending \naround $1,500 in annual tuition and books, that amounts to a $1,125 tax \ncredit. I would like to thank Senator Roth for his support of \nvocational training in the budget package.\n  Under the House budget package, a student would only receive a 50-\npercent credit for up to $3,000. That amounts to $1,500 for a 4-year \nstudent. But for community college students, who are generally of a \nlower income and are holding jobs while they are in school, it would \nonly amount to $750 or less. I think it is fortunate that the Senate \nrecognizes this and is going to allow a 75-percent tax credit for up to \n$2,000.\n  I believe that we should give every adult American the opportunity to \nobtain the training needed to find employment. In fact, we are \ndemanding that they work, so it is incumbent upon us to give them the \nopportunity to be trained to work. Most any job that a person would \nlook at today requires some training, and the community college is the \nplace to do it. This tax credit will enable the students to go.\n  A tax credit for community college students will encourage workers in \nall age brackets to pursue an education beyond high school without \nincurring the expensive cost of attending a 4-year college. By \nimproving the training and skills of our workers, we will create a \nbetter job climate and a better manufacturing and technological \nsociety.\n  As State commerce secretary for North Carolina, I was able to bring \nmore than 500,000 jobs into the State, and practically all of them \nrequired additional training or retraining. By strengthening the \ncommunity college system and offering custom training for workers in a \nspecific skill for the last 8 years, North Carolina has been among the \ntop three States in new plant locations. We have been able to develop a \nfilm industry that brings $2.5 billion a year to my State. The answer \nto economic growth is to be able to train people, and the community \ncollege system is the only entity I have ever seen that could really \ntrain them and put them on the job.\n  As we begin to see the impact of the changes made to welfare in the \nlast Congress, more and more people are going to be taken off welfare \nand they must work, and we must train them if they are going to work.\n  Many people who go to the community colleges are going back for \nretraining. They are not studying to get an entirely new degree. People \nare expected to keep up with new technology, and industry is demanding \nthat they do. The tax credit will allow these individuals to receive \ntraining so they can quickly return to the work force.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Roth for his support, as well as the \n11 Senators that have helped me to bring this bill to this point. I \ncertainly hope we will retain the 75-percent credit as the package \nmoves through the process and through the conference.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S5959-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                LEADERSHIP TRAINING INSTITUTE FOR YOUTH\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to point out a remarkable \nprogram that exists in America today--a program that infuses our young \npeople with a sense of purpose, values, principles, and the capacity to \nget things done.\n  This program, called the Leadership Training Institute for Youth, is \ndoing its good work at Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, MO, \nthis week.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to this organization and \nits dedicated staffers and participants. It is Missouri's distinct \nhonor to host such an excellent opportunity for our young people.\n  The Leadership Training Institute for Youth is a model initiative \nthat, with the help of Scripture and sound guidance, teaches young \npeople the tenets of good leadership and good citizenship.\n  Of course, the core training for tomorrow's leaders begins at home, \nand this organization and its committed staffers build on the lessons \nthat parents teach.\n  The Leadership Training Institute for Youth provides young people \nacross the country with opportunity, inspiration, and advantage in our \nculture. It calls future leaders to their highest and best in the name \nof a higher power. It offers direction in what is too often a \nrudderless world.\n  The institute demonstrates through lessons and example the value of \npriorities such as love for God, family, and country. It motivates \nyouth to esteem virtues of honor, morality, compassion, faithfulness, \nintegrity, discipline, and respect for the sanctity of life.\n  Therefore, I rise today to express my sincere appreciation to the \nLeadership Training Institute for Youth. Without such entities, our \nchildren might be left to the mercies of today's malls, movies, and \ntelevisions.\n  Our national heritage and our country's future are too important to \nbe left to today's suspect environments that typically attract our \nyoung people.\n  The Leadership Training Institute for Youth is a commitment to our \nyoung people--a commitment to the future leaders of this great Nation. \nWe need more programs like it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S5959-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5959-S5960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate yesterday \npassed H.R. 956, the Drug Free Communities Act of 1997. I have long \nbeen a supporter of substance abuse prevention programs, particularly \nfor our youth, and was a cosponsor of the Senate's companion bill, S. \n536.\n  I am glad to see that my Republican colleagues have taken a second \nlook at these types of prevention programs since the debate over the \n1994 crime law. It clearly was time to stop debating the usefulness of \nprevention programs and instead make sure we authorized and funded such \nprograms as the Drug Free Communities Act.\n  Community-based prevention programs have proven to be an effective \nway to combat the problem of youth drug abuse. Throughout the country \nthere are groups, large and small, public and private, whose mission is \nto reduce drug use among our young people. Many of these groups form \ncoalitions, pool their resources, and work together to reach that goal. \nGroups such as D.A.R.E., MADD, the Partnership for a Drug-Free America, \nand Vermont's unique Kids N' Kops Program, serve communities every day \nwith programs that involve entire communities and educate our youth in \ninnovative ways so that they are secure in their decision not to use \ndrugs. Those groups need to be supported and that is the purpose of \nH.R. 956.\n  Many Americans are concerned about the problem of juvenile crime and \ndelinquency, and drug abuse is a contributing factor. According to a \nrecent report from the Justice Department's Office of Juvenile Justice \nand Delinquency Prevention, the number of juvenile delinquency cases \nfor drug offenses has increased significantly. In 1994, 61 percent of \nall delinquency cases were for drug offenses compared to 43 percent in \n1985. Unfortunately, the proportion of drug offenses is higher in \nVermont than the national average. Similarly disturbing are trends in \nthe overall juvenile crime rate. While the juvenile violent crime rate \ndipped nationally in 1995, it rose in Vermont that same year. In \naddition, the number of juvenile violent crime arrests is 67 percent \nhigher than in 1986.\n  That is why at the beginning of this year, I along with a number of \nmy Democratic colleagues, introduced S. 15, the Youth Violence, Crime \nand Drug Abuse Control Act of 1997. This bill includes a number of \ninitiatives to prevent juvenile crime and drug abuse, including \nproviding funding for comprehensive drug education and prevention for \nall elementary and high school students, creating safe havens where \nchildren are protected from drugs, gangs, and crime. We must ensure \nthat prevention programs and funding are included in S. 10, the \nRepublican juvenile crime bill currently being considered in the Senate \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n  The Drug Free Communities Act of 1997 creates a 5-year, $143.5 \nmillion grant program to be run by Gen. Barry McCaffrey and the Office \nof National Drug Control Policy [ONCDP]. The purpose of the grant \nprogram is simple: to provide matching grants to community coalitions, \nparticularly those dedicated to reducing drug abuse by young people. \nEstablished partnerships in local communities with positive track \nrecords can apply for grants of up to $100,000 per community. No new \nfunding is required; it will come from redirecting money already in the \n$16 billion Federal antidrug budget.\n  In Vermont, these resources will be put to good use. With the \nmovement of gangs into Vermont and the rise in youth drug use, more \nresources are needed to serve our children. I am proud of the work that \nmany of community groups are doing in Vermont. The Orleans County \nPrevention Partnership [OCCP] in Newport, VT, has spent the last 6 \nyears fighting youth crime and drug use. OCCP was formed based on the \npremise that communities already possess a wealth of knowledge and \ntalent to deal with these problems, but need resources to coordinate \nand harness community talents to the fullest. Over the years, this \npartnership has grown from the original 17 members to the current 117 \nmembers, including all segments of Orleans County from church groups to \nlaw enforcement to schools. This commitment has led to great results: \nThe OCCP reports that, in Orleans County, liquor consumption among \nmiddle schoolers is down 15 percent, as are DWI arrests of teens and \narrests for drug crimes in all age groups. The Prevention Coalition \nbased in Brattleboro is also doing terrific work in drug prevention \nefforts in the southern part of the State. These coalitions know as \nwell as anyone about the benefits of targeted prevention programs and \nthat community partnerships are an effective way to approach this \nproblem. The passage of H.R. 956 will provide them another tool in this \nbattle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, the Finance Committee yesterday reported \na bill that will tragically undermine Medicare as we know it. I'm sure \nthat some will tell the American people that these changes are needed \nto preserve Medicare for future generations. I say, hogwash. The \nassault on Medicare that began in the last Congress is continuing with \nfull force, and Congress should reject it this year, just as we \nrejected it last year.\n  There is no justification--none whatever--for Congress to rush \nforward with ill-considered changes in Medicare under the thinly veiled \npretext of balancing the Federal budget. None of these basic changes in \nMedicare were part of the budget agreement. It is the height of \nhypocrisy for these who voted against including the Hatch-Kennedy \nchildren's health plan in the agreement last month to make this assault \non Medicare part of the agreement this month.\n  In the last Congress, the assault on Medicare came in two steps. The \nfirst step was to make deep cuts in Medicare--$270 billion over 7 \nyears, three times the amount necessary to restore the solvency of \nMedicare. The second step was to inflict enough damage to Medicare that \nit would wither away over time.\n  This year, the amount of cuts in Medicare is lower--$115 billion over \n5 years--and was locked-in by the budget agreement. But the budget \nagreement was not strong enough to prevent the second part of the anti-\nMedicare strategy.\n  Medicare is still one of the most successful social programs ever \nenacted. It has brought health care and health security to tens of \nmillions of senior citizens. We can deal with the financial problems of \nMedicare, but we must do it the right way, not the wrong way. Our goal \nis to save Medicare, not destroy it.\n  The proposal coming to the floor next week will raise the age of \neligibility for Medicare from 65 to 67. If this increase passes, we \nwill be breaking a compact made with millions of working Americans. \nDespite what supporters of this proposal claim, Medicare is not the \nsame as Social Security on the age of eligibility.\n  A delay in eligibility for Social Security may result in delayed \nbenefits or lower benefits, but people can still retire when they \nchoose. By contrast, a delay in eligibility for Medicare will throw \nmillions of seniors into the ranks of the uninsured. Unless we are \nwilling to enact simultaneous insurance reforms to guarantee access to \naffordable and comprehensive coverage\n\n[[Page S5961]]\n\nfor this group, these senior citizens will be forced to go without the \nhealth security promised to them for the past 32 years.\n  The age of eligibility is precisely the type of issue that ought to \nbe considered by the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of \nMedicare. To change the age of eligibility suddenly, on the spur of the \nmoment, in this reconciliation bill, is an unnecessary slap in the face \nof future beneficiaries. This shift should also concern big business, \nsince the serious problems created by this dangerous policy will \nundoubtedly rest in part on its shoulders.\n  We must not undermine the foundation and structure of Medicare. Yet \nthis bill would turn Medicare over to private sector insurers and \nmanaged care companies, pushing millions of elderly Americans into \ngiving up their own doctors and joining private insurance plans.\n  If just half of all seniors leave Medicare and join private plans, \ninsurance company premium revenues will increase by over $625 billion \nin 7 years. The increased profits for insurance companies will amount \nto almost $20 billion. The motive for the craven change is clear--to \npad the profits of private insurance companies at the expense of the \nhealth security of millions of elderly Americans.\n  The claim is made that the plan offers seniors more choice. But the \nplan tips the scales heavily in favor of private insurers. It reduces \npayments to doctors under traditional Medicare, inducing them to either \nlimit the number of Medicare patients they treat or leave the program. \nAt the same time, it allows doctors in some private plans to charge \nfees far above what current law allows.\n  During the budget negotiations, Republicans and Democrats jointly \nagreed to set aside $1.5 billion to provide premium assistance for \nsenior citizens with annual incomes between $9,500 and $11,800. Yet--\ndespite this clear commitment--this needed assistance is not included \nin the Senate bill, and the House bill provides only one-third of the \nmoney under a proposal that is likely to be ineffective. More than 3 \nmillion beneficiaries fall into this category, most of whom are older \nwomen who live alone.\n  Where did this money go? At least a portion went to pay for an \nunnecessary test of medical savings accounts. Proponents claim that \nthese high-deductible private plans will help Medicare by encouraging \nseniors to take responsibility for their own health care. But we know \nthat MSA's are just another gift for the wealthy and the healthy. They \nwill encourage the wealthiest beneficiaries to opt-out of Medicare and \ntake their premiums with them, leaving the Government with the sickest \npatients and fewer dollars to pay for their care. Again, the real \nreason for this change is MSA's cost the taxpayers money while \nbenefiting private insurers. The private insurance industry has been \nitching for 30 years to get its hands on Medicare, but that is no \nreason for this Congress to scratch that itch.\n  We are already spending approximately $1.5 billion between 1997-2002 \nto review the effect of MSA's in the private insurance market under \nlast year's Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance reform law. There is no \nneed to gamble with scarce Medicare funds before an adequate evaluation \nof the current test is obtained. This additional demonstration program \nserves only to put another foot in the door in the misguided effort to \nturn Medicare into a private insurance plan.\n  Unfortunately, it is the low and moderate-income elderly who will \nsuffer most from these proposals. Senior citizens already spend, on \naverage, more than 20 percent of their income on health expenses. \nIgnoring this fact, the committee proposal also includes a new $5 per \nvisit copayment for home health services under Medicare. This copayment \nalone will raise nearly $5 billion. It is a tax on the very senior \ncitizens who are sick, and can least afford to pay it. It will fall \ndisproportionately on the very old, the very ill and those with modest \nincome.\n  Another extremely serious change for beneficiaries is the proposal to \nmeans-test the Medicare deductible. Unlike proposals to means-test the \npremium, which would apply to all beneficiaries, means-testing the \ndeductible affects only those who actually use health services. It \ntherefore imposes a sickness tax that undermines Medicare's fundamental \npolicy of spreading risks and costs across all beneficiaries.\n  Supporters justify this step by claiming that most beneficiaries have \nsupplemental insurance policies--called Medigap--which will cover the \nincrease. But insurance companies do not set their rates based on \nincome. So the additional costs will be reflected in higher Medigap \npremiums paid by all--unconscionably forcing lower income beneficiaries \nto subsidize the higher deductibles of the wealthier beneficiaries.\n  No one should be under any illusions about the impact of these \nprovisions on Medicare. The issue is clear. On the question of whether \nsenior citizens deserve decent health care in their retirement years, \nthe answer of this bill is a resounding ``no.''\n  Taken together, the proposals in this plan give upper income \nbeneficiaries no need to stay in Medicare--and every incentive to \nleave. This plan will destroy the successful social compact that if \nrich and poor alike contribute to the program, rich and poor alike will \nreceive the same benefits.\n  Our priority should be to keep the promise of medical and financial \nsecurity for senior citizens that Medicare provides. We are the \nguardians of that promise and we should oppose any schemes that violate \nit.\n  There is no question that Medicare will face serious challenges in \nthe next century as a result of the retirement of the baby-boom \ngeneration. Today, there are nearly four adults of working age for \nevery senior citizen. By the year 2030, that ratio will be only two \nworkers for every senior citizen. But there is a right way and a wrong \nway to respond to that challenge. The wrong way is to destroy the \nprogram under the guise of saving it.\n  One right way that Congress should carefully explore has been \nsuggested by a recent study at Duke University. It shows that the most \nimportant factor driving Medicare costs is not how many seniors are in \nthe program, but how sick they are. The chronically ill, those who are \ndisabled, account for the overwhelming majority of Medicare costs. In \n1995, the average disabled senior citizen cost the program seven times \nas much as a nondisabled beneficiary. Saving just one senior citizen \nfrom disability saves Medicare an incredible $18,000 a year in costs on \nthe average.\n  Over the last 12 years, the rate of disability dropped by an average \nof 1.3 percent per year. Maintaining and slightly raising that rate of \ndecline to 1.5 percent a year could make the Medicare Program solvent \nfar into the 21st century--without destructive benefit cuts or major \ntax increases. This is a far better way to save Medicare for the long \nhaul. It will put Medicare's fiscal house in order, and enable all \nAmericans to live longer and healthier lives. It is unacceptable for \nCongress to make deep and excessive cuts in Medicare without exploring \nthis alternative.\n  In fact, we need to do more, not less, to provide good health care to \nsenior citizens. We need to double our investment in biomedical \nresearch over the next 5 years.\n  It has been a bipartisan effort. Senator Mack has been a leader. \nSenator Specter, Senator Harkin, and many others on both sides of the \naisle have provided leadership in this area. We need to make sure that \nevery senior citizen receives the best and most up to date medical \ncare. We need to encourage every American--and especially senior \ncitizens--to follow healthier lifestyles and receive good preventive \nmedicine. I am pleased that one of the positive parts of this \nreconciliation bill is its expansion of preventive benefits for \nMedicare beneficiaries, including annual mammograms, colorectal cancer \nscreening, and diabetes self-management. But this is one of the few \nbright spots in an otherwise destructive approach to the long-term \nhealth of Medicare and its beneficiaries.\n  Today the Finance Committee will also mark-up its tax proposal. There \nis little reason to expect that the result will be any fairer than the \nassault on Medicare. Our goal next week is clear.\n  Next week also as an amendment to the reconciliation bill Senator \nHatch and I intend to offer our proposal for children's health \ninsurance, paid for by an increase in the tobacco tax. Clearly the \nprovisions in the Finance Committee plan, which will cover fewer than\n\n[[Page S5962]]\n\none out of three of America's uninsured children, fall far short of any \nresponsible initiative to deal with the urgent health needs of our \nchildren. We were encouraged that a strong bipartisan majority of the \nFinance Committee voted to include our legislation in their bill. Now \nwe have a realistic opportunity on the floor to guarantee every \nAmerican child a healthy start in life. I urge the Senate to support \nit.\n  Congress can balance the budget with fairer Medicare changes to \nprotect senior citizens, expanded health care for children fully paid \nfor by an increased tobacco tax, and we can still balance the budget \nwith fairer tax cuts to help working families. As those major battles \nreach the Senate floor, we will have a chance to correct the many \nserious injustices in the current proposals, and I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to do so.\n  Mr. President, I have a chart about the average Medicare outlays per \nbeneficiary. If you take the healthiest 90 percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries, we only spend $1,444; the sickest, 10 percent; on which \nwe spend $36,960 a year. If we are able to reduce the sickest and those \nthat have chronic disabilities, we can have a dramatic impact on the \nfinancial stability of our Medicare system. And we certainly ought to \ntake a hard look at that before we start cutting the benefits, and \nraising copays and deductibles for those on Medicare in the way that \nthe Finance Committee has done so in the last few days.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

Mr. President, Senator Durbin and I want to visit a bit \nwith our colleagues about the tax bill that is now being written in the \nSenate Finance Committee, and the tax cut bill that was written by the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee--to talk about who will receive the \nbenefits of this legislation.\n  I served for 10 years on the House Ways and Means Committee, and was \ninvolved in the writing of tax legislation. And I understand that, \ngenerally speaking, when tax legislation is written you have a lot of \nvery important interests who come to the table and want to have access \nto some of the benefits of the tax cuts. My concern is that when \nCongress decides to provide tax cuts that it provide tax cuts \nespecially to working families in this country who have seen an \nincrease in their payroll taxes.\n  One of the circumstances that exists now in this country is that \nnearly two-thirds of the American people pay higher payroll taxes than \nthey pay in income taxes. Yet, every time we talk about tax cuts around \nhere we have folks who talk about the tax cuts that will generally say \nif you invest you are going to be exempt but if you work you are going \nto be taxed. In other words, they go right back to the old approach: \nLet's tax work and exempt investment. I happen to think investment is a \nworthy thing. We ought to encourage more of it in this country for \nthose who work. Why can't we construct a tax bill that will value work \nas much as we value investment?\n  It is interesting to me that the bill that was constructed by the \nHouse of Representatives is a proposed tax cut bill which says here is \nthe way we are going to deal out our tax cuts. We are going to provide \nfor the bottom 60 percent of the people in this country that--if you \nhave a table and the American people are sitting around that table--the \nbottom 60 percent of income earners are going to get 12 percent of the \ntax cuts. Then we say for the top 10 percent of the income earners \naround this table that you are going to get 43 percent of the tax cut.\n  Let me put it a different way. It says for the bottom 20 percent of \nthe working population in this country you are going to get one-half of \n1 percent of the total tax cut given by Congress. The bottom 20 percent \ngets one-half of 1 percent, and the top 1 percent gets nearly 20 \npercent of the benefit of the tax cut.\n  You can construct a tax cut that is much more fair than that.\n  The tax increases that people have experienced in this country in \nrecent years has been the payroll tax. The folks who go to work--\nespecially at the lower wages and then find their wages are largely \nfrozen. It is hard to get out of those brackets. But the one thing that \nisn't frozen is the payroll tax, and they have to pay higher and higher \npayroll taxes.\n  What happens to them is--despite the fact they have not had increases \nin income but they have had increases in payroll taxes--when it comes \ntime to figure out how Congress is going to give back some taxes and \nprovide tax relief, they discover that the tax relief isn't really \navailable to them. It is going to be available to the folks at the top. \nThose are the folks that have had the biggest income increase--the \nhighest increase in income--in recent years. Frankly, they do not pay \nanywhere near the kind of payroll taxes because their payroll taxes end \nat a certain level. The folks at the bottom pay a payroll tax on every \ndollar of income. Those are the taxes that increase.\n\n  But here are some of the concerns that we have about the tax bill. \nSenator Durbin and I hope that when the legislation is finished by the \nSenate Finance Committee that it will come to the floor with a \ndistribution table that is fair for the middle- and lower-income \nworking families so they can get some real tax relief.\n  But the child tax credit, which I think makes some sense, is not \nrefundable. Therefore, the folks who do not make enough money but are \nstill working and paying payroll taxes--incidentally paying higher \npayroll taxes--are not going to get the full benefit of the child tax \ncredit.\n  This chart shows that the child tax credit is not going to be \navailable to 40 percent of American children. There was an adjustment \nin the last day that will decrease that to about 30 percent. That does \nnot make any sense.\n  Make that available so that the working people can get a child tax \ncredit. Make that available to them, and that can be helpful to them \nwith real tax relief.\n  This is the distribution of the House tax bill proposal. It is the \nsame old thing. There is no secret here. If you are fortunate enough to \nbe in the top 1 percent of the income earners, you are going to get a \nwhopping $12,000 tax cut. And if you are down at the bottom 15 percent, \nor so, of the income earners, you are going to get a $14 tax cut.\n  It is the old cake and crumbs theory. If you are somewhere up near \nthe top, you get the cake. If you are earning somewhere down near the \nbottom, you get the crumbs.\n  Yet those who face higher taxes in this country are the ones who are \npaying the payroll taxes. That especially hurts those at the bottom of \nthe income level.\n  We hope that when the Congress, and the Senate Finance Committee in \nthis case, brings a bill to the floor of the Senate that we will see a \ndistribution table that allows us to say everybody in this country \nbenefits from a tax cut.\n  There is kind of a different theory in this country. Some feel this \neconomy works because you pour something in the top and it trickles \ndown to everybody at the bottom. Others of us think that it works \nbecause you have a lot of working families, and, if you give them \nsomething to work with, it percolates up, and that represents the \neconomic strength and economic engine of this country.\n  But when we give tax cuts as a Congress, let us do it fairly. Let us \nmake sure that moderate-income and low-income families out there in the \nmiddle of the pack also get a reasonable tax cut, and not just the \nfolks way at the upper end who get exemptions for their investments, \nbut the rest of the folks as well. If we get to that point, I think the \nAmerican people will say a job well done.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Dorgan on \nthis issue. There is not a more important\n\n[[Page S5963]]\n\ntopic on Capitol Hill. During the last several weeks we were \nembarrassed by a debate on the disaster bill. I am afraid that we are \ngoing to be embarrassed again by a tax bill that will be disastrous to \nworking families. Senator Dorgan pointed it out.\n  Why in the world would we be giving tax cuts to the wealthiest \nAmericans, and ignoring folks struggling to get by every day; trying to \npay the bills, trying to pay for their day care costs, trying to save a \nlittle money for their children, trying to make sure they make the \nmortgage payment and maybe have enough left over for the utility bills? \nWhy isn't this tax bill helping these families?\n  Folks making $100,000, $200,000, or $300,000 are the winners in this \ntax bill. But the folks struggling to get by? The husband and wife both \nworking two jobs are the ones who don't get a break. Why are we doing \nthis? Because there is a clear difference in values between the people \nwho are arguing this bill.\n  For goodness sakes. I believe, as Senator Dorgan has said, that we \nshould be helping working families at this point in our history. Give \nthose folks a break, and make sure that the families which are being \nnailed with payroll taxes get a chance to make a living and realize the \nAmerican dream. And give their kids a chance. But to say that we are \ngoing to focus the help in this bill on those who are struggling--get \nthis now, struggling-- with the concept of, ``How will I pay my capital \ngains on the stock that has appreciated so dramatically?'' Are those \nthe folks that you would loose sleep at night over and the ones that we \nshould have some sort of tinge of sadness in our heart for? I don't see \nit.\n\n  When I think of this tax bill I think of working families trying to \nhang on to a job, and struggling to get by.\n  Take a look at what this does. This really tells the story, \nunfortunately, about what this is all about. Think about this. The \nlower 60 percent of wage earners in America--the lower 60 percent--\nunder the bill being proposed by the Senate Republicans get 12 percent \nof the tax cuts; 12 percent. More than 87 percent goes to those in the \nupper-income categories.\n  The amount of money involved in this is dramatic. If you make over \n$400,000 a year, we are going to give you a $7,000 tax cut. We want to \ntake care of you. We are afraid you are struggling at $400,000 a year. \nBut if you happen to be making $50,000 a year, I am afraid to tell you \nthat the benefit is going to be about 52 bucks; a buck a week.\n  What a heart this Senate has for working families.\n  Let's hope that the people who are writing this bill wake up to the \nreality that we have to do more than just meet the target of cutting \n$130 million when it comes to tax cuts. We have to be cutting it in the \nright way so that working families have a fighting chance.\n  Let's make sure that when this debate is over that we don't have \nanother disaster bill--a bill disastrous for working families.\n  The final point I want to make on this is when you take a look at \nthese tax cuts, don't measure them against just this year, or next \nyear, or even 5 years, but against what they will do down the line.\n  The people bringing this bill are very crafty. They start the tax \ncuts now. They don't look like much. And, all of a sudden, they start \nmushrooming--it may be a poison mushroom--when you look at the \noutyears. We have a dramatically costly bill associated with these tax \ncuts.\n  So in the future Members of Congress--the House and the Senate--are \ngoing to struggle to balance the budget because of bad decisions and \nbad policy today. That makes no sense.\n  I urge my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee and all of my \ncolleagues in the Senate to think about the working families in this \ncountry for a change. For goodness sakes, let's have a tax cut bill \nthat is designed to help them. These are families who, with a tax cut, \nwill turn around and make purchases--who will purchase a new washer and \ndryer, who will purchase a new home, who will purchase a new car--\ncreating jobs and creating opportunities.\n  That is what this is all about.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan, for requesting the floor at \nthis propitious moment in the debate on this bill. I hope that our \nmessage will be delivered through the people of this country, and to \nall of our colleagues.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time and \nmake a point of order a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S5962-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5963-S5978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 87, S. 858, the \nintelligence authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 858) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n     1998 for intelligence and intelligence-related activities of \n     the United States Government, the Community Management \n     Account and the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and \n     Disability System, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We have a list of them: Alfred Cumming, Melvin Dubee, Peter \nFlory, Lorenzo Goco, Joan Grimson, Andy Johnson, Taylor Lawrence, Ken \nMyers, Suzanne Spaulding, Christopher Straub, Christopher Williams, \nPeter Dorn, Bill Duhnke, Emil Francona, Art Grant, Patricia Hanback, \nKen Johnson, Don Mitchell, Randy Schieber, Don Stone, Linda Taylor, and \nJames Wolfe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the intelligence authorization bill is \nbefore the Senate at this time.\n  This bill was unanimously voted out of the Intelligence Committee on \nJune 4. It was then referred to the Senate Armed Services Committee and \nwas favorably reported without amendment yesterday.\n  This bill will authorize appropriations for intelligence and \nintelligence-related activities of the U.S. Government. I am pleased to \nreport to the Senate today that I have worked very closely with Senator \nKerrey, the vice chairman of the committee, in drafting this bill. We \nhave crafted, Mr. President, what we believe is a bipartisan bill that \nreceived the full support of all Republican and all Democratic members \nof the Intelligence Committee.\n  I am proud that the actions we have taken with this legislation are \ncomprehensive and that we have taken some bold steps to implement four \npriorities to posture the intelligence community for the future.\n  Mr. President, it is extremely fortuitous that we are bringing the \nintelligence authorization bill to the floor this week when we have \nseen a great intelligence success recently. It is not often that the \ndedicated men and women of our intelligence agencies enjoy public \nrecognition for their work. They understand that. But yesterday, all \nAmericans were gratified to learn of the successful apprehension of Mir \nAimal Kansi and his transport to the United States to stand trial for \nthe brutal murder of two CIA employees and the wounding of three others \noutside the CIA headquarters several years back.\n  I am extremely proud of our intelligence community in their work \nhere. The Kansi arrest was the result of over 4 years--4 years--of \npainstaking and dedicated investigative and intelligence work by the \nCIA, the FBI, and others.\n\n  Together with my colleagues on the Intelligence Committee, I was \nbriefed on the details of this successful mission yesterday. While I \ncannot comment on the operation itself, I can share with my colleagues, \nas Senator Kerrey would, and the American people, that it was conducted \nwith great professionalism and personal courage.\n\n[[Page S5964]]\n\n  The success of this operation should serve as a warning to others, \nthose who in the past have attacked Americans and those who might be \ncontemplating such actions, that America will take action to bring the \nalleged perpetrators to justice wherever they are and whatever the \ncost.\n  To the families of those who died and to those who were wounded, we \nknow that this arrest cannot return your loved ones or heal your \nwounds. We hope, however, that you derive consolation from seeing the \naccused killer brought to this country for trial.\n  The legislation before us today is made up of words and numbers on \npaper. As yesterday's events remind us, the work of our intelligence \nand law enforcement professionals takes place in the real world, in \nflesh and blood.\n  While the cold war is, indeed, over, there are still many forces in \nthe world today that threaten our national security and our citizens \nand require the constant vigilance of our intelligence community. That \nis why we have authorized a significant level of funding for the \ncontinued operation of the intelligence community's activities.\n  I believe it would be inappropriate, Mr. President, to reveal this \nexact level of funding, not because we do not want the American people \nto know how much is invested in intelligence activities for their \nprotection, but, rather, we want to protect the level of our \ninvestments from foreign intelligence services and leaders of rogue \nstates who would analyze trends in these investments to help guide \ntheir decisions about when to strike with terrorism or aggression \nagainst their neighbors, perhaps our own citizens.\n  I now would like to take a few minutes to summarize the major \npriorities and the actions we have taken with this legislation.\n  We have had to face some tough choices, as all of us have in the \nSenate, in the allocation of resources to meet the critical priorities \nthat have been set for the intelligence community.\n  In setting the authorization level for intelligence, we have looked \nacross the combined request for intelligence that is broken up into \nthree major categories, and they are the National Foreign Intelligence \nProgram of the Director of Central Intelligence, the Joint Military \nIntelligence Program of the Secretary of Defense, and the Tactical \nIntelligence and Related Activities Program of the military services.\n  The Intelligence Authorization Act includes authorization for each of \nthese categories. With this legislation, Mr. President, we continue to \nlay the groundwork for the intelligence community of the 21st century, \none that is retooled and I believe that is right-sized.\n  In putting together this authorization, the committee identified nine \nkey areas that will contribute to this effort. We drafted an \nauthorization bill that will better focus, we believe, the intelligence \ncommunity's resources on these areas. I call the first five areas the \nfive C's: counterterrorism, counterproliferation, counternarcotics, \ncounterintelligence, and covert action. In each of these areas our bill \nincludes additional resources to aggressively tackle these difficult \nmissions in the world.\n  We also examined four other areas with a view toward long-term \ninvestments that would place our intelligence agencies on a stronger \nfooting as we enter the 21st century. These included: A stronger \ncommitment to advanced research and development to maintain our \ntechnological edge; improvement in the tools and skills of our \nclandestine service personnel; new approaches to infiltrating and \nassessing hard-target countries; and enhancements to our analytical and \ninformation warfare capabilities.\n  We have put forward a balanced recommendation for the authorization \nof a Joint Military Intelligence Program that, among other things, \nincludes sensor and engine upgrades for our airborne intelligence fleet \nof RC-135's; it continues the modernization of our manned \nreconnaissance capabilities; and pushes forward with the new technology \nof unmanned aerial vehicles.\n  We have also taken some bold legislative initiatives in this bill. \nOne area on which the Intelligence Committee focused was the need to \nensure that classification of information is used effectively to \nprotect sensitive sources and methods or other vital national security \ninterests but does not prevent the flow of information to Congress or, \nwhere appropriate, to the American people.\n  The committee has concluded that a higher priority is needed for the \nreview and for the declassification of intelligence so that families \nconcerned about the murder of a loved one overseas receive vital \ninformation consistent with national security concerns. The Committee \non Intelligence recently heard from the families of several marines who \nwere murdered in a terrorist attack in Zona Rosa, El Salvador, in 1985. \nA common refrain in their testimony before the committee was concern \nabout how little information they received from their Government \nregarding the attack and its perpetrators.\n\n  It was from network television, for example, that at least one family \nfirst learned of the attack and death of their brother or son. It was \nalso from television broadcasts that several families learned years \nlater that the likely mastermind of the attack had been brought into \nthis country through the U.S. official channels. The committee has \npressed the executive branch to provide these families with as much \ninformation as possible, but 12 years is a long time to wait.\n  The committee believes, however, that it is the national interests of \nthe United States to provide information regarding the murder or \nkidnapping of Americans abroad to their families consistent with \nintelligence operations.\n  Moreover, given the difficulty inherent in identifying all relevant \ninformation that might be held by different elements of the Government \nand the likely resistance to providing information that is currently \nclassified, the committee believes this important responsibility must \nultimately be vested in a Cabinet-level official.\n  Therefore, the committee has adopted a provision in this bill \nrequiring the Secretary of State to ensure that all appropriate actions \nare taken within the Government to promptly identify relevant \ninformation pertaining to incidents of violence against Americans \noverseas.\n  Mr. President, the Secretary is then required to make the information \navailable to families to the maximum extent possible without seriously \njeopardizing sensitive intelligence sources and methods or other \nnational security interests.\n  This provision, along with others contained in this bill, will \nenhance the intelligence community's working relationship with the \nAmerican public that it serves.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Intelligence \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1998.\n  Mr. President, I also want to remind my colleagues that a lot, if not \nmost, of this bill is classified. But we have some security officers \nfrom the Intelligence Committee that are available here today, off the \nfloor, to go into any aspect of the legislation that they think is \npertinent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to join my chairman, the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama, in offering this year's \nintelligence authorization bill. It is designed to focus the national \nintelligence agencies of the United States on today's and tomorrow's \nthreats. The bill is the product of the open, bipartisan process that \nhas long been the hallmark of the Select Committee on Intelligence. It \nwas voted unanimously out of the committee and in accordance with \nSenate Resolution 400, the founding document of the Intelligence \nCommittee, the bill was reviewed by the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Before I discuss the bill, I want to say a word about the bipartisan \nprocess which created this legislation under Chairman Shelby's \nleadership. Unlike many other topics which we consider here each day, \nthere is no Republican agenda or Democratic agenda with regard to \nintelligence, or at least none apparent to me.\n  Intelligence is simply the best informed estimate of the truth about \nsomething. It knows no party. Every member of our committee seeks the \nmost effective and most efficient methods for the collection, \nprocessing, analysis, production, and dissemination of\n\n[[Page S5965]]\n\nintelligence. Every member of our committee seeks intelligence \ncollection and operations to be conducted in accordance with American \nlaw and American values. We certainly often disagree on which approach \nto take in a particular situation, but our disagreements are not based \non party agendas. We are simply seeking the best performance for the \nintelligence community and the best outcome for our country. So the \nchairman and I were united in purpose as we approached this \nlegislation, we came to closure on our disagreements, and we are united \nin recommending it to the full Senate.\n  Most of the intelligence authorization is contained in a classified \nannex which we cannot discuss in open session but which is available to \nMembers in S-407. The schedule of authorizations in that annex comprise \nthe National Foreign Intelligence Program of the United States, \ntogether with the Intelligence Committee's markup of the Joint Military \nIntelligence Program and recommendations to the Armed Services \nCommittee on Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities. The total \namount allocated for these programs is not something I can report in \nopen session, and I understand that fact will be the subject of an \namendment. But I can say while it is a good value, it is a substantial \namount of money.\n  Before we discuss any amendment which may be introduced in that \nregard, I want to respond to the concerns of Members who may doubt the \nneed for significant investment in intelligence at this stage of our \nhistory.\n  The best intelligence is simply a necessity for the protection of our \npeople and for the leadership of a nation with America's power and \nAmerica's responsibilities. Intelligence illuminates policy. Much is \nmade of the strategic crossroads the Nation finds itself at, the need \nto develop fresh strategies for the new century. You can't make good \nstrategy without good intelligence. Intelligence is also the essential \nAmerican advantage in war. Victory in battle comes, and will come in \nthe future, from the convergence of three things we saw in the gulf \nwar: American courage and precise American weapons linked to precise \nAmerican intelligence. The ability to avoid conflict, to gain victory \nor attain our objectives without risking American lives, is also \nfounded on the inside knowledge gained from intelligence. I can assure \nmy colleagues: intelligence gives America a huge advantage in \npolicymaking, in defense, and in the international aspects of law \nenforcement.\n  This year's authorization bill addresses today's and tomorrow's \nthreats. We have focused on international terrorism, the proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction, and on narcotics trafficking from \nforeign countries. We have also stressed counterintelligence and the \nneed for more advanced research and development. Good science is \nessential to keeping and extending our edge in intelligence, and we do \nnot recommend standing pat in this key area. Our bill also reflects our \nunderstanding that despite the good relations we now enjoy with Russia, \nour intelligence agencies need to continue to pay attention to Russian \nnuclear warheads which still pose the greatest threat, just in terms of \ncapability, to our national life and the lives of our citizens.\n  The bill also has some important legislative provisions, which are \nunclassified. The most important, in my view, is the requirement for \nthe executive branch to make crystal clear to every employee of the \nnational intelligence community that he or she has the right to \ndisclose classified information to the appropriate congressional \noversight committee, if the employee believes the information provided \ngives evidence of wrongdoing. This provision, like the rest of this \nbill, does not have a partisan basis. We simply intend it to preserve \nthe ability of Congress to perform oversight, which cannot be done \nwithout information. In most circumstances, I hope an employee who felt \nthe obligation to report something classified to Congress would first \napproach his superiors and get their views on how the information \nshould be presented. But in some circumstances, such as when the \nemployee suspects his superiors of complicity in the alleged \nwrongdoing, the employee should not fear to communicate with the \nappropriate committee member or cleared staff. The administration does \nnot agree, and believes they have greater authority, by virtue of \nExecutive Order 12356, to control the release of executive branch \nclassified information to Congress. But, given the guarantees in the \nbill for responsible handling of the received classified information by \nCongress, I would hope every Member of the Senate would support \nCongress' right to be informed.\n  This legislation also provides subpoena powers for the CIA inspector \ngeneral to obtain documentary evidence in support of investigations. \nThe CIA IG is the only inspector general in any of the major national \nsecurity agencies who lacks this power, and its absence has adversely \naffected investigations. We have made clear in the bill that subpoena \npower will remain strictly in the service of the IG for investigative \npurposes, and will not be used by or in behalf of any other element of \nthe CIA.\n  The Intelligence Committee in 1989 originated the legislation \ncreating the CIA inspector general, and in the past year the Audit Team \nof the Select Committee on Intelligence conducted a review of the \nperformance of the IG and his office. The confidence of the oversight \ncommittees and ultimately the public is essential if the IG is to do \nhis job properly. If I may quote from the report accompanying the bill, \n``the [IG] office has increased the level of trust and respect from \nwithin the Agency, the Oversight Committees, and the Intelligence \nCommunity.''\n  Mr. President, the distinguished chairman has described other \nhighlights of the bill, one of which we learned from the Khamisiya \nnerve gas experience and is intended to ensure intelligence better \nsupports our deployed forces, and another which enables Americans whose \nfamily members are victims of murder or kidnapping overseas to be kept \nbetter informed by their Government. These provisions, like others I \nhave already described, are the result of investigations or hearings by \nthe committee and represent, as does the entire bill, the committee's \nreasoned view of what is necessary to keep the Nation safe and informed \nin today's world.\n  Finally, I would like to call the Senate's attention to the arrest \nand return to the United States, this past Tuesday, of Mir Aimal Kansi \nfor the murder of two CIA employees and wounding of three others at the \ngate to CIA headquarters several years ago. The CIA and FBI pursued \nthis man to the ends of the Earth, just as former Director James \nWoolsey promised at the time of the crime. Mr. President, this is a \ngreat triumph for U.S. intelligence and law enforcement, working in a \nharmony which could not have been imagined just a few years ago. All \ninvolved in this mission have my deepest respect and congratulations.\n  The Kansi case underlines the quality and dedication of the \nremarkable people who work for the American people in our intelligence \norganizations. They are selfless and patriotic, many of them risk their \nsafety for the sake of our country, and many more are denied the \ngratification of the ego that comes from being able to talk freely \nabout their professional accomplishments. A lot of our talk here is \nmeaningless without the commitment of people like these to actually do \nsomething or learn something for America's benefit. The annual \nauthorization bill debate is a chance to thank them, and I do.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the Senate's deliberations on this \nbill and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to support S. 858, the fiscal year \n1998 intelligence authorization bill. The legislation comes to the \nfloor having been reported out of the Select Committee on Intelligence \nearlier this month and approved, on referral, by the Armed Services \nCommittee. As a member of both committees, I believe S. 858 is a \nresponsible, bipartisan bill which reflects our mutual oversight \nconcerns and policy priorities. While there may be some areas in which \nthe two committees disagree, I want to praise Intelligence Committee \nChairman Richard Shelby and Vice Chairman Bob Kerrey for their efforts \nin seeking a consensus with the Armed Services Committee on the funding \nand legislative provisions contained in the bill.\n\n[[Page S5966]]\n\n  Most notably, S. 858 reflects our shared concern that intelligence \ncommunity activities must reflect the new, post-cold-war era threats \nand challenges to U.S. security. Additionally, there is strong \nagreement between the two committees and the administration that \ncontinued emphasis must be given to improving the collection and \ndistribution of timely intelligence to the warfighter in the cockpit, \nin the tank, aboard ship, and in the command post. One of the \noverriding lessons learned from the Persian Gulf war was that high \nquality tactical intelligence, if provided to the warfighter in a \nprompt fashion can save American lives and carry the day on the field \nof battle. Improving this qualitative advantage enjoyed by our Armed \nForces must remain a top priority in my view and I am pleased to see it \nreflected in S. 858.\n  Also included in the intelligence authorization bill is a provision I \nsponsored asking that the Director of Central Intelligence examine the \nfull range of threats to the United States from weapons of mass \ndestruction, not just the threat from ballistic and cruise missile \nweapons, which formed the basis of the last intelligence estimate of \nthis kind in 1995. The intelligence threat assessment required by S. \n858 will be submitted to Congress annually beginning February 15 of \nnext year and provide us with our first comprehensive understanding of \nthe emerging ``nontraditional'' threat facing our Nation, including the \nability of terrorist groups and hostile governments to produce and \ndeliver nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons into the United \nStates, the probability that such an attack would come from ballistic \nmissile, cruise missile, or any other means of delivery, and the \nvulnerability of the United States to such an attack. One month after \nthe completion of the intelligence community's threat estimate, the \nPresident is required to submit a report to Congress identifying how \nFederal funds are dedicated to defending against this full range of \nthreats. Linking the probability of a certain type of attack using a \nweapon of mass destruction, such as a terrorist chemical attack versus \na Russian ballistic missile attack, with the level of funds being spent \nto defend against such a threat will be extremely helpful, in my view, \nas the Senate debates national defense spending priorities in the \nupcoming years.\n  In closing, I again want to commend the leadership of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee for its willingness to work with the Armed \nServices Committee on the numerous issues of mutual concern, and I look \nforward to continued cooperation between the two committees as we move \ninto conference with the House of Representatives on our respective \nbills.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 415\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 415.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: ``It is the \n     sense of the Senate that any tax legislation enacted by the \n     Congress this year should meet a standard of fairness in its \n     distributional impact on upper, middle and lower income \n     taxpayers, and that any such legislation should not \n     disproportionately benefit the highest income taxpayers.''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, we did not \nformally agree to a time agreement. I know that the policy committees \nare meeting. I think I will take 20 minutes rather than 15, because I \ndo not think we will have a vote before 2 o'clock, in any case.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, there will be other amendments, at least one \nother amendment, before final passage. So that will take us well beyond \nthat. If the Senator would not object, we would probably like to stack \nhis vote, if that would be agreeable?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to the Chair, 15 minutes is what we had talked \nabout. I would be pleased to do that. I just remind my colleague, I do \nnot think there will be any votes until 2, in any case.\n  Mr. KERREY. We will need a consent agreement to set time for the \nvotes.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota have from now until 2 o'clock on his amendment; \nat the end of that time, no vote will occur until we have an \nopportunity to work out maybe back-to-back votes. The other one \namendment I think we can work a time agreement on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just read this amendment because \nI want colleagues to know exactly what it says. I want them to know \nwhat they are voting on, because if there is going to be strong support \nfor this amendment, that's fine. It is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, \nbut people are on record. This will be a test that I want to use, as a \nSenator, to look at what we are doing vis-a-vis tax policy. This \namendment says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that any tax legislation \n     enacted by the Congress this year should meet a standard of \n     fairness in its distributional impact on upper--\n\n  Mr. KERREY. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a unanimous \nconsent to set the other vote? Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the only amendments in order to S. 858 be an amendment offered by \nSenator Torricelli regarding funding, an amendment by Senator Wellstone \nregarding tax fairness, and, further, no other amendments be in order, \nthat the amendment offered by Senator Torricelli have 40 minutes \nequally divided, and that the vote on these two amendments be stacked \nand begin at 2:45.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, might I \ninquire if it would be part of this agreement to have no second-degree \namendments? Is that correct?\n  Mr. KERREY. No second-degree amendments on either amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I shall go on reading, then, this \namendment, that whatever we do by way of this tax legislation ``should \nmeet a standard of fairness in its distributional impact on upper, \nmiddle and lower income taxpayers, and that any such legislation should \nnot disproportionately benefit the highest income taxpayers.''\n  Mr. President, I want colleagues to listen to this because it is my \nsense that there is going to be strong support for this. I will do \neverything I can as a Senator to hold my colleagues accountable for \ntheir support.\n  Understand, I say to Democrats and Republicans alike, that if you \nvote for this, then what we need to do is look at what we are now \ndiscussing in the Finance Committee and what came out of the Ways and \nMeans Committee. Look at the Finance Committee tax bill--it is quite \nunbelievable--if you are at the top 1 percent of the population, making \nover $400,000 a year, you are going to get a break of a little bit over \n$7,000 a year. If you are in the top 20 percent of the population, and \nhave an income of $200,000 a year and over, you will get a break of \nabout $3,706. $200,000 and over, you get $3,706; $100,000 to $200,000 \n--we are not middle class yet, I remind my colleagues--you get $1,440; \n$75,000 to $100,000, you get $804.\n\n  Now look what happens when we get to incomes of $75,000 and below, \nand more so when we get into the $40,000 to $50,000, $30,000 to \n$40,000, and $15,000 to $30,000 range. For these hard-pressed people--\nwhat do you get? A pittance. Low income families get a dollar a week, \nif that.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about a tax bill that provides benefits \nto people in inverse relationship to need. The less you need, the more \nyou get; the more you need, the more hard pressed you are, the more you \nare trying to provide for your family, trying to make a decent living \nand raise your children successfully, the less you get. This is a \nRobin-Hood-in-reverse policy.\n  If I could turn to the next chart: here we see that the House bill is \neven\n\n[[Page S5967]]\n\nworse, really, skewed in the favor of higher income Americans. The top \n1 percent get $10,000; and then you get down to $40,000 to $50,000, \n$30,000 to 40,000--they get $167, or $300, or some similar tiny amount.\n  So, Mr. President, we are giving $10,000 and $12,000 per year tax \nbreaks to upper-income and wealthy people, and then hard-pressed people \nin the States of Wyoming or Minnesota are getting practically nothing.\n  I say to my colleagues, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, and \nmaybe people don't want to debate it and maybe people don't want to \nvote against it. But if you vote for it and then you go and vote for \nthis tax bill, you are going to have to come out with some other data \nthat shows that this tax bill, in fact, is based on some standard of \nfairness. I haven't seen one shred of evidence to that effect.\n  The next chart, Mr. President, reflects on the issue of deficit \nreduction. The chart is from the Joint Tax Committee and the Center on \nBudget and Policy Priorities--the first two charts were from the \nDepartment of the Treasury--and shows how the tax cuts are backloaded. \nLook at this. We are talking about an erosion of revenue between 2000 \nand 2017, to the tune of $950 billion.\n  Mr. President, I have said it before on the floor of the Senate, \nthere is an old Yiddish proverb: you can't dance at two weddings at the \nsame time. You can't be talking about deficit reduction and say you \nwant to invest in education and opportunities for all our citizens and \nyou are for the children and at the same time vote for tax cuts that \nare going to explode the deficit, and the worst thing of all is provide \nthe lion's share of the benefits to those people who are the wealthiest \ncitizens. Maybe this is the difference between the Democrats and the \nRepublicans. If so, I am pleased to have that division reflected in \nthis vote on this sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about higher education. This is \nnear and dear to my heart, because I really do believe that what we do \nhere today has so much to do with whether or not our children or our \ngrandchildren will do well in life and have access to a higher \neducation. Again, coming over from the House Ways and Means Committee, \nChairman Archer's higher education tax cuts are unbelievable. If you \nare in the top 1 percent of income earners--just take a look--you are \ngetting up to $600 by way of a break. If you earn around $59,000, you \nare getting about $100. If you earn around $36,000, you may get $50, \nand below that, below $30,000 a year, you don't get anything at all.\n  What kind of tax breaks are we talking about? I am telling you \nsomething, this tax bill makes the best argument for campaign finance \nreform I have ever seen since I have been here in the Senate. If you \nare a heavy hitter and you are well heeled and you are a player and you \nare over there in that tax committee room and you are lobbying every \nday, you are sure going to get your piece. But I have news for you \nworking Americans. I am bringing this amendment to the floor today \nbecause it is a wake-up call. You are getting the short end of the \nstick.\n  We have been talking about affordable higher education. I must say, \neven the President's proposal is far better than what we are looking at \nright now.\n  I was speaking at Inver Hills Community College last Friday at \ngraduation and talking to the president. It is wonderful. I love going \nto those graduations, because when you go to the community college \ngraduations, always, at least one time, someone will yell out, ``Way to \ngo, grandma.'' These are different students. They are not 19 years old. \nMany are older, many are hard pressed, many come from families with \nincomes under $30,000.\n  If the tax credit isn't refundable, they are not going to get \nanything. So let's stop making claims that just do not hold up, and \nlet's not brag about a tax bill that provides a huge amount of \nassistance to those people least in need. When it comes to those at the \nvery top, this bill provides great breaks. When it comes to middle \nincome, this bill gives a little bit, and when it comes to working \nfamilies, low- and moderate-income families, this bill gives nothing. \nAnd this is called fairness?\n  So, I say to my colleagues, if you vote for this amendment, then I \ncertainly hope that you will not then separate your votes on the \nreconciliation bill next week from the words to which you have ascribed \ntoday. Some people sort of just pooh-pooh sense-of-the-Senate \namendments, and they say it is just a wish list, it doesn't mean \nanything. I say you are on record.\n\n  We have an important piece of legislation out here. I made this a \nsense-of-the-Senate. I am not talking all afternoon on this, but, by \ngolly, we are focused on tax policy, and we are seeing a bill moving \nthrough these committees which is absolutely outrageous. It is no \nwonder that people in cafes in Minnesota and around the country think \nthere has been a hostile takeover of the Government process. When they \nfind out what this bill does and who benefits and who doesn't, they are \ngoing to be furious, and they are going to say the same thing they are \nsaying already, which is, ``Boy, I tell you something, we're locked \nout. Those folks in the Congress, they do a heck of a good job of \nresponding to the well heeled, but they sure don't do a very good job \nof responding to our families.''\n  According to the Treasury Department, on June 17, just look at where \nwe are heading right over here in the Senate Finance Committee. Sixty-\nfive-point-five percent of the benefits of these tax proposals go to \nearners in the top 20 percent; 10 percent goes to those making $50,000 \nor under; 5 percent goes to families making between $40,000 and \n$50,000; 3 percent goes to those making between $30,000 and $40,000; \nand 1.8 percent goes to families between $15,000 and $30,000 a year. I \nam actually surprised that they even got 1.8 percent. And the bottom of \nwage-earners? Nothing. If you earn below $15,000 a year, you get \nnothing.\n  Mr. President, again I say to my colleagues, if you vote for this \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment, that is great, but I don't think you are \ngoing to then be able to vote for what is coming out of the Finance \nCommittee or what is coming out of the Ways and Means Committee, unless \nyou come out here with other data, unless you come out here with \nanother analysis as to what the distributional effects are.\n  If this sense-of-the-Senate is adopted--and I think it will be, or I \nhope it will be--then I will come out with a tougher amendment on the \nDepartment of Defense bill. We are going to have some discussion today \non the floor of the Senate about tax policy. I cannot believe the \nsilence on the floor of the Senate. We are going to have a debate about \nthis. This isn't just going to move through next week quickly and \nsilently, as we do with reconciliation bills. People in the country \nhave a right to know how this is going to affect them, who exactly is \nmaking the decisions, who exactly is going to benefit, and who exactly \ngets the short end of the stick. Working families, you get the short \nend of the stick. Don't you for a moment let anybody tell you that you \nand your children are getting a heck of a lot of assistance. You are \nnot. But, by golly, if you are wealthy and at the very top, you are \ngoing to get a lot by way of assistance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a very fine piece by \nRobert Kuttner in the Washington Post today be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 19, 1997]\n\n                   Contending Over Capital Gains Cuts\n\n                          (By Robert Kuttner)\n\n       For two decades, cutting the capital gains tax has been an \n     object of almost religious fervor for the Republican right. \n     Now the grail seems at last within reach. Only, with the \n     stock market setting new records, the timing is a bit off.\n       The Republican plan would cut the top tax rate on capital \n     gains from 28 percent to 18 percent and phase in indexing of \n     gains for inflation. These and other tax changes would reduce \n     government's revenue by hundreds of billions of dollars over \n     10 years. Given bipartisan obsession with budget balance, the \n     revenue cuts would translate directly into cuts in public \n     outlay--in medical care and countless other public programs.\n       Supposedly, capital gains cuts will help the economy grow. \n     With investment offering greater after-tax rewards, people \n     will save more, invest more and be freer to shift assets to \n     more efficient investments. All of this in turn will make the \n     economy more productive.\n       But here the timing doesn't compute. The stock market, of \n     course, is setting records. It's hard to argue with a \n     straight face that\n\n[[Page S5968]]\n\n     the prospect of paying capital gains tax is deterring much \n     productive investment.\n       Venture capital markets are booming, and new issues are \n     having little difficulty fetching buyers. The overall \n     strength of the American economy and the healthy dollar make \n     U.S. capital markets a magnet for the entire world.\n       Another old chestnut is that inflation overstates the real \n     capital gain. True, but in a low-inflation environment, the \n     effect of inflation on capital gains is not significant. \n     Stock values have doubled in two years, while inflation has \n     gone up less than 6 percent. Taxpayers with serious money in \n     the market are crying all the way to the bank.\n       Moreover, if there is a real problem with U.S. capital \n     markets, it is too much trading and not enough patient \n     investment for the long term. Capital gains cuts would make \n     the stock market even more of a traders' market. Indeed, the \n     present capital gains tax is one of the few forces keeping \n     the stock market from becoming a pure casino.\n       Also, nearly half of the holdings in financial markets are \n     tax-exempt. This includes life insurance portfolios, pension \n     funds, IRAs and Keoughs. Capital gains cuts do nothing to \n     influence these institutional Investors, because they can \n     already trade stocks to their hearts' content and pay no \n     capital gains tax.\n       One other factor makes this a dubious crusade--the Federal \n     Reserve Board. If the capital-gains cutters have a near-\n     messianic zeal, the Fed has an equally religious conviction \n     that the economy can only grow so fast.\n       The economy's supposed speed limit is about 2.5 percent per \n     year. Whenever the growth rate exceeds that pace, the Fed \n     scents inflation and raises interest rates. So even if \n     capital gains cuts did allow more investment and higher \n     potential growth, you could count on the Fed to nip it in the \n     bud.\n       The real issue here is not growth but political power--who \n     gets what from government policy. The Republican majority in \n     Congress wants to reward its well-heeled friends.\n       Despite misleading claims of ``people's capitalism,'' \n     ownership of financial wealth remains astonishingly \n     concentrated. Roughly 40 percent of stocks and bonds are held \n     by the richest one percent of Americans. The next 5 percent \n     own most of the rest. These are the people benefiting from \n     the present uneven boom, and these people will profit from \n     capital gains cuts.\n       The stocks and bonds held on behalf of non-wealthy \n     Americans--mostly in pension plans, annuities and life \n     insurance savings--are already tax-exempt. So a capital gains \n     cut will do nothing for them, unless you think it will boost \n     the value of stocks generally. But a lot of smart people \n     think the market is already dangerously overvalued.\n       The Democrats, rather belatedly, are weighing in with an \n     alternative tax plan. It will cost roughly the same $85 \n     billion in net tax cuts over the next five years (and much \n     less in the long run), but it will allocate the cuts quite \n     differently.\n       The Democrats' plan offers only modest capital gains cuts \n     and spends more on tax relief for families with incomes below \n     $75,000 through a child-tax credit and tax breaks for \n     tuition. It we are to cut taxes at all, given the quest for \n     budget balance, these priorites make much more sense.\n       In today's economy, stockholders are doing just fine, thank \n     you. It's other Americans who are struggling. The case that \n     capital gains relief would trickle down and broaden \n     prosperity just hasn't been made.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I will read a brief \nrelevant section:\n\n       The Republican plan would cut the top tax rate on capital \n     gains from 28 percent to 18 percent and phase in indexing of \n     gains for inflation.\n\n  I believe that is not going to be done on the Senate side, and that \nis an improvement.\n\n       These and other tax changes would reduce Government's \n     revenue by hundreds of billions of dollars over 10 years. \n     Given bipartisan obsession with budget balance, the revenue \n     cuts would translate directly into cuts in public outlay.\n\n  That is another way we can do it with the erosion of revenue, either \nthe deficit explodes or we make further cuts in health care and \neducation.\n\n       Supposedly, capital gains cuts will help the economy grow. \n     With investment offering greater after-tax rewards, people \n     will save more, invest more and be freer to shift assets to \n     more efficient investments. All this in turn will make the \n     economy more productive.\n\n  But, Mr. President, it is not like people's stockholdings are not \ndoing well.\n\n       Stock values have doubled in two years, while inflation has \n     gone up less than 6 percent. Taxpayers with serious money in \n     the market are crying all the way to the bank.\n\n  Who are we trying to help here? Wall Street investors and bondholders \nare doing just great. They are doing fine. I think the real issue is \npolitical power. The real issue is political power. Who has the say? \nWho are the well-heeled? Who are the folks who are well represented? \nBut working families and their children get the short end of the stick.\n  Mr. President, I have a June 16 piece in the New York Times by David \nRosenbaum. I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 16, 1997]\n\n               Tax Bill's Complexities Often Aid Wealthy\n\n                        (By David E. Rosenbaum)\n\n       Washington--``Beset with invisible boomerangs.''\n       That's the way Justice Robert Jackson of the Supreme Court \n     described the hidden dangers of tax laws in a 1952 opinion.\n       The bill the House Ways and Means Committee approved last \n     week is a good illustration of what Jackson was talking \n     about.\n       Take, for example, a provision in the bill that would \n     exempt from capital-gains taxation up to $500,000 of the \n     profits a couple made from the sale of their home but would \n     set the exemption for a single person at $250,000.\n       That caused great mirth among several of the lawyers, \n     lobbyists and accountants who spent breaks in the committee's \n     sessions last week trying to puzzle out unintended \n     consequences in the bill the way other people might work on \n     crosswords.\n       An accountant said he had an elderly client outside \n     Philadelphia who had a house worth more than $1 million and \n     who he knew would look for a marriage of convenience if the \n     $500,000 exemption became law.\n       ``I can just see this guy finding himself an old lady \n     somewhere and getting married and selling his house and then \n     dumping her like a sack of potatoes,'' the accountant said.\n       A lawyer thought of a corollary: ``Say your husband's on \n     his death bed and you've got this house with a big capital \n     gain. You'd better sell it quick before he dies.''\n       These people were mostly joking. But they also saw a more \n     serious consequence that was being overlooked in the section \n     of the bill dealing with capital gains, which are profits \n     from the sale of investments.\n       The bill would lower the top capital-gains tax rate, now 28 \n     percent, to 10 percent for taxpayers with incomes below \n     $41,200 and to 20 percent for those who were better off.\n       The main beneficiaries of the 10 percent rate, the tax \n     experts said, would not be middle-income taxpayers selling a \n     modest amount of mutual funds. Instead, it would be wealthy \n     families who were selling stock to pay for their children's \n     tuition. They could cut the taxes in half by giving their \n     appreciated stock to their children and having the children \n     sell it, rather than selling it themselves and paying the \n     higher tax because of their higher income.\n       That is not the only instance in which the bill would give \n     a better tax break to affluent people sending their children \n     to college than it would give to taxpayers who were less well \n     off.\n       The bill would allow parents to put money into an \n     educational investment account, similar to an individual \n     retirement account, in which interest and dividends would \n     accumulate tax-free. The money could then be withdrawn to pay \n     college expenses.\n       The Democratic staff of the Ways and Means Committee \n     calculated that a family that could afford to invest $50,000 \n     in such an account when a child was 8 years old would save \n     almost $4,000 a year in taxes on a $22,500 annual tuition \n     bill when the child reached college age.\n       Under the bill, a family that could not afford to put aside \n     so much money in advance and had to meet the college costs \n     from income and student loans would get a tax break of only \n     $1,500 a year, and that would be available only for the first \n     two years of college.\n       If all this sounds complicated, it is. That is somewhat \n     embarrassing to the principal author of the bill, Rep. Bill \n     Archer, R-Texas, who is chairman of the Ways and Means \n     Committee and who has made a career of complaining about how \n     complicated the income-tax system is.\n       Archer commented on the paradox in his opening statement to \n     the committee on Thursday evening. Holding up the 422-page \n     bill, he said, ``When you look at a tax bill that's this \n     thick, you know it's not going to simplify things for the \n     taxpayer.''\n       Then to make sure no one thought he had changed his \n     stripes, he quickly added, ``This in no way hinders my \n     ultimate goal of abolishing the income-tax system.''\n       The most ``fabulously complicated'' part of the \n     legislation, said Jeffery Yablon, a prominent tax lawyer in \n     Washington, is the provision that would allow investors to \n     adjust the value of their capital gains to take account of \n     inflation, a process known in tax lingo as indexation.\n       Here is how it would work. Say an investor bought stock for \n     $100, held it for three years and then sold it for $110, and \n     assume the inflation in overall prices in the economy was a \n     total of 9 percent for the three years.\n       Under the current law the investor would report a capital \n     gain of $10. But if the law allowed indexation, the taxable \n     gain would be only $1.\n       Sounds simple enough. But here is the problem. Many people \n     buy stock with borrowed money and take a deduction for the \n     interest they pay on their loan. So if the investor borrowed \n     the money at an interest rate of 4 percent, his tax statement \n     would show a loss of $3 ($1 profit minus $4 deduction), \n     although he had actually made a profit on his investment even \n     after adjusting for inflation.\n\n\n[[Page S5969]]\n\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I quote:\n\n       The bill would lower the top capital-gains tax rate, now 28 \n     percent, to 10 percent for taxpayers with incomes below \n     $41,200 and to 20 percent for those who were better off.\n       The main beneficiaries of the 10 percent rate, the tax \n     experts said, would not be middle-income taxpayers selling a \n     modest amount of mutual funds. Instead, it would be wealthy \n     families who were selling stock to pay for their children's \n     tuition. They could cut the taxes in half by giving their \n     appreciated stock to their children and having the children \n     sell it, rather than selling it themselves and paying the \n     higher tax because of their higher income.\n       That is not the only instance in which the bill would give \n     a better tax break to affluent people sending their children \n     to college than it would give to taxpayers who were less well \n     off.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, this happens every way you look at it.\n  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities talks about the children's \ntax credit. I don't know what is going to happen. I understand Chairman \nArcher and the Republicans are changing their minds. Good. The more we \nspeak out, the better chance we have of other people changing their \nminds. That is why I am on the floor today.\n  The Senate did an analysis based on data from the Congressional \nBudget Office that show that the child credit, given where it was \nheading, where EITC is essentially used to offset it, that there are 28 \nmillion children, 2 of every 5, who will receive no child tax credit \nbecause their incomes would not be high enough to qualify. Because \ntheir incomes won't be high enough to qualify? Unbelievable.\n  You have a tax bill that is going to give a child tax credit, all in \nthe name of helping families, but not if you are in the bottom 40 \npercent of the population. Unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable.\n  Let me just simply go back to this amendment, because I have been \nhere now long enough to realize what I think is happening, and I just \nwant to be very honest with my colleagues, all of whom I appreciate \nwhether or not we agree or disagree on other things. I bring this \namendment to the floor to essentially sound the alarm, because we have \ntax bills that are absolutely unbelievable. There is no standard of \nfairness.\n  Ninety-nine percent of the people in any cafe in any of our States \nwould say, ``What? No, can't be; it can't be. We were thinking about \ntax cuts that would provide us with some relief. You mean, this is \ngoing to people with incomes over $400,000 a year and over $200,000 a \nyear, and they get the lion's share of the benefits and hardly anything \ncomes to us, those of us where both are working and we are making \n$35,000 a year? Say what? No, can't be, Senator Wellstone.''\n  Well, it is.\n  Or families are going to be saying in Minnesota, ``Wait a minute, I \nheard higher education was going to be more affordable. Wait a minute, \nyou are saying to me now basically folks with IRA's are going to get \nthe breaks and the breaks will mainly go to high-income people? And, by \nthe way, the tax credits aren't going to be refundable, so if we are \nmaking $28,000 a year we'll be cut out?'' I meet these students all the \ntime at community colleges. You have a woman or a man, she is 40, he is \n45, they are going back to school, but their income is $28,000. They \nare not going to get a thing, hardly a thing. People are going to say, \n``What? That's not what we understood was going to be the case.''\n  So, I ask my colleagues to bring out other data, other charts--I \nwould be delighted for them to do so. I have about 2 minutes remaining. \nLet me read this again--\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that any tax legislation \n     enacted--\n\n  Just for staff who are listening or colleagues listening--\n\n     by the Congress this year should meet a standard of fairness \n     in its distributional impact on upper, middle and \n     lower income taxpayers * * *\n\n  By the way, I don't think anybody in the Congress will say middle-\nincome taxpayers are $250,000 a year. We all know what we are talking \nabout here:\n\n     and that any such legislation should not disproportionately \n     benefit the highest income taxpayers.\n\n  If my colleagues vote for this sense-of-the-Senate amendment, I will \nbe delighted. Then I will come back with a slightly tougher one on the \nnext bill, and if I get a strong vote for that, I will be delighted as \nwell. But I want to tell you something, sense of the Senate or not, you \nare on record. You are on record and people in the country are going to \nbe taking a close look at what we are about, and they are going to ask \nthe question whether this tax relief is going to us or is it basically \ngoing to the same folks that all too often are the ones who always get \nthe lion's share of the benefits.\n  This is all about political power, who decides, who benefits and who \nsacrifices. The folks who are benefiting are at the very top of the \neconomic ladder, and the folks who are really paying the price are the \npeople most in need of the assistance.\n  So, we will have this vote later on. Maybe people may vote against \nit, in which case you don't agree with this proposition. If you vote \nfor it, don't think that your vote is just symbolic. I will have a \ntougher amendment on the next bill and all next week, any way I can, I \nwill be talking about what you are on record for and how that is \nopposed to what is coming out of these tax committees.\n  Mr. President, I assume Democrats are going to have an alternative, \nin which case it will be good, because then people will say there are \ndifferences between the parties and those differences matter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think that this debate is healthy for \nthe body politic. People don't want to see us bitterly angry, but they \ndo want to see us genuinely debate issues that directly affect them and \ntheir children and their families. I am telling you something, this \namendment, that is what this amendment is all about. These tax bills, \nthat is what they should be about.\n  I thank my colleagues for their courtesy.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the disposition of the two amendments that we have been \ntalking about, that the bill be read a third time, and the Senate \nproceed to a vote on passage of S. 858, as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Also, for the information of all Senators, this now means \nthat all Members can expect up to three consecutive rollcall votes \nbeginning around 2:45 this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, the committee has received the Congressional Budget \nOffice cost estimate for S. 858. CBO found that the public bill would \nnot affect direct spending or receipts in 1998; thus, pay-as-you-go \nprocedures would not apply to it. In addition, the Unfunded Mandates \nReform act [UMRA] excludes from application of the act legislative \nprovisions that are necessary for the national security. CBO determined \nthat all of the provisions of this bill either fit within that \nexclusion or do not contain intergovernmental mandates as defined by \nUMRA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Congressional Budget \nOffice cost estimate for Senate bill 858, the intelligence \nauthorization bill, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 1997.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 858, the \n     Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Dawn \n     Sauter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E.

On that limited basis, CBO estimates that enacting \n     S. 858 would result in additional spending of $91 million \n     over the 1998-2002 period, assuming appropriation of the \n     authorized amounts. The unclassified portion of the bill \n     would not affect direct spending or receipts in 1998; thus \n     pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply to it. The Unfunded \n     Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) excludes from application of the \n     act legislative provisions that are necessary for the \n     national security. CBO has determined that all of the \n     provisions of this bill either fit within that exclusion or \n     do not contain intergovernmental mandates as defined by UMRA.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary effect of S. 858 is shown in the following table. \n     CBO was unable to obtain the necessary information to \n     estimate the costs for the entire bill because parts are \n     classified at a level above clearances held by CBO employees. \n     The estimated costs, therefore, reflect only the costs of the \n     unclassified portion of the bill.\n       The bill would authorize appropriations of $91 million for \n     the Community Management Account and $197 million for CIARDS. \n     The funding for CIARDS would cover retirement costs \n     attributable to military service and various unfunded \n     liabilities. The payment to CIARDS is considered mandatory, \n     and the authorization under this bill would be the same as \n     assumed in the CBO baseline.\n       For purposes of this estimate, CBO assumed that S. 858 will \n     be enacted by October 1, 1997, and that the full amounts \n     authorized will be appropriated for fiscal year 1998. Outlays \n     are estimated according to historical spending patterns for \n     intelligence programs.\n\n                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 1997   1998   1999   2000   2001   2002\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nSpending under current law:\n    Estimated authorization       102      0      0      0      0      0\n     level \\1\\................\n    Estimated outlays.........     95     46     22      5      0      0\nProposed changes:\n    Estimated authorization         0     91      0      0      0      0\n     level....................\n    Estimated outlays.........      0     50     23     14      5      0\nSpending under S. 858:\n    Estimated authorization       102     91      0      0      0      0\n     level \\1\\................\n    Estimated outlays.........     95     96     45     19      5     0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 1997 level is the amount appropriated for that year.\n \nNote: The costs of this legislation would fall within budget function\n  050 (national defense).\n\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: The Unfunded \n     Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) excludes from application of the \n     act legislative provisions that are necessary for the \n     national security.

I have no quarrel with the \namendment, the Wellstone amendment. I do not believe it belongs on the \nSenate authorization bill dealing with intelligence activities, but I \nhave no opposition to the content of it or the substance of it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the Senate is faced with an issue as \nold as the Republic itself. It is the continuing debate between the \npublic's right to know and the Government's need to retain information \nonly unto itself. It is an old argument, but it is one that has largely \nbeen settled through time.\n  We have decided as a country that the best source of good judgment in \nthis Nation remains with the people and that they should be trusted \nwith the public welfare in having a maximum exposure to the facts and \njudgments that govern our society.\n  Indeed, it was that wisdom which led to the first amendment to the \nConstitution itself, and equally significantly as it led to article I, \nsection 9, clause 7 of the Constitution, which reads:\n\n       * * * a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and \n     Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time \n     to time.\n\n  For a long time, Mr. President, despite these national ambitions, \nthis consistency with our greatest national principles, we as a \nCongress determined this was not possible because of the dangers of \nworld war and the continuing struggle in the cold war.\n  It was the judgment of this Congress that even the total aggregate \namount of expenditures for our intelligence agencies, including the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, would remain private and not be published \nand shared with the people.\n  The end of the cold war has raised this question anew. Not only for \nthe intelligence community, but indeed for all of the U.S. Government. \nAnd most of this Government has responded appropriately.\n  The Defense Department began to share information about programs it \nwas developing, technologies that it possessed. Weapons hitherto \nunknown were shared with the press and the public. And perhaps \npredictably that is why since 1980, according to the bipartisan Brown \nCommission, defense expenditures of the United States in real terms \nhave declined by 4 percent.\n  Accountability by the people themselves led this Congress to adjust \nour national priorities to deal with the new emerging security \nsituation internationally. No doubt, an equal reflection of the fact \nthe intelligence community retained privacy of its budget is that the \nbipartisan Brown Commission found that since 1980 the intelligence \ncommunity's budget, in adjusted terms, increased by 80 percent.\n  Mr. President, what we are facing today in honest debate can no \nlonger be concluded to be whether or not adversaries of the United \nStates will gain information about our intentions and abilities of our \nintelligence community, because our adversaries have neither the means \nto respond nor probably the ability in all cases to understand the \noperations of our intelligence community. The only people being \nshielded from this information are not adversaries, but the taxpayers \nof the United States.\n  Indeed, general accountings, in estimates, of American intelligence \nexpenditures appear in all of our major newspapers. Only the exact \naggregate numbers are denied, and not denied to adversaries; they are \ndenied to the people of this country who need to make informed \njudgments as voters, as taxpayers about our national priorities.\n  So I rise today with an amendment that this Senate has considered \nbefore. It is simply this: To publish, not the details of the CIA \nexpenditures, not to reveal their programs, to share no numbers and no \nestimates on any technology, any element of spending of the \nintelligence community but one, the total aggregate amount of money \nspent in the U.S. Government for the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  This one number would allow the American people, as an informed \nelectorate, to make their judgments on a\n\n[[Page S5971]]\n\ncomparative basis about whether or not, as compared to defense, social \nprograms, foreign assistance, and the intelligence community, this \nCongress is making the right judgments.\n  And yet, it will be argued that our adversaries would have this \ninformation and use it for their own purposes. I understood that \nargument when we were concerned that the Russians, the Soviet Union \nwith all of its capabilities, as our principal adversary would have \nthis information and could adjust their own intelligence programs to \nrespond.\n  There is no Soviet Union; and the cold war has ended. The decline and \nchange of our national defense expenditures give the best testament to \nthe fact that this Senate has accepted that fact.\n  Now we face new adversaries, terrorist organizations, a list of \npariah states from North Korea to Libya, to Iraq and Iran. And so the \nquestion begs itself, what if these nations possessed this one \naggregate number, of what value would it be to them? By most press \nestimates, total expenditures of the Central Intelligence Agency are \nnot only more than the intelligence expenditures of each of those \ncountries, it is more than all those countries combined.\n  Indeed, the United States, by most published estimates, spends more \non its intelligence community than the gross national product of every \none of these potential adversaries of the United States. And so for \nthose who will argue that we cannot share this information with the \nAmerican people, I ask, what is it North Korea would do with this \ninformation or Libya or Iran? What possible change would they have in \ntheir own programs or their own expenditures? They have not the means \nto respond or to change.\n  I repeat in my argument, Mr. President, as I began. There is only one \npeople on this Earth that need this information to make important \njudgments about their future who are being shielded from it, and it is \nthe people of the United States.\n  Mr. President, if this argument seems familiar to Members of the \nSenate, it is because it is not new. This Senate voted on this question \nin 1991, a sense-of-the-Senate resolution in 1992, and again in 1993.\n  Indeed, most Members of the Senate who in a matter of moments will \nvote on this question have already voted in previous years to share \nthis information with the American people.\n  Eighty members of the House of Representatives have cosponsored \nlegislation to do so.\n  The Federation of American Scientists have gone to Federal court to \ncompel its release on constitutional principles.\n  But perhaps most significantly, the President of the United States \nhimself, our Commander in Chief, who has the ultimate authority for the \nsecurity of the United States, suggested if the Congress would concur, \nhe would release this information.\n  This Senate on previous occasions has confirmed for the directorship \nfor the Central Intelligence Agency Admiral Turner, Mr. Gates, Mr. \nDeutch. Each of those CIA Directors themselves have argued that \nconcealing this information serves no purpose and it should be shared \nwith the people.\n  This Congress has disagreed on this issue before. And so a bipartisan \ncommission, chaired by former Secretary of Defense Brown, and by our \nformer Senate colleague, Senator Rudman, addressed this question in \ntheir own report. And they urged the public release of this \ninformation.\n  To my colleagues, when you have voted on this question previously, \nwhen Directors of the Central Intelligence Agency, the President of the \nUnited States, and a commission charged for this very purpose argues \nthat this single individual aggregate amount of spending should be \nreleased, by what possible logic do we continue to shield the American \npeople from these facts?\n  But if, Mr. President, in their individual judgment my colleagues are \nstill convinced that because of the danger of these new pariah states \nand the rise of international terrorism, this expenditure must be \nconcealed from our people, I urge them to consider the fact that we are \nalso not the first of the allied nations to face this judgment.\n  The British Parliament has had this debate. And Britain decided its \npeople should share with this information. The Canadian Parliament, the \nAustralian Parliament, and perhaps most significant, the Israeli \nKnesset--no nation on Earth is faced with the threat of terrorism more \nthan Israel--but they have decided, in spite of the fact that their \nprogram cannot conceivably have our capabilities nor the relative \nadvantage versus their adversaries as we face as opposed to our own, \nthey share this information with the people of Israel.\n  We remain the exception.\n  Fifty years since the Second World War when a judgment was made that \nfor national security, a judgment appropriately made for national \nsecurity, that this information was best concealed, we retain this last \nrelic of the cold war.\n  Mr. President, this is a national policy to conceal the gross \nexpenditures of the Central Intelligence Agency that has lost its \nrationale. It is time for this Senate once again, as it has on three \nprevious occasions, to vote to allow the sharing of this information \nwith the American people. But we do so not because we believe it is a \ncompromise with national security that has become necessary, but \nbecause indeed many of us believe it would enhance our national \nsecurity.\n  Perhaps most significantly in the Brown report was a conclusion that, \nin the commission's words, ``Most intelligence agencies seem to lack a \nresource strategy apart from what is reflected in the President's 6-\nyear budget projection. Indeed, until the intelligence community \nreforms its budget process, it is poorly positioned to implement \nstrategies.''\n  Efficiency, accountability, proper judgments for national security, \nlike all other aspects of the governance of the United States, are best \nmade under the careful scrutiny of the people themselves. National \nsecurity is not only the exception, it may be the best rule. It is the \nlives of the people of this country themselves--from terrorism and from \na new group of potential adversaries--that we are charged with \nprotecting. Allow the people of the United States to participate in \nthis judgment.\n  I urge my colleagues, once again, as you have done on several \nprevious occasions, to join with the previous leadership of the Central \nIntelligence Agency in concurrence with the commission report that you \ncommissioned to be done, and allow this single number, this one gross \nexpenditure of the Central Intelligence Agency's budget, to be released \nto the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Torricelli amendment. \nI oppose the public disclosure of the overall level of intelligence \nfunding as proposed by the amendment offered by the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. President, it does not, I repeat, it does not take an act of \nCongress to declassify the top line of the intelligence budget as this \namendment would do if adopted. The President of the United States has \nalways had and has today the authority to disclose this figure and has \nalways chosen to keep it classified.\n  Determining classification is the responsibility and is the duty of \nthe Chief Executive of the United States, the President, who is also, \nas we know, the Commander in Chief. Presidents Truman through Clinton \nhave determined this figure is to remain classified, and I believe we \nshould not overrule that judgment.\n  The purpose of maintaining a premier intelligence capability is to \nsave lives and to prevent and, if we get in them, win wars. The \nfoundation of an effective intelligence capability, as we all know, is \nsecrecy. Secrecy protects not only the information that we collect, but \nalso the brave people that put themselves at risk to do the collection \nof it. We are an open and a free society that generally abhors secret \ndealings by our Government. But in the case of intelligence collection \nand analysis, secrecy, I believe, is absolutely necessary.\n  Some of my colleagues argue that the American people have a right to \nknow how much of their money is being spent to defend their Nation's \nsecurity through intelligence-gathering operations. I assert today \nthat, through its elected officials, the public interests are being \neffectively served.\n\n[[Page S5972]]\n\nAs U.S. Senators, all of us we have been elected to represent the \ninterests of our constituents and to act on their behalf. Therefore, \nthe American people do know, in a sense, how much we spend on national \nsecurity because their elected representatives know. As on many other \nissues, Mr. President, our constituents have a voice, and it speaks \nthrough the Senators and Representatives and the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Some of my colleagues will argue that disclosing the total budget \namount will instill public confidence and enable the American people to \nknow what portion of the Federal budget is dedicated to intelligence \nactivities. It appears there is general agreement that the details of \nthe intelligence budget should remain classified, however. I believe \nthat the total budget figure is of no use to anyone but to those who \nwish to do us harm.\n  For example, what do the numbers tell our adversaries or potential \nadversaries in the world? In any given year, perhaps, not a great deal. \nBut while watching the changes in the budget over time, and using \ninformation gathered by their own intelligence activities, \nsophisticated analysts can indeed learn a great deal.\n  Trend analysis, Mr. President, you are familiar with, is a technique \nthat our own analysts use to make predictions and to reach conclusions. \nThere are hostile foreign intelligence agencies all over the world that \nare focused solely on gathering every bit of information that they can \nabout our own intelligence-gathering operations and our capabilities. \nTheir ultimate goal is to exploit weaknesses and to deny access and to \ndeceive our own intelligence collectors. Denial and deception is \nalready a serious concern for the intelligence community, and providing \nour enemies or potential enemies with any insight as to what we spend \non intelligence will only make it worse, not better.\n  Others will argue that the total budget figure is already in the \npublic domain, and we should just acknowledge it. Mr. President, we \nnever, never confirm or deny classified information that may have been \npublished somewhere or spoken by someone. Classified information, as \nyou well know, remains classified even if it wrongly makes it into the \npublic domain.\n  We will also, Mr. President, hear from those who say disclosure is \nrequired by the statement and account clause of the Constitution, \narticle 1, section 9, clause 7. Mr. President, I assert today that the \ncurrent practice is fully consistent with the Constitution, and it \ncarries forward a tradition of secret expenditures dating back more \nthan 200 years. As a matter of fact, the Supreme Court of the United \nStates observed in the U.S. versus Richardson case, ``Historical \nanalysis of clause 7 suggests that it was intended to permit secrecy in \noperations.''\n  Further, Mr. President, the figure is available to all Members of \nCongress, the U.S. Senate and, the U.S. House to review.\n  As I reviewed the debate on this topic, I found a statement by my \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, in 1993, with which I \ntotally agree, and which is appropriate today. Senator Chafee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island, said, disclosing the top line \nbudget figure would only ``frustrate a curious public and politicize \nthe intelligence budget.''\n  He pointed out further, ``What many proponents of disclosure want to \ndo is to put a bull's-eye on the intelligence budget and hold it up as \na target for public ridicule, recognizing full well that we cannot \nengage in a meaningful public debate regarding intelligence programs.''\n  I assure you, Mr. President, once the overall number has been \nreleased, there would be efforts to amend the overall funding for \nintelligence in open session. I do not believe it would be good for the \nSenate, the House, or the American people. Otherwise, I believe \nPresident Clinton and Presidents before him would have already \ndeclassified the number which they have the right to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I first thank my colleagues who have \njoined me in this effort today, most significantly, Senator Specter of \nPennsylvania, who has led this effort previously and makes this a \ngenuinely bipartisan effort to share this information with the American \npeople, Senator Bumpers of Arkansas, who has argued so passionately on \nthis cause previously, and, of course, the ranking member of the \nintelligence committee, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, I know that many Government agencies would have liked \nthe right to keep the information of their expenditures on a \nproprietary basis. This logic must have occurred to the Defense \nDepartment. Indeed, it was difficult for the Defense Department, at the \nend of the cold war, to begin to share some of the programs, exhibit \nsome of the technology and the assets it possessed that previously had \nremained secret.\n  This Congress and the leadership of this Government made a judgment \nthat the people could not make the proper decisions about their elected \nrepresentatives and we could not make the proper judgments for them \nwithout complete access to information. I want to remind my colleagues, \nwe have faced this issue previously in 3 different years since the end \nof the cold war, and on each of those occasions this Senate has voted, \neven if contained in other legislation, either by law or by a sense of \nthe Senate, to permit the publishing of this one single number. If we \nfail to do so today, it will be a change in the position of this \nSenate. It will be an inconsistency by a majority of Senators who \nserved in this institution in those previous years.\n  By what logic would we now change our minds? Because it will endanger \nan employee of the Central Intelligence Agency? On what basis and by \nwhat theory would anyone be endangered because they knew a total amount \nof money spent by the intelligence community? Because an adversary will \nchange their plans, initiate a new program, compete with the \nintelligence community of the United States--when I have demonstrated \nthat every and each potential adversary of the United States has a \ngross national product that is, according to published reports, smaller \nthan the gross expenditures of the American intelligence communities?\n  Mr. President, I conclude as I began: There is only one group of \npeople who have real need of this information upon which to make \ndecisions, and it is the taxpayers of the United States. This is the \nlast cloud of secrecy necessitated by war, cold war and struggle, that \nshould be removed by this Government. My colleagues have decided to do \nso before, but we have been frustrated in conference, and our will has \nnot been done. It can be done now.\n  I urge an affirmative vote to allow the public release of the \naggregate expenditures of the United States intelligence community, a \nsingle number, published each year. The people of our country can make \na good and accurate judgment.\n  I want to thank again Senator Specter, Senator Bumpers, and Senator \nKerrey for joining me in this and each of my colleagues who have voted \npreviously on a majority basis to allow its release.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in the strongest possible opposition \nto the Torricelli amendment. My grandmother used to say there are some \nthings that are better not to know, and that is the case with certain \nhighly classified information that is important to the national \nsecurity of American citizens. One of those things is how much money is \nspent on our intelligence activities, information which is very useful \nto our opponents, and not particularly useful to the average American \ntaxpayer.\n  The public's right to know, as has been pointed out by the \ndistinguished chairman of the Intelligence Committee, is adequately \nprotected by our elected representatives. That is why we have special \nprovisions of law, Mr. President, that call for certain Members of \nCongress only--not every Member of Congress, but only certain Members \nof Congress--to be apprised of certain operations and certain details \nof our intelligence operations.\n  For example, in an operation such as that which nabbed the terrorist \nMir Aimal Kansi just last Saturday, it was known to only a handful of \nour elected representatives because that is what the law provides. The \nAmerican people did not need to know that, and, indeed,\n\n[[Page S5973]]\n\nit would have jeopardized American lives, the people who were involved \nin this operation, had there been more widespread knowledge. There is a \nreason why this information is not public.\n  The irony is, Mr. President, that revealing the top-line number, the \naggregate amount we spend on intelligence, would be of very little use \nto the average American debating whether or not it is the proper \nnumber, but it means a great deal to clever potential adversaries who \ndo trend analysis and extrapolation from year to year to see whether or \nnot there are changes and who try to determine whether or not we have, \ntherefore, made certain commitments to our intelligence that would be \nof interest to. So on the one hand it doesn't help the average American \nmuch. On the other hand, it could easily help opponents a great deal. \nUnfortunately, there is no way for us to defend that budget. If the top \nline is $10 billion, or $100 billion, or $50 billion, just \nhypothetically, whatever number, somebody might say, ``I don't think \nthat is a good number.'' How do you defend that number without getting \ninto all of the sensitive, classified information that comprises the \nbudget? So it is not a good idea.\n\n  No other friend or ally of the United States reveals the amount that \nit spends on intelligence. It would set a terrible, terrible precedent, \nMr. President, because right after the aggregate budget was revealed, \neverybody would realize that, to the average American, that doesn't say \nmuch and so the calls would be very quick for more information. ``You \ngave us the top line; how about the categories on which it is spent?\"\n  This is a slippery slope, Mr. President. Reveal the first number and \nit will be just a matter of minutes before there will be a call to \nreveal more information. As a matter of fact, our colleague from New \nJersey, in effect, just did that by saying that ``in the area of \ndefense spending we have determined that we need complete access to \ninformation,'' to use his quotation. And the defense budget is known. \nYes, the defense budget is known, but there is still much about defense \nthat is highly classified. That is the way it needs to be.\n  Another argument of our friend from New Jersey is that there have \nbeen leaks and there is no reason to continue to withhold the \ninformation. Of course, the proper policy when there are leaks is to \nfind them. They can be very damaging to our national security. The \nanswer is not to, therefore, let all the information out. The object is \nto try to prevent those leaks from causing more harm.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, if this is such a good idea, one \nwonders why previous Presidents haven't done it. They have the \nauthority and power to do it, and they have not done it because they \nknow full well that it is not the right thing to do. I just suggest \nthat it would be highly, highly dangerous to the national security \ninterests of the United States, to the lives of Americans who literally \nput their lives on the line to work operations that are very dangerous \nthat the public never hears about, because, obviously, they can't, or \nit would compromise the sources and methods by which we obtain \ninformation. It would be very dangerous to these people if our \npotential adversaries could soon begin to pick apart the budget and \nlearn what kind of capabilities we have to use against them.\n  I urge, in the strongest possible terms, that we vote against the \nTorricelli amendment and urge my colleagues, when we have that vote, to \ndo so.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Ohio as much \ntime as he might need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the \namendment proposed by my colleague and friend from New Jersey. It is an \namendment that would disclose the total intelligence budget.\n  Mr. President, intelligence budgets and programs are kept secret for \na good reason: to keep our enemies--and, yes, we still do have \nenemies--from knowing how much we are spending on intelligence and, of \ncourse, on what programs. Mr. President, disclosure of the total budget \nmight well be the first step leading to a demand to disclose individual \nagency budgets, as my colleague from Arizona has just stated, and \ninevitably to disclose specific programs.\n  Mr. President, the reality is that a single budget figure with no \nadditional detail or disclosure of capabilities does not, in my view, \nprovide a sufficient basis for a meaningful public debate. Therefore, I \nthink there would be pressure to disclose more. But such a disclosure \nwould only help our enemies. It would provide them with vital \ninformation on our Nation's resource allocations. It would undermine \nour commitment to early warning for our policymakers, as well as our \nability to provide our military the intelligence information that is \nessential to making them the best in the world.\n  President Clinton--as the chairman of the committee has already \npointed out--has the authority to disclose the total budget on his own. \nHowever, he has not done so. President Clinton joins every President \nsince Harry Truman in making that same policy decision--that it is not \nin the best interest of this country to disclose this dollar figure.\n  Mr. President, the practice of keeping the budget secret is fully \nconsistent with the Constitution, and it carries forward a tradition of \nsecret expenditures dating back more than 200 years. The Supreme Court \nobserved in U.S. versus Richardson that ``historical analysis of clause \n7 suggests that it was intended to permit secrecy in operations.'' It \nis clear, Mr. President, the Constitution provides for this secrecy.\n  This intelligence figure is available to all Senators, as is the \nentire classified schedule of authorizations and classified annex to \nthe Intelligence Authorization Act. Members of the Intelligence \nCommittee, members of the Armed Services Committee, members of the \nAppropriations Committees in both the House and the Senate do provide \nvigorous oversight of the intelligence community and of its budget. \nThere is full scrutiny through the people's elected representatives, \nwhile at the same time providing protection for intelligence \noperations.\n  Mr. President, to disclose the budget would break with tradition. I \nbelieve it would help our enemies and it would not provide the public \nwith any meaningful information. For these reasons, Mr. President, I \nurge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  I believe that little can be gained, but much can be lost over time \nby this type of disclosure.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleague from Alabama.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I yield the remainder of our time to Senator Specter \nof Pennsylvania, and I thank him for his leadership.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I support public disclosure of the \noverall funding law and would start with the language of the \nConstitution, which I believe supports that disclosure:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular \n     Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all \n     public Money shall be published from time to time.\n\n  On the base, that calls for public disclosure. I know some courts \nhave limited that interpretation to what Congress says. But I believe, \nas a constitutional matter, disclosure ought to be made. And beyond \nthat, as a public policy matter for the Congress, disclosure ought to \nbe made.\n  In the 8 years I served on the Senate Intelligence Committee--2 years \nas chairman--it seemed to me that much too much is kept secret, and \ndisclosing the overall amount is not to disclose the programs. We have \nseen terrorism as the instrumentally for political purposes, replacing \nwar. Intelligence is very important to fight terrorism, and I believe \nif the American people knew how much money was being spent on \nintelligence gathering, the people would want more spent and not less.\n  Just yesterday, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee took \nissue with the way the Central Intelligence Agency is being run, saying \nit is not being run effectively. Much too much is being kept secret, \nMr. President. We can protect important sources and methods and means \nfrom being disclosed, but still have a great deal more candor for the \nAmerican people about what is going on in intelligence. When we look at \nthe budget of the CIA or the\n\n[[Page S5974]]\n\nFBI for domestic intelligence, those are items which ought to be \nsubject to public debate. The public ought to be demanding more. The \npublic ought to be receiving more. As a very basic first step, it is my \nsense--having some familiarity with the Intelligence Committee \noperations and overall budget--that the funding level ought to be \ndisclosed.\n  I thank the Chair and inquire how much of the 2\\1/2\\ minutes is left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 19 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I leave that to the sponsor of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I believe I have consumed all of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 seconds.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. The 10 seconds I have remaining I yield to the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Senator \nTorricelli to declassify the aggregate intelligence budget. This body \nhas been on record a number of times over the years as supporting \ndisclosure of the intelligence budget total. Last year the Intelligence \nAuthorization Act as reported by the SSCI and adopted by the Senate \nrequired the President to disclose in his annual budget submission to \nCongress each year the total amount appropriated for all intelligence \nand intelligence-related activities, that is, the total of NFIP, JMIP, \nand TIARA, in the current fiscal year and the total amount requested \nfor the next fiscal year. As has happened on each previous occasion \nthat the Senate has voted in favor of disclosure, the provision in last \nyear's bill ultimately was dropped in conference with the House.\n  The Senate's support for this position dates back at least to the \nChurch committee, in 1976. The following year the Select Committee on \nIntelligence was established and the members of that committee voted in \n1977 for public disclosure of the aggregate intelligence budget. In the \nyears since, the Senate has regularly voted to disclose the aggregate \namount of intelligence spending.\n  Senators will recall that in 1994 we chartered a commission to \nconduct a comprehensive review of American intelligence. Part of the \nstatutory mandate of this commission was to study the issue of budget \ndisclosure and resolve it once and for all. The Aspin-Brown Commission \nunanimously recommended that the total amounts appropriated and \nrequested be disclosed. Senators Warner and Rudman and other \ntraditional opponents agreed. In fact, Senator Rudman and former \nDefense Secretary Brown would declassify the CIA budget as well in \norder to show it is only a fraction of the overall budget.\n  Public disclosure of total budget amount for intelligence is \nsymbolically important: it sends a message that intelligence is a \nlegitimate and open governmental function. It helps to instill public \nconfidence and enables the American people to know what proportion of \nthe entire Federal budget is spent on intelligence, as compared with \nother functions. Moreover, there is an argument that disclosure is \nconstitutionally required by the statement and account clause of the \nConstitution (Art. I, Sec. 9, clause 7), which provides that ``A \nregular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all \npublic money shall be published from time to time.''\n  Disclosure of the aggregate budget amount will not harm our national \nsecurity. Disclosure of the top-line number is not sufficient to alert \nadversaries to deployment of new systems; spending on new systems \ndoesn't occur in 1 year, it's stretched out over a number of years. \nThere has been no history of conspicuous spikes in intelligence \nspending. It is interesting to note that our major allies disclose \ntheir intelligence budgets. The United Kingdom recently decided to \ndisclose the total budgets for MI-5 and MI-6.\n  The reality is that this number is already in the public domain in \napproximate terms. The intelligence budget is already widely reported \nin the press. A congressional committee released the actual numbers for \nall agencies a couple of years ago by mistake. Even efforts to talk \naround the budget numbers, by using percentages, for example, instead \nof actual numbers, have given industrious reporters and analysts \nsufficient information to extrapolate the dollar figures. Knowledge of \nthe top-line does not give an adversary useful information about \nintelligence targets, sources, or methods.\n  Nor has the de facto disclosure of the budget total taken us down the \nso-called slippery slope of more detailed disclosures. In fact, I \nbelieve this disclosure will actually strengthen our ability to protect \nvital national secrets by bolstering the credibility of our \nclassification decisions--officially revealing the budget total tells \nthe American public that we are using classification to protect vital \nnational secrets, not to conceal information that might be inconvenient \nto defend. And I think it would not be difficult to defend the size of \nthe intelligence budget, given the complex world we live in today.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I support this amendment and urge \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I will try to be brief.\n  Mr. President, as former Director Woolsey of the CIA once said, ``It \nis impossible to conduct a meaningful debate on the effects of such \namendments without explaining the component parts of the intelligence \nbudget.''\n  Think about that a minute. How much is spent for the CIA? How much is \nspent for signals intelligence? How much are we spending on satellites, \nand so on?\n  It is that discussion which creates the likelihood of disclosure of \nsensitive intelligence information that would be of benefit to our \nadversaries.\n  Mr. President, there are many opportunities to debate and discuss the \ndetails of the intelligence budget among the Intelligence, Armed \nServices, and Appropriations Committees. We all do this. This is not a \ntopic that goes unexamined by the people's representatives in the \nSenate or the House.\n  Mr. President, the Senate Intelligence Committee was established to \nensure vigorous oversight of our intelligence activities. I believe \nmyself that the committee faithfully represents the American people. \nOur goal is to maintain a robust intelligence capability while ensuring \nthat our intelligence activities are conducted in accordance with \nAmerican values and constitutional principles.\n  The members of the committee take their responsibilities very \nseriously, and I pledge to the American people that we will continue to \nrepresent the best interests of this Nation.\n  Mr. President, our intelligence capabilities are a critical national \nasset and, as chairman of the committee, I will not support an effort \nto disclose classified information when there is no compelling argument \nto do so. Therefore, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the \nTorricelli amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FORD.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 415\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Specter and Senator \nKerrey for joining me in this effort. We asked the Senate to do that \nwhich you have done three times before, that which three previous \nDirectors of the Central Intelligence Agency have endorsed, that which \nthe Brown Commission, in a bipartisan review of this issue, has \nendorsed--that is to share with the American people and the Members of \nthis Congress the total aggregate amount spent on intelligence \nactivities by the U.S. Government. No details, no programs, no internal \nfacts--one aggregate number, so the people can make their own judgments \nwhether the direction and the amount of intelligence spending is \nappropriate and proper for the U.S. Government. I urge an affirmative \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I oppose the public disclosure of the \noverall level of intelligence funding as proposed by the Torricelli \namendment. It does not take an act of Congress to declassify the top \nline of intelligence spending. The President of the United States has \nalways had the authority to disclose this figure, and has always chosen \nto keep it classified. Determining the classification is the \nresponsibility and, I believe, the duty of the Chief Executive and \nCommander in Chief. Presidents Truman through Clinton have determined \nthat this figure is to remain classified and we should not overrule \nthat judgment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time. I ask my colleagues to vote no on \nthe Torricelli amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate now turn to the consideration of \nCalendar No. 88, S. 936, the Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 936) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year \n     1998 for military activities of the Department of Defense, \n     for military construction, and for defense activities of the \n     Department of Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths for \n     such fiscal year for the Armed Forces, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, then, \nthe Senate is now considering the defense authorization bill. Several \namendments are expected to be offered to the bill; therefore, votes can \nbe expected throughout the remainder of the afternoon and into the \nnight. We will have to get started and see what amendments are \navailable, and then we will expect some votes, but we would like to get \nas much work done today as we can. And that could take us into the \nnight.\n  Also, I want to make clear that we do intend for the Senate to resume \nconsideration of the bill on Friday. I do expect rollcall votes on \namendments relative to the DOD bill, at least until the noon hour on \nFriday. But, again, that will depend on exactly what amendments are \npending. We recognize Senators do have commitments to go back to their \nStates tomorrow afternoon, and we will try to accommodate that.\n  But I do think we need to get some work done on this important \nlegislation. A lot of effort has gone into working out a way to be able \nto bring the DOD authorization bill to the floor. I think we can make \nsome progress, and I encouraged the ranking member and the chairman to \nsee right away if they could get some finite list of amendments that \nmight want to be offered and be considered. Maybe we can get some \nunderstanding of when we could get a final vote on this legislation \nwhen we come back after the recess.\n  Next week, we again do intend to bring up the reconciliation spending \nbill on Monday, as I discussed with the acting minority leader, and we \nhope to run off time on that bill on Monday. We will talk further about \nexactly what will happen on Monday. We will do that tomorrow probably \njust as we wrap up consideration of this bill, complete the spending \nreconciliation bill Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday, and then go to the \ntax bill on Thursday, and stay until we finish the tax cut bill.\n  I do not know exactly how long that will take. We have a very \nbipartisan effort underway in the Finance Committee. The vote on the \nspending bill was 20 to 0, and we are working together right now on the \ntax cut provisions also. I expect it will be a bipartisan process and a \nbipartisan bill. It is possible it may not take that long, but it is \nvery important legislation and we need to get it done, completed next \nweek--both of those bills.\n  Assuming we cannot complete the DOD authorization bill tomorrow \nbecause of some concerns, and at least one issue that may come up, I \nknow the Democratic leader would want to be here for that, so we may \nnot be able to take that up until after we come back from the recess.\n\n  I want to thank the Members for their cooperation in getting this \nlegislation before the Senate now. And I do want to announce that we \nwill expect to complete action on it the week that we come back. \nHopefully, it will not take all week, because we have a lot of other \nbills now that are ready for consideration. It will be the pending \nbusiness when we come back--if we do not complete it tomorrow--when we \ncome back from the recess.\n  I hope Senators will come to the floor now and offer their \namendments. Some Senators were inquiring, ``Why do we need to vote \nduring the middle of the afternoon on Thursday?'' I would like to \nsuggest we have votes the rest of the day into tonight, on Friday, and \nwe be prepared next week to work long hours, Monday, Tuesday, \nWednesday, Thursday, and Friday, to get our work done. Then we can go \nto the recess period and feel good about our production.\n  Would the Senator from Kentucky have any comments?\n  Mr. FORD. No comments, Mr. President. I appreciate the courtesy that \nthe majority leader has shown me in the absence of the Democratic \nleader. I am trying to fill in as best I can, and hopefully we can be \naccommodating. And I am sure the majority leader will be accommodating \nto us. We both have to work together. I think Monday we can work out \nsomething that would be amenable to both sides. Hopefully, tomorrow we \nmight look at the DOD authorization bill with amazement.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. FORD. We hope we can do that, I am sure. But there is one \namendment that we will have to wait until into July, so we are not \ngoing to finish. We could be very close. I hope we could find out how \nmany amendments are out there and maybe get some kind of resolution to \nhow many we might have.\n  I will be glad to help the majority leader with that.\n  Mr. LOTT. That would be very helpful, Mr. President.\n  I thank Senator Ford.\n  It is a pleasure for me to yield the floor to the chairman of the \ncommittee so we can begin the debate.\n\n[[Page S5979]]\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes before the \nSenate begins consideration of the fiscal year 1998 Defense \nauthorization bill to explain why the Armed Services Committee filed \ntwo separate Defense authorization bills.\n  Yesterday, as most of you observed, there was objection to a consent \nrequest to take up S. 924, the bill the committee reported to the floor \nfor consideration. This objection was based on a number of provisions \ninvolving public depots--specifically--Air Force Logistics Centers. \nSenator Inhofe, the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee included \nthese provisions in his subcommittee markup. They were approved by the \nsubcommittee and the full committee in the markup and therefore were \nincluded in the bill which the committee voted unanimously to report to \nthe floor.\n  Senators from other States who did not agree to these provisions \nwould not consent to S. 924 being considered by the Senate. I believe \nall Senators acted in the interests of their states and their \nperception of what was in the best interests of the Government. This \nissue affects a great many jobs in all of these States and is an \nimportant economic issue within each State.\n  I want to commend Senator Inhofe for stepping forward and offering to \nstrip these provisions out of the bill. The committee met yesterday \nand, at his request, reported out a bill that does not include the \nprovisions that provided the basis for objection. Therefore, the Senate \ncan proceed to consideration of the Defense authorization bill, now S. \n936. The committee did not publish a report to accompany S. 936 and \ndeems Senate Report 105-29, minus sections 311, 312, and 313, as the \nreport to accompany S. 936.\n  I understand the importance of this issue to each of you. I want to \nespecially thank and commend Senator Inhofe for his courageous and \nunselfish act in moving to remove the basis for objection so that this \nbill, which is so critical to our Armed Forces and our national \nsecurity, can be considered by the Senate.\n  I want to emphasize that all Senators reserve their rights to offer \namendments on this issue on the floor while the bill is being \nconsidered. I understand that while the bill is on the floor, Senators \nand staff will continue to search for a solution to this very difficult \nissue.\n  I want to thank all Senators for their consideration. We hear a lot \nof talk on this floor about the loss of comity in the Senate. I believe \nthis is an indication of how Senators can act cooperatively on \ndifficult issues. In this case, it took a courageous Senator, Senator \nInhofe, to make the difference and I thank him again on behalf of the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank the very \ndistinguished chairman of our committee, Senator Thurmond, for the \nhours and hours that he put in and the way he ran the meetings. He was \nvery fair and open. I appreciate personally very much his remarks that \nhe just made. Thank you, Senator Thurmond.\n  As chairman of the readiness subcommittee I want to thank Senator \nRobb who is the ranking minority member. We took care of a lot of the \nproblems out there. I must say, Mr. President, that I think that our \nreadiness is desperately underfunded. We did the very best we could in \nthis bill with the resources we had but we are not going to be able to \ncontinue on the course we are on right now. We have problems.\n  As I go around the Nation, and around the world, actually, and visit \nbases, I have been in bases in the State of Alabama, and throughout the \nNation, as well as some of the foreign bases, and I can tell you we are \nin an OPTEMPO rate which is unacceptable. Our divorce rates are going \nup, our retention rates are going down, and we need to do a better job \nof funding not just readiness but modernization and quality of life. I \nam very concerned about quality of life. As I go around I find that \nsome of these kids are working about double the normal tempo that we \nhave found to be acceptable. While they can sustain it for a while, and \nwhile the troops can sustain it, the spouses cannot. There will come a \npoint in time where they will have to have more time with their \nfamilies and have a more civil type of existence. We cannot do that \nwith the way this administration has not allocated the proper amount of \nmoney to keep our system going to meet the minimum expectations of the \nAmerican people. That is, to be able to defend America on two regional \nfronts.\n  Having said that, I say again that we did the very best that can be \ndone, and in our readiness subcommittee we were able to reinstate money \nfor flying hours. We are losing pilots on a daily basis to the \nairlines. So we will have to do a lot more than we have done, but we \nhave done the very best that we can.\n  Let me make one comment about the depot issue. I know it is a \ndifficult issue. A few years ago when one of the House Members, \nCongressman Armey, I believe, originally came up with the whole idea of \nthe Base Realignment and Closing Commission concept, which means we \nknow we cannot reduce excess infrastructure by doing it through the \nnormal political process because everybody is concerned about jobs in \ntheir States. So they appointed an independent commission to be totally \nfree from political influence to make recommendations and they went \nthrough, with round one in 1991, in 1993 another round, in 1995 a third \nround, and in doing this there is hardly a Senator in this Chamber that \ndid not have major installations that have closed in their States. \nCertainly the State of Alabama lost a major one, and there were two \nmajor installations in the very State from which our chairman comes \nfrom, South Carolina, and virtually all the other States. So, we all \nbit the bullet.\n  However, it appears there is an effort now to disregard that and \nleave air logistic centers in California as well as in Texas open. \nWhile it is a difficult thing to go through we have to accept the fact, \nsooner or later, that you cannot have in the case of any specialty \narea, and specifically in this case, air logistic centers where you \nhave five operating at 50 percent capacity. You cannot continue to do \nthat. So they recommended closing two of them that they determined to \nbe the least efficient of the five and transferring that workload to \nthe remainder which would be around 75 to 80 percent capacity.\n  That makes a lot of sense. According to the GAO, that would save $468 \nmillion a year, and over 5 years, Mr. President, that is $2.34 billion. \nWhen I think about that and think about where those dollars are \ndesperately needed in quality of life, in readiness, in force strength, \nin modernization, it breaks my heart to think we are maybe willing to \njust throw it away.\n  So I did make the gesture that the chairman referred to and no one \nasked me to do it. I felt it was the right thing to do because we have \nto have an authorization bill. Under the rules of the Senate, it is \nvery possible for one Senator to keep a bill from coming up. I did not \nwant that to happen to Senator Thurmond's bill. I did not want that to \nhappen to our defense establishment. So I pulled the objectionable \nportions of how we treat depot maintenance out of the bill, but at the \nsame time I announced I have every intention of reestablishing language \nthat will accomplish what we want to get accomplished, and that is to \nbe able to save that money that the GAO states is at risk.\n  So I do not know whether it will be an amendment on the floor by \nwhich I will try to do this or in conference but I think everyone \nunderstands clearly there will be an effort to reinstate language that \nwe have had to take out.\n  With that, I will say this is a good bill and I want to move forward \nwith it. I want to get a chance to really consider these amendments, \nand I know there will be a lot of amendments.\n  As the new chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee of the Armed \nServices Committee, I have a devoted a significant amount of time \nduring the past few months traveling to military bases to discuss \nissues that impact the readiness of the Armed Forces and their ability \nto carry out assigned missions: European theater, including \ninstallations in England, Italy, Bosnia, Hungary; Camp Lejuene, NC; \nFort Hood, TX; Corpus Christi Naval Base, Texas; Dyess Air Force Base; \nand Fort Drum.\n\n[[Page S5980]]\n\n  We have also received testimony from the Secretary of Defense, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the service chiefs, the unified \ncommander-in-chief, and several other high ranking military and \ncivilian officials from the Department of Defense.\n  While the administration claims to have provided strong support for \ntraining, maintenance, supplies and other essentials needed to keep \nU.S. Forces ready to fight and win decisively, its budget request \nreduced real funding for these areas by $1.4 billion.\n  Nothing I've heard during my base visits has made me feel like we are \nas ready as the administration asserts.\n  At each unit, maintenance personnel have resorted to cannibalizing \ngood equipment to keep other equipment operating. These additional \nmaintenance actions result in 12-hour average work days for our young \ntroops--only because of a lack of good spares.\n  If readiness truly remains the administration's highest priority, \nthen I have to wonder about the shape of the other accounts--\nmodernization, quality of life, research and development--are they even \nmore seriously underfunded?\n  Military units and the personnel within them, are being overused and \nunderfunded to the point that I am afraid we are returning to the days \nof the hollow force. And the military personnel with whom I've spoken \nagree.\n  It is also apparent to me that our Forces are being stretched to the \nlimit to support humanitarian and contingency operations such as the \ndeployment of IFOR/SFOR in Bosnia.\n  Our high OPTEMPO is particularly troubling, since it results in more \nthan just time away from home for the troops--it results in more \nequipment wear and tear; higher than planned consumption of spares; and \ncanceled training.\n  At every base visited, I heard concerns about the quality of \nequipment.\n\n       Our lack of spares has caused us to cannibalize perfectly \n     good engines to keep others operating, requiring my \n     maintenance troops to work even more hours to keep our planes \n     flying. Our normal work week is now 50--56 hours/week.--\n     Lakenheath, AF Maintenance Officer.\n\n  Letter to Senator Thurmond from a non-commissioned officer:\n\n       We have old, worn out equipment that is difficult to \n     maintain because we cannot always get the parts needed to \n     repair them. It is the same way wherever we go; outdated, \n     broken equipment, a lack of spare parts, overworked and \n     underpaid GIs, resulting in an inability to perform our \n     mission.\n\n  I do not question the fact that our military forces are the finest in \nthe world. They are clearly performing their assigned missions superbly \nand they are capable of defeating any potential enemy of today.\n  But what about tomorrow? If this trend continues, I am concerned \nabout how long we can maintain the present pace of operations. I am not \nalone in my concerns--they were echoed by many of the military \npersonnel I had the pleasure of meeting. One officer summed it up \nnicely when he said ``the storm clouds are on the horizon.''\n  The Pentagon continues to omit these concerns from official reports \nwe receive from the Committee--to the contrary, their reports reports \nindicate readiness levels are at an all time high. I find the \nremarkable discrepancy between what I see in the field and the official \nstatements coming from the administration and the Pentagon very \ntroubling. And I am concerned that unless we take the necessary steps \nto correct these problems now, our military capability will erode as we \nenter the 21st century.\n  The most troubling challenge is the need for additional modernization \nfunding, for lack of new procurement has dramatic affects across all \nthe other accounts: As our military equipment ages, it requires \nincreased maintenance and thus more operations and maintenance [O] \nfunding; since additional funding is not available to increase the O \naccounts, dollars are often robbed from training accounts; \nunfortunately, as the equipment ages, the problem will only get worse, \nand we will find ourselves in a death spiral.\n  The funding crisis is further aggravated by the continual deployment \nof forces to contingency operations such as Southern Watch and Provide \nComfort. I have spoken many times, about the huge cost of these \noperations--between $6.5 and $8 billion for Bosnia alone--and the fact \nthese expenditures will come at the expense of our defense budget.\n  While dollars are the most obvious issue in defense, I suggest that \nwhat we often overlook is the huge burden we are placing on our people \nand our equipment. We are wearing out our equipment and pushing our \npeople so hard they no longer have time to train.\n  I heard comment after comment during my visits:\n\n       The high OPTEMPO at which our personnel are operating is \n     definitely causing a strain on our people's families. \n     Ultimately, this strain also affects my pilots' job \n     performance.--Marine F--18 Squadron Commander.\n       ``The number of days we fly to support Bosnia doesn't leave \n     us with enough time to train. The only areas where we get \n     training from our Bosnia missions is in reconnaissance and \n     close air support. The rest of our training areas are \n     suffering.''--Air Force F-16 Squadron Commander.\n       ``Our average crew goes TDY 150--160 days per year--the Air \n     Force goal is 120 days. These excessive taskings are \n     straining my peoples' families as well as impacting the \n     ability of my crews to receive adequate training.''--Air \n     Force C--130 Squadron Commander.\n\n  Clearly, there are situations when the deployment of the U.S. \nmilitary is necessary to protect America's vital interests. \nUnfortunately, it appears the Clinton administration will continue to \nkeep a very low threshold for determining the need to commit our \nforces.\n  My friends, the United States cannot force its military to expend \nmore resources than we are willing to provide and still expect it to \nremain a viable force for the future when it may be called upon to \ndefend American interests. I am concerned, the committee is concerned, \nour military personnel are concerned, and the American people should be \nconcerned. If we are to avoid losing our military edge, we must act \ndecisively and begin providing the resources necessary to support the \nmissions we continue to ask of our Armed Forces.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Senator, as I understand, you have been trying to \nfacilitate this very important piece of legislation in conjunction with \nthe distinguished chairman from South Carolina. I have been a vigorous \nsupporter of your efforts to fulfill the BRAC recommendations to the \nCongress, the President, and the Nation, which called for there to be \nthree logistic Air Force bases. Your efforts are to fulfill that \nrecommendation, to make that aspect of the Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission fulfilled. It has been abrogated by the administration.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. And it is your intention, as I understand our \nconversations, to continue to pursue an appropriate conclusion to this \navoidance of BRAC by the administration during the deliberations, the \nongoing deliberations of the debate on the Department of Defense \nauthorization?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is my intent.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator from Oklahoma can be assured that he will \nhave my undevoted attention to accomplishing this because not only have \nwe lost half a billion dollars because the Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission was voided by the administration, we have lost the integrity \nof the discipline itself. It should never occur again in that form.\n  I suspect there will be a debate on that on this bill. The Base \nRealignment and Closure Commission has been sullied because it was a \nstrict discipline that the people, the citizens of the country had to \nlive by, the Congress had to live by, could not amend, gave up its \nprerogatives to amend, could only vote up or down, and then we found \nthe administration could void it for whatever reason. That means that \nsystem no longer is of sound integrity, so if it is ever visited again \nit will have to be in a form that includes the President--not just the \npeople and the Congress.\n  I assume the Senator from Oklahoma will agree with that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I do agree with that. I want to give my assurance to the \nSenator from Georgia I have been living with this problem for a long \nperiod of time. We need an ultimate solution. In the interim, we need \nto make sure the recommendations of the BRAC Commission--that we \nprotect the integrity of that system and they be acted upon--that we go \nahead and fulfill the\n\n[[Page S5981]]\n\nexpectations. Again, it is not just the money involved here.\n  I think about all of the Senators who had closures, and if we start \nmaking exceptions now I think it is very unfair to every Member of this \nSenate body who has had a closure to now say for political reasons we \ncan take exceptions.\n  I know it is controversial when you say this, but if you just read \nthe statements that the President made in August of 1996 right before \nthe election, saying we will make sure those jobs do not leave, so what \ndoes that mean? It means regardless of what they do, whether it is \ncompetition or anything else, if the jobs stay in those areas we will \nstill have five air logistic centers, so you have the same problem \noperating at 50 percent capacity.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. One last comment. It is my understanding that the \ntotal number of jobs in the two bases that BRAC asked be closed were \n33,000 at the time of the recommendation and today, almost 2 years \nlater, it is 31,000.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is correct. In responding to the Senator from \nGeorgia, we had a committee meeting on this with the GAO and we looked \nat how much that has cost so far. That has been 2 years ago. And still, \nalmost the same number are there.\n  Now, there are other problems that come in, as the junior Senator \nfrom Utah brought up yesterday, that we are having a flight of \nexpertise out of these areas, getting into other occupations, and if we \ndo not do something quickly we are not going to be able to ever solve \nthis problem.\n  I think for that reason we need to address this, address it in this \nbill. But again, to protect the bill so that we would have an \nauthorization bill, I, personally, was willing, as you were willing, to \ntake that out so we could come to the floor and take it up and work in \na different work form--it may be the same form or a different form--but \ntake it up as a floor amendment or in conference.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, national security remains the federal \ngovernment's most important obligation to its citizens. The Committee \non Armed Services recognizes its critical role within the Senate in \ncarrying out the powers relating to national security which are granted \nto Congress in the Constitution. These include the power to: declare \nwar; raise and support Armies; provide and maintain a Navy; make rules \nfor the government and regulation of the Land and Naval Forces; provide \nfor organizing, arming and disciplining the militia; give its advice \nand consent to treaties and to the nominations of officers of the \nUnited States.\n  The members of the committee further understand the importance of the \ncommittee's jurisdiction within the Senate over matters relating to the \ncommon defense, the Department of Defense, the Military Departments, \nand the national security programs of the Department of Energy.\n  The Armed Services Committee completed its markup last Thursday \nafternoon after 4 days of careful deliberation, voting unanimously to \napprove of the fiscal year 1998 defense authorization bill. I believe \nwe have a good bill with a better balance between personnel quality of \nlife programs, readiness, and modernization.\n  The budget agreement reached this year represents a historic endeavor \nby the Congress and the President to reach a balanced budget by fiscal \nyear 2002. While the budget agreement protects our military forces from \nunrealistic and unwise cuts, the committee remains concerned that the \nfunding levels for defense may not provide sufficient funds to \nadequately sustain over time the personnel, quality of life, readiness, \nand modernization programs critical to our military services. The \ncommittee intends that the achievement of a balanced budget will not \nadversely affect the readiness and capabilities of our military forces \nand will endeavor, within the funds agreed upon for defense in the \nbudget agreement, to ensure their essential readiness and capabilities. \nChanges in the world situation or threat, and adverse impacts from \nfunding shortfalls on general readiness or on vital operational \ncapabilities, are among the trends that might indicate a requirement \nfor additional funds for defense. In such cases, the committee believes \nthat national security requirements must take precedence over lesser \npriorities within the budget.\n  In this bill, the committee worked to achieve a more appropriate \nbalance between near-term and long-term readiness through investments \nin modernization, infrastructure, and research; maintenance of \nsufficient end-strengths at all grade levels and policies supporting \nthe recruitment and retention of high quality personnel; fielding of \nthe types and quantities of weapons systems and equipment needed to \nfight and win decisively with minimal risk to our troops; and ensuring \nan adequate, safe and reliable nuclear weapons capability.\n  The committee worked to protect the quality of life of our military \npersonnel and their families. Quality of life initiatives include \nprovisions designed to provide equitable pay and benefits to military \npersonnel, including a 2.8 percent pay raise to protect against \ninflation, and the restoration of appropriate levels of funding for the \nconstruction and maintenance of troop billets and military family \nhousing.\n\n  The committee remains concerned about military readiness. To ensure \nthat U.S. Armed Forces remain the preeminent military power in the \nworld, readiness requirements must be adequately funded.\n  The committee is also concerned about the continuing migration of \nmodernization funds to operations and maintenance accounts. We have \nconsistently recommended a more robust, progressive modernization \neffort which will not only provide capabilities requisite for future \nmilitary operations, but will lower future operational and maintenance \ncosts as well.\n  The committee has increased investment in the broad spectrum of \nresearch and development activities to ensure that U.S. military forces \nremain superior in technology to any potential adversary. We believe \nthat effective development of advanced technologies will be a key \nfactor in determining the victors on future battlefields. A program of \nstable, long-term investment in science and technology will remain \nvital to United States dominance of combat on land, at sea, in the air, \nand in space.\n  The committee also directed a more detailed programming and budgeting \nprocess for the reserve components. The utilization and effectiveness \nof reserve component forces are dependent on proper funding to enhance \ntheir readiness and capabilities.\n  Finally, the committee sought to accelerate the development and \ndeployment of theater missile defense systems and to provide adequate \nfunding for a national missile defense system to preserve the option to \ndeploy such a system in fiscal year 2003. This bill also supports \nexpeditious deployment of land and sea-based theater missile defense \nsystems to protect United States and allied forces against the growing \nthreat of cruise and ballistic missiles.\n  The committee intends that, within the balanced budget agreement, we \nwill provide adequately for our men and women in uniform to defend our \nNation. The committee will continue to examine the adequacy of the \nfunds we allocate to our national security. At the same time, we must \nsearch for ways to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our \ndefense establishment--especially in the support structure--so that we \ncan achieve savings to devote to the cutting edge of our military \ncombat forces.\n  The national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1998 reflects \na bipartisan approach to our national security interests, and provides \na clear basis and direction for U.S. national security policies and \nprograms into the 21st century.\n  Let me make it clear to my colleagues--we do not have much time to \ncomplete action on this bill. If you have amendments, please come to \nthe floor and introduce your amendment now. Remember that if you are \nadding anything to this bill that requires additional funding, you must \nprovide a legitimate offset.\n  Mr. President, I want to close by thanking all the Senators on the \ncommittee and commend them for their hard work on this bill. All 18 \nSenators on the committee voted for the bill.\n  I also want to thank the staff on both sides and commend them for \ntheir hard\n\n[[Page S5982]]\n\nwork on the bill. I also ask unanimous consent that a list of members \nof the Armed Services Committee staff be included at this point in the \nRecord in recognition of their dedication and hard work.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                 SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE STAFF\n\n  Les Brownlee, David S.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee in bringing S. 936, the national defense authorization bill, \nto the floor, and I want to congratulate the Senator from South \nCarolina for the extraordinary effort he has put in on this bill. He \nhas really guided this bill through thick and thin, so that we are in a \nposition where we can bring this bill to the floor. It is his \ncommitment and his energy that he devotes to national defense that has \nmade this possible. I congratulate him on that.\n  I want to reiterate the comments of the chairman of the committee \nthat we are here debating S. 936, which is the bill that was reported \nyesterday. Now, this bill is almost identical to S. 924, which was the \nversion of the defense authorization bill that was reported earlier \nthis week. The exception is that the bill before us does not contain \ncertain provisions relative to depot maintenance that were in the \nearlier bill. That has been the subject of a number of colloquies here \nthis afternoon.\n  This bill meets the guidelines of the budget agreement and the fiscal \nyear 1998 budget resolution. The members of the committee didn't agree \non every provision; we never do, of course. There are several critical \nareas where I believe this bill needs to be improved. I will be working \nto make these improvements during the debate and during the conference. \nBut despite the few disagreements that existed, there was--again, as \nthis committee traditionally does--a very strong sense of \nbipartisanship and a spirit of cooperation that permeated the \ndiscussions and the markups. I want to join my friend, the chairman of \nthe committee, in thanking all of the members of the committee and the \nstaff for the hard work put up to get this bill to this point.\n  The chairman has summarized major provisions of the bill, and I want \nto take a few moments to give my perspective on some of the key \nprovisions.\n  First, relative to the implementation of the quadrennial defense \nreview recommendations, for the most part, this bill is consistent with \nthe administration's defense policies and programs. The budget \nagreement this year demonstrated that there is a growing consensus \nbetween the President and the Congress over the level of defense \nspending for the next 5 years. It is not going to be possible, at these \nfunding levels, to maintain today's force levels at their current \nreadiness posture, provide the pay and the quality of life for our \nmilitary members and their families that they deserve and that we are \nobligated to provide, and still to modernize our forces to meet \npossible future threats. We are not going to be able to do all that at \nthe agreed-upon funding levels.\n  In my view, our forces must continue to have the technological edge \nover any potential adversary. In order to modernize our forces, we are \ngoing to have to accept, in my judgment, a somewhat smaller force in \nthe future. But there are encouraging indications that technology is \ngoing to allow a smaller force to have the same or even greater \nlethality and combat effectiveness as our forces have today.\n  The recently completed quadrennial defense review begins to make some \nof the tradeoffs that we are going to need to make to be able to \nmodernize our forces. In several important respects, this bill begins \nto implement the requested recommendations. For example, the bill \nreduces active duty personnel strength for the military services by \n36,000 below the current levels and reduces Reserve component strength \n16,000 below current levels.\n  The bill supports a major Army initiative, which was recommended at \nthe quadrennial defense review, by increasing funding by approximately \n$150 million for the Army's Force 21 initiative. Last April, I visited \nthe Army's advanced war-fighting experiment at the National Training \nCenter. I saw, firsthand, the tremendous potential of the advanced \nsituational technologies the Army is developing in their Force 21 \ninitiative. The QDR recommended speeding up the fielding of these \ntechnologies, and the committee bill supports this important effort.\n  I may say that a number of our colleagues visited the center as well. \nI know the Senator from Indiana, for instance, also visited the \nNational Training Center, and he is the chairman of our subcommittee. \nHe was also very deeply impressed by the potential of these \ntechnologies, and he is primarily instrumental, I would say, for the \nincreased resources that we are devoting to this initiative. I have \nbeen happy to support that effort. I believe very strongly in them. But \nI want to give credit to Senator Coats for the energies he has shown in \nthis regard.\n  In order to be able to afford the modernization program for the \nmilitary services outlined in the quadrennial defense review, it is \nimportant that the Congress and the Defense Department carefully limit \nweapons acquisition programs to only the levels necessary to meet the \nfuture requirements of the military services. In this regard, I am \npleased that our committee included a provision prohibiting future \nproduction of B-2 bombers beyond the 21 currently planned for the Air \nForce. We don't need and we can't afford more B-2's.\n  Finally, Mr. President, in this area, we have heard from a number of \nSenators this year expressing concern over the levels of procurement \nfunding for the National Guard and Reserve components.\n  The committee bill authorizes a total of $653 million above the \nbudget request to buy equipment for National Guard and Reserve units. \nBut now I want to turn to several areas of concern that I have with \nthis bill.\n\n[[Page S5983]]\n\n  First, on base closures: I am disappointed that the committee could \nnot agree on a process for future base closures in the Department of \nDefense. Although there was strong support in the committee for more \nbase closures, the amendment to authorize two additional base closure \nrounds--one in 1999 and one in 2001--failed on a 9 to 9 tie vote. I \nbelieve that the case for closing more military bases is clear and \ncompelling.\n  From 1989 to 1997 the Department of Defense reduced total active duty \nmilitary end strength by 32 percent. That figure is going to grow to 36 \npercent by the year 2003, as a result of the quadrennial defense \nreview. So we have cut the size of our forces by 36 percent as of the \nyear 2003, and already by 32 percent.\n  But even after the four base closure rounds, the domestic military \nbase structure in the United States has been reduced by only 21 \npercent. And therein lies the problem. We have more structure than we \nneed in our bases. So both the QDR, quadrennial defense review of the \nDepartment of Defense, and the national defense panel of outside \ncitizens that we have selected to review the QDR division--both the QDR \nand that outside defense panel--have concluded that further reductions \nin the DOD base structure are essential to free up money that we need \nto modernize our forces.\n  Because we have to make some very difficult choices here, one of the \ncritical choices is whether or not we are going to continue to keep \nexcess structure when we are shorting modernization funding. And on \nJune 5 the Armed Services Committee received a letter signed by all six \nmembers of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The chairman, the vice chairman, \nthe four service chiefs all signed one letter. It is rather unusual. \nBut they did it in this case because of the strength of their views. \nAnd they urged us in this letter to ``strongly support further \nreductions in base structure proposed by the Secretary of Defense.''\n  Mr. President, every dollar that we spend to keep open bases that we \ndon't need is $1 that we can't spend on modernization programs that our \nmilitary forces do need. And I know that closing bases is a painful \nprocess. I have been through it. We lost all three of our Strategic Air \nCommand bases in Michigan. One of them that was closed recently was in \nthe upper peninsula of Michigan which was the largest single employer \nin the upper peninsula in a rural area, and it was closed. We argued \nagainst it. We lost. So the largest employer in the upper peninsula of \nMichigan shut down. We are surviving. A lot of good people are putting \ntheir shoulder to the wheel and we are going to be able to pull \nthrough. Is there some short-term pain and stress? You bet. Is it \nessential that we go through this process to reduce excess structure? \nIt is.\n  Are there additional facilities in Michigan that might be addressed \nin future rounds of base closings? There are. And that has to make all \nof us worry. But we have really no choice. If we are serious about \nmodernizing, about the need to modernize and to keep ahead of any \npotential adversary, and to make sure that our forces in the future \nhave the best equipment that can possibly be developed and \nmanufactured, we have to do what the Joint Chiefs have urged us to do \nin this 24-star letter; and that is to support further reductions in \nbase closures which has closings which have been recommended by the \nSecretary of Defense. I don't see any other choice. The easy way is to \nnot do it. But it is not the right thing to do, if we are going to \nmaintain our qualitative technological edge. We just simply must \ncontinue to find a way to reduce our infrastructure costs. And, if that \nmeans that the next round of base closing we have to adjust it so that \nwe don't run into the kind of argument that we have run into in the \npast round of base closings, if we have to put in the next round of \nbase closing a provision that you can't privatize in place, for \ninstance, without a specific recommendation to do that by BRAC, if that \nis what it is going to take, then so be it. But we have to continue \ndown this road, if we are going to be true to the needs of our \nmilitary.\n  Secretary Cohen pointed out in his testimony on the quadrennial \ndefense review that the choice is clear. We can maintain the current \nbase structure and fail to meet our modernization goals, or we can \nreduce our base structure and achieve the savings that we need to pay \nfor the modernization that we all agree is necessary.\n  On the Air Force depot issue, there is no more contentious issue than \nthis one. And I commend the Senators who permitted this process of \nbringing this bill to the floor to continue by removing the contentious \nprovisions at this time. I commend them for it. In my view, the only \nway to resolve this issue is to have a fair competition, and determine \nthe most cost-effective solution to redistribute the workload of these \ntwo depots, regardless of whether the result is privatization in place, \nprivatization in some other location, or transfer to another Government \ndepot.\n  There are many that believe and I know that the White House \npoliticized this one aspect of the base closure process when the DOD \nprivatized in place the work of the two closing Air Force depots. But I \nthink it would be just as bad for Congress to politicize the base \nclosure process by attempting to legislate a particular outcome. I \ndon't think we can legislate a particular outcome.\n  I don't think we should. I think we should legislate a process which \nwill guarantee that there be a full and fair competition. I tried that \napproach in committee. I didn't quite make it. But I think that is the \nbest way to proceed.\n  We have base-decision amendments on this bill, and, even if we do \nnot, we are going to face this issue in conference because the House \nbill contains provisions that do address the issue. Ultimately we will \nhave to reach a compromise I believe that is fair and equitable to all.\n  On another subject, cooperative threat reduction programs: One of the \nmost cost-effective and successful defense programs to reduce threats \nto our country and to enhance our national security is the cooperative \nthreat reduction program that was started in 1991 by Senators Nunn and \nLugar. The cooperative threat reduction program at the Department of \nDefense and its companion program at the Department of Energy have \nproduced important results in reducing the threat of proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear, chemical, and \nbiological weapons and their materials.\n  In my view, the committee decision to reduce the budget request for \nthese programs by $135 million was shortsighted. I would have preferred \nto see an increase in funding for these programs because they are a \nvery cost-effective approach to the most serious national security \nthreat that we face today. That is the threat from the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction. Of all the security threats that we face, \nthat is probably the most serious one--weapons of mass destruction in \nthe hands of terrorists, or terrorist states.\n  This is a very modest investment in terms of defense budget, and it \ncan significantly reduce the threat of proliferation by securing \nmaterials wherever they are--in this case Russia and some of the other \nformer Soviet Union states. That is a real investment in our own \nsecurity with a huge payoff.\n  It doesn't take much of this plutonium or enriched uranium to leak--\nto be transferred across the borders of these states to threaten us \nwith massive destruction. About a hockey puck of plutonium can take \ncare of one of our cities. That can be carried in one's pocket. That \nmaterial literally can be carried in a pocket across a border. We need \nto secure that material; whatever it takes to secure it within reason.\n  These are reasonable amounts of money. We are talking about a major \ninvestment in American security.\n  So I think the decision to reduce the budget request for these \nprograms, including security of nuclear material, was a mistake. And I \nknow there is going to be a bipartisan effort to restore these funds \nfor this important program. I hope that we will do so here on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. President, on another part of the bill, the committee authorized \n$345 million to begin incremental funding of the construction of the \nnext Nimitz class nuclear aircraft carrier called CVN-77. It did so \nbased on claims of cost savings by the shipbuilder. Those claims, it \nseems to me, can be made reasonably. Those are claims that have some \nfoundation.\n  Indeed, there was a report that we received. The Rand Corp. folks did \na\n\n[[Page S5984]]\n\nstudy on this issue that said that the savings which were advertised \nhere claimed by the shipbuilder can be achieved. It is possible. But \nwhat we failed to do in committee is to assure that the advertised and \nclaimed savings would be achieved. We didn't adopt the safeguards to \nensure that the taxpayers actually received the savings advertised by \nthe shipbuilder on which this very unusual action is based.\n  We do not incrementally fund aircraft carriers. We do not say, ``OK, \nwe will put a couple hundred million dollars in this year, and a couple \nhundred million dollars in next year'', and so forth, because it makes \nit very difficult for us when it comes to negotiating the contract to \npurchase the aircraft carrier to have any bargaining leverage. We have \nalready incrementally funded, bought pieces of it, obligated funds for \nit, and we have lost our bargaining leverage when it comes to the \nprice. So what we have done traditionally is authorized the whole thing \nat once in order to make sure that we get the best deal when it comes \ntime to negotiate the price.\n  The Defense Department's current future years' defense program \nincludes a total of $5.2 billion for the construction of the next \naircraft carrier with what is called ``advanced procurement'' in the \nyear 2000, and the balance of $4.5 billion in the year 2002. But \nearlier this year the shipbuilder came forward with a proposal, as I \nsaid, to incrementally fund this carrier beginning in this year's \nbudget--the one that is in front of us--and continuing each year \nthrough 2002. According to the shipbuilder, this alternative funding \nproposal would save us $600 million in the cost of building the CVN-77. \nAnd this claim has been repeated many times in the last 2 months in \nsome very highly visible advertising in the media.\n  As I said, the normal method of funding major defense procurement \nfunding programs is to provide full funding in one lump sum in the year \nin which the program is started.\n  There have been certain exceptions and limited long-lead items which \nare funded through advanced procurement. And the reason for it is the \none that I have given, which has to do with avoiding buy-ins--the \nsituation in which it becomes more difficult to control total program \ncosts in future and future cost growth.\n  But the Rand Corp. did that study I referred to, and it substantiated \nthat savings were really possible here if we incrementally fund it as \nproposed by the shipbuilders, and the Navy's own analysis subsequently \nconfirmed that this savings could be achieved.\n  So I am willing to support incremental funding as one Senator, but I \nam willing to do it only if this incremental funding approach assures \nus that the Government is going to receive the savings from this \napproach that had been promised by the contractor. And it is doable. We \ncan do this. And I will be offering an amendment--and I hope there will \nbe bipartisan support for this amendment--that will attempt to assure \nthat this $600 million in advertised savings is, in fact, achieved in \nthe purchase of this aircraft carrier. And we began, I think, to do \nthis in a way which allows us to get the savings but also to assure the \nsavings.\n  Mr. President, just one or two other items. Section 1039 of this bill \nprohibits the General Accounting Office from undertaking any self-\ninitiated audits unless it can certify that it has completed all \ncongressional requests. Since the General Accounting Office has \nhundreds of pending requests at any given time, this provision in \neffect is a total prohibition on any self-initiated work by the GAO.\n  I hope that this provision will be deleted or modified because it \ncould hamstring the GAO in its very important efforts to identify \nwaste, fraud and abuse in Government programs. Already 80 percent of \nthe GAO work is in response to the requests of committees and Members \nof the Congress. But some of the work that they do fulfills work that \nhas been carried out by them in the waste, fraud and abuse area which \nthey have self-initiated and which has been very, very important to the \nCongress in identifying waste, fraud and abuse--not just in the defense \narea, in any area. And this provision applies not just to defense. The \nprovision in this defense bill applies Governmentwide.\n  That is why the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nSenator Thompson, and the ranking member of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, Senator Glenn, both wrote a letter requesting sequential \nreferral of this bill to Governmental Affairs so that they could have a \nlook at this provision which is Governmentwide and would restrict the \nGAO. Sequential referral was not approved because, under the rules, the \nparliamentary rules, apparently in order for there to be sequential \nreferral, a bill must have many more provisions in it relating to that \nsecond committee than this one provision. It has to predominantly \nbelong within the jurisdiction of a second committee, and this bill \nobviously does not. This is one of a few provisions which touches the \nGovernmental Affairs jurisdiction. But I do hope that we will be able \nto find a way to either delete or to modify this provision as it will \nhamstring the efforts of the GAO in doing some very important work.\n  Finally, Mr. President, section 363 of this bill gives the Secretary \nof Defense the unprecedented authority unilaterally to stop for 30 days \ncertain administrative actions of other Federal agencies. The Secretary \nwould have this authority without regard to the valid health or safety \nconcerns that may have motivated other agencies in taking their action. \nThis automatic stay could cover rules and orders intended to protect \nthe environment and safeguard work safety or preserve private property \nand many other conceivable administrative actions and orders. This \naction exceeds the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee. It \ncreates the appearance of placing the Department of Defense above the \nlaw. For these reasons, I do not believe that it should have been \nincluded in the bill, and I hope we can find a way to correct it.\n  Mr. President, I know there will be some vigorous debate on this \nbill, and I hope Senators will come to the floor and offer their \namendments so that we can complete Senate action on the bill in a \ntimely manner and in a fashion that the majority leader has announced, \nand then go to conference with the House.\n  And, again, I want to commend my friend from South Carolina for his \nleadership on the committee and in making it possible for this bill to \ncome to the floor. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend Senator Levin, the ranking member of this committee, for his \nfine cooperation, advice and assistance during the preparation of this \nbill. This cooperation on his part greatly enhanced the successful \ncompletion of the 1998 defense authorization legislation. We worked in \na bipartisan manner for the benefit of our great Nation, and by doing \nthis I think we have brought to the floor an excellent bill on behalf \nof our Nation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as we begin consideration of the Senate's \nversion of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, \nI cannot help reflecting on the increasingly illogical nature of the \nprocess through which we have arrived at this point. By that I refer to \nthe task of marking up yet another defense bill while budgets continue \nto decline in real terms, force structure continues to contract, and \noperational requirements continue to climb, while Members of Congress \ncontinue to waste considerable sums on projects of questionable merit.\n  Let me say first that there is much in this bill that warrants our \nsupport, including an active duty pay raise, improvements in the way \nhousing allowances for military personnel are calculated and applied, \nfunding for tactical aviation modernization and missile defense \nprograms, increased emphasis on defense against chemical and biological \nweapons, and much more.\n  The bill includes, for example, a provision authorizing the \nDepartment of Defense to waive CHAMPUS deductibles and annual fees for \nservice members and their families who are stationed in remote duty \nlocations within the continental United States. These families, most of \nwhom are junior enlisted personnel, are geographically separated from \nmilitary treatment facilities and TRICARE Prime sites and now rely to a \ngreat degree on standard CHAMPUS for health care\n\n[[Page S5985]]\n\nservices. The legislation also approves several survivor benefit plans \nthat will alleviate much of the emotional anguish experienced by \nsurviving spouses of military retirees.\n  The committee also adopted an amendment that enhances aviation \nspecial pays. Compelling testimony from the service chiefs of the Navy, \nAir Force, and Marine Corps revealed that our Armed Forces are facing \ncritical shortages of skilled aviators. It is clear that this provision \nwill be crucial in retaining sufficient aviators to operate today's \ntechnically advanced aircraft. Any failure to address this issue would \ncertainly have an enormous impact on future readiness.\n  I was particularly pleased that the Armed Services Committee \ncontinued to focus on improving the system by which the services \ndetermine unit readiness levels. The Department of Defense is directed \nto continue its study of the merits of maintaining units at differing \nlevels of readiness, depending upon actual deployability and the \nlikelihood of each unit actually responding to a crisis. With budgets \nbeing as tight as they are while fiscally daunting modernization \ndecisions are fast approaching, it is worth examining whether savings \nin the operations and maintenance accounts--the largest portion of the \ndefense budget and the most difficult to track--can be identified and \nreallocated to high priority research and development and procurement \nprograms.\n\n  I recognize that there is already a considerable amount of tiering \nthat occurs in the Navy simply by virtue of the deployment, training, \nand maintenance schedules it must follow in order to meet requirements. \nThe Army and Air Force, however, may be a source of some savings if \nunits whose deployability is highly contingent on air and sealift \ncapabilities are permitted to relax their readiness levels to some \ndegree. In fact, many Army personnel have expressed the sentiment that \nthey would fare better if forced to perform fewer training exercises, \nwhich place a strain on people and equipment.\n  I am not arguing that units should be permitted to atrophy; on the \ncontrary, I would like to think that none of us would acquiesce in the \nimplementation of policies that would place U.S. interests and military \npersonnel at risk. It is a legitimate question, though, whether certain \nunits must be retained at the highest readiness levels despite the \nimprobability of deployment, given operational plans, and the time it \nwould take for such units to deploy given available lift assets.\n  One of the more significant actions taken by the committee involved \ntermination of funding for the B-2 bomber, including of funds required \nto preserve that aircraft's industrial base. Opponents of the amendment \nto end the program once and for all argued that we need to maintain the \nability to build more of these extremely technically complex aircraft \nin the event future contingencies require more stealth bombers. We \nalready have enough strategic bombers in the inventory, however, and \nthe Air Force has repeatedly testified that it does not want and cannot \nafford any more. Most important, the time it takes to build even one B-\n2 precludes our being able to surge produce them in the event of a \nmajor deterioration in the international environment. Should a major \nregional contingency arise, it will be fought with the bombers on-\nhand--not ones more than a year from being operational.\n  Unfortunately, for all that is good in this bill, there is much that \nis wasteful. The manner in which shipbuilding and conversion dollars \nare allocated no longer bears any resemblance to actual military \nrequirements and available resources, nor does it correspond to \nessential industrial base preservation concerns. Rational discourse on \nwhether to incrementally fund a $5 billion aircraft carrier cannot \noccur without other shipbuilding interests demanding something for \nthemselves. After all, what's another destroyer above and beyond the \nnumber requested and budgeted for? What's another LPD-class ship, or an \nAOE fast support ship, or another submarine? For the last several \nyears, we have seen a dangerous trend whereby decisions on shipbuilding \nmatters, more than any other--save for the depot issue--are predicated \nsolely on parochial considerations. This situation has to stop.\n  One of the more disappointing results of the Armed Services \nCommittee's mark-up of this bill was the rejection of an amendment \nsponsored by Senators Robb, Levin, Coats, and myself that would have \nstatutorily mandated the two base closure rounds called for in the \nQuadrennial Defense Review. There is a broad consensus that the Defense \nDepartment, even after the previous four rounds of such closings, \ncontinues to maintain considerably more infrastructure than it needs. \nThe expenditures associated with maintaining these installations and \nfacilities constitute a major drain on declining resources allocated \nfor national defense. Rejection of the amendment represented a serious \nsetback in the efforts of some of us at instilling greater discipline \ninto the budgetary process.\n  Mr. President, you can support the Reserve component of our total \nforce without acquiescing in the thorough hemorrhaging of scarce \nmilitary construction dollars for National Guard projects. The total \nmilitary construction budget request for projects located inside the \nUnited States was $2 billion, not including another $2 billion for base \nclosure activities. The request for National Guard and Reserve \nconstruction projects was $172 million. Of the 87 military construction \nprojects added to the administration's request, 46--more than half--are \nfor the National Guard and Reserve. The Senate bill includes over $900 \nmillion in National Guard and Reserve procurement items, the House \nversion $700 million.\n  As I have already noted, the bill includes an ample supply of pork-\nbarrel projects, including continued funding of High Frequency Active \nAuroral Research Program, or HAARP. This project, while certainly \ninteresting from a purely theoretical perspective, is thoroughly \nlacking in merit and does not belong in a defense spending bill. Nor do \nadditional dollars for the National Oceanographic Partnership Program. \nThe Navy, out of whose budget this project is funded, derives no \ntangible return on its investment. This nondefense program may deserve \nto be funded in another area of the Federal budget, but it does not \nbelong in this bill. Individually, projects like these are a serious \nwaste of taxpayer dollars. Collectively, they constitute a serious \ndrain on the resources needed to ensure future military readiness.\n  In short, Mr. President, it is regrettable that the propensity of \nMembers to continue to add pork as though it were still the early \n1980's remains as strong as ever.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 417\n\n(Purpose: To strike section 3138, relating to a prohibition on recovery \n    of certain additional costs for environmental response actions \n  associated with the Formerly Utilized Site Remedial Action Project \n program, and to require a report on the remediation activities of the \n                         Department of Energy)\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have an amendment that I send to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg], for himself \n     and Mr. Torricelli, proposes an amendment numbered 417.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Strike out section 3138 and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 3138. REPORT ON REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT \n                   OF ENERGY.\n\n       The Secretary of Energy shall submit to Congress a report \n     on the remediation activities of the Department of Energy.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first let me say to the distinguished \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee and the ranking member that I \ncommend them for a job well done. I am very much aware of the \ncomplications that one has in the defense authorization bill. It is a \nlarge sum of money, a very complicated piece of legislation. It has \nresearch funds and it has operational money. It is quite a job, and I \ncommend the both of them for moving this rapidly and getting this bill \nto the floor.\n  Mr. President, I have an amendment that would strike a section, \nsection\n\n[[Page S5986]]\n\n3138 of this bill because this section prevents the Department of \nEnergy from recovering any cleanup costs at sites under DOE's Formerly \nUtilized Site Remedial Action Project program other than the costs \nalready covered in a written, legally binding agreement with the party \ninvolved in the site.\n  To put it more simply, this section would strike the Department of \nEnergy's ability to recover costs already covered in a previous \nagreement with a party involved in the site.\n  As a practical matter, Mr. President, it would absolve W.R. Grace \nCompany of millions of dollars of responsibility for toxic pollution \ncosts by their actions. The effect of this provision from the analysis \nthat we have conducted so far is to grant a special exemption from \nSuperfund law to one company. The Superfund law, a law which I am proud \nto have helped author, embodies the principle that polluters should pay \nfor the damage they do, and in this case W.R. Grace should pay for the \ncleanup of the mess that it created.\n  The deal was an unacceptable slap in the face to American taxpayers \nand the residents of Wayne, NJ, my home State. As a matter of fact, I \nlived in this community for some time. The residents of Wayne Township \nhave been living with this problem for such a long period of time, and \nwhy this amendment is so outrageous is something that I want to \nexplain.\n  A pile of approximately 15,000 cubic yards of potentially radioactive \nmaterial has already been removed by the Department of Energy, and the \nDepartment of Energy says that there are still about 70,000 cubic yards \nmore still buried at the Wayne site, and it is still deciding how to \nclean up the part that is on the surface and below. The Department of \nEnergy estimates the entire cleanup may cost $120 million. The major \ncontaminant in this soil is a contaminant called thorium, highly \nradioactive material. It is known to cause cancer and has a half life, \nMr. President, that is far longer than perhaps this Earth can endure. \nIt is 14 billion years. In other words, this stuff stays hot for that \nlong a period of time.\n  This deadly waste was the result of industrial activity going on \nsince 1948, almost 50 years ago. The contamination may affect the \ndrinking water of 51,000 New Jersey residents resulting in untold \nharmful health consequences. The W.R. Grace company owned the property \nand contributed to this huge pile of waste. The Grace company signed an \nagreement with the Federal Government in which it promised to \ncontribute to the cleanup, and then they went on to pay a tiny fraction \nof the ultimate cleanup cost for this site when they deeded over the \nproperty to the Government. They paid $800,000 as a down payment on \n$120 million. That does not sound like a very serious downpayment to \nme. But the agreement also said that the Federal Government maintained \nthe right to come after W.R. Grace under other laws to remedy the \nthreats caused by their pollution despite again the agreement they had \nsigned. But nothing happened for many years.\n  In 1995, I urged in a letter to the Department of Energy to expedite \nthe cleanup by negotiating with W.R. Grace, the responsible party, the \npolluter, to pay its share. Those negotiations began shortly \nthereafter. Over the last year, I have been assured a number of times \nby the Energy and Justice Departments that progress was being made. And \nfor over 1 year now W.R. Grace has been engaged in a discussion with \nthe Department of Justice, which I believe was in good faith, to \ndetermine what share Grace would pay for contributing so much to this \nmess.\n\n  Now I read the language in this bill and find that it effectively \nwipes out all of the progress that has been made, wipes out all of the \nobligation that W.R. Grace would have. This language takes away the \nDepartment of Energy's legal rights under the Superfund polluter pays \nliability system. It abrogates a legal commitment signed by Grace.\n  Mr. President, this puts the burden squarely on the American taxpayer \ninstead of the polluters. Further, it will delay the cleanup and could \npoison the drinking water of the people of Wayne and the State of New \nJersey. The Department of Energy, Mr. President, has limited cleanup \ndollars and numerous sites across the country under a program that is \ncalled FUSRAP, the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program. \nThese are the sites of industrial activity that may have contributed at \none point to our Nation's defense. That does not mean they have a \nlicense to pollute thereafter. They have a responsibility.\n  Without an infusion of cleanup funds from the parties responsible for \nthe mess in Wayne, there will be years of delay in this cleanup, years \nwhen the radioactive waste will continue to blight a community, years \nfor that plume to migrate, to reach the drinking water source for that \ntown.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, and I \nworked together on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee \nand together we are trying to rewrite the Superfund law which is soon \nto expire. We worked together in good faith, and I believe we have \nnarrowed the differences on many issues affecting Superfund. I hope \nthat we are going to be able to produce a bill later this year with \nboth our names as cosponsors of that legislation.\n  However, as far as the provision in this bill that deals with the \nDepartment of Energy cleanup at the site in Wayne, I oppose it \nstrenuously. As the Senator from New Hampshire expressed to me, he had \nno scheme in mind to mitigate the obligation that W.R. Grace has to do \nthe cleanup. That was an effect apparently unintended by the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, but we have to deal in reality not the intent. W.R. \nGrace must stand up to their obligation. The reality is that the \nprovision in this bill would not only slow down the Wayne cleanup \nprogram, but it would also transfer its costs from the responsible \nparty to the taxpayer. We are not going to stand for that, Mr. \nPresident.\n\n  So I urge the adoption of my amendment and urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, the amendment of the \nSenator from New Jersey addresses a provision, section 3138, in the \ndefense bill which relates to something called Formerly Utilized Sites \nRemedial Action Program [FUSRAP]. I just want to give a little \nbackground as to how and why the language the Senator is concerned \nabout appeared in the legislation and also to indicate what its intent \nwas and to discuss specifically his amendment.\n  Earlier this year it came to the attention of the Armed Services \nCommittee this program, the so-called FUSRAP program, was not getting \nthe sites cleaned up as quickly or as efficiently as it could. Of \ncourse, as all of us know who work on the Superfund issue, that is true \nof many, many Superfund sites around the country as well as these \nparticular FUSRAP sites. So the committee felt we wanted to do \nsomething to expedite the cleanups, to get it done quicker, to respond \nto the concerns raised by Members who were not on our committee--that \nis the Armed Services Committee--and in some cases were not even on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. In order to try to respond to \nthose concerns, the Armed Services Committee unanimously adopted this \nlanguage. It was hoped it would speed up the cleanup of these sites and \nprovide an incentive for parties that were responsible for the \ncontamination of these sites to come to the table, negotiate their \nliability allocations with DOE, and to contribute an appropriate amount \nto the cleanup costs--not to give anybody a sweetheart deal, not to \nremove people from the hook, so to speak, but rather to bring people to \nthe table to pay their appropriate share of the cleanup costs. That was \nthe goal and the objective of the language.\n  I might say, unfortunately, sometimes these disputes manage to make \ntheir way to the floor because they are not resolved before we get \nhere. Had this Senator had some knowledge of concerns raised by members \nof the committee or other Members of the Senate prior to this time, we \nmight have been able to address those concerns. But as I indicated \nearlier, it passed unanimously in the Armed Services Committee. There \nwas absolutely no discussion of it in the committee. So it is \nunfortunate that we\n\n[[Page S5987]]\n\nhave to deal with it here, but, be that as it may, that is what we will \ndo.\n  The language included in the section would have limited DOE's ability \nto seek cost recoveries against some private parties. That is true. \nThat is what Senator Lautenberg just said. But in no way would it have \nlimited the similar powers, the collateral powers that the EPA and the \nDepartment of Justice has to obtain these recoveries, get these dollars \nrecovered. So, given the fact that DOE may have some level of \nresponsibility for liability at these sites, we on the committee \nbelieved it was an inappropriate conflict of interest for them to have \ncontrol for recovering costs against private parties. So, by leveling \nthe playing field, we believed it would be more likely that private \nparties would settle their liability at the site, and, given the fact \nthat EPA and DOJ would still have enforcement authority, we knew no \nparty would be let off the hook. That was the intention.\n  I believe in my own heart, as I read the language, that the language \nsupports that intention. But I can understand there may be differences \nof opinion in terms of how you interpret it. There have been some \nconcerns raised that we tried to address a single-party site here, to \ngive somebody specific relief. That could not be further from the \ntruth. I think the facts speak for themselves. This was a generic \namendment. I might say the topic at hand here is the so-called FUSRAP \nsites, that is the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Project.\n  In a DOE Office of Environmental Restoration pamphlet that is dated \nApril 1995, there are 46 FUSRAP sites, of varying degrees. I think it \nmay be the case that the site in New Jersey could be singled out here \nas possibly being helped in one way or another by his provision. \nHowever, there are 46 sites, so I think the committee is on record \nhere, being very clear that the intention here was to deal with 46 \nFUSRAP sites to try to expedite the cleanup. They are in States all \nacross the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a section of this \npamphlet listing those 46 FUSRAP sites be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Site Name and Location\n\n\n                                missouri\n\n     Latty Avenue Properties--Hazelwood\n     St. Louis Airport Site (SLAPS)--St. Louis\n     SLAPS (Vicinity Properties)--Hazelwood and Berkeley\n     St. Louis Downtown Site (SLDS)--St. Louis\n\n\n                               new jersey\n\n     DuPont & Company--Deepwater\n     Maywood--Maywood/Rochelle Park\n     Middlesex Sampling Plant--Middlesex\n     New Brunswick Laboratory--New Brunswick\n     Wayne Interim Storage Site--Wayne\n\n\n                                new york\n\n     Ashland 1--Tonawanda\n     Ashland 2--Tonawanda\n     Linde Air Products--Tonawanda\n     Seaway Industrial Park--Tonawanda\n     Bliss & Laughlin Steel--Buffalo\n     Colonie--Colonie\n     Niagara Falls Storage Site--Lewiston/Youngstown/Niagara Falls\n\n\n                                  ohio\n\n     Associate Aircraft--Fairfield\n     B Metals--Columbus\n     Baker Brothers--Toledo\n     Luckey--Luckey\n     Painesville--Painesville\n\n\n                              Other Sites\n\n     Madison--Madison, IL\n     W.R.

So that was the intention here and the \npoint I wanted to make regarding these sites.\n  Let me also say, because this is kind of a technical term--the so-\ncalled FUSRAP sites is a little hard to understand. We have a lot of \nacronyms here. I know it is difficult for people to comprehend some of \nthese, but this program was initiated in 1974 by the Atomic Energy \nCommission under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. They have 7 or 8 major \nobjectives. I will just briefly highlight those.\n  One is to find and evaluate sites that supported the Manhattan \nEngineer District/Atomic Energy Commission's early atomic energy \nprogram and to determine whether these sites needed cleanup or control.\n  Second, to clean up or control these sites so that they meet current \nDOE guidelines.\n  Third, to dispose of or stabilize waste in an environmentally \nacceptable way.\n  Fourth, to complete all work so the DOE complies with the appropriate \nFederal laws and regulations and State and local environmental and land \nuse requirements.\n  Fifth, to certify the sites for appropriate future use.\n  These sites are owned by either the Department of Energy, local \ngovernments, private corporations or private citizens or a combination \nthereof.\n  Again, the goal here was to try to craft something that would \nexpedite these 46 FUSRAP sites, some with problems more serious in \nnature than others. Obviously the site the Senator from New Jersey is \ntalking about is much more serious than some of the others. But the \nidea was to bring these parties to the table in a fair and equitable \nway, being certain that those PRPs that had put money on the table, had \noffered money on the table, would be encouraged to provide not only \nthat money but more. That way, we could get a fair settlement so the \ntaxpayers would be saved dollars and at the same time we would \naccomplish the goal of cleaning up these sites.\n  In a moment I am going to offer a second-degree perfecting amendment \nto the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey. Before I do that, I \njust want to say that I understand the concerns of the Senator. He has \nbeen very cooperative. We have talked about this at great length in the \npast few days to try to come to an understanding of what my intent was \nand what he believes the result to be. We may not be 100 percent in \nagreement here, but I think we can resolve this with this second-degree \namendment which I believe addresses the concerns of the Senator and at \nthe same time will lead us to accomplishing the cleanup goal that we \nwant to achieve.\n  I do not want to preclude the Senator's debate. I would be happy to \nwithhold offering the second-degree if the Senator wants to speak on \nthis amendment? I will withhold that amendment and I will yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I just want to respond to my \ncolleague. I do not object to the Senator's second degree amendment. If \nit is passed into law, DOE is going to have to report to Congress next \nyear on the number of sites of this category, the FUSRAP program, on \nthe cost of cleanup, the numbers of sites where private parties are \ninvolved, and on the progress DOE has made in pursuing them for a \ncleanup costs.\n  We want to do these sort of things. This reporting requirement is \ncertainly a step in the right direction. DOE at last will be required \nto step up its efforts to make the private sector pay for the pollution \nit caused. It's only fair. The private sector profited enormously from \nparticipating in DOE's efforts to build the Nation's nuclear arsenal. \nThe company, however, should not escape liability for the mess they \ncreated as they did that.\n  These former DOE sites, Department of Energy sites, contain some of \nthe Nation's most dangerous and pernicious pollution problems. Their \nradioactive legacy--it is incredible--will endure for thousands if not \nmillions of years. This stuff, unfortunately, creates the energy supply \nas well as the hazard for this period of time. DOE has been shamefully \nslow and their reluctance to bring W.R. Grace into the cleanup efforts \nis inexplicable. In fact,\n\n[[Page S5988]]\n\nDOE did not begin to go after Grace as a responsible party until I \nstarted urging them to do so, now over 2 years ago.\n\n  Sadly enough, Wayne is not the only New Jersey site being managed by \nthe Department of Energy under the FUSRAP program. New Jersey has five \nof these sites, including another thorium site which threatens \nresidents of Maywood, Rochelle Park and Lodi. Like the Wayne citizens, \nthese residents, too, have been waiting patiently for lots of years to \nsee that their particular site is cleaned up.\n  This report should prove helpful in encouraging faster cleanup at \nthese sites. I support the amendment and I note the presence of my \ncolleague from New Jersey on the floor, who has worked closely with me \non matters affecting the communities, these communities that have these \nradioactive sites.\n  I am pleased to see him and to note that we worked together on these \nthings. I assume the Senator from New Jersey wants to make some \ncomments. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I want to identify myself with the \nremarks of my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, and I join with him in \noffering this amendment today. What we have before us is a classic case \nof adding insult to injury. The people of various communities in New \nJersey have lived for 40 and 50 years with the problem of thorium. The \nstories are long and often involved, but the thorium is clearly \ndangerous in the case of Maywood and the thorium in Wayne. They are all \nthe result of wartime production, the production of lanterns and bomb \nsights and other war material that required a low level of radiation.\n  In an extraordinary story of success of the U.S. Government, in the \ncase of Maywood all the thorium involving residential communities has \nnow been removed. Now we are beginning to do the same in the community \nof Wayne. But it is not enough that the people of Wayne have the \nthorium removed. The question remains who will pay the bill? This was \nnot an operation of the U.S. Government. This was not a question where \nthe Government was operating the facility and it was left for the \nresidents. This is a profitmaking corporation that had public and \nprivate contracts, earned money on the site, left it polluted, and the \ntaxpayers are now left with the bill.\n  To date, $50 million has been spent. It is estimated the final cost \ncould be as high as $120 million to remove 100,000 cubic yards of waste \nmaterial.\n  Mr. President, only several months ago, I, as Senator Lautenberg, in \nconcern that as we began to make progress in the removal of this \nthorium, wanted to know the progress and who was going to pay the bill. \nWe pressed the Department of Energy to seek legal recourse in \nrecovering costs and assuring future contributions.\n  I, too, met with the W.R. Grace Corp., and I was very pleased after \nthose meetings to receive this letter, as Congressman Pascrell, who \nrepresents this district, received this correspondence and claimed ``we \nare entered into good faith negotiations with the Department of Energy \nin an effort to fairly resolve this matter.''\n  The letter from the Grace Corp. concluded:\n\n       Grace has acted in good faith and desires to achieve an \n     amicable resolution to this problem.\n\n  Only to discover in this legislation a prohibition in section (a) and \n(b):\n\n       The Department of Energy may not recover from a party \n     described in subsection (b) any costs of response actions for \n     actual or threatened release of hazardous substances that \n     occurred before reenactment of the act.\n\n  The net result would be that all of our efforts to ensure the \nDepartment of Energy uses all legal recourse and continues in good-\nfaith negotiations, that the private parties that profited by these \noperations also bear the cost of removal of the thorium contamination, \nwould have been lost and the taxpayers would be left with the entire \ncost, $120 million.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased Senator Lautenberg and I have the \nchance today to strike this provision, and I am very pleased that \nSenator Smith, in his secondary amendment, will simply seek good-faith \nefforts in negotiations to resolve this matter. But let the record be \nclear to the Department of Energy, a good-faith resolution is nothing \nless than the Federal policy of polluter pays prevails.\n  We fully expect the Department of Energy to seek those parties who \nprofited and that they pay. We cannot allow an enormous environmental \npotential success to be transferred and transformed into a failure. As \nthe communities of Maywood have seen much of the thorium now leave, \nWayne is witnessing the first departure of that same thorium. We intend \nto see it not only removed, but the taxpayers not be left with a legacy \nof debt.\n  I am very pleased we have a chance to offer this amendment today, and \nI am glad Senator Smith is now joining us in having good-faith \nnegotiations proceed. I urge my colleagues to support both efforts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 418 to Amendment No. 417\n\n   (Purpose: To create a report for Congress regarding the Formerly \n                Utilized Sites Remedial Action program)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I think it would be \nappropriate at this time for me to offer the second-degree amendment, \nand then I believe we can get this matter resolved and go on to the \nnext amendment.\n  So I offer a second-degree amendment to Senator Lautenberg's \namendment to strike section 3138 from the national defense \nauthorization bill for fiscal year 1998. I send the amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], for himself and \n     Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered 418 to \n     amendment No. 417.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the language proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.   . REPORT ON REMEDIATION UNDER THE FORMERLY UTILIZED \n                   SITES REMEDIAL ACTION PROGRAM.\n\n       Not later than March 1, 1998, the Secretary of Energy shall \n     submit to Congress a report containing the following \n     information regarding the Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial \n     Action Program:\n       (1) How many Formerly Utilized Sites remain to be \n     remediated, what portions of these remaining sites have \n     completed remediation (including any offsite contamination), \n     what portions of the sites remain to be remediated (including \n     any offsite contamination), what types of contaminants are \n     present at each site, and what are the projected timeframes \n     for completing remediation at each site.\n       (2) What is the cost of the remaining response actions \n     necessary to address actual or threatened releases of \n     hazardous substances at each Formerly Utilized Site, \n     including any contamination that is present beyond the \n     perimeter of the facilities.\n       (3) For each site, how much it will cost to remediate the \n     radioactive contamination, and how much will it cost to \n     remediate the non-radioactive contamination.\n       (4) How many sites potentially involve private parties that \n     could be held responsible for remediation costs, including \n     remediation costs related to offsite contamination.\n       (5) What type of agreements under the Formerly Utilized \n     Sites Remedial Action Program have been entered into with \n     private parties to resolve the level of liability for \n     remediation costs at these facilities, and to what extent \n     have these agreements been tied to a distinction between \n     radioactive and non-radioactive contamination present at \n     these sites.\n       (6) What efforts have been undertaken by the Department to \n     ensure that the settlement agreements entered into with \n     private parties to resolve liability for remediation costs at \n     these facilities have been consistent on a program wide \n     basis.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am going to take a \ncouple of minutes, and then we will move on.\n  This second-degree amendment would substitute a reporting requirement \nfor the original section of section 3138 directed regarding cost \nrecovery agreements at cleanup sites managed by DOE within the so-\ncalled FUSRAP program.\n  As you know, and as we indicated earlier, there had been some \ninterest requested that limitations be placed on this Federal agency \ncost recovery from\n\n[[Page S5989]]\n\npotential responsible third parties. We were able to deal with those, \nand the Armed Services Committee does not have jurisdiction over these \nissues, but does have jurisdiction over defense-related cleanups of DOE \nsites. Section 3138 was intended to narrowly focus on concerns that \nwere related to cost recovery of FUSRAP.\n  Mr. President, basically, there are six provisions that are part of \nthat report language. They are self-explanatory. This is an attempt to \ntry to get a reasonable compromise to see to it that we save taxpayers \ndollars, at the same time to be fair and to get both parties to the \ntable as quickly as possible.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me commend the Senators from New \nJersey for this amendment and commend the Senator from New Hampshire \nfor his support of it with a second-degree amendment.\n  It is a good amendment. We support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Department of Energy, \naddressed to our chairman, dated June 19, strongly supporting, in \neffect, the amendment by stating their opposition to the provision, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Department of Energy,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1997.\n     Hon. Chairman Strom Thurmond,\n     Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Thurmond: I am writing to express strong \n     opposition to a provision, section 3138, in S. 936, National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, that would \n     prohibit the Department of Energy from recovering all legally \n     available response costs for certain actual or threatened \n     releases of hazardous substances at sites included in the \n     Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program (FUSRAP). At \n     some FUSRAP sites, the application of this provision would be \n     inconsistent with the policy that the polluter should pay the \n     cost of addressing the pollution created.\n       We strongly support removing this language and would be \n     pleased to report to the Congress on our current efforts \n     under the FUSRAP program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Alvin L. Alm,\n\n                                           Assistant Secretary for\n                                         Environmental Management.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we support the amendment. I suggest a \nvoice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the second-degree amendment No. 418.\n  The amendment (No. 418) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the \nvote by which the amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 417, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 417 ), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the \nvote by which the amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 419\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the distribution of certain information relating \n  to explosives, destructive devices, and weapons of mass destruction)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself \n     and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 419.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of subtitle E of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1074. CRIMINAL PROHIBITION ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF \n                   CERTAIN INFORMATION RELATING TO EXPLOSIVES, \n                   DESTRUCTIVE DEVICES, AND WEAPONS OF MASS \n                   DESTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Unlawful Conduct.--Section 842 of title 18, United \n     States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(l) Distribution of Information Relating to Explosives, \n     Destructive Devices, and Weapons of Mass Destruction.--\n       ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection--\n       ``(A) the term `destructive device' has the same meaning as \n     in section 921(a)(4);\n       ``(B) the term `explosive' has the same meaning as in \n     section 844(j); and\n       ``(C) the term `weapon of mass destruction' has the same \n     meaning as in section 2332a(c)(2).\n       ``(2) Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for any person--\n       ``(A) to teach or demonstrate the making or use of an \n     explosive, a destructive device, or a weapon of mass \n     destruction, or to distribute by any means information \n     pertaining to, in whole or in part, the manufacture or use of \n     an explosive, destructive device, or weapon of mass \n     destruction, with the intention that the teaching, \n     demonstration, or information be used for, or in furtherance \n     of, an activity that constitutes a Federal criminal offense \n     or a State or local criminal offense affecting interstate \n     commerce; or\n       ``(B) to teach or demonstrate to any person the making or \n     use of an explosive, a destructive device, or a weapon of \n     mass destruction, or to distribute to any person, by any \n     means, information pertaining to, in whole or in part, the \n     manufacture or use of an explosive, destructive device, or \n     weapon of mass destruction, knowing that such person intends \n     to use the teaching, demonstration, or information for, or in \n     furtherance of, an activity that constitutes a Federal \n     criminal offense or a State or local criminal offense \n     affecting interstate commerce.''.\n       (b) Penalties.--Section 844 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``person who violates \n     subsections'' and inserting the following: ``person who--\n       ``(1) violations subsections'';\n       (2) by striking the period at the end and inserting ``; \n     and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) violates subsection (l)(2) of section 842 of this \n     chapter, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more \n     than 20 years, or both.''; and\n       (2) in subsection (j), by striking ``and (i)'' and \n     inserting ``(i), and (l)''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send this amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Biden and myself.\n  For 3 years, Senator Biden and I have sent an amendment to the desk \nwhich would prohibit the teaching of bomb making. Twice it passed this \nbody by unanimous consent, and twice in conference the amendment was \ntaken out.\n  Last year, when we made this amendment and this body graciously and, \nI believe, wisely accepted it, it was replaced in conference with the \nproviso that the Department of Justice would do a report to see whether \nthis amendment was well advised and would stand a constitutional test.\n  On April 29 of this year, the Department of Justice published a \nreport, and that report was entitled, ``Report on the Availability of \nBomb Making Information, The Extent to Which Its Dissemination is \nControlled by Federal Law, and the Extent to Which Such Dissemination \nMay be Subject to Regulation Consistent with the First Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution.''\n  The bottom line of the report is that the Department of Justice \nagrees that it would be appropriate and beneficial to adopt further \nlegislation to address the problem of teaching bomb making directly, if \nthat can be accomplished in a manner that does not impermissibly \nrestrict the wholly legitimate publication and teaching of such \ninformation or otherwise violate the first amendment.\n  In other words, the question presented by this is, when does the \nfirst amendment end and when does conspiracy to commit a felony begin?\n  So the language in the amendment that we submit to this body today \nhas been reworked, strengthened and approved by the Department of \nJustice. I would like to briefly read it. The language is as follows:\n\n       It shall be unlawful for any person--\n       (A) to teach or demonstrate the making or use of an \n     explosive, a destructive device, or a weapon of mass \n     destruction, or to distribute by any means information \n     pertaining to, in whole or in part, the manufacture or use\n\n[[Page S5990]]\n\n     of an explosive, destructive device, or weapon of mass \n     destruction, with the intention that the teaching, \n     demonstration, or information be used for, or in furtherance \n     of, an activity that constitutes a Federal criminal offense \n     or a State or local criminal offense affecting interstate \n     commerce . . .\n\n  Then there is an alternative:\n\n       or (b) to teach or demonstrate to any person the making or \n     use of an explosive, a destructive device, or a weapon of \n     mass destruction . . . knowing that such person intends to \n     use the teaching, demonstration, or information for, or in \n     furtherance of, an activity that constitutes a Federal \n     criminal offense or a State or local criminal offense \n     affecting interstate commerce.\n\n  The penalty for violating this law would be a fine of $250,000 or a \nmaximum of 20 years in prison, or both.\n  Mr. President, according to terrorism expert, Neil Livingston, there \nare more than 1,600 so-called mayhem-manuals in circulation. I outlined \nsome examples of what I am talking about.\n  I will never forget, Mr. President, and you are a member of the \nJudiciary Committee--I don't believe you were on the committee at the \ntime--but when a document entitled ``The Terrorist's Handbook'' was \ncirculated, I believe at that time Senator Kennedy and I couldn't \nbelieve it. So I went back to my office and asked my staff to download \nwhat is called ``The Terrorist's Handbook.'' The cover of ``The \nTerrorist's Handbook'' reads something like this:\n\n       Stuff you are not supposed to know about.\n       Whether you are planning to blow up the World Trade Center, \n     or merely explode a few small devices on the White House \n     lawn, the Terrorist's Handbook is an invaluable guide to \n     having a good time. Where else can you get such wonderful \n     ideas about how to use up all that extra ammonium triiodide \n     left over from last year's revolution?\n  And then this handbook, which I have in my hand, goes on to tell \npeople how to break into a building, how to pick a lock, how to break \ninto a chem lab in a college, how to look like a student. It produces \ntechniques for picking locks. It goes on and tells you what useful \nhousehold chemicals you should use. And then it goes on to explain, \nwith specificity, how to make a light-bulb bomb, a book bomb, a phone \nbomb, and it goes on and on and on.\n  Mr. President, there is no legal, legitimate use for a phone bomb, \nfor a book bomb, for a baby-food bomb, all of which are described in \nthis handbook. When it is put in this context, the context of \ncriminality, it is my belief that the person who puts this up on the \nInternet becomes a conspirator in the ability to commit a major crime \nin the United States.\n  An interesting thing that we have found is that individuals who have \ncommitted these crimes have actually had at least some of these \npublications in their home when they were arrested.\n  According to the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, the following \npublications were found among Timothy McVeigh's possessions: ``Homemade \nC-4, A Recipe for Survival.'' My staff just went over to the Library of \nCongress and tried to take out a copy of this. Incidentally, it is \nmissing from the library.\n  ``Ragnar's Big Book of Homemade Weapons and Improvised Explosives.''\n  So we know that materials on the Internet are used by terrorists to \ncommit terrorist acts. We also know that the number of explosive \ndevices now being found are increasing. Authorities have stated that \nthe rise is attributable to a rise in Internet use. This is certainly \ntrue in Los Angeles County. During the first half of 1996, these \nnumbers of explosive devices have increased dramatically; 178 were \nfound compared to 86 total in 1995.\n  Responses by the Los Angeles Police Department to reports of \nsuspected bombs have shot up more than 35 percent from 1994 to 1995. \nThe LAPD found 41 explosives in 1995, more than double the number 3 \nyears ago. And it goes on and on and on.\n  One thing is also very interesting. Not only are terrorists using \nthis, but children are using this.\n  Not too long ago there was a cartoon in a newspaper. It really \ndescribes what is happening. A mother is on the telephone saying to a \nfriend, ``* * * history, astronomy, science, Bobby is learning so much \non the Internet * * *'' And there is Bobby sitting by his computer, and \nwhat Bobby is doing here is putting a timer on six sticks of dynamite \nlooking at the Internet and following the recipe. Of course what that \nleads to is something like this:\n\n       Three Boys used Internet to Plot School Bombing, Police \n     Say.\n\n  That is the New York Times.\n  Something like this:\n\n       Internet Cited for Surge in Bomb Reports.\n       Police and sheriffs officials say Web sites provide \n     youngsters with information on making explosives.\n\n  Yesterday, June 18, the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel reported on the \npending trial of 15-year-olds Burke DeCesare and Adam Walker, who were \ncharged with planting a bomb in their Catholic school. They are eighth \ngraders. They live in the Bayview neighborhood. They broke into Saint \nColeman Catholic School in Pompano Beach around 2 a.m. on February 24, \n1996. They planted a gasoline bomb in the ceiling of classroom 116.\n  Bomb experts from the Broward Sheriff's Office said the device, made \nwith gasoline, was wired to explode at the flick of a light switch. \nThis is taught--the recipe for this is in one of these manuals. The \nboys told police they got the instructions to build the bomb from the \nInternet.\n  Nine days ago, on June 10, 1997, the Cleveland Dispatch reported the \narrest of a North Side 15-year-old who built a homemade bomb with \ninformation he gathered from the Internet. The Columbus Fire Division \nbomb squad was required to remove devices from the kitchen and the \nbasement of the parents' homes. Neighbors, who lived within 500 feet of \nthe home, were evacuated for 2 hours.\n  Columbus police reported that one device consisted of a quart Mason \njar containing lighter fluid and Styrofoam, with an M-90 inserted into \nthe Mason jar cap which served as an igniter. This young man told his \nparents he learned to make the bomb on the Internet.\n  Last month, the Los Angeles Times reported that two 14-year-old boys \nwere arrested in Yorba Linda, CA, after crafting eight pipe bombs and \ndetonating one of them. The bomb caused a fire, charring 400 feet of \nland behind a home on Grandview Avenue. After admitting they sparked \nthe fire with the bomb, the boys told investigators they had seven more \nbombs inside the house. The bombs were fashioned with information from \nthe Internet.\n  In May of this year, the Baltimore Sun reported that two teenagers in \nFinland face charges over an explosion from Finland's second ``Internet \nbomb'' in a week. Sixty people were evacuated. And it goes on and on \nand on.\n  In Orange County, police say teenagers may have used the Internet to \nhelp construct acid-filled bottle bombs in Mission Viejo and Huntington \nBeach, one of which burned a 5-year-old boy when he found it on a \nschool playground.\n  According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, between \n1992 and 1995, 15 juveniles were killed and 366 injured in the United \nStates while making explosive devices. Most of this comes right off of \nthe Internet.\n\n  The Justice Department, on a single Web site, obtained the titles to \nover 110 different bombmaking texts.\n  The point here is that this material is now so easy to get. When it \nis put in something like a terrorist handbook and you are told what to \nuse, how to steal it, how to dress like a college student, how to break \ninto a chem lab, how to use cardboard to stuff in the lock so you can \ncome back at night, how to go home and how to go into your kitchen and \nmake one of these bombs, and then how to go out and explode it wherever \nyou want--there is no legitimate legal use for this information.\n  There is only a criminal purpose for this information. There is no \nlegal use for a baby food bomb, for a phone bomb, for a book bomb. You \ndo not blow up a tree stump if you are a farmer in the field with one \nof these. There is no legal use. So I am hopeful--I know that we are \ninto the third year of this amendment--that it will in fact survive a \nconference committee. I understand that both sides are willing to \naccept the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the \nDepartment of Justice report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5991]]\n\n Summary of the Report on the Availability of Bombmaking Information, \nThe Extent to Which its Dissemination is Controlled by Federal Law, and \n  the Extent to Which Such Dissemination May be Subject to Regulation \n      Consistent with the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution\n\n              (Prepared by the U.S. Department of Justice)\n\n\n                        Introduction and Summary\n\n       In section 709(a) of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death \n     Penalty Act of 1996 [``the AEDPA''], Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 \n     Stat. 1214, 1297 (1996), Congress provided that, in \n     consultation with such other officials and individuals as she \n     considers appropriate, the Attorney General shall conduct a \n     study concerning--\n       (1) the extent to which there is available to the public \n     material in any medium (including print, electronic, or film) \n     that provides instruction on how to make bombs, destructive \n     devices, or weapons of mass destruction;\n       (2) the extent to which information gained from such \n     material has been used in incidents of domestic or \n     international terrorism;\n       (3) the likelihood that such information may be used in \n     future incidents of terrorism;\n       (4) the application of Federal laws in effect on the date \n     of enactment of this Act to such material;\n       (5) the need and utility, if any, for additional laws \n     relating to such material; and\n       (6) an assessment of the extent to which the first \n     amendment protects such material and its private and \n     commercial distribution.\n     Section 709(b) of the AEDPA, in turn, requires the Attorney \n     General to submit to the Congress a report containing the \n     results of the study, and to make that report available to \n     the public.\n       Following enactment of the AEDPA, a committee was \n     established within the Department of Justice [``the DOJ \n     Committee''], comprised of departmental attorneys as well as \n     law enforcement officials of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation and the Treasury Department's Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The committee members divided \n     responsibility for undertaking the tasks mandated by section \n     709. Some members canvassed reference sources, including the \n     Internet, to determine the facility with which information \n     relating to the manufacture of bombs, destructive devices and \n     other weapons of mass destruction could be obtained. Criminal \n     investigators reviewed their files to determine the extent to \n     which such published information was likely to have been used \n     by persons known to have manufactured bombs and destructive \n     devices for criminal purposes. And legal experts within the \n     Department of Justice reviewed extant federal criminal law \n     and judicial precedent to assess the extent to which the \n     dissemination of bombmaking information is now restricted by \n     federal law, and the extent to which it may be restricted, \n     consistent with constitutional principles. This Report \n     summarizes the results of these efforts.\n       As explained in this Report, the DOJ committee has \n     determined that anyone interested in manufacturing a bomb, \n     dangerous weapon, or a weapon of mass destruction can easily \n     obtain detailed instructions from readily accessible sources, \n     such as legitimate reference books, the so-called underground \n     press, and the Internet. Circumstantial evidence suggests \n     that, in a number of crimes involving the employment of \n     such weapons and devices, defendants have relied upon such \n     material in manufacturing and using such items. Law \n     enforcement agencies believe that, because the \n     availability of bombmaking information is becoming \n     increasingly widespread (over the Internet and from other \n     sources), such published instructions will continue to \n     play a significant role in aiding those intent upon \n     committing future acts of terrorism and violence.\n       While current federal laws--such as those prohibiting \n     conspiracy, solicitation, aiding and abetting, providing \n     material support for terrorist activities, and unlawfully \n     furthering civil disorders--may, in some instances, proscribe \n     the dissemination of bombmaking information, no extant \n     federal statute provides a satisfactory basis for prosecution \n     in certain classes of cases that Senators Feinstein and Biden \n     have identified as particularly troublesome. Senator \n     Feinstein introduced legislation during the last Congress in \n     an attempt to fill this gap. The Department of Justice agrees \n     that it would be appropriate and beneficial to adopt further \n     legislation to address this problem directly, if that can be \n     accomplished in a manner that does not impermissibly restrict \n     the wholly legitimate publication and teaching of such \n     information, or otherwise violate the First Amendment.\n       The First Amendment would impose substantial constraints on \n     any attempt to proscribe indiscriminately the dissemination \n     of bombmaking information. The government generally may not, \n     except in rare circumstances, punish persons either for \n     advocating lawless action or for disseminating truthful \n     information--including information that would be dangerous if \n     used--that such persons have obtained lawfully. However, the \n     constitutional analysis is quite different where the \n     government punishes speech that is an integral part of a \n     transaction involving conduct the government otherwise is \n     empowered to prohibit; such ``speech acts''--for instance, \n     many cases of inchoate crimes such as aiding and abetting and \n     conspiracy--may be proscribed without much, if any, concern \n     about the First Amendment, since it is merely incidental that \n     such ``conduct'' takes the form of speech.\n       Accordingly, we have concluded that Senator Feinstein's \n     proposal can withstand constitutional muster in most, if not \n     all, of its possible applications, if such legislation is \n     slightly modified in several respects that we propose at the \n     conclusion of this Report. As modified, the proposed \n     legislation would be likely to maximize the ability of the \n     Federal Government--consistent with free speech protections--\n     to reach cases where an individual disseminates information \n     on how to manufacture or use explosives or weapons of mass \n     destruction either (i) with the intent that the information \n     be used to facilitate criminal conduct, or (ii) with the \n     knowledge that a particular recipient of the information \n     intends to use it in furtherance of criminal activity.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I conclude my statement simply with \nthis. This amendment has been put into this bill once before. It has \nbeen put into the terrorism bill once. It has been passed by this body \ntwice. It has been reworked to withstand a first amendment challenge. I \nam hopeful, with the history of what is happening in this country, that \nAmericans all across this land will say there is no first amendment \nright to be a conspirator and teach someone how to make a bomb to blow \nsomeone else up. So I am hopeful that this year it might survive a \nconference.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We are checking with one Senator who we understand may \nwish to be heard on this amendment. I just want to notify the Senate of \nthat. I see, though, the chairman is on his feet, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have no objection to the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of subtitle E of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. . SUPERCOMPUTER EXPORT CONTROL.\n\n       (a) Export Licensing Without Regard to End-Use and End-\n     User.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, effective upon the date of enactment of this Act, \n     computers described in paragraph (2) shall only be exported \n     to a Computer Tier 3 country pursuant to an export license \n     issued by the Secretary of Commerce.\n       (2) Computers described.--A computer described in this \n     paragraph is a computer with a composite theoretical \n     performance equal to or greater than 2,000 million \n     theoretical operations per second.\n       (b) Limitation on Reexport.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should enact legislation to require that any \n     computer described in subsection (a)(2) that is exported to a \n     Computer Tier 1 or Computer Tier 2 country shall only be \n     reexported to a Computer Tier 3 country (or, in the case of a \n     computer exported to a Computer Tier 3 country pursuant to \n     subsection (a), reexported to another Computer Tier 3 \n     country) pursuant to an export license approved by the \n     Secretary of Commerce and that the preceding requirement be \n     included as a provision in the contract of sale of any such \n     computer to a Computer Tier 1, Computer Tier 2, or Computer \n     Tier 3 country.\n       (3) Computer Tiers Defined.--In this section, the terms \n     ``Computer Tier 1'', ``Computer Tier 2'', and ``Computer Tier \n     3'' have\n\n[[Page S5992]]\n\n     the meanings given such terms in section 740.7 of title 15, \n     Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on the 11th of June, my Subcommittee on \nInternational Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services of the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs held a hearing on the subject of \nproliferation and U.S. dual-use export controls. The hearing focused \nalmost entirely on the subject of U.S. exports of high-performance \ncomputers, also known as supercomputers.\n  In preparing for and conducting this hearing, we learned that the \nadministration's policy on supercomputers, which are an integral \ncomponent for developing, producing and maintaining nuclear weapons, \nballistic missiles, and practically all advanced weapon systems, could \nput American lives and interests at risk.\n  I am offering this amendment as a necessary first step to staunch the \nflow of American-made supercomputers to countries and places they \nshould not be going.\n  On October 6, 1995, President Clinton announced a new export control \npolicy for supercomputers which decontrolled supercomputer exports to a \ngreat extent. He said that he had ``decided to eliminate controls on \nthe exports of all computers to countries in North America, most of \nEurope, and parts of Asia.'' Continuing further, ``For the former \nSoviet Union, China, and a number of other countries, we will focus our \ncontrols on computers intended for military end uses or users, while \neasing them on the export of computers to civilian customers.''\n  There is, of course, a delicate balance that must be struck between \npresenting U.S. national security by controlling dual-use exports and \npromoting exports. We must be careful not to place American \nmanufacturers in a position where they cannot export goods that other \ncountries are exporting, though, of course, our national security \ninterests dictate that some goods cannot be sold to some countries no \nmatter how irresponsibly other countries behave. For example, the \nwillingness of some Western European countries to work with Libya to \nconstruct a chemical weapons complex does not justify the involvement \nof United States companies in similar ventures.\n  President Clinton's October 6, 1995, announcement liberalizing U.S. \nexport controls on supercomputers established four country tiers to \nguide American exporters, at the same time eliminating restrictions on \nthe export of computers capable of less than 2,000 million theoretical \noperations per second-- this is referred to as an MTOPS--for all except \ntier 4 countries, it is unrestricted if the computers are capable of \nless than 2,000 MTOPS. Whether it makes sense to decontrol computers \ncapable of up to that level is one of the issues which should be \nstudied more extensively. I will ask the General Accounting Office to \ndo so.\n  Country tier 1, consisting primarily of NATO allies, effectively \nestablishes a license-free zone for U.S. high-performance computer \nexports. Computers of unlimited capacity under this policy can be \nexported to any tier 1 country without regard to the identity of the \nend user or the intended end use.\n  The policy for country tier 2, which includes countries such as South \nKorea, Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic, allows unlicensed \nexports to any country within this tier of computers capable up to \n10,000 million theoretical operations per second. And the policy \ncontinues the virtual embargo against those nations--the terrorist \nnations such as Iran, Iraq, Syria, and North Korea--that comprise \ncountry tier 4. There are many deficiencies in this new policy, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Our amendment addresses what we consider to be the most significant \ndeficiency in need of immediate attention. It is a problem specific to \nthe part of the policy pertaining to country tier 3 which I want to \ndescribe now. The policy announced by President Clinton for tier 3 \ncountries, which include Russia, China, and some others, is based \nentirely upon the questions of who the end user will be and for what \nend use the supercomputer is intended. End use and end user are the \ncritical factors for tier 3 exports.\n  The tier 3 policy requires an export license to be granted by the \nDepartment of Commerce under only two circumstances: First, if the \ncomputer to be exported is capable of 2,000 MTOPS and is going to a \nmilitary end use or end user; and second, if the computer to be \nexported is capable of 7,000 MTOPS and is going to a civilian end use \nand end user. This policy requires no export license for manufacturers \nwho want to sell supercomputers capable between 2,000 and 7,000 MTOPS \nto buyers in tier 3 countries when there is to be a civilian end use \nand end user. It is the exporter--not the Department of Commerce, not \nthe U.S. Government--who is given the latitude under the policy for \ndetermining whether the purchaser's representations are accurate, that \nit is not a military end user and will not use the supercomputer for a \nmilitary purpose.\n  The Clinton administration policy further requires American exporters \nto act on the honor system, policing themselves and deciding themselves \nwhether or not the end user is going to be a military entity or will be \nputting the supercomputer to a military use.\n  Unfortunately, some companies have already been tempted to take a \nchance. Maybe they were not sure; maybe they were tempted by the \nprofits of the transaction. Whatever the motivations and the \nunderstandings or lack of information, or for whatever the reason, we \nhave known that some transactions have involved the sale of \nsupercomputers, without objection from our Department of Commerce or \nour Federal Government to those who may be putting computers to a \nmilitary use, or maybe military entities themselves.\n  We know now, for example, based on statements from the Russian \nMinister of Atomic Energy and from United States Government officials, \nthat there are at least five American supercomputers in two of Russia's \nnuclear weapons labs: Chelyabinsk-70 and Arzamas-16. Minister Mikhailov \nof the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy has not been reluctant to \nproclaim what these high-performance computers will be used for, and he \nsaid in a speech in January they will be used to simulate nuclear \nexplosions, and that the computers are, in his words, ``10 times faster \nthan any previously available in Russia.''\n  Four of the five supercomputers we are aware of publicly in Russia's \nnuclear weapons labs came from Silicon Graphics, a company in \nCalifornia, I think. According to the CEO, Edward McCracken, it was his \ncompany's understanding that the computers were for environmental and \necological purposes. It may be that Silicon Graphics was unable to \ndetermine whether a Russian nuclear weapons lab was going to be the \nmilitary end user or if its supercomputers would be put to a military \nend use. But it seems from the statements made by the Atomic Energy \nMinister in Russia that they certainly are available to them for those \npurposes.\n  We also know at least 47 high-performance computers have been \nexported without licenses to the People's Republic of China. One of the \ncomputers sold also by Silicon Graphics is now operating in the Chinese \nAcademy of Sciences. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is a key \nparticipant in military research and development, and works on \neverything from the DF-5 ICBM--which, incidentally, is capable of \nreaching the United States--to uranium enrichment for nuclear weapons. \nThere can be no question about the Chinese Academy of Science's status \nas a military end- user.\n  According to the Department, its new Silicon Graphic Power Challenge \nXL supercomputer provides it with computational power previously \nunknown, which is available to all the major scientific and \ntechnological institutes across China. We can only hope that some of \nthese institutes in China are using the supercomputer's technology for \npeaceful purposes, but we cannot help but suspect that some may be a \npart of the weapons development program in China, which is on a fast \ntrack to modernize their nuclear weapons system and capabilities and \ntheir missile technologies and all the rest.\n  At our recent hearing, we had the benefit of testimony from the Under \nSecretary of Commerce for Export Administration, William Reinsch, who \nsaid that the Clinton administration doesn't know if any of the \nsupercomputers in China or Russia are being used for weapons-related \nactivities, but the Commerce Department is in a difficult position. You \nhave to appreciate how difficult it must be to have the responsibility \nfor both promoting exports\n\n[[Page S5993]]\n\nand controlling exports, and that is the dilemma that this Department \nis in. But we have to realize that nuclear weapons labs are potential \nend users and have been shown already by the evidence before our \ncommittee that they have obtained American supercomputers and they may \nbe put to a military end use.\n  In 1986, the Department of Energy published an unclassified report \nentitled, ``The Need for Supercomputers in Nuclear Weapons Design.'' \nThe report's conclusion included this statement: ``The use of high-\nspeed computers and mathematical models to simulate complex physical \nprocesses has been and continues to be the cornerstone of the nuclear \nweapons design program.'' These computers continue to be important to \nthe design and production of nuclear weapons and other types of weapons \nof mass destruction and delivery systems.\n  I do not see how we can tolerate the continuation of a policy that \nmakes it easier for Russia and China to modernize their nuclear weapons \nand delivery systems. We ought not to be in the business of helping \nthem to improve the quality of our weapons, their technology, their \ndelivery systems, particularly when there is evidence of proliferation \nfrom those countries to other countries.\n  This amendment, I want to point out, does not include a comprehensive \nrevision of our export control policy. It is targeted to one specific \npart of the policy. We hope that with the findings that are obtained \nfrom the General Accounting Office study and our further studies in our \nsubcommittee, which is reviewing this entire issue and proliferation \nproblems generally, that we will be able to come up with and work with \nthe administration and hopefully develop a consensus agreement on a \nmodification of our export policy.\n  We think the time is here, it is now, when we need to stop the \nunrestricted flow of these supercomputers to potential users all around \nthe world that can threaten our Nation's security and put at risk \nAmerican citizens. It is not like some other country has these systems \navailable for sale on the market. They do not. We are the state-of-the-\nart producer of the supercomputers. Japan has the capacity to produce \nsupercomputers as well, but their export policy is more restrictive now \nthan ours is. So we are the culprit, if we are putting in the hand of \nmilitary end users and military weapon system producers in other \ncountries technologies that are superior to what they have now and that \ncan be used to make more lethal their nuclear weapons and their missile \nsystems. We are putting in jeopardy the lives of our own citizens.\n  I am hopeful that this amendment, in concert with other efforts that \nwe are making, will help improve our capacity to monitor these exports \nand require license in those situations where we think this export \nmight present a proliferation problem, because we know from previous \nexperience in Russia and China, as well, private companies have \ndemonstrated that they do not have the adequate restraints to make \ndeterminations about where and how their exports are distributed into \nother country's hands. We know that transshipments are occurring. We \nalso know that it is difficult to verify in a country like China what \nthe private company that may be the purchaser of a supercomputer really \nintends to do with it once they have it. It is difficult to get access, \nto get information, and so a private company has a very difficult time \ndeveloping an information base on which it can really make a conclusion \nabout the end use or the end user. That is another reason to change \nthis policy. The Commerce Department is going to have to do a better \njob of compiling information about those who are in the market \nworldwide for these supercomputers and making this information \navailable to our exporters and the companies that have these \nsupercomputers for sale.\n  Mr. President, I encourage the Senate to look very carefully at this \nproposal. I hope that the amendment will be agreed to. Senator Durbin \nand I were involved in questioning witnesses before our subcommittee \njust recently on this subject, and we are convinced that this is a \npolicy that has to be changed, and the time to change it is right now.\n  Our amendment does not in any way change the policy President Clinton \nannounced in October 1995, though it is my judgment that the entire \npolicy is in need of serious evaluation and revision, and I will also \nbe asking the General Accounting Office to assist me in this \nevaluation. Our amendment requires the Department of Commerce, in \nconcert with other parts of the executive branch, to determine whether \nan entity in a tier 3 country is a military or civilian end-user, and \nwhether the end-use will be for a military or civilian purpose. By \ntheir exports to Russian and Chinese nuclear weapons labs, private \ncompanies have demonstrated that they do not do an adequate job of \nmaking this determination. Government has the resources and information \navailable to make the best determination possible, and should step in \nto ensure that America's national security is not being compromised for \nsake of a more profitable quarter.\n  In a country like the People's Republic of China, how can any private \ncompany have the resources to determine whether an end-user is military \nor civilian?\n  Some suggest that the process can be left unchanged, but that the \nCommerce Department can do a better job of helping industry make the \nproper end-use and end-user determination by publishing a list of end-\nusers to which high performance computer exports are prohibited. I \ndisagree with this suggestion. Any published list would necessarily be \nincomplete, for a complete list would compromise U.S. intelligence \nsources and methods. Any published list would also serve as a marketing \ntool for the world's proliferators, making their job of finding \nspecific clients easier. And, any published list would be only too easy \nto manipulate by both the purchaser and the exporter who may not be \nwilling to operate under the honor system. If, for example, \nChelyabinsk-70 is on the list of prohibited locations, does that mean \nthat a Chelyabinsk-71, not on the list, can receive U.S. exports of \nhigh performance computers? What's to stop an exporter like Silicon \nGraphics from accepting the convenient suggestion that, ``yes, \nChelyabinsk-70 does nuclear weapons work, but at Chelyabinsk-71 we \nconduct only environmental research.''\n  Publishing a list could reduce, but not eliminate, the problem we \nface, though in so doing other serious problems would be created. \nCongress needs to change the current process so the Government--with \nthe most access to information with which to make the most informed \ndetermination of military end-use and end-user--makes the decision on \nwhether to ship these computers to countries who are modernizing their \nweapons and delivery systems and engaged in proliferation of these \ntechnologies. America should not be participating in the qualitative \nupgrade of Russian and Chinese proliferant activities.\n  The Commerce Department maintains that President Clinton's \nsupercomputer export control policy is working. Commerce continues to \nmake this claim despite the fact that the administration's policy has \nallowed American supercomputers to be shipped to Russia's and China's \nnuclear weapons complexes, and who knows where else. If this policy is \nworking, what would a policy that wasn't working look like? Would there \nbe more supercomputers in Russia and China, or would we know absolutely \nthat our supercomputers were in Iran, North Korea, or other terrorist \nstates?\n  The cold war's end does not decrease the need for the continued \nsafeguarding of sensitive American dual-use technology. While there may \nno longer be a single, overarching enemy of the United States, there is \nlittle doubt that many rogue states, and perhaps others, have interests \nclearly contrary to those of the United States. Helping these nations--\nor helping other nations to help these nations--to acquire sensitive \ndual-use technology capable of threatening American lives and interests \nmakes no sense.\n  I thank Senator Durbin for his work with me on this issue, and look \nforward to continuing to work with him to get to the bottom of this \nproblem. I encourage all of my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S5994]]\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that the \nprivilege of the floor be granted to Lamelle Rawlins during the \npendency of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nMississippi, Senator Cochran, as a cosponsor of this important \namendment. I think anyone who had attended our hearing within the last \n2 weeks on this issue would have been shocked at what they learned. We \nhave expanded opportunities for the purchase of some of the most \nvaluable technology in the world. It is technology developed in the \nUnited States, which has no parallel anywhere else in the world, and we \nare selling it. The fact that we are selling it is nothing new. The \nUnited States has done that for years. But this technology is so \nimportant and sensitive that the people who buy it automatically \nacquire a capacity, a capability that they have never had in their \nhistory. In other words, our expertise, our knowledge, our \ntechnological skill is being sold.\n  What makes this particularly important is that this very technology \nhas the capacity to give to the purchasing country the skills and \nabilities that they have never had before to develop things that are \nvery positive, on one hand, but also potentially very negative. I was \nreminded of a quotation that is attributed to Mr. Lenin in the early \ndays of his establishment of the Soviet republics. He said that it was \nhis belief that ``a capitalist would sell you the rope that you would \nuse to hang him.'' I thought about that over and over, as we discussed \nthis question of selling these computers to countries like China and \nRussia, which have the capacity to allow them to develop extraordinary \nmilitary capability.\n  Recent news accounts about sales of supercomputers to Russian nuclear \nweapons labs and the Chinese Academy of Sciences--in apparent \ncircumvention of United States export control regulations--have raised \ntroubling questions about the control that the United States exercises \nover supercomputer exports.\n  China has purchased at least 46 United States supercomputers. Of \nthese, 32 are one particular model that is faster than two-thirds of \nthe classified computer systems available to our own Department of \nDefense, including the United States Naval Underwater Weapons Center, \nUnited States Army TACOM, and United States Air Force/National Test \nFacility.\n  The Commerce Department and the Justice Department are investigating \nthe unlicensed sale--unlicensed sale--of four over-2000 MTOPS computers \nto the Russian nuclear weapons facility Chelyabinsk-70.\n  The computers recently sold are 10 times more powerful than anything \nRussia ever had before, and we sold it to them.\n  There is ample room for mistakes and confusion in the current dual-\nuse export control system for supercomputers.\n  According to a New York Times article on February 25 of this year, in \nan effort to circumvent United States export controls, Russia's nuclear \nweapons establishment obtained a powerful IBM supercomputer through a \nEuropean middleman and said they planned to use it to simulate nuclear \ntests.\n  I was on this floor 2 weeks ago giving a speech about a test ban, \nrecalling the speech given by President Kennedy before American \nUniversity in 1963. I came to the floor with Senator Harkin and said it \nis time for us to have a comprehensive nuclear test ban, moving toward \nthe day when there are no nuclear weapons threatening this world. In \nthe world we live in today, you don't need to detonate a nuclear \nweapon. If you have a supercomputer, which can simulate that \ndetonation, you can derive the same information--or a lot of it--\nthrough this model and through this technology. These are the very same \ncomputers and capabilities that we are selling.\n  The Nation's export controls for supercomputers ``amount to a kind of \nhonor system,'' according to one U.S. official quoted in the Wall \nStreet Journal. Companies that have doubt about a customer's activities \nare expected to call the U.S. Government for advice.\n\n  Think about that. You have a computer company and you have a sale \nworth millions of dollars and you don't know whether it is going to be \nused for a peaceful purpose or a military purpose. Well, the honor \nsystem says it is time to call the Department of Commerce and check it \nout and see if they have any records or classified information. They \nmay not share the information with you, but they may tell you there is \nsome concern. But it is an honor system. There is nothing built into \nthe law to guarantee this kind of surveillance, this kind of \nsupervision.\n  Companies may fail to obtain licenses to sell supercomputers ordered \nfor civilian purposes, such as weather forecasting or air pollution \nstudies or natural resources prospecting and development, but these \ncomputers end up in places which do design work for nuclear weapons \nprograms--not a civilian use. Companies may knowingly ignore licensing \nrequirements or, alternatively, companies may unwittingly fail to \nrecognize a suspect end-user.\n  The first step toward better export controls is better communication. \nIncreased accountability and interaction between industry and the \nFederal Government called for by this amendment will help facilitate \nthat interchange.\n  Even William Reinsch, the Undersecretary for Export Administration \nfor the Commerce Department, quoted by Senator Cochran with whom I \nshare the sponsorship of this amendment, testified at the Governmental \nAffairs subcommittee hearing last week, agreed that better \ncommunication is essential. He invited and encouraged companies to \nconsult with the Commerce Department when faced with challenging sales \ndecisions.\n  The current system for supercomputer exports involves controls on \nhigh-power computer exports set forth in Federal regulations that \ndivide the countries of the world into various categories, or tiers.\n  The licensing policies vary depending on which category the country \nfalls into. There are countries for which no export license is \nrequired--tier 1--some countries for which licenses are required for \nextraordinarily high performance machines--tier 2--some for which \nlicenses are required, depending on whether the end-use is military \nrather than civilian--tier 3--and countries for which sales are totally \nbanned--tier 4.\n  The tier 3 countries include India, Pakistan, all of the Middle East/\nMaghreb, the former Soviet Union, China, Vietnam, and the rest of \nEastern Europe.\n  Under current rules, export licenses are required to export or re-\nexport computers with a composite theoretical performance, known as \nCTP, greater than 2000 MTOPS to military end-users and end-uses and to \nnuclear, chemical, biological, or missile end-users and end-uses in \ntier 3 countries.\n  However, for civilian end-users or end-uses that don't fall into a \nmilitary or proliferation category, licenses are not required for \nexport or re-export of computers under 7000 MTOPS to these countries.\n  What this means is that for many sales, no Government oversight or \ndecisionmaking takes place at the front end if the exporter determines \nthat he is selling to a company that portrays itself as a civilian user \nbecause no license is required.\n  Because of the differences in the licensing rules that apply to \nexports for military and proliferation uses than those governing sales \nfor civilian use, the U.S. Government plays no upfront role in \ndetermining whether the end-use of a supercomputer under 7000 MTOPS \nsold to a buyer in a tier 3 country is indeed to be used for a civilian \npurpose.\n  I know this is involved, I know that it is complicated. Let me try to \ncut to the bottom line. If a company in the United States seeks to sell \na supercomputer, one of great capacity, and the end-user, the company \nthat is buying in another country, says this is strictly for a civilian \npurpose, it is not going to be used for anything of a military \ncapacity, there are virtually no controls on that sale; nor is there \nmuch of anything done to track that sale, once it is made, as to where \nthat computer actually ends up.\n\n  The responsibility is all on the shoulders of the manufacturer or \nexporter to make the determination on whether or not a license is \nneeded, whether or not the computer might be used for military \npurposes. Exporters run the risk\n\n[[Page S5995]]\n\nof relying on assurances of the purchasers or their own intelligence \ninformation about end-use, rather than the resources of the Government. \nEither intentionally or inadvertently, exporters have made sales to \ndestinations for which a license should have been obtained, because of \nend-use, but was not.\n  The Cochran-Durbin amendment would require that all U.S. exports of \nsupercomputers above 2,000 million theoretical operations per second--a \nmeasure of the computer's speed--to a tier 3 country be licensed by the \nCommerce Department.\n  The presently more lenient requirements for civilian end-use sales in \nthis category would be made identical to stricter ones applicable to \nsales for military proliferation purposes.\n  The amendment would shift responsibility from industry to the \nGovernment for deciding the propriety and conditions of the sales.\n  By subjecting all such sales above 2,000 MTOPS to licensing \nrequirements, the United States may be able to prevent the uncontrolled \nflow of technology for unauthorized use or diversion to purchasers in \ncountries who may have vastly different interests than those of the \nUnited States.\n  Civilian sales of supercomputers above 2,000 MTOPS to purchasers in \ntier 3 countries would be reviewed and approved by the Commerce \nDepartment, using the same standards used in licensing military and \nproliferation sales to these countries.\n  In addition, the amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that \nCongress should enact legislation requiring that any computer exceeding \n2,000 MTOPS exported to a tier 1 or tier 2 country shall only be \nreexported to a tier 3 country, or reexported by a tier 3 country to \nanother tier 3 country, pursuant to an export license approved by the \nSecretary of Commerce.\n  We are trying to track these computers, once sold, and determine \nwhere they are going to end up. We are saying to those countries, whom \nwe consider to be our allies and friends, that we are going to ask you \nto bear responsibility for the end-use of the computer. We don't want \nyou to be a conduit for the sale of a computer to a country where the \nUnited States suspects it may be used for military purposes.\n  The sense of the Senate would call for legislation that would require \nany reexport to a tier 3 country would have to be done under U.S. \nexport license. This amendment is clearly necessary. I urge my \ncolleagues to join Senator Cochran and myself. If you had listened to \nthe testimony, as we did, you would have discovered, as I did, that \nthere has been a dramatic increase in technology and expertise in this \nfield. It is estimated that every 9 months to a year most of the \ncomputers that we are talking about become obsolete and move on to \nhigher standards.\n  The United States is where these computers are made and the country \nfrom which they are sold. As we are concerned about the proliferation \nof those items that can be used for the construction of nuclear, \nbiological, and chemical weapons, we should also be concerned about the \npotential that we are selling technology that can also be used for \nproliferation of military weaponry. If we are truly seeking a peaceful \nworld--and we are--the United States should take care not to sell that \ntechnology which allows another country to develop weapons of \ndestruction.\n  I think the Cochran-Durbin amendment strikes an appropriate balance. \nIt brings our Government into the decision process. It protects those \nexporters in the United States who truly are trying to do the right \nthing and sell for civilian use. But it gives them a backup, and it \nleaves some assurance that will be another party investigating when it \ncomes to sales of a suspect nature.\n  This amendment is an important step toward addressing some of the \ngrowing concerns about U.S. export control policies governing sales of \ndual-use technology and whether those policies may be permitting access \nto sophisticated American technology to aid in the buildup of nuclear \nweapons capability of other countries.\n  Recall the words of Mr. Lenin: ``A capitalist will sell you the rope \nthat you will use to hang him.''\n  Let's not have that occur. Not in the name of free trade and good \ncommerce should we forget our responsibility to national and world \nsecurity. I believe the Cochran-Durbin amendment is a sensible and \nresponsible way to bring some order to what is becoming a very chaotic \nsituation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Cochran and me in support of \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois for the great force of his argument and for the clarity of his \nstatement in support of this proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham] \nbe added as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the chairman and \ndistinguished ranking member present here, I wish to inform Senators \nthat there will be a vote at 7:15 tonight on the amendment by the \nsenior Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein]. Essentially, this vote \nis a legislative measure to criminalize, under Federal laws, the \nwillful disclosure of technology and other information that would \nenable an individual or individuals to make--manufacture a bomb.\n  The time between now and 7:15 will be equally divided between myself \nand the distinguished ranking member. Hopefully, within that time we \ncan accommodate the distinguished colleague from Virginia, also. But, \njust a few words about the amendment to advise Senators with regard to \nthe subject of the vote.\n  It is entitled, ``Distribution of Information Relating to Explosives, \nDestructive Devices, and Weapons of Mass Destruction.''\n\n       Definitions.--In this subsection--\n       (A) the term ``destructive device'' has the same meaning as \n     [another section of the code];\n       (B) the term ``explosive'' [same meaning].\n\n  These terms are defined within the code, the existing code.\n\n       (C) the term ``weapon of mass destruction'' has the same \n     meaning as in [another part of the code].\n       Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for any person--\n       (A) to teach or demonstrate the making of an explosive, a \n     destructive device, or a weapon of mass destruction, or to \n     distribute by any means information pertaining to, in whole \n     or in part, the manufacture or use of an explosive, \n     destructive device, or weapon of mass destruction, with the \n     intention that the teaching, demonstration, or information be \n     used for, or in furtherance of, an activity that constitutes \n     a Federal criminal offense or a State or local criminal \n     offense affecting interstate commerce; or\n       (B) to teach or demonstrate to any person the making or use \n     of an explosive, a destructive device, or a weapon of mass \n     destruction, or to distribute to any person, by any means, \n     information pertaining to, in whole or in part, the \n     manufacture or use of an explosive, destructive device, or \n     weapon of mass destruction, knowing that such person intends \n     to use the teaching, demonstration, or information for, or in \n     furtherance of, an activity that constitutes a Federal \n     criminal offense or a State or local criminal offense \n     affecting interstate commerce.\n  And the penalties are then recited.\n  Mr President, I yield to my distinguished colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator form Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that of the time \nremaining between now and 7:15, that 5 minutes be allocated to Senator \nRobb and that----\n  Mr. WARNER. To be charged equally, Mr. President, to both sides.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That would be great, and 3 minutes be allocated to Senator \nFeinstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator also asking we return to the \nFeinstein amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that we return to the Feinstein \namendment immediately after the Senator from Virginia has completed his \n5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S5996]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The defense authorization bill before us today does a pretty \nresponsible job of providing adequate funding for personnel readiness, \nquality of life and modernization.\n  It also makes a concerted effort to accommodate many of the \nrecommendations of the Quadrennial Defense Review. I remain concerned, \nhowever, as do many colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, that we \nwill face a serious funding shortfall in just a very few years as we \ntry to replace and modernize aging vehicles, ships, and aircraft that \nwill be exiting the inventory in droves just after the turn of the \ncentury.\n  By accelerating some of the funding for major procurement items in \nthis authorization, we help head off this funding crisis at least to a \nsmall degree.\n  As a ranking member of the Readiness Subcommittee, I compliment the \nchairman, Senator Inhofe, for his diligence in supporting U.S. military \nreadiness.\n  I am pleased the bill funds many of the high-priority readiness \nincreases requested by the service chiefs in the operations and \nmaintenance accounts, as well as the ammunition accounts. Military \nconstruction is well funded, but all adds were subjected to the strict \ncriteria established in the Senate years ago to ensure we only fund \nprojects truly needed by the military.\n  The bill does not go far enough, however, in my judgment, in taking \non the issue of excess infrastructure. One of the best ways we can pay \nfor future modernization is through reducing the Department of \nDefense's large ``tail'' of infrastructure and support, which is taking \naway critical funding for the ``teeth''--our warfighting troops and \nequipment that will fight the next war.\n  The best place to reduce tail is to cut more bases. An effort to \nauthorize a new base closure round failed in a tie vote in committee, \nbut in spite of its political unpopularity, I hope the full Senate \nwill, for the good of the Nation's defense, support a new BRAC round.\n  We have reduced force structure by over 30 percent since 1989, but \nfour rounds of base closures have yielded an infrastructure reduction \nof only 21 percent. Reductions enacted so far will yield, in the long \nterm, over $5 billion a year.\n  To gain additional, badly needed savings, the only responsible course \nof action, in my judgment, is to begin reducing additional excess right \naway. Although I certainly understand the reservations of those Members \nwho are concerned about the integrity of the BRAC process, in light of \nthe attempts to privatize in place the work at Kelly and McClellan Air \nForce depots, I hope once those issues are resolved, those Members will \nsupport a new BRAC round as well.\n  The depot issue remains a difficult one, to say the least. My view is \nthat we must significantly reduce the excess capacity at the air \nlogistic centers, that the spirit of the BRAC was to reduce roughly two \nALC's worth of capacity, and that the BRAC did allow for some level of \nprivatization of work at Kelly and McClellan.\n  But in no way did the BRAC intend to privatize in place excess \ncapacity. Preserving that excess capacity will cost hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, and we simply cannot afford this kind of waste \nanymore.\n  I applaud my counterpart on the Readiness Subcommittee, Senator \nInhofe, for his willingness to strike the controversial depot \nmaintenance sections of the original bill that threatened to prevent us \nfrom proceeding to consider this bill.\n\n  Mr. President, there are other ways to save money so that we can \nproperly fund modernization.\n  One is to invest in new technologies that promise to deliver more \nlethality for less cost.\n  This bill aggressively funds the Army's efforts to ensure battlefield \ndominance through better intelligence, communications and smart \nweapons. It adds significant funds for the Navy's impressive \ninformation Technology 21 initiative, which will enable the warfighter \nto exchange all types of information on a single desktop computer, \nshorten decision time lines and better utilize information for combat.\n  I will be addressing another technology, smart card technology, that \npromises to save millions in an amendment later on in our consideration \nof this bill.\n  The bill also sensibly allows a new approach for funding the next \ncarrier, the CVN-77.\n  By letting the contractor maintain a steady supplier and workforce \nbase through early funding in fiscal year 1998 for construction in \n2002, the taxpayers stand to save over $600 million on this program \nalone. By authorizing an innovative teaming arrangement for the new \nattack submarine, we achieve additional savings over a noncompeted, \nsole-source procurement while preserving two nuclear-capable shipyards.\n  Let me offer one other area the bill addresses that could lead to \nbillions in savings without undue risks to military capability. We \ngenerally assume that any money for force modernization must come from \nforce structure cuts, end-strength cuts or infrastructure cuts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBB. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, we generally assume that there are no \nprospects for savings in readiness. The reality is that we maintain \nmost of our active force units at very high levels of readiness at \nconsiderable expense, when, in fact, we could relax readiness levels \nfor certain units, especially those not slated to go into combat early. \nSenator McCain included language in this and last year's bill requiring \nan evaluation of a concept he refers to as ``tiered readiness'' where \nfour tiers of readiness are established for our units based on their \nlikely time of deployment to battle.\n  I have included language in this bill asking for an estimate of \nsavings from a related concept I refer to as ``cyclical readiness.'' It \nwould involve alternating a high state of readiness between units, \nwhere the units at the high state of readiness would be slated for a \nfirst major theater war, and the other lower readiness units would be \navailable for a second theater.\n  The services tell us that their operational and personnel tempos are \ntoo high to relax the readiness of any units. I have come to the \nconclusion that much of that problem is self-inflicted through \nexcessive training and contingency requirements.\n  I have included another provision in this bill that requires a look \nat how much of the demands on our troops are, in fact, self-inflicted.\n  The reality is that come October, our largest overseas contingency \ncommitment will be about a third of an Army division in Bosnia.\n  In my judgment, we don't need to maintain all ten active Army \ndivisions at a high state of readiness, and I believe we need to take a \nhard look at this matter.\n  With that, Mr. President, I look forward to our continued \nconsideration of this bill and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for 1 minute charged to the time of \nthe chairman.\n  I just wish to say what a valuable contribution to the work of the \nArmed Services Committee from my distinguished colleague from Virginia. \nWe work together as a team on behalf of our Nation but, obviously, \ncaring for the specific needs of our State which are directly related \nto national security.\n  We are fortunate in Virginia to have a very significant concentration \nof activities relating to national security, and I know of no one \nbetter qualified than my distinguished colleague to work together as a \npartner in fulfilling our obligations to country and State.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my senior colleague.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 419\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Feinstein-Biden \nanti-bomb-making amendment. The bill would make it a Federal crime to \nteach someone how to use or make a bomb if you know or intend that it \nwill be used to commit a crime.\n  As my colleagues know, I fought to pass nearly identical legislation \nlast\n\n[[Page S5997]]\n\nyear. Senator Feinstein and I tried several times to have it enacted as \npart of my anti-terrorism initiatives. The bill passed the Senate on \ntwo occasions, but unfortunately, it was rejected by the House both \ntimes.\n  Critics of the bill claimed that it was unnecessary, \nunconstitutional, and would outlaw legitimate business uses of \nexplosives.\n  To respond to these claims, we asked the Justice Department to \nexamine each of these questions. The report supports Senator Feinstein \nand my position on each and every criticism.\n  So now that we have cleared away the basis for some of the \nopposition, I hope we can quickly enact this important legislation. And \nlet me tell you why.\n  I think most Americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what \nkind of criminal information is making its way over the Internet. This \ninformation is easily accessible. It's proliferating by leaps and \nbounds.\n  Let me give just one example. A guy named ``War-Master'' sent this \nmessage out over the Internet about how to build a baby food bomb. Here \nis how his message goes:\n\n       These simple, powerful bombs are not very well known even \n     though all the material can be easily obtained by anyone \n     (including minors). These things are so [expletive deleted] \n     powerful that they can destroy a car. The explosion can \n     actually twist and mangle the frame. They are extremely \n     deadly and can very easily kill you and blow the side of the \n     house out if you mess up while building it. Here's how they \n     work.\n\n  And then the message goes into explicit detail about how to fill a \nbaby food jar with gunpowder and how to detonate it. The message \nobserves that the explosion shatters the glass jar, sending pieces of \nrazor sharp glass in all directions. The message continues with even \nmore deadly advice:\n\n       Tape nails to the side of the thing. Sharpened jacks (those \n     little things with all the pointy sides) also work well.\n\n  As a result, the message concludes:\n\n       If the explosion doesn't get 'em then the glass will. If \n     the glass don't get 'em then the nails will.\n\n  I am not making this up. And this is only one small example.\n  Mr. President, we hear about this happening time and time again: A \nbomb goes off. People are killed. A criminal is apprehended. And we \nlearn that the criminal followed--to the letter--someone else's \ninstructions on how to make a bomb and how to make it kill people.\n  Indeed, the Justice Department report indicates that numerous \nnotorious terrorists--including the World Trade Center bombers and the \nmurderers of a Federal judge--have been found in possession of bomb-\nmaking manuals and internet bomb-making information.\n\n  And there is another situation that we are hearing about more and \nmore frequently. We read about it in our local papers across the \ncountry. These bomb-making instructions are having an ever increasing \nimpact on children.\n  In Austin, TX, a boy lost most of one hand and part of the other \nafter following bomb-making instructions he found on the internet. This \nboy once had plans to serve in the Marines. But that dream is now gone.\n  And in Massachusetts, several boys--in separate incidents throughout \nthe State--were maimed when they tried to mix batches of napalm on \ntheir kitchen stoves. These experiments were direct results of kids \nfinding a bomb-making recipe on the internet.\n  And what is even worse is that some of these instructions are geared \ntoward kids. They tell kids that all the ingredients they need are \nright in their parents' kitchen or laundry cabinets.\n  These stories illustrate what can happen when the literally millions \nof kids today sit in front of their computer and type ``explosive'' on \ntheir keyboard. In minutes, they can have instructions for making all \nsorts of explosive devices they never knew even existed.\n  I know that some say that going after people who only help other \npeople make bombs is not the way to go. They say that bomb-making \ninstructions are protected by the first amendment. And I agree--to a \npoint.\n  I take a backseat to no one when it comes to the first amendment. I \nhave always argued that we must take great care when we legislate about \nany constitutional right--paticularly our most cherished right of free \nspeech.\n  But let's not forget the obvious. It is illegal to make a bomb. And \nthere is no right under the first amendment to help someone commit an \nillegal act.\n  Our bill says you have no right to provide a bomb-making recipe to \nsomeone if you know that person has plans to destroy property or \ninnocent lives. You have no right to help someone blow up a building.\n  The Justice Department has concluded that our legislation--with some \nminor modifications which we have incorporated into this bill--is \nentirely consistent with the first amendment.\n  I am glad that the Senate voted last year to join Senator Feinstein \nand me in making this type of behavior a crime. I hope this time \naround, we can pass this legislation through the full Congress and send \nit on to the President so he can sign it into law.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on this \nside. I commend my good friend from California for her amendment. It is \ncarefully worded. It has been cleared on this side, and I believe that \nthere are 2 minutes allocated to the Senator from California under the \nunanimous-consent agreement and that the remainder of the time is to be \ndivided as indicated.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Kim \nHamlett, who works on the Veterans' Affairs staff, be allowed the \nprivilege of the floor during the time of consideration of the Defense \nAuthorization Act and the conference report thereto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Feinstein amendment is primarily a \njudicial amendment, but it is a very worthy amendment, and I intend to \nsupport it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \ncomments, and I thank all the Members for their support of this \namendment.\n  Essentially, this is the third year that I have submitted this \namendment. It has been put on the terrorism bill and on this bill in \nprior times. It was removed in conference. Part of the terrorism bill \nasks the Department of Justice to take a look at the situation that \nexists out there with respect to the teaching of bombmaking and the \nknowledge and intent that such teaching will be used for a criminal \npurpose. In fact, the Department of Justice has submitted a report \nindicating that they believe that the amendment is necessary and will \nstand a constitutional test, and they have, in fact, approved the \ndrafting of this amendment. I believe it is important and timely. I \nbelieve it will stand a constitutional test. I am just delighted that \nit has been cleared on both sides. I thank the Chair, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will be most happy to yield to the distinguished \nSenator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I was present at a hearing on the issue \nof terrorism and raised the question of domestic terrorism, \nspecifically in terms of information that is put on the Internet by \ngroups that are opposed to fur farming; that is, opposed to the raising \nof animals for their fur. On the Internet, these groups describe how to \nbuild a bomb for the purpose of destroying a fur farm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The remaining time is under the control of the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. BENNETT. It was my understanding the Senator from Michigan \nyielded to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California had 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the \nSenator from California. She can yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will finish my question. This group opposed to fur \nfarming put on the Internet a description of how to build a bomb to \nblow up, say, a mink farm. They did say in their Internet thing, make \nsure no animal, including a human, is present in the building when you \nblow it up.\n\n[[Page S5998]]\n\n  I ask the Senator from California if, in her opinion, her amendment \nwould make that kind of information on the Internet subject to Federal \nprosecution?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished Senator. My answer is I \nbelieve it would if the individual had the knowledge that any attempt \nwould be used for criminal purpose, which this would be. The answer to \nthe question is yes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Utah very much.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n419. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina [Mr. \nHelms] is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first of all, I would like to announce there \nwill be no further rollcall votes tonight. We have been working to make \nsure that the Members that we need to have here tomorrow, if necessary, \non the Finance Committee and also the Budget Committee members are here \nso we can complete our work on the tax cut provision of reconciliation, \nso that the Budget Committee can meet tomorrow morning to package both \nthe reconciliation spending provision and the tax cut bill. We are now \nsatisfied we will be able to have Members here for that, even though we \ndo not have recorded votes scheduled.\n  For the information of all Senators, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the DOD authorization bill. However, I have been \nassured that amendments will be offered. Therefore, votes will not \noccur during Friday's session.\n  The point I am making here is that we will be in session. We will \ncontinue to work on the DOD bill. We will have amendments that will be \noffered, but because of the request of a number of Senators, and the \nagreement we have been able to work out, we will not have to have votes \nduring Friday's session.\n  As all Members know, the Senate will begin reconciliation on Monday. \nIt is my understanding that Members will offer amendments to the \nreconciliation bill. Again, with a lot of requests from the Members and \nwith the assurance and the cooperation in a number of ways, which I \nwill not enumerate now, the votes that are required as a result of \namendments being offered Monday will be stacked to occur on Tuesday, at \n9:30 a.m. Therefore, no votes will occur on Monday.\n  Committees are expected to act in the morning on the tax \nreconciliation package. We will be in session tomorrow with some \nmorning business time that we will have identified later, and the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill will continue to be \nconsidered. We will be in session on Monday on the reconciliation bill, \nwith amendments to be offered. But the next recorded votes will occur \nand be stacked--more than one, hopefully, and at least a couple, but \nmaybe even more--to occur at 9:30 on Tuesday.\n  Mr. President, does the Senator from Kentucky wish to add anything?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we have been working back and forth all day. \nI think the water is calm. So, on Monday, we will debate \nreconciliation. There will be amendments offered. Votes will be stacked \nuntil 9:30 on Tuesday, and there will be votes--a minimum of four, \nprobably, back to back.\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate that. That was an important component of us \ngetting this agreement, to guarantee that we are, in fact, getting work \ndone and making progress on the reconciliation bill.\n  Mr. FORD. I can guarantee the majority leader this. If we are here \nand alive, you will have at least two amendments from our side that we \nwill vote on on Tuesday morning.\n  Mr. LOTT. We will have two from our side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Cochran amendment \nNo. 420.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing three members of the Senator Kyl's staff be granted floor \nprivileges during the consideration of the national defense \nauthorization bill: Paul Iarrobino, John Rood, and David Stephens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \nprovide for the cancellation of 6 existing leases and to ban all new \nleasing activities in the area off the coast of Florida, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                      FLORIDA COAST PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nGraham, to introduce the Florida Coast Protection Act. This legislation \nwill cancel the six oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf \nclosest to Florida's coast. Representative Scarborough is leading a \nsimilar effort in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, Floridians have always been justifiably concerned \nabout the prospect of oil and gas exploration in the waters off our \nState. We are well aware of the risk this activity poses to our \nenvironment and our economy.\n  Throughout my tenure in the Senate I have opposed exploration and \ndrilling off Florida's coasts. My goal--and the goal the entire Florida \ncongressional delegation--is to permanently remove this threat from our \ncoastlines. In recent years, we have stood together in opposition to \ndrilling and have successfully extended the annual moratorium on all \nnew leasing activities on Florida's continental shelf.\n  The reason for our concern is simple, Mr. President. In Florida, a \nhealthy environment means a healthy economy. Millions of people come to \nour State each year to enjoy the climate, the coastlines, and our fine \nquality of life. It would only take one disaster to end Florida's good \nstanding as America's vacationland and we cannot afford to let that \nhappen.\n  Mr. President, if the current exploration plan runs its course, there \nis the potential for the operation of up to 400 drill rigs off \nFlorida's panhandle. A recent permit report from the Environmental \nProtection Agency states that a typical rig can be expected to \ndischarge between 6,500 and 13,000 barrels of waste. This presents a \nhuge potential for damage to our near-shore coastal waters and beaches. \nThe report warns of further harmful impact on marine mammal \npopulations, fish populations, and air quality. We cannot afford these \nrisks in Florida and we do not want these risks in Florida.\n  But while the opposition of Floridians to oil drilling is well \ndocumented, the reality remains that leases have been let, potential \ndrilling sites have been explored and it is likely that actual \nextraction of resources will take place 17 miles off the coast of \nFlorida. Mr. President, if this is allowed to happen, the drill rigs \nwill be within the line of sight from vacationers in Pensacola. This \nCongress must not allow that to happen.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is very simple. It provides \nfor cancellation of the lease tract 17 miles off Pensacola. Under the \nOCS Lands Act, Mr. President, the current holders of these leases would \nbe entitled to fair compensation for their investment. This is only \nfair. The bill also makes permanent the moratorium on any new leasing \nactivity in order to ensure the past mistake of leasing in the OCS off \nFlorida is not repeated.\n  If the threat of oil and gas exploration is to be permanently removed \nfrom our shores, it will require responsible leadership from the \nCongress. This legislation, in my view, is absolutely necessary to \nprotect our state's economic and environmental well-being.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile effort.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Mack in introducing the Florida Coast Protection Act today. It \nrepresents the next step in the State of Florida's long battle to \npreserve our beautiful coastal and marine ecosystem.\n  Floridians oppose offshore oil drilling because of the threat it \npresents to the State's greatest natural and economic resource: our \ncoastal environment. Florida's beaches, fisheries, and wildlife draw \nmillions of tourists each year from around the globe, supporting our \nState's largest industry. Tourism supports, directly or indirectly, \nmillions of jobs all across Florida, and the industry generates \nbillions of dollars every year.\n  The Florida coastline boasts some of the richest estuarine areas in \nthe world. These brackish waters, with their mangrove forests and \nseagrass beds, provide an irreplaceable link in the life cycle of many \nspecies, both marine and terrestrial. Florida's commercial fishing \nindustry relies on these estuaries because they support the nurseries \nfor the most commercially harvested fish. Perhaps the most \nenvironmentally delicate regions in the gulf, estuaries could be \ndamaged beyond repair by a relatively small oil spill.\n  Over the years, we have met with some success in our effort to \nprotect Florida's OCS. In 1995, the lawsuit surrounding the \ncancellation of the leases around the Florida Keys was settled, \nremoving the immediate threat of oil and gas drilling from what is an \nextremely sensitive area. While I believe strongly that a long-term \nstrategy is needed for the entire Florida coastline, the legislation we \nare introducing today focuses on a more near-term goal: to cancel six \nleases in an area 17 miles off the coast from Pensacola. The bill \nprovides a mechanism for leaseholders to seek compensation under \nsection 5 of the OCS Lands Act. Both Senator Mack and I believe the \nleaseholders have the absolute right to just compensation from the \nFederal Government in order to recover their investment.\n  As the member of the Florida delegation who serves on the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee--the committee with jurisdiction over this \nissue--I anticipate a difficult and precarious road to enactment. But \nthe Florida delegation as a whole has no other choice than to pursue \nwith all our combined abilities the goal we envision: to take another \nmajor step toward ensuring the wellbeing of the Outer Continental Shelf \noffshore the State of Florida.\n  In addition to introducing this legislation today, Senator Mack and I \nintend to write to Chairman Frank Murkowski of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee to request a hearing on this bill as soon as \npossible. Floridians will have our very best effort to make the Florida \nCoast Protection Act Federal law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Bumpers):\n  S. 938. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nsurveillance, research, and services aimed at the prevention and \ncessation of prenatal and postnatal smoking, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n             THE MOTHERS AND INFANTS HEALTH PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Mothers and \nInfants Health Protection Act on behalf of myself and Senator Bumpers. \nFirst, I express my sincere thanks to my colleagues in the Senate last \nweek for having passed the Birth Defects Prevention Act. That act was a \ntremendous step forward in protecting the health of our Nation's most \nvulnerable population and in saving families from the economic and \nemotional hardships associated with birth defects.\n\n[[Page S6001]]\n\n  However, we must keep moving forward. After having had numerous \ndiscussions with the Centers for Disease Control and child advocacy \norganizations about the adverse birth outcomes and infant health \nproblems connected with smoking during and after pregnancy, I decided \nwe would introduce this legislation here today to carry the next step \nin our battle against birth defects.\n  The main purpose of the measure introduced today is to provide \nsurveillance, research, and services aimed at the prevention and \ncessation of smoking, both during and after pregnancy. The CDC, along \nwith the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, is meeting \ntoday here in Washington to highlight that although the overall smoking \nrate for pregnant women is slowly declining, the smoking rate for \npregnant teens is increasing. That is bad news. For black teenagers \nspecifically, the rate rose 6 percent, the first increase since this \ninformation first became available in 1989. And even with this \nincrease, smoking rates for white teenagers are still four to five \ntimes the rate for black teenagers. Furthermore, the smoking rate for \nthose between the ages of 15 and 24 is 23 percent higher than the \nsmoking rate among all pregnant women.\n  In my home State of Missouri, this public health program is even more \ndramatic: 20 percent of all pregnant women in Missouri admit to \nsmoking. This is 44 percent higher than the national average. This, \nunfortunately, may be connected to the fact that our incidence of birth \ndefects and infant mortality is 50 percent higher than the national \naverage.\n  The consequences of smoking during and after pregnancy are downright \nhorrifying. Recent studies show that this activity is a problem. \nIncreases in maternal and fetal risk causes 20 to 30 percent of low \nbirth rates and 10 percent of fetal and infant deaths in the United \nStates.\n  Smoking triples the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Smoking \nelevates the risk of a child being born with a birth defect. Smoking \nincreases the risk of spontaneous abortion, premature rupture of \nmembranes, and the delivery of a stillborn infant. Smoking may impede \nthe growth of a fetus and increase the likelihood of mental retardation \nby 50 percent, and smoking increases the risk of respiratory illness in \ninfants and children.\n  Adding to this devastating problem, the proportion of women who quit \nsmoking during pregnancy but then relapse at 6 months postpartum is \nnearly 63 percent, thereby exposing their infants to passive smoke and \nincreasing their risk for SIDS and other health-related problems.\n  These are just a few of the problems related to smoking during and \nafter pregnancy. But in addition to the risks for the fetus and infant, \nsmoking is associated with a wide variety of hazards for pregnant \nwomen, such as infertility and ectopic pregnancy.\n  There is no question that smoking during and after pregnancy is a \ncompelling public health problem. These facts clearly underscore the \nnecessity for smoking prevention and cessation programs aimed \nspecifically for pregnant women. This legislation aims to reverse these \ndevastating outcomes on several fronts.\n  First, the CDC is directed to foster coordination between all \ngovernmental levels, other public entities, and private voluntary \norganizations that conduct or support prenatal and postnatal smoking \nresearch, prevention, and surveillance.\n  Second, the bill provides grants to state and local health \ndepartments, community health centers, other public entities, and non-\nprofit organizations for the development of community-based public \nawareness campaigns aimed at the prevention and cessation of smoking \nduring and after pregnancy.\n  Third, monies would be made available to the groups just mentioned \nfor the purpose of coordinating and conducting basic and applied \nresearch concerning prenatal and postnatal smoking and its effects on \nfetuses and newborns.\n  Fourth, the bill calls for a procedure for the dissemination of \neffective prevention and cessation strategies and the diagnostic \ncriteria for infants suffering the effects of exposure to intrauterine \nand passive tobacco smoke to health care professionals.\n  Finally, this measure authorizes a modest appropriation of $10 \nmillion to achieve these goals.\n  Similar to the Birth Defects Prevention Act, this is another stride \nin improving the health of our children and in reducing infant \nmortality and morbidity.\n  Fetuses, newborns, and children are too vulnerable and cannot protect \nthemselves. We must therefore have a coordinated effort among \ngovernment, nonprofit groups and local communities to get the message \nout on the devastating outcomes associated with pre and post natal \nsmoking as well as information on effective prevention and cessation \nopportunities.\n  Again, it is important to note that overall, fewer pregnant women are \nsmoking now that they know the health risks for themselves and for \ntheir babies. The bad news is that not everyone has gotten the \nmessage--in particular those between the ages of 15 and 24. They are \nmoving directly against the trend.\n  This is the generation coming up; and these women are likely to go on \nhaving more children. If they are smoking more, that does not bode well \nfor their future health, or for that of their children.\n  Many people still do not understand that there is a link between \nadverse birth outcomes and prenatal and postnatal smoking. Part of the \nreason is that not all women have adequate access to prenatal care.\n  Thus, it is my firm belief that this legislation will ensure that all \nmothers will receive information on the potential tragedies of smoking \nduring and after pregnancy and the much needed assistance in quitting \ntheir habit.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me first extend my sincere and \nprofound gratitude to Senator Bond for creating and being the \noriginator of this legislation. I am honored he has asked me to be his \nchief cosponsor.\n  I just want to say for the Record and for those who may be watching, \nI remember when I was Governor of my State and my wife, Betty, was \nfirst lady. She had spent 2 years laying the groundwork for a statewide \nimmunization program. It was a howling success. We immunized 300,000 \nchildren one Saturday without a single reaction. That evening I said, \n``Betty, you ought to take great pride in what you just accomplished \ntoday.'' She said, ``I do. Of course, this is good for your political \ncareer and it is good for the babies who were immunized today, but it \nis certainly no final solution because we will lapse right back into \nthe lethargy we have experienced and watched for years with low \nimmunization rates among children who are yet to be born.'' She said \nuntil we institutionalize a program that can track each child's \nimmunizations from birth through early childhood we will not have \nsucceeded. Thanks to her efforts and many others, including Rosalynn \nCarter, and the program Every Child By Two, immunization levels in this \ncountry are now at an all-time high.\n  The same principle applies in this case. Once we get this bill \npassed, and we will get it passed, it is imperative that we follow it \nup year after year after year so we do not lapse into the condition we \nare in right now where the rate of smoking among teenage women, \npregnant teenage women, is going up. We got it down to 14 percent and \nnow it is back up to 17 percent.\n  If you ask that same teenage mother, what and whom do you love most, \nshe loves mostly that fetus that lies inside her womb, and when that \nbaby is born, she loves that baby above everything under the shining \nsun--above all else.\n  So ask yourself, why would a woman, or why would parents smoke during \npregnancy, and why would parents smoke after the baby is born? Every \npediatrician in the country will tell you horror stories about sending \nchildren home after asthma attacks, only to see them come back with \nanother asthma attack because people are smoking in the household.\n  Senator Bond and I are asking for $10 million for this new \ninitiative, an infinitesimal sum when compared to the savings it will \nproduce. Hubert Humphrey stood at that desk right there. I never will \nforget the speech he made. ``We don't have national health insurance. \nWhat we have is national sick insurance. It isn't worth anything until \nyou get sick.'' He told me about preventive programs that Ford Motor \nCompany had instituted among all their employees and how much they\n\n[[Page S6002]]\n\nwere saving on health care costs through preventive medicine.\n  Here we are now with a chance to save 10 to 100 times more than the \npaltry $10 million we will spend educating pregnant women in this \ncountry and telling them the consequences of asthma and low-birthweight \nbabies. After the baby is born, one of the biggest single problems is \nsudden infant death syndrome. One of its causes is smoking around \nnewborn babies.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to join my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Bond, in pushing this. I hope we will be able to get hearings \non this very shortly. Incidentally, I hope that the Centers for Disease \nControl will not just conduct outreach and education among pregnant \nwomen. I hope they will also work to educate the College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics. \nSometimes the very best professionals neglect and forget to tell \npregnant women how to conduct themselves during pregnancy. I do not \nthink that is a big problem, but I do think providers must be made \nacutely aware that they have this grave responsibility to at least tell \npregnant women what they are up against and tell women what they must \ndo when they go home from the hospital with a newborn.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  S. 939. A bill to establish a National Panel on Early Reading \nResearch and Effective Reading Instruction; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n          THE SUCCESSFUL READING RESEARCH AND INSTRUCTION ACT\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Successful \nReading Research and Instruction Act. It establishes a panel that will \ninclude parents, scientists, and educators to conduct a study of the \nresearch relevant to reading development and advise the Congress of its \nrecommendations for disseminating its findings and instruction \nsuggestions to those who would like to have them.\n  Reading is the skill students must master to meet life challenges in \na confident and successful manner. For a child, breaking the code of \nwritten language not only opens academic opportunities; it is a \ncornerstone to building high self esteem. Both reading and self esteem \naffect the knowledge and experiences that form a child's character and \nfuture.\n  Teaching children to read is the highest priority in education today. \nMany teachers and parents I've talked with are frustrated and confused \nabout what method of reading instruction is best. Every American should \nbe concerned that 40 to 60 percent of elementary school children are \nnot reading proficiently. Even more disturbing is research that shows \nfewer than one child in eight who is failing to read by the end of \nfirst grade ever catches up to grade level.\n  Success in reading is essential if one is to progress socially and \neconomically. In fact, most of the federally funded literacy programs \nare targeted to helping adults learn to read because the education \nsystem failed them, and more than likely, failed them at an early age.\n  This indicates that we need to start solving the problem of poor \nreaders at the beginning, instead of working backward. It seems to me \nthat the first step to finding a solution is to seriously analyze \nsound, rigorous research on the subject.\n  Mr. President, at a hearing on April 16, of the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, I \nbrought to the attention of the Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, \nresearch by the National Institute of Child Health and Human \nDevelopment mandated by the Health Research Extension Act of 1985, and \nasked that he use such research in the development of federally \nsupported reading programs. This research is ongoing, in a \ncollaborative network with multidisciplinary research programs to study \ngenetics, brain pathology, developmental process and phonetic \nacquisition. NICHD has spent over $100 million over the past 15 years, \nand has studied approximately ten thousand children.\n\n  On June 11 of this year, when officials from the National Institutes \nof Health came before the same appropriations subcommittee, I asked Dr. \nDuane Alexander, the Director of NICHD, about this study. Dr. \nAlexander's testimony about the research confirmed what I suspect most \nteachers already know--at least 20 percent of children have difficulty \nlearning to read. But the research also suggests that 90 to 95 percent \nof these can be brought up to average reading level.\n  As a result of this research, techniques for early identification of \nthose with reading problems and intervention strategies are now known. \nBut administrators, teachers, tutors and parents are not aware of the \nkey principles of effective reading instruction. The NICHD findings \nunderscore the need to do a better job of teacher training, as \nresearchers found fewer than 10 percent of teachers actually know how \nto teach reading to children who don't learn reading automatically.\n  I am surprised that the Department of Education hasn't looked to this \nstudy and found a way to effectively get the information to teachers, \nschools, parents, and most importantly, teacher colleges.\n  What scientists have learned from their studies of reading hasn't \nbeen passed on to the teachers who are teaching, so parents are telling \nus their kids aren't reading. It is time we put all this experience \ntogether; come up with suggestions for dealing with the problems and, \nif schools, teachers, parents or higher education institutions want the \ninformation, let's make it available.\n  This is a proposal to develop answers that are based on scientific, \nmodel based research. I think it can be a helpful beginning for \nsuccessful reading instruction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Dr. Duane Alexander's \ntestimony and a copy of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 939\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Successful Reading Research \n     and Instruction Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) At least 20 percent, and in some States 50 to 60 \n     percent, of children in elementary school cannot read at \n     basic levels. The children cannot read fluently and do not \n     understand what they read.\n       (2) Research suggests that the majority of the children, at \n     least 90 to 95 percent, can be brought up to average reading \n     skills if--\n       (A) children at risk for reading failure are identified \n     during the kindergarten and first grade years; and\n       (B) early intervention programs that combine instruction in \n     phonological awareness, phonics, and reading comprehension \n     are provided by well-trained teachers.\n       (3) If the early intervention programs described in \n     paragraph (2)(B) are delayed until the children reach 9 years \n     of age (the time that most children are identified), \n     approximately 75 percent of the children will continue to \n     have reading difficulties through high school.\n       (4) While older children and adults can be taught to read, \n     the time and expense of doing so is enormous.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to conduct an assessment of research and knowledge \n     relevant to early reading development, and instruction in \n     early reading, to determine the readiness of the research and \n     knowledge for application in the Nation's classrooms; and\n       (2) if appropriate, to develop a national strategy for the \n     rapid dissemination of the research and knowledge to teachers \n     and schools throughout the United States as a means of \n     facilitating effective early reading instruction; and\n       (3) to develop a plan for additional research regarding \n     early reading development, and instruction in early reading, \n     if the additional research is warranted.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL PANEL.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Education, or the \n     Secretary's designee, and the Director of the National \n     Institute of Child Health and Human Development, or the \n     Director's designee, jointly shall--\n       (1) establish a National Panel on Early Reading Research \n     and Effective Reading Instruction;\n       (2) establish the membership of the panel in accordance \n     with subsection (b);\n       (3) select a chairperson of the panel;\n       (4) provide the staff and support necessary for the panel \n     to carry out the panel's duties; and\n       (5) prepare and submit to Congress a report regarding the \n     findings and recommendations of the panel.\n       (b) Membership.--The panel shall be composed of 15 \n     individuals, who are not officers\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\n     or employees of the Federal Government. The panel shall \n     include leading scientists in reading research, \n     representatives of colleges of education, reading teachers, \n     educational administrators, and parents.\n       (c) Duties.--The panel shall--\n       (1) conduct a thorough study of the research and knowledge \n     relevant to early reading development, and instruction in \n     early reading, including research described in section 9 of \n     the Health Research Extension Act of 1985 (42 U.S.C. 281 \n     note);\n       (2) determine which research findings and what knowledge \n     are available for application in the Nation's classrooms; and\n       (3) determine how to disseminate the research findings and \n     knowledge to the Nation's schools and classrooms.\n       (d) Termination.--The panel shall terminate 9 months after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    Testimony of Dr. Duane Alexander\n\n       Thank you Senator Cochran:\n       I think that it is important to point out that our \n     intensive research efforts in reading development and \n     disorders is motivated to a great extent by our seeing \n     difficulties learning to read as not only an educational \n     problem, but also a major public health issue. Simply put, if \n     a youngster does not learn to read, he or she will simply not \n     likely to make it in life. Our longitudinal studies that \n     study children from age five through their high school years \n     have shown us how tender these kids are with respect to their \n     own response to reading failure. By the end of the first \n     grade, we begin to notice substantial decreases in the \n     children's self-esteem, self-concept, and motivation to learn \n     to read if they have not been able to master reading skills \n     and keep up with their age-mates. As we follow them through \n     elementary and middle school these problems compound, and in \n     many cases very bright youngsters are deprived of the wonders \n     of literature, history, science, and mathematics because they \n     can not read the grade-level textbooks. By high school, these \n     children's potential for entering college has decreased to \n     almost nil, with few choices available to them with respect \n     to occupational and vocational opportunities.\n       In studying approximately 10 thousand children over the \n     past 15 years, we have learned the following:\n       (1) At least 20%, and in some states 50 to 60%, of children \n     in the elementary grades can not read at basic levels. They \n     can not read fluently and they do not understand what they \n     read.\n       (2) However, the majority of these children--at least 90 to \n     95%--can be brought up to average reading skills IF:\n       (A) children at-risk for reading failure are identified \n     during the kindergarten and first grade years and,\n       (B) early intervention programs that combine instruction in \n     phonological awareness, phonics, and reading comprehension \n     are provided by well trained teachers. If we delay \n     intervention until nine-years-of-age (the time that most \n     children are currently identified), approximately 75% of the \n     children will continue to have reading difficulties through \n     high school. While older children and adults CAN be taught to \n     read, the time and expense of doing so is enormous.\n       (3) We have learned that phonological awareness--the \n     understanding that words are made up of sound segments called \n     phonemes--plans a casual role in reading acquisition, and \n     that it is a good predictor because it is a foundational \n     ability underlying basic reading skills.\n       (4) We have learned how to measure phonological skills as \n     early as the beginning of kindergarten with tasks that take \n     only 15 minutes to administer--and over the past decade we \n     have refined these tasks so that we can predict with 92% \n     accuracy who will have difficulties learning to read.\n       (5) The average cost of assessing each child during \n     kindergarten or first grade with the predictive measures is \n     between $15 to $20 depending upon the skill level of the \n     person conducting the assessment. This includes the costs of \n     the assessment materials. If applied on a larger scale, \n     these costs may be further decreased.\n       (6) We have learned that just as many girls as boys have \n     difficulties learning to read. The conventional wisdom has \n     been that many more boys than girls have such difficulties. \n     Now females should have equal access to screening and \n     intervention programs.\n       (7) We have begun to understand how genetics are involved \n     in learning to read, and this knowledge may ultimately \n     contribute to our prevention efforts through assessment of \n     family reading histories.\n       (8) We are entering very exciting frontiers in \n     understanding how early brain development can provide us a \n     window on how reading develops. Likewise, we are conducting \n     studies to help us understand how specific teaching methods \n     change reading behavior and how the brain changes as reading \n     develops.\n       (9) Very importantly, we continue to find that teaching \n     approaches that specifically target the development of a \n     combination of phonological skills, phonics skills, and \n     reading comprehension skills in an integrated format are the \n     most effective ways to improve reading abilities.\n       At the present time, we have held several meetings with \n     officials from the USDOE and have discussed how these \n     findings can be used across the two agencies. As an example \n     of this collaboration, NICHD and USDOE have been developing a \n     preliminary plan to determine which scientific findings are \n     ready for immediate application in the classroom and how to \n     best disseminate that information to the Nation's schools and \n     teachers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Lott, Mr. McCain and \n        Mr. Murkowski):\n  S. 940. A bill to provide for a study of the establishment of Midway \nAtoll as a national memorial to the Battle of Midway, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               THE BATTLE OF MIDWAY NATIONAL MEMORIAL ACT\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on July 31, 1995, Senator Dole and I \nintroduced S. 1098, the Battle of Midway Memorial Act. Today I am proud \nto offer an updated version of S. 1098 on behalf of the majority \nleader, Mr. Lott, the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka, the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, and the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski.\n  This bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to study the \nfeasibility and advisability of establishing Midway Atoll as a national \nmemorial to the Battle of Midway. It goes without saying that the \nsponsors of this bill strongly believe that this should be done without \ndelay. I am confident that the Interior Secretary will agree.\n  Mr. President, it was on June 4, 1942, that courageous American \nsailors, soldiers, and airmen stationed on Midway Atoll, and aboard 29 \nwarships, clashed with 350 warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy in \nwhat became known as the Battle of Midway. When the smoke cleared, the \nsmall American force, under the overall command of Admiral Nimitz, had \nsoundly defeated the Imperial Japanese Navy in one of the most \nspectacular and historically significant naval battles of all time, and \na turning point in the Pacific theater in World War II.\n  There is no reason to delay further the establishment of Midway Atoll \nas a national memorial to honor the American heros who fought and died \nthere in defense of our liberties. Approval of this bill will be the \nfirst step in recognizing what those gallant Americans did in 1942--and \nthat recognition is in fact long overdue.\n  Mr. President, on April 25, 1996, the Energy Committee's Subcommittee \non Parks, Historic Preservation, and Recreation held an extensive \nhearing on S. 1098, the predecessor to the bill we introduce today. \nChairman Nighthorse Campbell received testimony from my treasured \nfriend, Adm. Tom Moorer, who in my judgment, was the greatest Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff ever to serve in that post--and a veteran \nof the Pacific theater of World War II, and Dr. James D'Angelo, \npresident of the International Midway Memorial Foundation.\n  If the committee chooses to have another hearing on this issue, I \nhope Chairman Murkowski and Chairman Nighthorse Campbell will ask \nwhether any historic structures on Midway Atoll have been destroyed, \nand if so, why. If this has occurred, I will support modifying the bill \nto prohibit explicitly any further destruction of any historic \nstructure on Midway Atoll.\n  Mr. President, Adm. James W. (Bud) Nance, chief of staff of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Esther Kia'aina of Sen. Akaka's staff, and \nJim O'Toole with the Energy and Natural Resources Committee deserve \nspecial thanks. When Midway Atoll becomes a national memorial, it will \nin large part be due to their tireless efforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 940\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited the ``Battle of Midway National \n     Memorial Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) September 2, 1997, marks the 52th anniversary of the \n     United States victory over Japan in World War II.\n       (2) The Battle of Midway proved to be the turning point in \n     the war in the Pacific, as United States Navy forces \n     inflicted such severe losses on the Imperial Japanese Navy \n     during the battle that the Imperial Japanese Navy never again \n     took the offensive against United States or allied forces.\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\n       (3) During the Battle of Midway on June 4, 1942, an \n     outnumbered force of the United States Navy, consisting of 29 \n     ships and other units of the Armed Forces under the command \n     of Admiral Nimitz and Admiral Spruance, out-maneuvered and \n     out-fought 350 ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n       (4) It is in the public interest to establish Midway Atoll \n     as a national memorial to the Battle of Midway to express the \n     enduring gratitude of the American people for victory in the \n     battle and to inspire future generations of Americans with \n     the heroism and sacrifice of the members of the Armed Forces \n     who achieved that victory.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Midway Atoll and the surrounding seas deserve to be a \n     national memorial;\n       (2) the historical significance of the Battle of Midway \n     deserves more recognition;\n       (3) the historic structures on Midway Atoll deserve to be \n     protected and maintained;\n\n     SEC. 4. STUDY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MIDWAY ATOLL AS A \n                   NATIONAL MEMORIAL TO THE BATTLE OF MIDWAY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than six months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior \n     shall, acting through the Director of the National Park \n     Service and in consultation with the Director of the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service, the International Midway \n     Memorial Foundation, Inc. (hereafter referred to as the \n     `Foundation'), and Midway Phoenix Corporation, carry out a \n     study of the feasibility and advisability of establishing \n     Midway Atoll as a national memorial to the Battle of Midway.\n       (b) Considerations.--In studying the establishment of \n     Midway Atoll as a national memorial to the Battle of Midway \n     under subsection (a), the Secretary shall consider the \n     following:\n       (1) Whether, and under what conditions, to lease or \n     otherwise allow the Foundation or another appropriate \n     organization to administer, maintain, and utilize fully for \n     use as a national memorial to the Battle of Midway the lands \n     (including any equipment, facilities, infrastructure, and \n     other improvements) and waters of Midway Atoll.\n       (2) Whether, and under what circumstances the needs and \n     requirements of the wildlife refuge should take precedence \n     over the needs and requirements of a national memorial on \n     Midway Atoll.\n       (3) Whether, and under what conditions, to permit the use \n     of the facilities on Sand Island for purposes other than a \n     wildlife refuge or a national memorial.\n       (4) Whether to impose conditions on public access to Midway \n     Atoll as a national memorial.\n       (c) Report.--Upon completion of the study required under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the study, including any recommendations for \n     further legislative action. The report shall also include an \n     inventory of all past and present structures of historic \n     significance on Midway Atoll.\n\n     SEC. 5. RULE OF STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing under this Act should be construed to delay or \n     inhibit discussions between the Foundation and the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service or any other government \n     entity regarding the future role of the Foundation on Midway \n     Atoll.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Murray, \n        and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 941. A bill to promote the utilization of marine ferry and high-\nspeed marine ferry services; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                      high-speed marine ferry act\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \ncosponsored by Senators Gorton, Kerry, Murray, and Breaux to promote \nthe use of marine ferry and high-speed marine ferry services.\n  The marine ferry system of the United States provides an invaluable \ncomponent to the transportation requirements of our Nation. As a \nSenator from an island State, I appreciate the need for passenger/\nvehicle ferry services. In general, marine ferries require minimal \ncosts as compared to the costs of new infrastructure such as highways, \nbridges, and tunnels. In addition, marine ferries are one of the most \nenvironmentally friendly modes of transportation.\n  In coastal urban centers, marine ferry service can provide low-cost, \nenvironmentally friendly transportation to areas suffering from \ncongestion. In rural coastal areas, such as barrier islands, marine \nferries have been utilized as the sole source of transportation to \nconnect coastal communities to the mainland. While States with marine \nbarriers such as rivers or lakes have utilized marine ferries as low-\ncost alternatives to highway bridges or additional roadways. Marine \nferries have also been used to provide transportation in areas \ndevastated by natural disasters and floods. Ferries were used in the \naftermath of the earthquakes in northern California to provide \ntransportation across San Francisco Bay.\n  States such as Washington, Alaska, North Carolina, and Delaware have \ninvested, with great success, in State-run marine ferry services. While \nother States such as New York, New Jersey, and my own State of Hawaii, \nare exploring incentives to induce private ferry operations in order to \nfulfill certain transportation objectives. Private ferry operations and \nhigh-speed marine passenger vessels used for dinner cruises and tour \nexcursions, have contributed to the tourism potential of certain areas \nas well.\n  I am particularly hopeful that the Marine Ferry and High-Speed Marine \nFerry Act will help us to fulfill our Nation's potential for high-speed \nmarine technology. In the early 1970's, Boeing Marine pioneered the \ndevelopment and construction of commercial passenger hydrofoils capable \nof operating at 45 knots. Boeing built 25 hydrofoils for high-speed use \non the Hong Kong-Macau route before licensing production to Kawasaki \nHeavy Industries of Japan in the early 1980's, and by 1989, only one \nhigh-speed marine passenger/vehicle ferry of significant size was in \noperation.\n  The international and domestic high-speed marine passenger vessel \nmarket has recently seen a dramatic expansion, and currently over 60 \nhigh-speed marine passenger/vehicle ferries are in service or under \nconstruction. Fast ferries, until recently, have been primarily used in \nshort sea services on protected routes, but recent advances in design \nand materials have allowed for the construction of larger vessels \ncapable of being operated on longer open sea routes. New technologies \nhave also opened possibilities for high-speed cargo-carrying \noperations.\n  The United States has benefited from a number of recent high-speed \nprojects, and from the establishment of a shipyard specifically \ndesigned for high-speed marine passenger vessel construction. The \nMaritime Administration's ``1996 Outlook for the U.S. Shipbuilding and \nRepair Industry'' indicates:\n\n       New orders for ferries should also continue to provide work \n     for the second-tier shipyards. The enactment of ISTEA \n     continues to provide a significant boost to new ferry \n     projects. In addition, MARAD has a Title XI application \n     pending for the construction of two passenger/vehicle ferries \n     for a foreign owner, valued at more than $171 million. Demand \n     will come from continued promotion of states of ferries for \n     use in their tourist industries, as well as in \n     transportation/commuting, as an alternative to building \n     infrastructure projects such as highways and bridges. The \n     recent award of a $181 million contract to Todd Seattle for \n     three 2,500-passenger ferries and the solicitation for \n     proposals for two additional 350-passenger ferries by the \n     State of Washington, is an added sign that the ferry industry \n     is strong. On the private sector side, there is a demand for \n     the deployment of high-speed, high-tech ferries in the \n     passenger excursion industry.\n\n  The Marine Ferry and High-Speed Marine Ferry Act will build on \nprevious enactments aimed at promoting marine ferry operations. The \nbill would reauthorize section 1064 of ISTEA, at levels consistent with \npast years, to allow State-run ferry programs to apply for Federal \ngrants for the construction of ferries, and/or related ferry \ninfrastructure. The bill would also initiate a new program to help \nprovide loan guarantees for private marine ferry operators. A number of \nStates have decided not to operate their own ferry vessels, but \ninstead, have encouraged the private sector to establish marine ferry \noperations. The provision of loan guarantees to qualified applicants \nwill allow private sector operators to contribute to legitimate public \nsector transportation needs by providing favorable financing through \nfederally guaranteed loans.\n  The bill would also require DOT to report on existing marine ferry \noperations and to make recommendations on areas that could benefit from \nfuture marine ferry operations, and directs DOT to meet with relevant \nState and local municipal planning agencies to discuss the marine ferry \nprogram. The bill also directs the Marine Board to study high-speed \nmarine technologies, and potential utilization of such technology.\n  I hope my colleagues can join in to continue our support of marine \nferry operations. For a relatively small investment, we can leverage \nState and private operations to address our pressing infrastructure \ndemands.\n\n[[Page S6005]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6000-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6000-S6005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. MACK (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 937. A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \nprovide for the cancellation of 6 existing leases and to ban all new \nleasing activities in the area off the coast of Florida, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                      FLORIDA COAST PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nGraham, to introduce the Florida Coast Protection Act. This legislation \nwill cancel the six oil and gas leases on the Outer Continental Shelf \nclosest to Florida's coast. Representative Scarborough is leading a \nsimilar effort in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, Floridians have always been justifiably concerned \nabout the prospect of oil and gas exploration in the waters off our \nState. We are well aware of the risk this activity poses to our \nenvironment and our economy.\n  Throughout my tenure in the Senate I have opposed exploration and \ndrilling off Florida's coasts. My goal--and the goal the entire Florida \ncongressional delegation--is to permanently remove this threat from our \ncoastlines. In recent years, we have stood together in opposition to \ndrilling and have successfully extended the annual moratorium on all \nnew leasing activities on Florida's continental shelf.\n  The reason for our concern is simple, Mr. President. In Florida, a \nhealthy environment means a healthy economy. Millions of people come to \nour State each year to enjoy the climate, the coastlines, and our fine \nquality of life. It would only take one disaster to end Florida's good \nstanding as America's vacationland and we cannot afford to let that \nhappen.\n  Mr. President, if the current exploration plan runs its course, there \nis the potential for the operation of up to 400 drill rigs off \nFlorida's panhandle. A recent permit report from the Environmental \nProtection Agency states that a typical rig can be expected to \ndischarge between 6,500 and 13,000 barrels of waste. This presents a \nhuge potential for damage to our near-shore coastal waters and beaches. \nThe report warns of further harmful impact on marine mammal \npopulations, fish populations, and air quality. We cannot afford these \nrisks in Florida and we do not want these risks in Florida.\n  But while the opposition of Floridians to oil drilling is well \ndocumented, the reality remains that leases have been let, potential \ndrilling sites have been explored and it is likely that actual \nextraction of resources will take place 17 miles off the coast of \nFlorida. Mr. President, if this is allowed to happen, the drill rigs \nwill be within the line of sight from vacationers in Pensacola. This \nCongress must not allow that to happen.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is very simple. It provides \nfor cancellation of the lease tract 17 miles off Pensacola. Under the \nOCS Lands Act, Mr. President, the current holders of these leases would \nbe entitled to fair compensation for their investment. This is only \nfair. The bill also makes permanent the moratorium on any new leasing \nactivity in order to ensure the past mistake of leasing in the OCS off \nFlorida is not repeated.\n  If the threat of oil and gas exploration is to be permanently removed \nfrom our shores, it will require responsible leadership from the \nCongress. This legislation, in my view, is absolutely necessary to \nprotect our state's economic and environmental well-being.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this worthwhile effort.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Mack in introducing the Florida Coast Protection Act today. It \nrepresents the next step in the State of Florida's long battle to \npreserve our beautiful coastal and marine ecosystem.\n  Floridians oppose offshore oil drilling because of the threat it \npresents to the State's greatest natural and economic resource: our \ncoastal environment. Florida's beaches, fisheries, and wildlife draw \nmillions of tourists each year from around the globe, supporting our \nState's largest industry. Tourism supports, directly or indirectly, \nmillions of jobs all across Florida, and the industry generates \nbillions of dollars every year.\n  The Florida coastline boasts some of the richest estuarine areas in \nthe world. These brackish waters, with their mangrove forests and \nseagrass beds, provide an irreplaceable link in the life cycle of many \nspecies, both marine and terrestrial. Florida's commercial fishing \nindustry relies on these estuaries because they support the nurseries \nfor the most commercially harvested fish. Perhaps the most \nenvironmentally delicate regions in the gulf, estuaries could be \ndamaged beyond repair by a relatively small oil spill.\n  Over the years, we have met with some success in our effort to \nprotect Florida's OCS. In 1995, the lawsuit surrounding the \ncancellation of the leases around the Florida Keys was settled, \nremoving the immediate threat of oil and gas drilling from what is an \nextremely sensitive area. While I believe strongly that a long-term \nstrategy is needed for the entire Florida coastline, the legislation we \nare introducing today focuses on a more near-term goal: to cancel six \nleases in an area 17 miles off the coast from Pensacola. The bill \nprovides a mechanism for leaseholders to seek compensation under \nsection 5 of the OCS Lands Act. Both Senator Mack and I believe the \nleaseholders have the absolute right to just compensation from the \nFederal Government in order to recover their investment.\n  As the member of the Florida delegation who serves on the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee--the committee with jurisdiction over this \nissue--I anticipate a difficult and precarious road to enactment. But \nthe Florida delegation as a whole has no other choice than to pursue \nwith all our combined abilities the goal we envision: to take another \nmajor step toward ensuring the wellbeing of the Outer Continental Shelf \noffshore the State of Florida.\n  In addition to introducing this legislation today, Senator Mack and I \nintend to write to Chairman Frank Murkowski of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee to request a hearing on this bill as soon as \npossible. Floridians will have our very best effort to make the Florida \nCoast Protection Act Federal law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Bumpers):\n  S. 938. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nsurveillance, research, and services aimed at the prevention and \ncessation of prenatal and postnatal smoking, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n             THE MOTHERS AND INFANTS HEALTH PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Mothers and \nInfants Health Protection Act on behalf of myself and Senator Bumpers. \nFirst, I express my sincere thanks to my colleagues in the Senate last \nweek for having passed the Birth Defects Prevention Act. That act was a \ntremendous step forward in protecting the health of our Nation's most \nvulnerable population and in saving families from the economic and \nemotional hardships associated with birth defects.\n\n[[Page S6001]]\n\n  However, we must keep moving forward. After having had numerous \ndiscussions with the Centers for Disease Control and child advocacy \norganizations about the adverse birth outcomes and infant health \nproblems connected with smoking during and after pregnancy, I decided \nwe would introduce this legislation here today to carry the next step \nin our battle against birth defects.\n  The main purpose of the measure introduced today is to provide \nsurveillance, research, and services aimed at the prevention and \ncessation of smoking, both during and after pregnancy. The CDC, along \nwith the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs, is meeting \ntoday here in Washington to highlight that although the overall smoking \nrate for pregnant women is slowly declining, the smoking rate for \npregnant teens is increasing. That is bad news. For black teenagers \nspecifically, the rate rose 6 percent, the first increase since this \ninformation first became available in 1989. And even with this \nincrease, smoking rates for white teenagers are still four to five \ntimes the rate for black teenagers. Furthermore, the smoking rate for \nthose between the ages of 15 and 24 is 23 percent higher than the \nsmoking rate among all pregnant women.\n  In my home State of Missouri, this public health program is even more \ndramatic: 20 percent of all pregnant women in Missouri admit to \nsmoking. This is 44 percent higher than the national average. This, \nunfortunately, may be connected to the fact that our incidence of birth \ndefects and infant mortality is 50 percent higher than the national \naverage.\n  The consequences of smoking during and after pregnancy are downright \nhorrifying. Recent studies show that this activity is a problem. \nIncreases in maternal and fetal risk causes 20 to 30 percent of low \nbirth rates and 10 percent of fetal and infant deaths in the United \nStates.\n  Smoking triples the risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Smoking \nelevates the risk of a child being born with a birth defect. Smoking \nincreases the risk of spontaneous abortion, premature rupture of \nmembranes, and the delivery of a stillborn infant. Smoking may impede \nthe growth of a fetus and increase the likelihood of mental retardation \nby 50 percent, and smoking increases the risk of respiratory illness in \ninfants and children.\n  Adding to this devastating problem, the proportion of women who quit \nsmoking during pregnancy but then relapse at 6 months postpartum is \nnearly 63 percent, thereby exposing their infants to passive smoke and \nincreasing their risk for SIDS and other health-related problems.\n  These are just a few of the problems related to smoking during and \nafter pregnancy. But in addition to the risks for the fetus and infant, \nsmoking is associated with a wide variety of hazards for pregnant \nwomen, such as infertility and ectopic pregnancy.\n  There is no question that smoking during and after pregnancy is a \ncompelling public health problem. These facts clearly underscore the \nnecessity for smoking prevention and cessation programs aimed \nspecifically for pregnant women. This legislation aims to reverse these \ndevastating outcomes on several fronts.\n  First, the CDC is directed to foster coordination between all \ngovernmental levels, other public entities, and private voluntary \norganizations that conduct or support prenatal and postnatal smoking \nresearch, prevention, and surveillance.\n  Second, the bill provides grants to state and local health \ndepartments, community health centers, other public entities, and non-\nprofit organizations for the development of community-based public \nawareness campaigns aimed at the prevention and cessation of smoking \nduring and after pregnancy.\n  Third, monies would be made available to the groups just mentioned \nfor the purpose of coordinating and conducting basic and applied \nresearch concerning prenatal and postnatal smoking and its effects on \nfetuses and newborns.\n  Fourth, the bill calls for a procedure for the dissemination of \neffective prevention and cessation strategies and the diagnostic \ncriteria for infants suffering the effects of exposure to intrauterine \nand passive tobacco smoke to health care professionals.\n  Finally, this measure authorizes a modest appropriation of $10 \nmillion to achieve these goals.\n  Similar to the Birth Defects Prevention Act, this is another stride \nin improving the health of our children and in reducing infant \nmortality and morbidity.\n  Fetuses, newborns, and children are too vulnerable and cannot protect \nthemselves. We must therefore have a coordinated effort among \ngovernment, nonprofit groups and local communities to get the message \nout on the devastating outcomes associated with pre and post natal \nsmoking as well as information on effective prevention and cessation \nopportunities.\n  Again, it is important to note that overall, fewer pregnant women are \nsmoking now that they know the health risks for themselves and for \ntheir babies. The bad news is that not everyone has gotten the \nmessage--in particular those between the ages of 15 and 24. They are \nmoving directly against the trend.\n  This is the generation coming up; and these women are likely to go on \nhaving more children. If they are smoking more, that does not bode well \nfor their future health, or for that of their children.\n  Many people still do not understand that there is a link between \nadverse birth outcomes and prenatal and postnatal smoking. Part of the \nreason is that not all women have adequate access to prenatal care.\n  Thus, it is my firm belief that this legislation will ensure that all \nmothers will receive information on the potential tragedies of smoking \nduring and after pregnancy and the much needed assistance in quitting \ntheir habit.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me first extend my sincere and \nprofound gratitude to Senator Bond for creating and being the \noriginator of this legislation. I am honored he has asked me to be his \nchief cosponsor.\n  I just want to say for the Record and for those who may be watching, \nI remember when I was Governor of my State and my wife, Betty, was \nfirst lady. She had spent 2 years laying the groundwork for a statewide \nimmunization program. It was a howling success. We immunized 300,000 \nchildren one Saturday without a single reaction. That evening I said, \n``Betty, you ought to take great pride in what you just accomplished \ntoday.'' She said, ``I do. Of course, this is good for your political \ncareer and it is good for the babies who were immunized today, but it \nis certainly no final solution because we will lapse right back into \nthe lethargy we have experienced and watched for years with low \nimmunization rates among children who are yet to be born.'' She said \nuntil we institutionalize a program that can track each child's \nimmunizations from birth through early childhood we will not have \nsucceeded. Thanks to her efforts and many others, including Rosalynn \nCarter, and the program Every Child By Two, immunization levels in this \ncountry are now at an all-time high.\n  The same principle applies in this case. Once we get this bill \npassed, and we will get it passed, it is imperative that we follow it \nup year after year after year so we do not lapse into the condition we \nare in right now where the rate of smoking among teenage women, \npregnant teenage women, is going up. We got it down to 14 percent and \nnow it is back up to 17 percent.\n  If you ask that same teenage mother, what and whom do you love most, \nshe loves mostly that fetus that lies inside her womb, and when that \nbaby is born, she loves that baby above everything under the shining \nsun--above all else.\n  So ask yourself, why would a woman, or why would parents smoke during \npregnancy, and why would parents smoke after the baby is born? Every \npediatrician in the country will tell you horror stories about sending \nchildren home after asthma attacks, only to see them come back with \nanother asthma attack because people are smoking in the household.\n  Senator Bond and I are asking for $10 million for this new \ninitiative, an infinitesimal sum when compared to the savings it will \nproduce. Hubert Humphrey stood at that desk right there. I never will \nforget the speech he made. ``We don't have national health insurance. \nWhat we have is national sick insurance. It isn't worth anything until \nyou get sick.'' He told me about preventive programs that Ford Motor \nCompany had instituted among all their employees and how much they\n\n[[Page S6002]]\n\nwere saving on health care costs through preventive medicine.\n  Here we are now with a chance to save 10 to 100 times more than the \npaltry $10 million we will spend educating pregnant women in this \ncountry and telling them the consequences of asthma and low-birthweight \nbabies. After the baby is born, one of the biggest single problems is \nsudden infant death syndrome. One of its causes is smoking around \nnewborn babies.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to join my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Bond, in pushing this. I hope we will be able to get hearings \non this very shortly. Incidentally, I hope that the Centers for Disease \nControl will not just conduct outreach and education among pregnant \nwomen. I hope they will also work to educate the College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics. \nSometimes the very best professionals neglect and forget to tell \npregnant women how to conduct themselves during pregnancy. I do not \nthink that is a big problem, but I do think providers must be made \nacutely aware that they have this grave responsibility to at least tell \npregnant women what they are up against and tell women what they must \ndo when they go home from the hospital with a newborn.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  S. 939. A bill to establish a National Panel on Early Reading \nResearch and Effective Reading Instruction; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n          THE SUCCESSFUL READING RESEARCH AND INSTRUCTION ACT\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Successful \nReading Research and Instruction Act. It establishes a panel that will \ninclude parents, scientists, and educators to conduct a study of the \nresearch relevant to reading development and advise the Congress of its \nrecommendations for disseminating its findings and instruction \nsuggestions to those who would like to have them.\n  Reading is the skill students must master to meet life challenges in \na confident and successful manner. For a child, breaking the code of \nwritten language not only opens academic opportunities; it is a \ncornerstone to building high self esteem. Both reading and self esteem \naffect the knowledge and experiences that form a child's character and \nfuture.\n  Teaching children to read is the highest priority in education today. \nMany teachers and parents I've talked with are frustrated and confused \nabout what method of reading instruction is best. Every American should \nbe concerned that 40 to 60 percent of elementary school children are \nnot reading proficiently. Even more disturbing is research that shows \nfewer than one child in eight who is failing to read by the end of \nfirst grade ever catches up to grade level.\n  Success in reading is essential if one is to progress socially and \neconomically. In fact, most of the federally funded literacy programs \nare targeted to helping adults learn to read because the education \nsystem failed them, and more than likely, failed them at an early age.\n  This indicates that we need to start solving the problem of poor \nreaders at the beginning, instead of working backward. It seems to me \nthat the first step to finding a solution is to seriously analyze \nsound, rigorous research on the subject.\n  Mr. President, at a hearing on April 16, of the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, I \nbrought to the attention of the Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, \nresearch by the National Institute of Child Health and Human \nDevelopment mandated by the Health Research Extension Act of 1985, and \nasked that he use such research in the development of federally \nsupported reading programs. This research is ongoing, in a \ncollaborative network with multidisciplinary research programs to study \ngenetics, brain pathology, developmental process and phonetic \nacquisition. NICHD has spent over $100 million over the past 15 years, \nand has studied approximately ten thousand children.\n\n  On June 11 of this year, when officials from the National Institutes \nof Health came before the same appropriations subcommittee, I asked Dr. \nDuane Alexander, the Director of NICHD, about this study. Dr. \nAlexander's testimony about the research confirmed what I suspect most \nteachers already know--at least 20 percent of children have difficulty \nlearning to read. But the research also suggests that 90 to 95 percent \nof these can be brought up to average reading level.\n  As a result of this research, techniques for early identification of \nthose with reading problems and intervention strategies are now known. \nBut administrators, teachers, tutors and parents are not aware of the \nkey principles of effective reading instruction. The NICHD findings \nunderscore the need to do a better job of teacher training, as \nresearchers found fewer than 10 percent of teachers actually know how \nto teach reading to children who don't learn reading automatically.\n  I am surprised that the Department of Education hasn't looked to this \nstudy and found a way to effectively get the information to teachers, \nschools, parents, and most importantly, teacher colleges.\n  What scientists have learned from their studies of reading hasn't \nbeen passed on to the teachers who are teaching, so parents are telling \nus their kids aren't reading. It is time we put all this experience \ntogether; come up with suggestions for dealing with the problems and, \nif schools, teachers, parents or higher education institutions want the \ninformation, let's make it available.\n  This is a proposal to develop answers that are based on scientific, \nmodel based research. I think it can be a helpful beginning for \nsuccessful reading instruction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Dr. Duane Alexander's \ntestimony and a copy of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 939\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Successful Reading Research \n     and Instruction Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) At least 20 percent, and in some States 50 to 60 \n     percent, of children in elementary school cannot read at \n     basic levels. The children cannot read fluently and do not \n     understand what they read.\n       (2) Research suggests that the majority of the children, at \n     least 90 to 95 percent, can be brought up to average reading \n     skills if--\n       (A) children at risk for reading failure are identified \n     during the kindergarten and first grade years; and\n       (B) early intervention programs that combine instruction in \n     phonological awareness, phonics, and reading comprehension \n     are provided by well-trained teachers.\n       (3) If the early intervention programs described in \n     paragraph (2)(B) are delayed until the children reach 9 years \n     of age (the time that most children are identified), \n     approximately 75 percent of the children will continue to \n     have reading difficulties through high school.\n       (4) While older children and adults can be taught to read, \n     the time and expense of doing so is enormous.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to conduct an assessment of research and knowledge \n     relevant to early reading development, and instruction in \n     early reading, to determine the readiness of the research and \n     knowledge for application in the Nation's classrooms; and\n       (2) if appropriate, to develop a national strategy for the \n     rapid dissemination of the research and knowledge to teachers \n     and schools throughout the United States as a means of \n     facilitating effective early reading instruction; and\n       (3) to develop a plan for additional research regarding \n     early reading development, and instruction in early reading, \n     if the additional research is warranted.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL PANEL.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Education, or the \n     Secretary's designee, and the Director of the National \n     Institute of Child Health and Human Development, or the \n     Director's designee, jointly shall--\n       (1) establish a National Panel on Early Reading Research \n     and Effective Reading Instruction;\n       (2) establish the membership of the panel in accordance \n     with subsection (b);\n       (3) select a chairperson of the panel;\n       (4) provide the staff and support necessary for the panel \n     to carry out the panel's duties; and\n       (5) prepare and submit to Congress a report regarding the \n     findings and recommendations of the panel.\n       (b) Membership.--The panel shall be composed of 15 \n     individuals, who are not officers\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\n     or employees of the Federal Government. The panel shall \n     include leading scientists in reading research, \n     representatives of colleges of education, reading teachers, \n     educational administrators, and parents.\n       (c) Duties.--The panel shall--\n       (1) conduct a thorough study of the research and knowledge \n     relevant to early reading development, and instruction in \n     early reading, including research described in section 9 of \n     the Health Research Extension Act of 1985 (42 U.S.C. 281 \n     note);\n       (2) determine which research findings and what knowledge \n     are available for application in the Nation's classrooms; and\n       (3) determine how to disseminate the research findings and \n     knowledge to the Nation's schools and classrooms.\n       (d) Termination.--The panel shall terminate 9 months after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    Testimony of Dr. Duane Alexander\n\n       Thank you Senator Cochran:\n       I think that it is important to point out that our \n     intensive research efforts in reading development and \n     disorders is motivated to a great extent by our seeing \n     difficulties learning to read as not only an educational \n     problem, but also a major public health issue. Simply put, if \n     a youngster does not learn to read, he or she will simply not \n     likely to make it in life. Our longitudinal studies that \n     study children from age five through their high school years \n     have shown us how tender these kids are with respect to their \n     own response to reading failure. By the end of the first \n     grade, we begin to notice substantial decreases in the \n     children's self-esteem, self-concept, and motivation to learn \n     to read if they have not been able to master reading skills \n     and keep up with their age-mates. As we follow them through \n     elementary and middle school these problems compound, and in \n     many cases very bright youngsters are deprived of the wonders \n     of literature, history, science, and mathematics because they \n     can not read the grade-level textbooks. By high school, these \n     children's potential for entering college has decreased to \n     almost nil, with few choices available to them with respect \n     to occupational and vocational opportunities.\n       In studying approximately 10 thousand children over the \n     past 15 years, we have learned the following:\n       (1) At least 20%, and in some states 50 to 60%, of children \n     in the elementary grades can not read at basic levels. They \n     can not read fluently and they do not understand what they \n     read.\n       (2) However, the majority of these children--at least 90 to \n     95%--can be brought up to average reading skills IF:\n       (A) children at-risk for reading failure are identified \n     during the kindergarten and first grade years and,\n       (B) early intervention programs that combine instruction in \n     phonological awareness, phonics, and reading comprehension \n     are provided by well trained teachers. If we delay \n     intervention until nine-years-of-age (the time that most \n     children are currently identified), approximately 75% of the \n     children will continue to have reading difficulties through \n     high school. While older children and adults CAN be taught to \n     read, the time and expense of doing so is enormous.\n       (3) We have learned that phonological awareness--the \n     understanding that words are made up of sound segments called \n     phonemes--plans a casual role in reading acquisition, and \n     that it is a good predictor because it is a foundational \n     ability underlying basic reading skills.\n       (4) We have learned how to measure phonological skills as \n     early as the beginning of kindergarten with tasks that take \n     only 15 minutes to administer--and over the past decade we \n     have refined these tasks so that we can predict with 92% \n     accuracy who will have difficulties learning to read.\n       (5) The average cost of assessing each child during \n     kindergarten or first grade with the predictive measures is \n     between $15 to $20 depending upon the skill level of the \n     person conducting the assessment. This includes the costs of \n     the assessment materials. If applied on a larger scale, \n     these costs may be further decreased.\n       (6) We have learned that just as many girls as boys have \n     difficulties learning to read. The conventional wisdom has \n     been that many more boys than girls have such difficulties. \n     Now females should have equal access to screening and \n     intervention programs.\n       (7) We have begun to understand how genetics are involved \n     in learning to read, and this knowledge may ultimately \n     contribute to our prevention efforts through assessment of \n     family reading histories.\n       (8) We are entering very exciting frontiers in \n     understanding how early brain development can provide us a \n     window on how reading develops. Likewise, we are conducting \n     studies to help us understand how specific teaching methods \n     change reading behavior and how the brain changes as reading \n     develops.\n       (9) Very importantly, we continue to find that teaching \n     approaches that specifically target the development of a \n     combination of phonological skills, phonics skills, and \n     reading comprehension skills in an integrated format are the \n     most effective ways to improve reading abilities.\n       At the present time, we have held several meetings with \n     officials from the USDOE and have discussed how these \n     findings can be used across the two agencies. As an example \n     of this collaboration, NICHD and USDOE have been developing a \n     preliminary plan to determine which scientific findings are \n     ready for immediate application in the classroom and how to \n     best disseminate that information to the Nation's schools and \n     teachers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Lott, Mr. McCain and \n        Mr. Murkowski):\n  S. 940. A bill to provide for a study of the establishment of Midway \nAtoll as a national memorial to the Battle of Midway, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               THE BATTLE OF MIDWAY NATIONAL MEMORIAL ACT\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on July 31, 1995, Senator Dole and I \nintroduced S. 1098, the Battle of Midway Memorial Act. Today I am proud \nto offer an updated version of S. 1098 on behalf of the majority \nleader, Mr. Lott, the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka, the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, and the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski.\n  This bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to study the \nfeasibility and advisability of establishing Midway Atoll as a national \nmemorial to the Battle of Midway. It goes without saying that the \nsponsors of this bill strongly believe that this should be done without \ndelay. I am confident that the Interior Secretary will agree.\n  Mr. President, it was on June 4, 1942, that courageous American \nsailors, soldiers, and airmen stationed on Midway Atoll, and aboard 29 \nwarships, clashed with 350 warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy in \nwhat became known as the Battle of Midway. When the smoke cleared, the \nsmall American force, under the overall command of Admiral Nimitz, had \nsoundly defeated the Imperial Japanese Navy in one of the most \nspectacular and historically significant naval battles of all time, and \na turning point in the Pacific theater in World War II.\n  There is no reason to delay further the establishment of Midway Atoll \nas a national memorial to honor the American heros who fought and died \nthere in defense of our liberties. Approval of this bill will be the \nfirst step in recognizing what those gallant Americans did in 1942--and \nthat recognition is in fact long overdue.\n  Mr. President, on April 25, 1996, the Energy Committee's Subcommittee \non Parks, Historic Preservation, and Recreation held an extensive \nhearing on S. 1098, the predecessor to the bill we introduce today. \nChairman Nighthorse Campbell received testimony from my treasured \nfriend, Adm. Tom Moorer, who in my judgment, was the greatest Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff ever to serve in that post--and a veteran \nof the Pacific theater of World War II, and Dr. James D'Angelo, \npresident of the International Midway Memorial Foundation.\n  If the committee chooses to have another hearing on this issue, I \nhope Chairman Murkowski and Chairman Nighthorse Campbell will ask \nwhether any historic structures on Midway Atoll have been destroyed, \nand if so, why. If this has occurred, I will support modifying the bill \nto prohibit explicitly any further destruction of any historic \nstructure on Midway Atoll.\n  Mr. President, Adm. James W. (Bud) Nance, chief of staff of the \nForeign Relations Committee, Esther Kia'aina of Sen. Akaka's staff, and \nJim O'Toole with the Energy and Natural Resources Committee deserve \nspecial thanks. When Midway Atoll becomes a national memorial, it will \nin large part be due to their tireless efforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 940\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited the ``Battle of Midway National \n     Memorial Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) September 2, 1997, marks the 52th anniversary of the \n     United States victory over Japan in World War II.\n       (2) The Battle of Midway proved to be the turning point in \n     the war in the Pacific, as United States Navy forces \n     inflicted such severe losses on the Imperial Japanese Navy \n     during the battle that the Imperial Japanese Navy never again \n     took the offensive against United States or allied forces.\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\n       (3) During the Battle of Midway on June 4, 1942, an \n     outnumbered force of the United States Navy, consisting of 29 \n     ships and other units of the Armed Forces under the command \n     of Admiral Nimitz and Admiral Spruance, out-maneuvered and \n     out-fought 350 ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n       (4) It is in the public interest to establish Midway Atoll \n     as a national memorial to the Battle of Midway to express the \n     enduring gratitude of the American people for victory in the \n     battle and to inspire future generations of Americans with \n     the heroism and sacrifice of the members of the Armed Forces \n     who achieved that victory.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Midway Atoll and the surrounding seas deserve to be a \n     national memorial;\n       (2) the historical significance of the Battle of Midway \n     deserves more recognition;\n       (3) the historic structures on Midway Atoll deserve to be \n     protected and maintained;\n\n     SEC. 4. STUDY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MIDWAY ATOLL AS A \n                   NATIONAL MEMORIAL TO THE BATTLE OF MIDWAY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than six months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior \n     shall, acting through the Director of the National Park \n     Service and in consultation with the Director of the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service, the International Midway \n     Memorial Foundation, Inc. (hereafter referred to as the \n     `Foundation'), and Midway Phoenix Corporation, carry out a \n     study of the feasibility and advisability of establishing \n     Midway Atoll as a national memorial to the Battle of Midway.\n       (b) Considerations.--In studying the establishment of \n     Midway Atoll as a national memorial to the Battle of Midway \n     under subsection (a), the Secretary shall consider the \n     following:\n       (1) Whether, and under what conditions, to lease or \n     otherwise allow the Foundation or another appropriate \n     organization to administer, maintain, and utilize fully for \n     use as a national memorial to the Battle of Midway the lands \n     (including any equipment, facilities, infrastructure, and \n     other improvements) and waters of Midway Atoll.\n       (2) Whether, and under what circumstances the needs and \n     requirements of the wildlife refuge should take precedence \n     over the needs and requirements of a national memorial on \n     Midway Atoll.\n       (3) Whether, and under what conditions, to permit the use \n     of the facilities on Sand Island for purposes other than a \n     wildlife refuge or a national memorial.\n       (4) Whether to impose conditions on public access to Midway \n     Atoll as a national memorial.\n       (c) Report.--Upon completion of the study required under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the study, including any recommendations for \n     further legislative action. The report shall also include an \n     inventory of all past and present structures of historic \n     significance on Midway Atoll.\n\n     SEC. 5. RULE OF STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       Nothing under this Act should be construed to delay or \n     inhibit discussions between the Foundation and the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service or any other government \n     entity regarding the future role of the Foundation on Midway \n     Atoll.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Murray, \n        and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 941. A bill to promote the utilization of marine ferry and high-\nspeed marine ferry services; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                      high-speed marine ferry act\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \ncosponsored by Senators Gorton, Kerry, Murray, and Breaux to promote \nthe use of marine ferry and high-speed marine ferry services.\n  The marine ferry system of the United States provides an invaluable \ncomponent to the transportation requirements of our Nation. As a \nSenator from an island State, I appreciate the need for passenger/\nvehicle ferry services. In general, marine ferries require minimal \ncosts as compared to the costs of new infrastructure such as highways, \nbridges, and tunnels. In addition, marine ferries are one of the most \nenvironmentally friendly modes of transportation.\n  In coastal urban centers, marine ferry service can provide low-cost, \nenvironmentally friendly transportation to areas suffering from \ncongestion. In rural coastal areas, such as barrier islands, marine \nferries have been utilized as the sole source of transportation to \nconnect coastal communities to the mainland. While States with marine \nbarriers such as rivers or lakes have utilized marine ferries as low-\ncost alternatives to highway bridges or additional roadways. Marine \nferries have also been used to provide transportation in areas \ndevastated by natural disasters and floods. Ferries were used in the \naftermath of the earthquakes in northern California to provide \ntransportation across San Francisco Bay.\n  States such as Washington, Alaska, North Carolina, and Delaware have \ninvested, with great success, in State-run marine ferry services. While \nother States such as New York, New Jersey, and my own State of Hawaii, \nare exploring incentives to induce private ferry operations in order to \nfulfill certain transportation objectives. Private ferry operations and \nhigh-speed marine passenger vessels used for dinner cruises and tour \nexcursions, have contributed to the tourism potential of certain areas \nas well.\n  I am particularly hopeful that the Marine Ferry and High-Speed Marine \nFerry Act will help us to fulfill our Nation's potential for high-speed \nmarine technology. In the early 1970's, Boeing Marine pioneered the \ndevelopment and construction of commercial passenger hydrofoils capable \nof operating at 45 knots. Boeing built 25 hydrofoils for high-speed use \non the Hong Kong-Macau route before licensing production to Kawasaki \nHeavy Industries of Japan in the early 1980's, and by 1989, only one \nhigh-speed marine passenger/vehicle ferry of significant size was in \noperation.\n  The international and domestic high-speed marine passenger vessel \nmarket has recently seen a dramatic expansion, and currently over 60 \nhigh-speed marine passenger/vehicle ferries are in service or under \nconstruction. Fast ferries, until recently, have been primarily used in \nshort sea services on protected routes, but recent advances in design \nand materials have allowed for the construction of larger vessels \ncapable of being operated on longer open sea routes. New technologies \nhave also opened possibilities for high-speed cargo-carrying \noperations.\n  The United States has benefited from a number of recent high-speed \nprojects, and from the establishment of a shipyard specifically \ndesigned for high-speed marine passenger vessel construction. The \nMaritime Administration's ``1996 Outlook for the U.S. Shipbuilding and \nRepair Industry'' indicates:\n\n       New orders for ferries should also continue to provide work \n     for the second-tier shipyards. The enactment of ISTEA \n     continues to provide a significant boost to new ferry \n     projects. In addition, MARAD has a Title XI application \n     pending for the construction of two passenger/vehicle ferries \n     for a foreign owner, valued at more than $171 million. Demand \n     will come from continued promotion of states of ferries for \n     use in their tourist industries, as well as in \n     transportation/commuting, as an alternative to building \n     infrastructure projects such as highways and bridges. The \n     recent award of a $181 million contract to Todd Seattle for \n     three 2,500-passenger ferries and the solicitation for \n     proposals for two additional 350-passenger ferries by the \n     State of Washington, is an added sign that the ferry industry \n     is strong. On the private sector side, there is a demand for \n     the deployment of high-speed, high-tech ferries in the \n     passenger excursion industry.\n\n  The Marine Ferry and High-Speed Marine Ferry Act will build on \nprevious enactments aimed at promoting marine ferry operations. The \nbill would reauthorize section 1064 of ISTEA, at levels consistent with \npast years, to allow State-run ferry programs to apply for Federal \ngrants for the construction of ferries, and/or related ferry \ninfrastructure. The bill would also initiate a new program to help \nprovide loan guarantees for private marine ferry operators. A number of \nStates have decided not to operate their own ferry vessels, but \ninstead, have encouraged the private sector to establish marine ferry \noperations. The provision of loan guarantees to qualified applicants \nwill allow private sector operators to contribute to legitimate public \nsector transportation needs by providing favorable financing through \nfederally guaranteed loans.\n  The bill would also require DOT to report on existing marine ferry \noperations and to make recommendations on areas that could benefit from \nfuture marine ferry operations, and directs DOT to meet with relevant \nState and local municipal planning agencies to discuss the marine ferry \nprogram. The bill also directs the Marine Board to study high-speed \nmarine technologies, and potential utilization of such technology.\n  I hope my colleagues can join in to continue our support of marine \nferry operations. For a relatively small investment, we can leverage \nState and private operations to address our pressing infrastructure \ndemands.\n\n[[Page S6005]]\n\n\n\n

Mr. President, I am pleased to speak about an \nissue I feel strongly about and have consistently supported during my \ntenure in the U.S. Senate. Today I rise in defense of Senate bill 400, \nthe Frivolous Lawsuit Prevention Act, of which I am a cosponsor.\n  The Senate has debated tort reform legislation in the past and this \nyear several bills have been introduced that attempt to remediate our \nlegal system. S. 400 takes a narrow approach and focuses on the \nparticular problem of persons who deliberately abuse America's courts.\n  I appreciate the efforts of Senator Grassley in introducing this \nimportant bill, which is a vital component of legal reform. It aims to \nrescue our courts from engaging in suits that more resemble talk show \nfodder than legitimate claims of wrongdoing. Specifically, the bill \namends rule 11 of the Federal rules of civil procedure by making \nsanctions mandatory rather than discretionary whenever federal courts \nfind a violation of that rule has occurred and an attorney has engaged \nin frivolous conduct.\n  For example, if a party files a lawsuit purely to badger another \nparty, and the judge finds this to be true, the court can impose a \npunishment commensurate with the degree of the violation. Prior to \n1993, this type of sanctioning had been standard procedure. \nUnfortunately, however, this rule was severely modified 4 years ago. \nCongress must now enact S. 400 to once again protect the courts from \nfrivolous lawsuits that clog this Nation's legal system and impede the \nability of legitimate claims to be heard.\n  Our courts must never become playgrounds for egregious claims and \nwild accusations that seek only to harass an individual. Those who \nengage in such conduct must face sanctions for their action. In my \nview, this bill will relieve our courts and restore the dignity and \nintegrity that America's system of justice demands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6007-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6007-S6008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNITION OF THE RECIPIENTS OF THE GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD, DUPAGE \n                           COUNTY GIRL SCOUTS\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to salute six \noutstanding young women who were honored on May 12, 1997, with the Girl \nScout Gold Award by the Dupage County Girl Scout Council of Naperville, \nIL. The Girl Scout Award symbolizes outstanding accomplishments in the \narea of leadership, community service, career planning, and personal \nplanning. I commend these young women for their dedication to our \ncommunity.\n  Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., an organization serving over 2.5 million \ngirls, has awarded more than 20,000 Girl Scout Awards to senior Girl \nScouts since the inception of the program in 1980. To receive the \naward, a Girl Scout must earn four interest project patches. The Career \nExploration Pin, the Senior Girl Scout Leadership Award, and the Senior \nGirl Scout Challenge. The Scout must also design and implement a Girl \nScout Gold Award project. A plan for fulfilling these requirements is \ncreated by the senior Girl Scout and\n\n[[Page S6008]]\n\nis carried out through close cooperation between the girl and an adult \nvolunteer. These objectives are met only through hard work and \ndiscipline, as displayed by the six young women honored on May 12.\n  A member of Girl Scout Troop 936, Jennifer Gary began working toward \nthe Girl Scout Gold Award in 1994. Her project, focused on providing a \nCosta Rican culture experience for people in her community and raised \ncommunity awareness about the importance of rain forests to our global \nenvironment.\n  The environment was also the focus of Carla Dingler's project. Carla, \na member of Girl Scout Troop 167, coordinated six different \nenvironmental cleanups in her community.\n  Cyndie Bagarie, an individual Girl Member, completed an innovative \nproject she began working on in 1995. Cyndie created a raffle-like \nevent, whereby members of the community were given the opportunity to \nwin free swim lessons from Cyndie by donating food to a local food \npantry.\n  Girl Scout Troop 42 member Susan Mickelson created and distributed a \nwallet-size index of public phone numbers for teens. This arduous \nproject began in 1993.\n  Another member of Troop 42, Erin Kraatz, knitted teddy bears for the \nchildren residing at a local women's shelter. This ongoing project \nstarted in 1993.\n  Jennifer Buhrow, an individual girl member, began working toward the \nGirl Scout Award in 1995. Her project consisted of collecting books, \ntoys, games, and school supplies for the children at a local women's \nshelter.\n  At a time when our Nation's youth face so many obstacles, it is \nencouraging to see six young women devoted to fostering an \nunderstanding between cultures and people, and taking steps to bring \nissues of importance to the attention of others. I extend my heartfelt \ncongratulations to Jennifer Gary, Carla Dingler, Cyndie Bagarie, Susan \nMickelson, Erin Kraatz, and Jennifer Buhrow as they are recognized for \ntheir hard work and service to the community. We can all take pride in \nthe fact that these six young women have made vital contributions to \nthe State of Illinois. The people of Illinois are grateful for their \ncontributions as public servants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6007-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6008-S6009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNITION OF THE 34TH ANNUAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today in support of America's \nsmall businesses and in recognition of the 34th annual Small Business \nWeek. As a member of the Small Business Committee, I understand that \nsmall business is truly the engine of economic growth in America. \nNinety percent of all U.S. businesses have less than 20 employees and \n99 percent have fewer than 500 employees. These small businesses employ \nmore than half of our Nation's workforce and create a large majority of \nour new jobs. In fact, 40 percent of our Nation's goods and services \nare produced by small businesses--making America's entrepreneurs the \nworld's third greatest economic power, trailing only the production of \nthe entire United States economy and Japan.\n  We celebrate Small Business Week every year to recognize those people \non the front lines of our economy. I would like to take a moment to \nspecifically recognize Tennessee's 1997 Small Business Person of the \nYear--Bob Pap--the president of the Accurate Automation Corp. in \nChattanooga. Accurate Automation is an aerospace/computer systems \ncompany doing research and development in hypersonic aircraft design \nand the emerging technology of neural networks. Accurate Automation \nbegan in 1988 as a two-person company located in a 450-square-foot \noffice. Today, it has 33 employees, 5 consultants, and a 13,000-square-\nfoot office facility. Bob Pap's corporation is a great example of how \nhard work and ingenuity can lead to small business success.\n  The work of a small business owner never ends. Therefore, Congress \nshould not stop working for small business after Small Business Week. \nWe must reduce or eliminate the restrictive taxes, unfunded mandates, \nand burdensome regulations plaguing small businesses. Many Federal \nbureaucrats and lawmakers do not understand that small businesses do \nnot have the money and personnel to cope with regulatory paperwork. \nThey do not understand that small firms lack a corporate legal \ndepartment to guide them through a maze of regulatory compliance. And, \nmost importantly, they do not understand that each new tax, mandate, \nand regulation stifles business expansion, job creation, and economic \ngrowth.\n  Fortunately, Congress is taking action to foster a healthier \nenvironment for entrepreneurs. Reducing the capital gains tax rate is \nvital to creating jobs and expanding economic growth. Through high \ncapital gains rates the Federal Government penalizes people who take \nrisks and invest their hard-earned income in homes, savings accounts, \nmutual funds, small and large businesses, or family farms. In addition, \nthis high tax rate threatens American leadership in the global \nmarketplace. The United States has the highest capital gains rate of \nany major industrialized nation in the world. We cannot expect to \nremain competitive if we are not on a level playing field with other \ncountries. Lowering the capital gains rate is essential to maintaining \na strong economy and supporting the cause of America's small business \nmen and women.\n  The bipartisan balanced budget agreement cuts the capital gains tax \nrate for individuals in the 15-percent tax bracket to 10 percent and \nfor individuals in the 28-percent bracket to 20 percent. It also \nprovides for the exclusion of gain on the sale of a home and indexing \nfor inflation.\n  Estate tax reform is also a high priority. Confiscatory estate tax \nrates are extremely detrimental to small businesses. They depress \nnational savings, discourage entrepreneurial risk, and limit economic \ngrowth. Too often, family farms and small businesses are forced out of \nbusiness after the death of a key family member because the family \ncannot afford to pay the estate tax. We need to make sure that there is \nan incentive for entrepreneurs to start small businesses and that there \nis a way for these small businesses to flourish after an important \nfamily member dies. The bipartisan balanced budget agreement also \nincludes a phased-in increase in the unified estate tax credit \nequivalent to $1 million and inflation indexing.\n  While capital gains and estate tax relief have been a major focus of \nour tax agenda, there are other important small business issues that \ndeserve attention. One of those issues is electronic tax filing. Under \na 1993 law, small businesses were required to submit their Federal tax \npayments electronically beginning this July. However, due to inadequate \neducation and implementation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), \nmore than 1 million small businesses were very confused about how to \ntransition to the new system, concerned about the possibility of fines \nand penalties, and frustrated overall with the mandatory nature of this \nnew requirement. Fortunately, relief is on the way. I voted for the \nsupplemental appropriations bill that included an extension of the \nelectronic tax filing deadline from July 1, 1997 to the end of this tax \nyear, December 31, 1997. And the President has already signed this \nprovision into law.\n  On another tax issue, I have cosponsored S. 460, the Home-Based \nBusiness Fairness Act of 1997. Home-based businesses are one of the \nfastest growing sectors of the economy. There are currently more than \n14 million individuals earning income from out of their own homes. As \nowners of a majority of home-based businesses, women, in particular, \nhave enjoyed astonishing success in this area. There are currently \neight million women-owned U.S. businesses which produce $2.3 trillion \nin sales. Women-owned businesses employ one quarter of all U.S. \nworkers. In light of these trends, we need to open more opportunities \nfor home-based and other entrepreneurial ventures to start, grow, and \ncreate jobs.\n\n  The Home-Based Business Fairness Act targets three particular areas. \nFirst, it provides 100 percent deductibility for self-employed health \ninsurance costs. Large corporations are currently allowed to deduct the \nhealth insurance costs of all of their employees. This bill will allow \nthe self-employed to take advantage of full deductibility as well. A \nfair and competitive business environment is impossible as long as \nlarge corporations have this unfair advantage.\n\n[[Page S6009]]\n\n  Second, the Home-Based Business Fairness Act will restore the home-\noffice deduction and make it available to all business owners who \nperform their essential administrative and management functions only in \ntheir homes. This portion of the bill will clarify the ambiguities \nresulting from the 1993 Supreme Court decision, Commissioner v. \nSoliman. This decision required the customers of a home business to \nphysically visit the home office and the business owners income to be \ngenerated within the home office itself in order to qualify for a \ndeduction. This bill would expand and clarify the home-office deduction \nby allowing those who perform their services outside the home to \nbenefit from the deduction as long as they use their home for all \nbilling and recordkeeping activities.\n  Third, S. 460 clarifies the independent contractor definition. Under \ncurrent law, small businesses and the self-employed must rely on a \ncomplicated and ambiguous 20 point test of IRS guidelines to determine \nhow to classify their workers and what taxes must be paid. The IRS can \npenalize firms who use self-employed contractors and force them to pay \nretroactive taxes and fines if they disagree with the worker's \nclassification as an independent contractor. The Home-Based Business \nFairness Act will establish a general safe harbor to provide more \ncertainty in determining the independent contractor status and protect \nagainst retroactive reclassifications, fines, and penalties.\n  On the regulatory front, I have cosponsored the Mandates Information \nAct of 1997 to help reduce the burden on America's economy of \nCongressional mandates. In the past, Congress has often acted without \nadequate information concerning the costs of private sector mandates. \nThese costs are borne by consumers in the form of higher prices and \nreduced availability of goods; workers, in the form of lower wages, \nreduced benefits, and fewer job opportunities; and small businesses, in \nthe form of hiring disincentives and stunted growth.\n  The Mandates Information Act contains two key provisions to prevent \nimposition of new mandates on the private sector. First, it establishes \nan additional procedural hurdle, or shame vote, against any bill \ncontaining private sector mandates exceeding $100 million a year. \nSecond, it directs the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to prepare a \nsmall business impact statement to inform Members of Congress about a \nbill's effects on consumer costs, worker wages, and the availability of \ngoods and services. I believe this initiative will help stop the spread \nof mandates at their source--allowing small businesses to take risks \nand create new jobs without the added pressure of unfunded Washington \nrequirements.\n  Mr. President, during Small Business Week and every week, Congress \nneeds to listen to the men and women who are running Main Street \nbusinesses. Today, I speak for only a few minutes to honor the small \nbusiness owners and employees who spend hours every day trying to \nfulfill their American dreams. I want to let them know that their \nelected officials are making some progress on their agenda, but we \nstill have a long way to go. I urge my colleagues not to rest in our \nefforts to support American free enterprise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6008-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6009-S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RISING COSTS OF A COLLEGE EDUCATION\n\n Mr. CLELAND.

This figure must be contained or an increasing \nnumber of low-income students will be shut out from the opportunity to \nearn a degree.\n  According to this report, tuition is expected to double by 2015, \neffectively shutting off higher education to half of those who would \nwant to pursue it. We cannot allow this door to close on these low-\nincome students. We should be opening these doors for our young people, \nnot closing them.\n  These rising tuition costs must be addressed. An investment in \neducation is an investment in the future of this country. Adequate \ngovernmental support for higher education is essential in order to arm \nour children with the proper resources so that they are able to live \nand compete in a global market. I firmly believe in providing all \nfeasible financial support for students receiving a higher education. \nThat's why I am a cosponsor of S. 12, the Education for the 21st \nCentury Act, which would help to increase the educational opportunities \nfor America's youth.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the article detailing these \nreport findings, which appeared in the New York Times, June 18, 1997, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 18, 1997]\n\n          Rising Cost of College Imperils Nation, Report Says\n\n                          (By Peter Applebome)\n\n       The nation's colleges an universities need to cut costs \n     dramatically or face a shortfall of funds that will \n     increasingly shut out the poor from higher education and from \n     economic opportunity as well, according to a blunt and far-\n     ranging assessment of American higher education that was made \n     public on Tuesday.\n       The report, by a panel of public and private university \n     officials and corporate executives, says that rising costs, \n     falling public spending and a coming surge in demand are \n     making the economics of American higher education \n     increasingly unsupportable.\n       If current enrollment, spending and financing trends \n     continue, the report said, higher education will fall $38 \n     billion short of what it needs to serve the expected student \n     population in 2015. To sustain current spending, it said, \n     tuition would have to double by 2015, effectively shutting \n     off higher education to half of those who would want to \n     pursue it.\n       The report focuses on one of the great unspoken dilemmas in \n     President Clinton's push to make a college diploma as common \n     as a high school one: higher education is expensive, students \n     pay only a small share of their costs and, while bringing \n     increasing numbers of low-income students into higher \n     education will have long-term economic benefits, it will also \n     have enormous short-term economic costs.\n       On the other hand, the report said, with education \n     increasingly crucial to economic advancement, cutting off \n     access to education--particularly to the poor and to \n     immigrant groups who increasingly dominate the student \n     population of states like California, Florida, New York and \n     Texas--would have enormous consequences for the nation's \n     social fabric.\n       The report, ``Breaking the Social Contract: The Fiscal \n     Crisis in Higher Education,'' calls for a radical \n     restructuring of universities, including an effort to \n     overhaul university governance to limit the power of \n     individual departments, redefining and often reducing the \n     ambitions of different institutions and a sharing of \n     resources between institutions.\n       The report also calls for more public financing, but it \n     stresses that changes in the system should be prerequisites \n     to any increases.\n       ``The facts are irrefutable,'' said Thomas Kean, the former \n     New Jersey governor who is now president of Drew University \n     and is a co-chairman of the panel that wrote the report. ``We \n     are heading for a crisis at the very time we can least afford \n     one.''\n       The panel, the Commission on National Investment in Higher \n     Education, is made up of academic and business leaders \n     convened by the Council for Aid to Education, an independent \n     subsidiary of the Rand Corp.\n       Experts say that higher education is already being reshaped \n     by such forces as technology or competition from for-profit \n     institutions, so that a straight-line extrapolation from \n     current economic figures is difficult. And higher education \n     is such a varied enterprise in the United States that a \n     crisis for a public college in California does not \n     necessarily mean a crisis for Harvard or Princeton.\n       Still, Roger Benjamin, president of the Council for Aid to \n     Education, notes that even rich universities like Yale and \n     Stanford have faced deficits and retrenchment in recent \n     years.\n       And officials in state systems, which educate the majority \n     of Americans, say the gap between resources and costs in \n     higher education is becoming ever more daunting.\n       Charles Reed, chancellor of the State University System of \n     Florida, said that over the next 10 years Florida will face a \n     50 percent increase in students at its public four-year \n     institutions, from 210,000 to 300,000.\n       Barry Munitz, chancellor of the California State University \n     System, said California was midway through a half-century of \n     population growth and demographic change that would see the \n     number of schoolchildren in kindergarten through the 12th \n     grade almost double, to about eight million, and go from \n     about 75 percent white in 1970 to about 75 percent minority \n     in 2020.\n       Population growth will only accelerate the financial \n     problems facing higher education, the report said. It noted \n     that the index measuring the increases in the price paid by \n     colleges and universities for goods and services, like \n     faculty salaries, rose more than sixfold from 1961 to 1995. \n     The annual rate of growth in the cost of providing higher \n     education exceeded the Consumer Price Index by more than a \n     percentage point from 1980 to 1995, the report said.\n\n[[Page S6010]]\n\n       And, while costs have gone up, public support has not. \n     Since 1976, public support per student has just kept up with \n     inflation, while real costs per student have grown by about \n     40 percent, the report said.\n       To make up the difference, tuition has risen dramatically, \n     with tuition and fees doubling from 1976 to 1994. But the \n     report said that a similar doubling between now and 2015 \n     would have a catastrophic effect on access, pricing as many \n     as 6.7 million students out of higher education.\n       ``If you were to announce that, given fiscal pressures, the \n     door to social mobility that was good enough for the old \n     generation is really no longer needed by the new one, you \n     might as well stick a ticking bomb inside the social \n     fabric of this country,'' Munitz said.\n       While calling for more public support, the report says that \n     a solution to the fiscal imbalance has to start with colleges \n     and universities themselves.\n       ``Given the magnitude of the deficit facing American \n     colleges and universities, it is surprising that these \n     institutions have not taken more serious steps to increase \n     productivity without sacrificing quality,'' the report said.\n       The report's recommendations for restructuring--from \n     sharing a library with other institutions to eliminating weak \n     programs--are not new, but there are enormous political and \n     institutional barriers in the way of a major economic \n     overhaul of higher education. Still, some experts say \n     institutions have no option but to find ways to operate more \n     efficiently.\n       ``The ability to maximize revenue, given the competitive \n     pressures for state dollars on the one hand and the \n     resistance to future increases in tuition on the other, has \n     about run its course,'' said Stanley Ikenberry, president of \n     the American Council on Education, a leading advocacy group \n     that was not involved in the report. ``All of that's putting \n     more and more pressure on the operating side of the \n     budget.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6009-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO THE TOWNS OF NASHUA, PORTSMOUTH, AND MANCHESTER ON BEING \n        NAMED TO MONEY MAGAZINE'S BEST PLACES TO LIVE IN AMERICA\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nrecognize the great citizens of Nashua, NH, Portsmouth, NH, and \nManchester, NH, on being named to Money Magazine's best places to live \nin America. Nashua, NH came in at No. 1, with Portsmouth and Manchester \nfinishing fifth and sixth respectively, based on Money magazine's \nrankings.\n  The national investment magazine released their list of America's top \n10 communities based on business climate, economic well-being, quality \nof life, and other factors that comprise a positive environment in \nwhich to work and raise a family. New Hampshire's tourism industry, \nscenic beauty, lack of sales or income tax, low crime rate, quality \neducation and family and community spirit make the State attractive for \nfamilies and businesses to locate here. The people of these \ncommunities, and of the entire State, have good reason to be extra \nproud.\n  Nashua, the Gate City of the Granite State, named No. 1 by Money \nmagazine, is the only State to receive this honor twice, of which I and \nthe citizens are very proud. The former mill town, which borders the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, has a booming economy with manufacturing \nfacilities, hi-tech firms and defense contractors. Nashua is also close \nto many cultural arts venues and major medical facilities of \nneighboring communities, which make it No. 1 as touted by Money \nmagazine.\n  Portsmouth, New Hampshire's port city, placed sixth as the most \ndesirable place in the country. The Portsmouth community relies on many \nmajor technology and communications firms to help thrust to the \nforefront of the Nation. The Portsmouth community is a great place to \nraise a family with its many fine schools and major colleges nearby, \nincluding the University of New Hampshire in nearby Durham. The Port \nCity is also the home of one of our Nation's finest military \ninstitutions, the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard.\n  Manchester, the Queen City, picked up the sixth place honors in the \nNation. The Queen City has many high-tech firms and major \ntelecommunications businesses which help add to the economic power of \nthe city. Manchester sits on the banks of the Merrimack River, the home \nto many of the historic manufacturing plants of the late 1800's and \nearly 1900's. Situated in the Merrimack Valley of New Hampshire, \nManchester is also home to a booming cultural arts center which is the \npride of northern New England.\n  Mr. President, it is no surprise that New Hampshire is the only State \nwith 3 towns in the top 10. I can think of no cities in America more \ndeserving of these top honors than Nashua, Portsmouth, and Manchester. \nI applaud the local officials, enterprising businessmen and women and \nthe committed citizens of these great cities. They helped bring about \nan economic revival that has propelled New Hampshire into national \nrecognition once again. I am proud to represent them all in the U.S. \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6010-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       BOB OLIVER, WASHINGTON STATE D.A.R.E. OFFICER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to \nrecognize Bellevue Police Department Officer Bob Oliver for his \nselection as Washington State D.A.R.E. Officer of the Year.\n  Our children are our greatest resource and our future prosperity \ndepends on them becoming contributing members of the community. Giving \nthem the skills to success is no easy task, yet it is our \nresponsibility as adults to ensure that our children have the best \nchance possible to succeed. The D.A.R.E. Program gives them that \nchance. D.A.R.E. equips each participant with the skills to just say no \nto peer pressure when confronted with the temptation to use drugs. It \nreinforces the importance of self-esteem and the consequences of one's \nactions, lessons which will help the children confront problems of any \nsort their entire lives.\n  Through his active participation in the D.A.R.E. Program, Officer \nOliver has demonstrated his special commitment to these children. As a \npolice officer, Officer Oliver has dedicated his career to making his \ncommunity a safer place to live. Through his participation in the \nD.A.R.E. Program and with his focus on prevention, his work not only \nmakes a difference today, but will have a lasting impact.\n  Some take measure of a good police officer by the numbers of arrests \nmade or traffic violations ticketed. Officer Oliver can measure his \nsuccess by the many children whose lives he has touched and positively \ninfluenced through the D.A.R.E. Program and the high esteem in which he \nis held in the community.\n  As his family and colleagues gather to recognize him for this \nachievement, I want to wish him continued success. Officer Bob Oliver \nis truly an asset to our community, and we all congratulate him on a \njob well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6010-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6010-S6011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMENDING ALL THOSE ASSISTING THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE INQUIRY \n                         INTO HOLOCAUST ASSETS\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to commend all those \nassisting in the ongoing Senate Banking Committee Inquiry into \nHolocaust Assets.\n  I must start with the leading role of the World Jewish Congress, \nparticularly Edgar Bronfman who along with WJC Secretary General Israel \nSinger brought this issue to me on December 7, 1995. Their work, along \nwith that of Elan Steinberg has been a true force to reckon with for \nthe Swiss banks.\n  I cannot forget the absolutely invaluable help of Ambassador Stuart \nEizenstat and his very able staff in finding and preparing the \nadministration's exhaustive report on the subject. Of particular help \nhas been the work of Judy Barnett. She has fought the tough interagency \nbattles to establish the truth. State Department Historian Bill Slany \ndid an incredible job in assembling the report.\n  I want to also thank the following members of the various departments \nof the U.S. Government: Francine Barber, Abby Gilbert, David Joy, Felix \nHernandez, Judy Liberson, Bill McFadden, Eli Rosenbaum, Ruth Van \nHeuven, and Barry White.\n  I hope that I have not left out anyone.\n  The National Archives at College Park has been nothing less then \namazing. The staff has gone out of their way to provide our researchers \nwith help, including declassification, record and document locations, \nuse of their facilities, overall access to the building and records, \nand the wisdom, and advice of the gifted archivists. Put all together, \ntheir help was indispensable in establishing, continuing and expanding \nthe research of the Committee.\n  Of particular help to our staff and researchers has been that of Greg \nBradshear who compiled the finding aid\n\n[[Page S6011]]\n\nfor the various record groups of documents, Calvin Jefferson who has \nprovided us with every appropriate extension of help with regard to use \nof the Textual Reference Room, Clarence Lyons for his help in the \noverall effort, Cary Conn for his help in declassifying hundreds of \nboxes of documents, and John Taylor for his wisdom and guidance. In \naddition to these fine and dedicated people, I would like to thank the \nfollowing for their help in our effort: Rich Boylan, Rebecca Collier, \nDavid Giordano, Milt Gustafson, Ken Heger, Marty McGann, Wil Mahoney, \nWilliam Deutscher, Robert Coren, Tim Nenninger, David Pfieiffer, Fred \nRamanski, Ken Schlessinger, Amy Schmidt, Donald Singer, Marilyn \nStachelczyk, Carolyn Powell, Dr. Michael Kurz, R. Michael McReynolds, \nPeter Jefferies, and Lee Rose.\n  Again, I hope that I have not left out anyone. I am truly grateful \nfor their help to my staff and the researchers.\n  In regard to the researchers, I would like to extend my sincere \nthanks to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum for their unwavering \nsupport to the committee by their provision of interns to us for the \nresearch. Of particular help and support, and for which this part of \nthe project could not have gotten off the ground, I have to thank \nWalter Reich and Stan Turesky. Specifically without Stan, we could not \nhave done the research among many other aspect of this inquiry.\n  The museum provided the committee with top rate college students to \nconduct the research. I would like to thank the following researchers \nfor their dedicated work: Charles Borden, Rick Crowley, Polly Crozier, \nJoshua Cypress, Mary Helen Dupree, Ben Fallon, Aaron Field, David Ganz, \nAvi Glazer, Jessica Hammer, Anantha Hans, Miriam Haus, Olivia Joly, \nKelsey Libner, Mary McCleery, Daniel Renna, Adam Sonfield, Hannah \nTrooboff, Kevin Vinger, and Brian Wahl.\n  Hannah Trooboff did excellent work with her research at the various \nresearch archives in and around New York City. She did this research \nwhile attending Columbia University.\n  Additionally, I would like to thank those who were either volunteers, \ninterns, or Legislative Fellows in my office who participated in the \nresearch Marc Isser, now a member of my staff was an early member of \nthe research team and the third person out at the archives to dig \nthrough the records Marc Mazurovsky was extremely helpful in aiding our \neffort by pointing us in the right direction and helping us with the \nrecord groups. Sid Zabludoff provided help with particular record group \nsources as well.\n  Moreover, I want to extend particular thanks to the dogged research \nof a Legislative Fellow in my office, B.J. Moravek, who was the man who \ninterviewed and tracked down dozens of survivors, found information \nthat no one else could have found, and was as dedicated as anyone could \npossibly be to obtain the truth about the misdeeds of the Swiss \nbankers.\n  I also want to thank another Legislative Fellow in my office, Brian \nHufker. Brian has been indispensable in translating documents from the \nGerman and French languages and researching for the complicated and \nvast amount of detail involved in this inquiry. I am proud to have him \nas a member of my staff.\n  I also have to thank Miriam Kleiman who was literally the first \nperson in the archives for us researching this subject. She has been \ndiligent, dedicated, and totally committed to achieving justice for the \nvictims of the Holocaust, survivors, and heirs who have assets in Swiss \nbanks. While the term indispensable might be overused, she truly has \nbeen She found the first ``five-star'' documents, and she continues \nfinding them today as she continues her fine work for this worthy \ntopic.\n  In addition, I want to thank Willi Korte, who along with Miriam was \nthere from the beginning and continues to this day to help in the \ncause. Willi has selflessly dedicated his time, efforts, vast knowledge \non the subject, and even his own resources to get to the truth.\n  My greatest debt of gratitude goes to my legislative director, Gregg \nRickman. Gregg was with me from the very beginning of this inquiry. He \nspent countless hours toiling through thousands of pages of \ndocumentation from so many sources. He also worked behind the scenes to \norganize four Senate Banking Committee hearings and numerous meetings \nwith many of the principals involved. There was no institutional \nknowledge on this subject when we started. The inquiry evolved through \na painstaking learning process derived from listening to the tragic \nrecollections of Holocaust victims and their descendants, and \nconducting persistent detective work. In the latter Gregg has no equal. \nGregg, I thank you and your wife, Sonia, who made personal sacrifices \nto see that some measure of justice is achieved.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to take this opportunity to thank all of \nthese fine people who made the revelations and discoveries of the past \nyear and more possible. I mean this when I say that they have all made \nhistory. They have contributed to correcting a great injustice and have \ntried with all of their might to set history straight. They should be \nproud of their work and I know that the claimants and survivors would \nagree. For my part, I am immensely proud of their effort and I heartily \ncongratulate them for their fine work. While there is still a great \namount of work to be done, we could not have gotten even this far \nwithout all of these fine people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6010-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMEMORATING JUNETEENTH INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a \nresolution to commemorate ``Juneteenth Independence Day,'' June 19, \n1865, the true independence day of African-Americans. Juneteenth is one \nof the oldest black celebrations in America. It celebrates the day on \nwhich the last known slaves in America finally were freed.\n  Although slavery was abolished throughout the United States with \nPresident Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and the passage of the \n13th amendment in 1863, the proclamation was only enforced in \nConfederate States under the control of the Union Army. Enforcement \nbegan nationwide when Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered on behalf of the \nConfederate States at Appomattox to end the Civil War on April 9, 1865.\n  At the end of the war, 2\\1/2\\ years after Lincoln's proclamation, the \nmessage of emancipation was spread throughout the South and Southwest \nby Union soldiers who were sent to enforce the freeing of the slaves.\n  The last slaves were freed on June 19, 1865, 65 days after Lincoln \nhad been assassinated, when Gen. Gordon Granger rode into Galveston, TX \nwith a regiment of Union soldiers, declaring that Texas' 250,000 slaves \nwere freed. To commemorate that day, the former slaves dubbed that June \n19th day ``Juneteenth.''\n  African-Americans who had been slaves celebrated that day as the \nanniversary of their emancipation. For more than 130 years this \ntradition has been passed on generation to generation as a day to honor \nthe memory of those who endured slavery and those who moved from \nslavery to freedom.\n  While the significance of this day originated in the Southwest, this \ncelebration soon spread to other States. There are now Juneteenth \ncelebrations across the country. In fact, the Bloomington/Normal Black \nHistory Project and Cultural Consortium in Bloomington/Normal, IL will \ncelebrate Juneteenth this week.\n  Juneteenth celebrations commemorate the faith and strength of the \nmany generations of African-Americans who suffered and endured the \nchattels of slavery. The annual observance of Juneteenth Independence \nDay will provide an opportunity for all Americans to learn more about \nour common past and to better understand the experiences that have \nshaped our Nation.\n  I urge all Americans to celebrate Juneteenth and to reflect upon not \nonly the end of a painful chapter in American history, but also the \ntriumph of unity and freedom in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6011-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6011-S6012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO THE TOWN OF GREENVILLE ON ITS 125TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the town of Greenville, NH on their 125th anniversary. \nGreenville is celebrating their 125th birthday June 27-29, and the \ntown's citizens will highlight these festivities with an anniversary\n\n[[Page S6012]]\n\nparade and numerous other activities. This New Hampshire town has a \nsignificant heritage to celebrate on their 125th anniversary.\n  The history of Greenville began in the mid-1760's with the building \nof a saw and grist mill by Thomas Barrett and his brother, Charles \nBarrett. From that time forward the mills have been the dominant \nfeature of the town on the banks of the Souhegan River from the Upper \nFalls to the High Falls. The first mills were a grist or saw mill, \nhowever the adventurous pioneers discovered hydroelectricity which \nwould help run woolen mills, the cotton mills, furniture mill, another \nsaw mill and the generation of hydroelectricity which continues today.\n  The early settlers of this untamed country were independent and self-\nsufficient folk, characteristics that have endured in the people of \nthis region. With their independent spirit and determination they built \na strong and lasting community that makes their descendants proud. By \nthe early 19th century a unique village had grown around the mills \nalong the flowing banks of the Souhegan. The village had its own \nmeeting house, school, post office, inn, and several stores. As the \nmills thrived, the town around it blossomed into the town of today.\n  The town of Greenville had been known by many names prior to 1872. \nThe village along the river was first called Barrett's Mills, then \nDakin's Mills, Mason Harbor, Souhegan Village, Mason Village, and \nfinally Greenville in 1872.\n  Today, the town of Greenville prides itself on its quality of life \nand community spirit, a tradition that has manifested itself throughout \nthe town's history. Greenville is one of New Hampshire's smallest towns \nand boasts not only magnificent surroundings, but a community of \nfriendly, caring neighbors as well.\n  I congratulate the town of Greenville on this historic milestone and \nwish them a happy 125th anniversary celebration. I send them my best \nwishes for continued success and a prosperous year as they mark this \nhistoric occasion. Happy birthday, Greenville.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6011-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WEST VIRGINIA DAY\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, tomorrow is a special day for \nme, as well as my fellow West Virginians. On June 20, 134 years ago, \nthe citizens of West Virginia separated from Virginia and formed the \n35th State to join the Union.\n  They had a saying back then, and it was so popular they made it the \nstate motto. Our motto is ``Mountaineers Are Always Free.'' In fact, \nfreedom is what West Virginia is all about, but attaining freedom is \noften a challenge. I would like to take a moment to recognize our \nMountaineer forefathers for their courage in leaving the Old Dominion \nState and taking up the struggle for the freedom of all Americans. I \ncommend these people as well as all West Virginians who have fought for \nfreedom and liberty by serving our country. I mention this because it \nis in this spirt that our great State was born and still lives. It is \nthis unbridled love of freedom that is alive in all our people as well \nas our beautiful environment. One can observe it in the ravishing yet \nperilous gushing rapids of the New and Gauley Rivers, as well as the \nsnow-covered Appalachian Mountains, which test the resolve of thousands \nof visitors each year. If one were to have the chance encounter with \nthe majestic black bear or cast a fishing line into one of our crystal \nclear lakes, they would quickly come to an appreciation of the freedom \nwe West Virginians hold dear.\n  Times also have changed. While the once-rudimentary log cabin has \nbeen replaced by the modern home, full of televisions, microwaves, and \ncomputers, the values of West Virginians have remained much the same. \nThere is a dedication that can be seen in the work of our miners, who \nproduce an inexpensive energy source that drives not only the economy \nof West Virginia but the steel mills of Pittsburgh as well as \npowerplants all across America. Whether it is the extra assistance of a \npark ranger, or the friendly smile of a checkout clerk, there is no \ndoubt that there exists a pride and dedication in West Virginians \nsecond to none.\n  It is for these reasons as well as many more that I'm proud to be a \nWest Virginian. So it is with great honor that I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in celebrating this 134th West Virginia Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6012-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6012-S6013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            INDIAN EDUCATION\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in support of a most \nimportant and timely of resolutions proposed by my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Pete Domenici. Senate Joint Resolution 100, which \nwas introduced on June 17, 1996, goes to the very heart of a matter of \nutmost concern--the education of American Indian and Alaska Native \nchildren and youth.\n  In exchange for millions of acres of the vast landscape which \nultimately formed the very foundation of our Nation, the United States \nundertook certain responsibilities to those who were here before us. We \nentered into over 800 treaties with Indian tribes, many of which \ncontained provisions for the education of Indian children. But as we \nknow, this history is a less than honorable one--not only did we \nviolate provisions in almost every single treaty--but we entered into a \ndark chapter where education meant the forced removal of Indian \nchildren from their families and communities.\n  This nearly century-long Federal policy began in 1819 when the \nCongress enacted a law establishing a civilization fund for the \neducation of Indians. This fund was turned over to religious groups \nthat established mission schools for the education of Indian children. \nIn the late 1840's, the Federal Government and private mission groups \ncombined efforts to launch the first Indian boarding school system, and \nin 1860, the first nonmission federal boarding school was established. \nRichard Henry Pratt, the founder of the Carlisle Indian School and \nconsidered to be the father of Indian education, believed that in order \nto transform a people, you must start with their children. This \nattitude was also expressed by the Federal Superintendent of Indian \nSchools in 1885 when describing his duty to transform Indian children \ninto members of a new social order.\n  By the end of the 19th century, this pattern of forcibly removing \nIndian children from their homes and families and sending them to \nfaraway boarding schools had become so pervasive that the Congress \nenacted legislation in 1895 which made it a crime to induce Indian \nparents by compulsory means to consent to their children's removal from \ntheir environment.\n  And so, for nearly a century, under the guise of education, the \nFederal Government sought to cleanse Indian children of their \nIndianness by separating them from their families and communities for \nmany years, by forbidding them to speak their native language and \npractice their cultural traditions. The ramifications of such policies \nare still being felt today, and are still remembered in the minds of \nonce-young children, now in their eighties and nineties.\n  While this dark chapter has long since been brought to a close and we \nhave distanced ourselves from such practices, in some respects, I \nbelieve we have not come far enough. Indian students today have the \nhighest drop-out rates, the lowest high school completion rate, and the \nlowest college attendance rates of any minority group. Nearly 38 \npercent of Indian children above the age of five live in poverty.\n  Such statistics are unacceptable. We simply have not done enough, and \nwe, as a collective body, must agree that more should be done and that \nwe must act accordingly. Mr. President, that is precisely what this \nmeasure before us does--it declares the sense of the Senate that the \nFederal commitment for the education of American Indians and Alaska \nNatives be affirmed through legislative actions of this Congress to \nbring the quality of Indian education up to parity with the rest of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, this is about capacity building, about school repairs \nso that Indian children can learn in safe environments, and about \nsufficient funding for the operation of 184 Bureau of Indian Affairs \nschools. It is about addressing Indian adult literacy needs and special \neducation, disability and vocational education needs. It is about using \nthat same educational system which once sought to strip native people \nof their Indianness, and using it instead to strengthen Indian people \nand their communities.\n\n[[Page S6013]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am proud to join my esteemed colleague, Senator \nDomenici, as a cosponsor of this resolution, and I urge each and every \nMember of this Chamber to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6012-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE MEMORY OF JUNETEENTH INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today in my State and around \nthe country we recognize the traditional anniversary of emancipation \nfor millions of African-Americans. On this date, June 19, in 1865, \nslaves in the American frontier, especially in the Southwest, finally \nreceived the word that President Lincoln's great cause of freedom had \nfinally been won. Since that date, throughout the American Southwest \nAfrican-Americans have informally celebrated Juneteenth Independence \nDay.\n  As with so many important cultural traditions in America, the meaning \nof Juneteenth was handed down from parent to child as an inspiration \nand encouragement for future generations. Earlier this year, the U.S. \nCongress recognized that tradition when it unanimously passed a \nresolution honoring the faith and strength of character of those in \neach generation who kept the tradition alive--a lesson for all \nAmericans today, regardless of background, region, or race.\n  Mr. President, Juneteenth Independence Day is an important and \nenriching part of our country's history and heritage. The history it \nrepresents provides an opportunity for all Americans to learn more \nabout our common past and to better understand the experiences that \nhave shaped our Nation.\n  I join my colleagues in both Houses of Congress in honoring those \nAmericans past and present to whom it has meant so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6013-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO HOVIE LISTER\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a man whose \nname has become synonymous with gospel music, Mr. Hovie Lister. On July \n19, 1997, a group of Georgians will recognize his contributions to the \nmusic field at the Civic Center in Atlanta.\n  Hovie was born into music. At the age of 6, he began studying the \npiano and later attended the Stamps Baxter School of Music. He often \naccompanied his family group, the Lister Brothers Quartet, around the \npiano.\n  His professional career began when he joined the famous Rangers \nQuartet and later the popular LeFevre Trio. In 1945, he came to Georgia \nand was the pianist for the Homeland Harmony Quartet heard over WAGA \nand WGST Radio in Atlanta.\n  In 1948, he organized the world famous Statesmen Quartet. The \nStatesmen steadily rose in popularity and became the premier gospel \ngroup in the nation. Hovie, as the group's manager and pianist, soon \nemerged as the chief spokesman and head of the rapidly growing gospel \nmusic industry.\n  Hovie was also an accomplished director and producer of radio and \ntelevision shows. He became the first gospel artist to sign a national \ntelevision contract and successfully directed and produced syndicated \ntelevision shows for Nabisco, as well as scripted and starred in the \ncompany's commercials.\n  In the early 1980's, Hovie brought together five performers who came \nfrom the top four groups in gospel music to form the Masters V. In \n1982, this group won the prestigious Grammy Award and in 1986, Hovie \nwas inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you and all our colleagues recognize Hovie \nLister, not just for the contributions he has made to the music \nindustry and my own State of Georgia, but for bringing gospel music to \nthe attention of all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6013-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RETIREMENT OF LT. COL. JAMES A. LAFLEUR, COMMANDER OF FORT RITCHIE\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it is my distinct pleasure today \nto recognize the Commander of Ft. Ritchie, Lt. Col. James A. LaFleur, \nwho will retire on Tuesday, June 24th, after 20 years of distinguished \nservice for his country.\n  A highly decorated soldier and respected leader, Lt. Col. LaFleur \nalso has set standards in an area in which the Army does not give any \nawards, the Base Realignment and Closure process. With great diplomacy, \nsensitivity and vision, Lt. Col. LaFleur has presided over this very \npainful process at Ft. Ritchie, a place rich in history that has proved \ninstrumental in the defense of the United States. Like my colleagues \nfrom Maryland and nearby Pennsylvania, I was very surprised and \ndisappointed by the inclusion of Ft. Ritchie in the 1995 round of BRAC \nclosings. The base has provided many good jobs for our constituents and \nwe are all saddened by the Army's departure.\n  Under Lt. Col. LaFleur's leadership, however, the BRAC process at Ft. \nRitchie has progressed as smoothly as possible. His understanding of \nthe connection between the base and the civilian community led him to \nwork with Washington County, the surrounding areas, and the Local \nRedevelopment Authority to establish a partnership that has facilitated \nthe transition for Ft. Ritchie's employees. He has reduced the closure \ntime by 50 percent, at the same time that his obvious concern for the \nbase's employees has boosted morale. Lt. Col. LaFleur's efforts in this \nregard have been recognized by BRAC-affected communities across the \nnation, as well as by the Army and the Department of Defense.\n  The successful redevelopment process has culminated in the decision \nby the PenMar Development Corporation to turn Ft. Ritchie into a high-\ntech conference and training facility, where organizations like the \nInternational Masonry Institute will use Ft. Ritchie as an \ninternational training center, bringing at least 200 good jobs to \nWashington County. I.M.I. is even considering building a conference \ncenter at this bucolic mountain lake park.\n  It is quite fitting that the man whose stewardship made much of this \npossible is the same man who will take the site into the 21st century. \nI was gratified to learn that, rather than leaving Ft. Ritchie, Lt. \nCol. LaFleur will dedicate himself to the success of the new PenMar \nTech Park, serving as its deputy director. Thus, while the Army is \nlosing an effective administrator and a courageous soldier, Washington \nCounty is retaining a respected friend committed to the welfare and \neconomic success of the area.\n  Lt. Col. James LaFleur began his military service in 1977 with the \n4th Infantry Division at Ft. Carson, Colorado, where he was a platoon \nleader and battalion officer. Since then, he has served in countries \nacross the globe, including both Iraq and Kuwait, during the Gulf War. \nFor his distinguished service, he earned the Bronze Star Medal, \nMeritorious Service Medal with second oak leaf cluster, Joint Service \nCommendation Medal, Army Commendation Medal with fourth oak leaf \ncluster, Joint Meritorious Unit Award, National Defense Service Medal, \nSouthwest Asia Service Medal, and Humanitarian Service Medal.\n  Mr. President, Lt. Col. LaFleur's service in the field is matched \nonly by his service to Washington County. His determination and spirit \nhas turned a painful base-closing into an opportunity for economic \ndevelopment, all the while engendering a lasting friendship between Ft. \nRitchie and the civilians who live and work in its shadow. \n``Patriotism,'' said Adlai Stevenson, ``is not the short and frenzied \noutburst of emotion, but the tranquil and steady dedication of a \nlifetime.'' Mr. President, Lt. Col. James A. LaFleur is a true patriot. \nI congratulate him on his distinguished military career, and look \nforward to his continued success as a leader in Washington County, \nMaryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6013-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6013-S6014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECOGNITION OF REV. JOSEPH P. MCLAUGHLIN\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, this Sunday, numerous students, \nparents, and alumni of my Alma Mater, Archmere Academy in Claymont, DE, \nwill be gathering to honor the Rev. Joseph P. McLaughlin, O. Praem. \nwho, during his 26 years as a teacher and headmaster at Archmere, has \nbeen more than a pillar of the academy. He has been a vital part of \nArchmere's spirit, and a tremendous influence In the lives of thousands \nof young women and men.\n  One of the cliches that teenagers hear again and again is how their \nteen years are ``the best years of your lives''. Well, with all due \nrespect, for most kids, it is not that simple. Too many adults have \nforgotten how those years are often filled with uncertainty and \ndiscomfort, as teenagers undergo\n\n[[Page S6014]]\n\ntremendous physical and emotional changes, have their values frequently \ncalled into question and their judgement tested beyond their \nexperience, and must make major decisions which will impact the course \nof their entire lives and careers. At no other time in their lives are \nthey forced to make so many major choices with so little experience and \ninformation upon which to base those choices. It is a time when \nguidance, understanding, and friendship are critical.\n  For more than a quarter-century, young men and women of Archmere \nAcademy, have counted upon Father McLaughlin for that guidance, \nunderstanding, and friendship. And he has always been there for them, \nguided by his own deep faith, sincerity, and lifelong experience in \ndealing with young people. Of course, we will never know many of the \nspecific instances of Father McLaughlin's intervention, because he is \nthe soul of discretion and modesty, but there are countless Archmereans \nwho will tell you that when they needed an advisor, a mentor, a friend, \nFather McLaughlin was there for them.\n  I graduated from Archmere before Father McLaughlin arrived, but my \ntwo sons attended the school during his tenure, and my daughter is \ncurrently an Archmere student. Each has had the utmost respect for his \ncommitment, his wisdom, and his generosity of spirit, and all have \nbenefitted from his years of dedicated service.\n  Having been involved with the school as an alumnus and as a parent, I \nhave seen firsthand Father McLaughlin's tireless efforts result in \nArchmere's becoming one of the premier high schools--not only in \nDelaware and the surrounding region, but nationally. It is obvious that \nhe has succeeded splendidly. The school is truly the academic beacon on \nthe hill envisioned by the school's founders, the Norbertines. Archmere \nhistorically has attracted students of all backgrounds, and turned out \npromising young scholars, and, most importantly, fine young men and \nwomen with solidly-rooted values and well-placed priorities.\n  In the longstanding tradition of the late Father Justin E. Diny, \nHeadmaster Emeritus, Father McLaughlin has long recognized that a \nschool's success can not be measured solely by the test scores of its \nstudents, or by the number of graduates moving on to prestigious \nuniversities--though by either of those standards Archmere \nis unquestionably an unqualified success--but also by the character of \nthe young men and women who pass through its gates. With his keen \nsensitivity for the Academy's rich history and tradition--``The \nArchmere Way'', as it is known on campus and throughout the community--\nFather McLaughlin saw to it that Archmere graduates were solid, civic-\nminded citizens with commitment and compassion as well as being \noutstanding scholars.\n\n  As headmaster, Father McLaughlin has been admired for his personal \ndecency, his quiet and gentlemanly way, his ability to listen to all \nsides before coming to a decision, and his vision for Archmere's \nmission and its future. He has long recognized that Archmere's future \nlies in its past, in terms of both history and tradition. In his belief \nthat Archmere alumni--those who have had such a tradition imbued in \ntheir characters--should play a vital role in sustaining and nurturing \nthe Academy's atmosphere, Father McLaughlin has uniquely enriched the \nlives of all those students who attended Archmere during his tenure. As \na result of Father McLaughlin's genuine commitment to maintaining the \nunbroken chain--from Archmereans to Archers to Auks--past and present \nArchmere alumni continue contributing to the school community long \nafter their campus years are over. It is my fervent hope that this \ntradition--the one for which Father McLaughlin worked so hard to \nperpetuate--the idea that an Archmere education is but the first step \nin a lifetime of involvement, will be a cornerstone of the Academy for \nall succeeding generations of Archmere students.\n  Father McLaughlin will now redirect his tireless energies and many \ntalents to his new position as novice master and formation director for \nthe Daylesford Abbey, where he will continue in his familiar role as \nmentor and counselor, as he matures new members of his order, thus \nensuring that his enthusiasm, dedication, and legacy of service to the \ncommunity will be instilled in yet future generations of teachers, \nstudents, and community-minded men and women of faith. As he embarks \nupon that challenge, all of us who love Archmere and the traditions our \nalma mater stands for, wish our friend Father McLaughlin him well, for \nhis service should be held up as an example and an inspiration for all \nwho accept the challenge to teach America's youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6013-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6014-S6015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RON D. ALIANO\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of \nthe more colorful characters in my home State, Ron D. Aliano, who on \nJune 24, 1997, will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the creation of \nhis first business in Norwich, CT.\n  Ron is renowned throughout my State for his positive attitude and his \ndetermination to tap the potential that he saw in the town of Norwich. \nHe challenged Norwich residents to commit themselves to the \nrevitalization of their hometown, and he is one of the leaders of this \ncommunity's urban renewal.\n  Ron Aliano is a man who believes that you can achieve any goal \nthrough commitment and hard work. He is also an ardent believer in the \ntheory that, ``if you're going to do something, you do it right.'' The \nbest illustration of Ron's commitment to doing a task first rate would \nbe the Marina at American Wharf.\n  For years, people talked about developing the Norwich waterfront, but \nthese plans never amounted to anything more than talk. But Ron Aliano \nwas the man who had the determination to make this project come to \nfruition. Before construction began on the Marina at American Wharf, \nRon visited 86 successful marinas around the country to see what \nworked, and he tried to incorporate the best elements of each into his \nproject. Today, boaters from Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode \nIsland, and all over Connecticut have rented slips in Norwich. Many \npeople would argue that American Wharf is the nicest marina in New \nEngland, and it is the central spoke in Norwich's revitalization \nefforts.\n  Another, more unique illustration of Ron's commitment to doing things \nfirst rate would be the miniature golf course that Ron constructed in \ndowntown Norwich. Instead of windmills and plastic dinosaurs, this \ncourse is lined with waterfalls and finely manicured gardens. It even \nhas a volcano, a claim that very few miniature golf courses can make. \nThis course has attracted people to the downtown area, stimulating the \nNorwich economy.\n  While Ron has worked diligently to develop Norwich, he also \nrecognizes the fact that Norwich's strength lies in its history and \ntradition. As a result, he is deeply committed to preserving the town's \nrich heritage. In a misguided effort, certain developers uprooted \ncobblestone streets and destroyed several 19th century homes in \nNorwich, replacing them with a parking garage. In addition, many other \ndeteriorating old buildings were in danger of being demolished. \nFortunately, Ron Aliano and other members of the private sector \ninvested substantial resources to purchase and renovate these old \nbuildings, and Norwich is currently home to more significant historic \nbuildings than any other city in Connecticut.\n  Although Ron has been associated with a number of high profile \nprojects in Norwich, his first business priority has always been his \nambulance service, which will be 25 years old next Tuesday. Ron's \nambulance service has enjoyed a dramatic evolution since its birth. Ron \nfounded the company with a business partner, but, in 1981, he became \nthe sole owner of the company and changed its name to American \nAmbulance Service. While the company started with only two used \nambulances, Ron now operates a fleet of 21 ambulances, nine invalid \ncoaches, two paramedic response vehicles, one watercraft ambulance, as \nwell as numerous administrative and support vehicles. American \nAmbulance has provided ambulance coverage to U.S. Presidents, and this \nbusiness continues to offer the highest quality care to Connecticut \ncitizens.\n  What makes Ron Aliano's passion for Norwich so unusual is that he is \nnot a native son. Ron is actually from Bristol, Connecticut, and he \ndidn't move to Norwich until he started American\n\n[[Page S6015]]\n\nAmbulance Service in 1972. Therefore, as Ron Aliano celebrates the 25th \nanniversary of his oldest business, I think it is only appropriate that \nthe town of Norwich, which once named Ron Aliano as their ``Citizen of \nthe Year,'' should celebrate the day when Ron became one of its \nown.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/19/senate-section/article/S6014-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ANNOUNCEMENT OF POSITION ON VOTES\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.
