Mr. President, the proposals by House Republican leaders \nto spend a major portion of the projected budget surplus on tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest citizens gives new meaning to the word \n``irresponsible.'' Any such cut would rob Social Security recipients of \nthe retirement benefits they have earned and deserve. Yet the House \nRepublicans want to spend this ``surplus'' before it even materializes, \nin an election eve vote-buying scheme of massive proportions. Every \nSenator on both sides of the aisle who is serious about preserving \nSocial Security for future generations has a duty to reject these \noutrageous proposals.\n  Before we spend it, wouldn't it be wise to at least ask where this \nprojected surplus comes from? The answer is clear--and shocking in its \nmeaning. Ninety-eight percent of the ten-year surplus projected by the \nCongressional Budget Office comes from the Social Security Trust Fund. \nThe issue is not whether we should use the surplus to ``save Social \nSecurity,'' the surplus is Social Security. Using those dollars to pay \nfor anything other than retirement benefits for future Social Security \nrecipients would be an act of political grand larceny. The victims \nwould be those hard-working men and women who are counting on Social \nSecurity to protect them in their retirement years.\n  The term ``surplus,'' as it is used in the budget debate, means only \nthat the total amount of revenue received by the Federal Government in \na particular year exceeds the total amount that the government will \nspend in that year. In the current fiscal year, for the first time \nsince 1969, the Federal Government will take in more dollars than it \nspends. But this so-called ``surplus'' does not take into consideration \nany future financial obligations of the Government, such as the \nobligation to pay Social Security benefits to retirees in\n\n[[Page S10332]]\n\nthe future. The surplus is not extra money which Congress can spend on \nany worthy cause. It is money which must be set aside to pay those \nfuture obligations.\n  The overall surplus is equal to the surplus in the Social Security \nTrust Fund minus the deficit in the rest of the government. When Social \nSecurity reserves are removed from the calculation, the surpluses over \nthe next seven years evaporate. Budget deficits continue through fiscal \nyear 2001, followed by four years of roughly balanced non-Social \nSecurity budgets. Not until 2006 does any meaningful surplus appear \nwithout counting Social Security reserves.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has projected a surplus of $1.55 \ntrillion over the next ten years. Of that amount, $1.52 trillion--98%--\nis Social Security reserves, which consist of the payroll tax payments \nmade by employees and employers during the next decade and interest \nearned on Social Security Trust Fund during that period.\n  Every one of those dollars will be needed to honor our commitment to \nfuture retirees. Only $31 billion of the ten year projected surplus--an \naverage of $3 billion a year--is not already committed to meeting \nfuture Social Security obligations, and that amount could easily \ndisappear with only a slight shift in the economy.\n  A $520 billion surplus is projected over the next five years, and it \nis composed entirely of Social Security reserves. In fact, if Social \nSecurity reserves are not included, there would actually be a deficit \nof $137 billion during this period. There is no surplus for Congress to \nspend over the next five years--none at all.\n  Despite these facts, House Republican leaders repeatedly call for \nusing a major portion of this so-called surplus for tax cuts. \nOriginally, they proposed that half the surplus--over $700 billion--be \nspent on tax cuts. These Republicans had the gall to brag that they \nwould devote the other half to Social Security. Majority Leader Dick \nArmey boasted that this is ``a big, big step in the direction of saving \nSocial Security.'' Nonsense. Congressman Armey's suggestion is the \nequivalent of a banker embezzling half the money he was entrusted with, \nand boasting that he did not steal it all.\n  Now we hear from Speaker Gingrich that House Republicans will only \nseek a tax cut of $70 to $80 billion this year, but intend to pass a \nmuch larger one next spring. He acknowledged that ``virtually all of \nit'' would be paid for with dollars taken from the surplus. The intent \nof these Republican schemes is clear--it is to rob Social Security in \norder to pay for tax cuts going disproportionately to the wealthiest \ncitizens.\n  Whether the Republicans take one giant bite, or several smaller ones, \nout of the surplus, the result will be the same--a dramatic weakening \nof Social Security. The entire $1.52 trillion belongs to the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund. It is being raised to pay for retirement \nbenefits--and any diversion of any portion of those funds is wrong.\n  Congressman Kasich, the House Budget Chairman, offered an interesting \nvariation on this Republican theme. He has suggested that the interest \nearned on reserves in the Social Security Trust Fund does not belong to \nSocial Security, and should be used to finance tax cuts. That too is \nabsurd. ``I only stole the interest'' is hardly a legitimate defense \nfor a person charged with embezzlement.\n  The interest earned on the reserves is clearly part of the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund, just as interest earned by a private citizen's \nbank account is part of that account and part of the citizen's income. \nAll of the reports issued by the Social Security actuaries on the state \nof Social Security finances reflect these interest earnings. Pension \nfunds, bank accounts, and other assets earn interest, and so does the \nSocial Security Trust Fund. Using the interest earned on the Social \nSecurity Trust Funds to finance tax cuts would consume hundreds of \nbillions of dollars that otherwise will be used to help restore the \nfinancial integrity of Social Security over the long term. If the \ninterest earnings are removed from the trust fund, Social Security's \nfinancial problems would become much greater.\n  If Social Security reserves are not available for the Trust Fund in \nthe future because they have been used to pay for tax cuts, then it is \nclear that benefit cuts or large payroll tax increases will be \ninevitable for Social Security. What we call the ``surplus'' is \nactually dollars raised expressly for the purpose of paying Social \nSecurity benefits to the men and women of the baby boom generation when \nthey retire. Every dollar which we divert today to finance \nirresponsible tax cut schemes will only expand the gap between the \nfuture retirement benefits owed by Social Security and the resources \navailable to meet those obligations.\n  Social Security is fundamentally sound. Unless Congress makes the \ncurrent problems worse, harsh benefit cuts will not be necessary to \ninsure its long-term solvency. It is essential that the current benefit \nstructure be preserved. For two-thirds of our senior citizens, Social \nSecurity benefits represent more than half of their annual income. \nSocial Security has dramatically reduced the poverty rate among older \nAmericans. We cannot allow that guaranteed benefit to be undermined. No \naction by Congress would threaten those benefits more than recklessly \nspending a large portion of the Social Security Trust Fund for \nirresponsible tax cuts.\n  The surplus belongs to Social Security--all $1.5 trillion of it. We \nare not free to spend it for other purposes. The Republican assault on \nSocial Security is unconscionable. We must preserve it for future \ngenerations, not spend it recklessly on tax cuts now.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Mr. President, I rise to bring this body's attention \nto a number of very serious problems that have now been documented in \nthe U.S. Customs Service's drug enforcement efforts at ports of entry \non the Southwest Border.\n  Back in March 1996, I asked the General Accounting Office to \ninvestigate the continuing influx of drugs entering our country across \nthe border with Mexico, and the inability or unwillingness of the \nCustoms Service to effectively address the problem. I was especially \nconcerned about reports that trucks loaded with drugs were coming into \nthe country without inspection by Customs.\n  The investigation by the GAO over the past 18 months has now \nconfirmed my long-standing concerns that there are major weaknesses in \nseveral Customs' programs that were supposed to help separate so-called \n``low-risk'' Mexican cargo shipments from those that are of higher drug \nsmuggling risk.\n  These programs were intended to help expedite the processing of cargo \nby companies with no previous involvement in narcotics smuggling, which \nhad been thoroughly checked so authorities could focus on other \nshipments considered to be of significant risk of drug smuggling.\n  The problems uncovered by the GAO's 18-month investigation are, by \nthemselves, cause of serious concern. But what is also disturbing, is \nthat the flow of large amounts of drugs through our ports of entry has \napparently continued even while the GAO was conducting its research.\n  Four reports in all have been issued by the GAO:\n  Customs Service: Information on Southwest Border Drug Enforcement \nOperations (GAO/GGD-97-173R, Sept. 30, 1997).\n  Customs Service: Process for Estimating and Allocating Inspectional \nPersonnel (GAO/GGD-98-107, April 30, 1998).\n  Customs Service: Drug Interdiction: Internal Control Weaknesses and \nOther Concerns With Low-Risk Cargo Entry Programs (GAO/GGD-98-175, July \n31, 1998).\n  Customs Service: Internal Control Weaknesses Over Deletion of Certain \nLaw Enforcement Records (GAO/GGD-98-187, August 21, 1998)\n  The August 1998 report was particularly troubling and I sent a letter \nto\n\n[[Page S10333]]\n\nTreasury Secretary Robert Rubin on August 17, 1998, asking for his \nresponse. To date, I have not heard back from him. I am also including \na copy of this letter in the record.\n  The problems identified in Customs' drug enforcement efforts at three \ncargo inspection facilities (Loredo, Texas; Nogales, Arizona; and Otay \nMesa, California) have been occurring during a time when the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement has stimulated significant increases in \ncommercial trade.\n  The increased trade generated by NAFTA has resulted in significant \nexpansion of opportunities for drug trafficking organizations. This is \nlargely because of the excellent ``cover'' commercial trade activity \nprovides, according to a report issued by Operation Alliance, a \nfederally sponsored drug enforcement coordinating agency in El Paso.\n  The Operation Alliance Report clearly describes the ways in which \ndrug smugglers are exploiting increased trade. Let me cite just a few \nexamples of how drug traffickers are taking advantage of the increased \ntrade generated by NAFTA:\n  Traffickers are making extensive use of ``legitimate'' systems for \nmoving drugs into the United States by becoming thoroughly familiar \nwith Customs documents, procedures and processes.\n  Traffickers are also becoming involved with well-known legitimate \ntrucking firms that would be less likely targets of law enforcement \nscrutiny.\n  Known drug traffickers are also involved as owners or controlling \nparties in other commercial trade-related businesses to assist in the \nstorage and transportation of drugs, such as semi-trailer manufacturing \ncompanies, railroad systems, factories, distributing companies and \nwarehouses.\n  Some traffickers have sought trade consultants to determine what \nmerchandise moves most quickly across the border under NAFTA rules.\n  Against this backdrop of traffickers exploiting legitimate means of \ntransporting cargo across the border for their own illicit smuggling \noperations, we now have the GAO finding disturbing evidence of problems \nin Customs' drug enforcement efforts.\n  Problems found by the GAO include:\n  Internal control weaknesses in a program known as ``Line Release,'' \nintended to identify and separate ``low-risk'' shipments from those \nwith apparently higher smuggling risk. These flaws at all three of the \nabove-mentioned border crossings are seriously jeopardizing the \nsecurity of the program.\n  Incomplete documentation of screening and review of applicants at \nOtay Mesa, as well as Nogales.\n  Lost or misplaced Line Release application files and background \nchecklists that served as support for approving applications. Otay Mesa \nofficials were unable to locate 15 of 46 background checklists in the \nLine Release program.\n  No recertification requirement for companies already approved for the \nLine Release Program to ensure that the participants remained a low \nrisk for drug smuggling. (The Otay Mesa Port did recertify participants \non the basis of their shipping volume criteria, but does not recheck \nthose same companies for their compliance or perform follow-up \nbackground checks, the GAO said.)\n  A lack of documentation of supervisory reviews and approval of \ndecisions.\n  Mr. President, given these problems in a program whose intent was to \nexpedite crossing of low-risk shipments so more enforcement attention \ncould be focused on high-risk shipments, the effectiveness of the Line \nRelease program is called into question.\n  Moreover, the GAO found that Customs officials themselves have little \nconfidence in the ``Three Tier Targets'' concept, another enforcement \ninitiative implemented in 1992, which was supposed to help identify \nlow- and high-risk shipments so inspectors could focus their attention \non suspect shipments.\n  Under the program, Customs headquarters identified how cargo \nshipments would be divided into three-tier categories, but allowed the \nports of entry to develop their own procedures for assigning risk.\n  The GAO found that this program does not work because there is \ninsufficient information in the Customs' database for researching \nforeign manufacturers. What this means is that the reliability of the \nrisk designations, which range from ``little risk'' for narcotics \nsmuggling to a ``significant risk,'' are questionable and therefore \nunreliable.\n  The GAO report noted that some inspectors (at Laredo) were ``more \nsuspicious of shipments classified as low risk because they had doubts \nabout the reliability of the tier designations.'' Such doubts could \nlead to a self-defeating exercise in which inspectors checked more low-\nrisk shipments instead of focusing their attention on high-risk \nshipments, the GAO said.\n  Although I have cited only a few of the numerous problems and \nconcerns identified in the GAO reports dealing with low-risk cargo \nentry programs, they are sufficient to raise serious doubts about the \neffectiveness of Customs' drug enforcement efforts at our Southwestern \nBorder Ports of Entry.\n  But, unfortunately, there is more.\n  The GAO also found significant internal control problems with a \nTreasury Enforcement Communications System, which is used to compile \nlookout data for law enforcement purposes, including identification of \npersons and vehicles suspected of drug smuggling.\n  The system is used by more than 20 federal agencies, including the \nINS, DEA, IRS and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. However, \nCustoms did not have adequate controls over deletion of records from \nthe system and Customs' guidance for its use does not follow standards \nset by the Comptroller General, and which renders it vulnerable to \ndeletion of data without checks and balances by management.\n\n  The bottom line: this could result in cargo shipments being expedited \nwhen they in fact should be stopped and searched.\n  In addition to communications problems, and the previously cited \nweaknesses in the Line Release and Three-Tier Targeting program, the \nGAO also found problems with the processes for estimating and \nallocating inspection personnel at the ports.\n  For example, under the current Customs' employees union contracts, \ninspectors can only be moved to new sites if they volunteer, which I \nfind quite surprising.\n  The GAO report also found that inconsistent practices in the agency's \npersonnel decision-making processes could prevent Customs from \naccurately estimating the need for inspector personnel and allocating \nthem to ports. This inability to quickly allocate resources to where \nthey are needed most is just another hindrance in our drug interdiction \nefforts at the border.\n  Mr. President, the problems go on and on. It's an alarming situation \nthat demonstrates the Southwest Border is still, without question, \nground zero in U.S. drug interdiction efforts.\n  More than 70% of the cocaine and other narcotics entering this \ncountry come across our Southwest border. In fact, narcotics \nintelligence officials continue to warn that an estimated 5 to 7 tons \nof cocaine enters this country every single day of the year.\n  In the last two years, Congress has authorized more than $100 million \nfor 650 additional inspectors and state-of-the-art technologies along \nthe Southwest border. The President's budget in FY1999 calls for an \nadditional $104 million for Southwest Border drug interdiction efforts.\n  Despite our best efforts and constant drum beat by Members of \nCongress, including myself, to try to tighten Customs' drug enforcement \nefforts, little progress has been made.\n  Trucks are still getting through our ports of entry with their loads \nof illicit drugs concealed in cargo ranging from electronics components \nto vegetables, or in false compartments built into the trucks.\n  For example, one of the largest cocaine seizures ever made in \nCalifornia's Imperial County occurred last November when Border Patrol \nagents found 835 pounds of the drug concealed in a tractor trailer rig \nof Mexican registry at a highway checkpoint about 50 miles north of the \nborder. (Source: U.S. Border Patrol.)\n  The next month Border Patrol agents seized 474 pounds of marijuana in \nanother truck of Mexican registry in Calexico, CA., across the border \nfrom Mexicali, Mexico. (Source: U.S. Border Patrol)\n  At the Otay Mesa Cargo Inspection facility, there have been 24 \nseizures\n\n[[Page S10334]]\n\nwithin the last year of drugs found concealed in trucks and trailers, \nincluding those of two Line Release participants. (Source: information \nprovided San Diego District Office by a Customs inspector.)\n  And, in August of 1997, the New York Times News Service reported the \nfollowing:\n\n       For nearly a year, 18-wheel trailer trucks, driven by \n     experienced truckers recruited in Michigan, have been rolling \n     north from the Mexican border to New York, delivering tons of \n     concealed cocaine and marijuana and carrying back millions of \n     dollars in illegal drug profits.\n\n  Authorities said the trucks were dispatched by Mexico's most powerful \ndrug-trafficking syndicate, once headed by the late Amado Carillo \nFuentes.\n  A parallel investigation discovered the smuggling of at least 1.5 \ntons of cocaine a month in crates of fruits and vegetables from Mexico, \naccording to the New York Times Service article.\n  One wonders if these cocaine-laden vegetable shipments were routinely \npassed through by border inspectors month after month because they were \npart of the Line Release or other Customs' programs that had classified \nthe shipments as low-risk for drug smuggling.\n  More than once, officials at Customs have told me that not only is it \nimpossible to increase inspection of trucks and cars entering our \nborders, but that it is not really necessary. Customs is relying on its \nsophisticated technology, including electronic technology, random \nsearches, and Customs' vast intelligence operations, to stop the drug \nsmugglers.\n  But the fact is, while Customs is having internal control problems, \nthe drug traffickers have developed detailed knowledge and profiles of \nour port operations, and are using the ``cover'' that legitimate \ncommercial trade activity provides to penetrate our borders and smuggle \ndrugs.\n  Additionally, the ``random'' searches that I have heard so much about \nare supposed to keep traffickers trembling in their ``big-rigs.'' But \nthey have become so predictable that, as Customs has previously told my \nstaff: ``traffickers know what cargo, conveyances, or passengers we \ninspect, how many of those conveyances are checked on an average day, \nwhat lanes we work harder, and what lanes are more accessible for \nsmuggling.''\n  Mr. President, I know how difficult this task is, and I want to \ncommend the extremely hard working men and women of the United States \nCustoms Service, but the impact of Customs' internal control problems \nhave dire consequences in our fight against drugs in our cities and in \nour rural areas.\n  But without effective internal controls over the Line Release \nprogram, the Three-tier risk program and other enforcement initiatives \ncited by the GAO, Customs' ability to detect drug smugglers and to \ninterdict drugs at the border is seriously jeopardized.\n  Mr. President, we must address the Customs' internal control problems \nnow. We need to fix the problems before authorizing any additional \nprograms that would further complicate our drug interdiction efforts at \nthe border.\n  As the ranking member of the Technology Terrorism Subcommittee on the \nJudiciary Committee, I hope to work with the Chairman of the \nSubcommittee to hold hearings on the issues raised by the GAO reports \nso that we can fully understand the problem and identify a long-term \nsolution.\n  I will work with the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee to identify a way for such hearings to be held without delay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letters to GAO and to \nSecretary Rubin be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 17, 1998.\n     Hon. Robert Rubin,\n     Department of Treasury,\n     Washington DC.\n       Dear Secretary Rubin: I am writing to ask that you review \n     and respond to the weaknesses outlined in the enclosed recent \n     GAO study of Customs Services' drug interdiction and \n     enforcement programs along the Southwest border.\n       The GAO study clearly indicates problems with the current \n     drug enforcement operations along the Southwest border, \n     particularly the Line Release program and the Three Tier \n     Targeting Program.\n       The Line Release Program has weak internal controls. As you \n     may know, the Line Release program was created in 1986 on the \n     northern border and in 1989 on the southern border to \n     expedite shipments of those brokers, importers and \n     manufacturers who Customs considered a low risk for drug \n     smuggling based on specific guidelines set by the Customs's \n     Line Release Quality Standards.\n       Of the three ports studied--Otay Mesa, CA, Laredo, TX and \n     Nogales, AZ--GAO identified one or more internal weaknesses \n     in the Line Release program as implemented at all of the \n     ports, seriously jeopardizing the security of the program \n     against drug smugglers.\n       The internal control weaknesses found by the GAO include: \n     lack of specific criteria for determining applicant \n     eligibility at Nogales and Laredo; incomplete documentation \n     of screening and review of applicants at Otay Mesa and \n     Nogales; lack of documentation of supervisory reviews and \n     approval of decisions; lost or misplaced application files \n     and background checklists; (For instance, Nogales officials \n     were unable to locate 2 of 7 applications for companies \n     currently using the Line Release program, and could only \n     locate 1 of 7 Line Release checklists identified with the \n     applications on file. Otay Mesa officials were unable to \n     locate 15 of 46 background checklists in the Line Release \n     program.); and no recertification requirement under the Code \n     of Federal Regulations or Customs' implementing guidelines \n     for companies already approved for the Line Release Program \n     despite the fact that without recertification, there is no \n     assurance that the participants remain a low risk for drug \n     smuggling.\n       All three ports have little confidence in the Three Tier \n     Targeting Program. The Three Tier Program allows Customs to \n     classify shipments into three tiers--little risk, unknown \n     degree of risk and significant risk--giving expedited \n     treatment for those shipments considered ``low risk''. GAO \n     reports that officials from all three ports agreed that this \n     program is not effective in distinguishing low to high risk \n     shipments since little information is in the database to \n     research foreign manufacturers and the reliability of the \n     risk designations are questionable. For instance, narcotics \n     seizures have been made from ``low risk'' shipments.\n       GAO recommendations. The GAO report recommends that Customs \n     strengthen internal control procedures for the Line Release \n     application and review process and that Customs suspend the \n     Three Tier Program until more comprehensive data is available \n     for Customs to make risk assessments and give expedited entry \n     into the U.S. Furthermore, GAO suggests evaluating the \n     effectiveness and efficiency of pilot programs such as the \n     Prefile program and the Automated Targeting System being \n     tested at Laredo before expanding the program further.\n       As you know, drug smuggling is an ongoing problem for \n     border states like California. I know you share my concern in \n     facilitating the flow of legitimate cargo into the United \n     States without jeopardizing our enforcement abilities against \n     illegal drug smuggling. I would appreciate your response on \n     the problems outlined by GAO as quickly as possible.\n       With warmest personal regards,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 1996.\n     Charles A. Bowsher,\n     Comptroller General, General Accounting Office, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Comptroller General Bowsher: I am alarmed at the \n     continuing influx of drugs entering our country across the \n     border with Mexico, and at the inability or unwillingness of \n     the United States Customs Service to effective address this \n     problem.\n       Mexico is a dominant source of drugs entering our country:\n       75 percent of the cocaine in the United States comes here \n     through Mexico, according to the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration (DEA).\n       70 to 80 percent of all foreign-grown marijuana enters the \n     U.S. from Mexico, according to the Boston Globe.\n       90 percent of the precursor chemical ephedrine, used to \n     manufacture the rapidly-escalating problem drug \n     methamphetamine, comes through Mexico, according to the DEA.\n       Colombian drug cartels are using Mexico as a safe haven to \n     store as much as 70 to 100 tons of cocaine to be smuggled \n     into the U.S., according to the DEA.\n       Yet, faced with a problem of this magnitude, the Customs \n     Service, a critical enforcement agency at the Mexican border, \n     has been surprisingly and disappointingly ineffective.\n       Last year, the Los Angeles Times reported that not one \n     pound of cocaine was seized from trucks at three of the \n     busiest ports of entry on the Southwest border in 1994.\n       Despite the alarm which I expressed at this fact, and my \n     calls for corrective action, reporters from the Los Angeles \n     Times have told my staff that, according to sources at \n     Customs, this continued unabated in 1995, with no cocaine \n     seizures being made from trucks at Otay Mesa, Brownsville, El \n     Paso, and Laredo, four of the busiest ports. The Customs \n     Service has not yet responded to my staff's requests to \n     verify this fact.\n       The Washington Post reported that cargo trucks, along with \n     ships, are considered a\n\n[[Page S10335]]\n\n     primary means of smuggling large amounts of narcotics into \n     the United States.\n       In 1993, the then-District Director of the Customs Service \n     may have prevented investigators from the Inspector-General's \n     office from conducting a surprise inspection of the ``line \n     release'' program at the southwest border, an investigation \n     aimed at determining whether unauthorized trucks, potentially \n     carrying drugs, were allowed to cross the border without \n     inspection.\n       The news program ``Dateline: NBC'' recently filmed more \n     than 35 trucks in just four hours of surveillance belonging \n     to companies on Customs' ``watch list'' for drug smuggling \n     rolling right through Customs, without being inspected.\n       It has been reported that the organization of recently-\n     arrested Mexican drug kingpin Juan Garcia Abrego has paid \n     millions of dollars to U.S. and Mexican law enforcement \n     officers. It seems inevitable that a substantial portion of \n     that money has gone to Customs officials, as they are \n     responsible for intercepting drugs at the ports of entry \n     along the Mexican border.\n       As a Customs supervisor told the Washington Post, ``Tons \n     and tons of cocaine are crossing the border, and we're \n     getting very little of it.''\n       The current pattern of drug flow and drug enforcement into \n     and within this country must be changed. To better understand \n     how federal law enforcement approaches these problems and the \n     efficacy of federal programs to curtail drugs, I am \n     officially asking the General Accounting Office to \n     investigate drug enforcement by the Customs Service.\n       To target your resources, I ask that you focus initially on \n     evaluating the Customs Service's drug enforcement operations \n     at Otay Mesa. After you have evaluated Otay Mesa, I would \n     like to work with you to broaden this inquiry to the rest of \n     the Southwest border. Specifically, I would appreciate your \n     addressing the following questions regarding Otay mesa:\n       Does the Commissioner of Customs provide clear direction to \n     Customs personnel regarding Customs' drug enforcement \n     mission?\n       How have Customs' drug enforcement efforts been, or how \n     will they be, affected by their programs to facilitate trade \n     and passenger movement, including but not limited to: line \n     release; re-engineering primary passenger processing; and \n     expanded access by Mexican trucks to the U.S. pursuant to the \n     North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)?\n       How have the percentage rates of inspections of trucks, \n     cars, and ships by Customs changed over the last three years?\n       What increases in border crossings by trucks, cars and \n     ships does Customs expect over the next several years? Does \n     Customs have a reasonable basis for the projections it has \n     made? If Customs has not made such projections, why haven't \n     they, and was any consideration given to making them?\n       Has Customs made adequate plans to meet any expected \n     increases in such border crossings?\n       What is the basis for Customs' allocation of personnel \n     resources for carrying out their drug enforcement \n     responsibilities? Is this basis reasonable? Have Customs' \n     actual allocations of personnel matched their projections?\n       What are Customs' processes for training their personnel in \n     their drug enforcement responsibilities?\n       Why are trucks on Customs' ``watch list'' passing through \n     without inspection? Is it human error, corruption, systematic \n     flaws, or something else, and in any case what is necessary \n     to fix this? Do Customs personnel actually implement, on an \n     operational level, what Customs' law enforcement plans \n     describe that they do?\n       Is the Los Angeles Times report that there were no cocaine \n     seizures from trucks at three or four of the busiest ports of \n     entry on the Southwest border in 1994 and 1995 accurate, and, \n     if so, what accounts for this?\n       Is Customs following up and adequately using the \n     intelligence which they gather?\n       How vulnerable are Customs' communication systems to \n     penetration by drug smugglers?\n       What steps are Customs taking to address the problem of \n     ``spotters'' (individuals who linger around ports of entry, \n     radioing inspection patterns to smugglers on the other side \n     of the border)? How are these steps working?\n       How are the Cargo search x-ray machines performing?\n       It is imperative that we get to the bottom of the problems \n     at Customs, and I appreciate your assistance in this regard.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArkansas is recognized to offer an amendment relating to mining with \nthe time until 12:30 p.m. to be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, my colleagues will be greatly relieved \nwith my departure at the end of this year because they won't have to \nlisten to this debate anymore. They may have to listen to it again, but \nnot from me.\n  This amendment arises from a situation which really began last year, \nMadam President. In order to set the stage for it, I direct my \ncolleagues' attention to this chart here. But before doing so, let me \njust say that we had what I thought was a solemn agreement last year on \nthis same issue. I won't say it was a handshake contract, but last year \nthe Interior appropriations bill contained a provision that was added \nin the committee markup, which said the Secretary of the Interior may \nnot promulgate new regulations for the mining of hard rock minerals on \nFederal lands until every Governor of 11 Western States had \nindividually agreed to it.\n  In 1976 we passed FLPMA, an acronym for Federal Lands Policy \nManagement Act, it was my second year in the Senate when we passed \nthat, but I was very active in the negotiations and passage of that \nbill. It was a comprehensive bill that determined how all Bureau of \nLand Management lands would be handled. In it we said that the \nSecretary of the Interior is charged with the responsibility of \nensuring that on Bureau lands, no unnecessary and undue degradation \nwould occur.\n  Now, as my friend, the Governor of Florida, Lawton Chiles, who used \nto be our colleague, used to say on this floor, ``The mother tongue is \nEnglish.'' You cannot say it any better in English than to say the \nSecretary is hereby charged with the responsibility for making certain \nthat there is no undue, unnecessary degradation of Federal lands.\n  We have about 450 million acres of Federal lands, and an awful lot of \nit is eligible to be mined for various hardrock minerals, notably gold, \nplatinum, silver, zinc, lead, you name it. So in 1980, the Secretary \nissued regulations to comply with FLPMA and in 1981 they were finalized \nand went into effect. Everybody applauded and said it is wonderful. Now \nwe have regulations in place that will govern mining companies.\n  What brought these regulations about? It was the first time we had \never tried to regulate mining on Federal lands. Why did we do it? \nBecause at that very moment, there were 557,000 abandoned mines in this \ncountry. Who do you think had been left with the pleasure of cleaning \nup those 557,000 abandoned mines? You guessed it--``Uncle Sucker.'' The \ncleanup costs, according to the Mineral Policy Center,\n\n[[Page S10336]]\n\nfor those 557,000 mine sites is calculated to be between $32.7 billion \nand $71.5 billion. Within the 557,000 abandoned mines, 59 of those are \nnow Superfund sites. We don't put things on the Superfund list just for \nfun. That is a big-time environmental disaster. In addition to 59 \nSuperfund sites, we have 12,000 miles of rivers that have been polluted \nby mining waste, and we have 2,000 national park sites in need of \nreclamation.\n  Now, think of that. We have 2,000 mine sites within the national \nparks that have to be reclaimed. And because it took the Nation too \nlong to wake up to the environmental damage that was being done by \nmining in this country, this damage had already occurred when we passed \nFLPMA in 1976 saying the Secretary will promulgate regulations to make \nsure that not only this comes to an end, but that it never happens \nagain. So we gave the Secretary regulatory authority.\n  In 1981, those rules went into effect. Let me make one point, and I \nwill make it more than once in this debate. The mining of gold in this \ncountry is done nowadays primarily with the use of cyanide. Cyanide is \na lethal chemical.\n  Now, Madam President, in 1991, George Bush was President, a \nconservative Republican administration. Because this new technique of \nmining with cyanide had gone into effect and there were several mines \nwhich had caused cyanide to leak into the streams and rivers around it \nand into the underground water supply, the environmentalists were \nsquealing like pigs under a gate.\n  So, in 1991, the Bush administration, through Secretary Lujan, came \nout with a study to develop new regulations to take care of these new \nenvironmental problems. But because in 1993 we were trying to reform \nthe whole mining law, everybody said, ``Well, we have got this whole \nlaw we are going to reform,'' so the Interior Department decided to \nsuspend the work on revising the regulations. Unfortunately, in 1994, \nthe Western Senators were able to kill the mining law reform \nlegislation that was pending in Congress.\n  As a result, last year, Bruce Babbitt, the all-time favorite whipping \nboy of the West, said he, as Secretary of the Interior, was going to \nhonor FLPMA as it was written, and that is to make sure there is no \nunnecessary and undue degradation of the public lands. So he \nreinitiated the process begun in the Bush Administration to revise the \nmining regulations in order to attempt to prevent environmental \ndisasters, such as the leak of cyanide into the rivers, streams and \nunderground water supplies. So Senator Reid of Nevada, in the \nappropriations subcommittee last year added a provision which would \nhave prohibited the Secretary from promulgating these rules unless all \nof the Western Governors consented.\n  The provision, as it was drafted, was patently clear. It simply meant \nthat each Western Governors had veto power over the revised \nregulations. That was, obviously, a little too much, even for some of \nmy friends in the West, to stomach.\n  So Senator Reid and I worked together in good faith and mutual \nfriendship and respect on both sides. We amended that language to say \nthat the Secretary will consult with all the Governors of the West. \nAfter he has done so, he will certify to the Congress that he has \nconsulted with all of the Western Governors. He maintained that he had \nalready done that, but they disagreed with that. So we required \nconsultation in the amendment. That is the path we adopted last year.\n  We also put a time schedule in there so that the Secretary could \ncontinue to work on the regulations, and he could promulgate the \nregulations after November 15. The deal was done. It will be done after \nthe election. Nobody will be hurt politically. The only thing wrong \nwith that is this year--1998--when the bill comes out of the \nappropriations subcommittee, the deal was reneged upon.\n  What is the new requirement? The new provision states that the \nSecretary could not promulgate these regulations until the National \nAcademy of Sciences has studied it for 27 months. Next year, it will be \nthe National Institutes of Health. God knows, the next year it will \nprobably be the National Organization for Women--anything to keep these \nregulations from going into effect.\n  Make no mistake about what we are talking about. Everybody \nunderstands it. Under the provision that is in the bill this year, \nwhich I am proposing with this amendment to strike, guess what the \ntimetable is. It will now take 27 months for the National Academy of \nSciences to study it and to report it and the Secretary to consider it \nand do whatever he is going to do--27 more months, over 2 years, of \ncontinuing to sock the taxpayers of America with the foibles of the \nmining industry. I will come back to some of those foibles in just a \nmoment and tell the American taxpayers what they are paying for right \nnow.\n  Why 27 months? You know, if you are a U.S. Senator, and if you paid \nany attention at all--you don't have to have a picture drawn for you--\n27 months takes us past the year 2000. So we go past the election in \nthe year 2000, and all of my friends who are going to come in here and \nvote against my proposal today hopefully will elect a President of a \ndifferent persuasion who will bring James Watt back as our Secretary of \nthe Interior.\n  That is the politics of the issue. It is not pleasant to talk about \nthings like that on the floor of the Senate. But there isn't a single \nSenator here today who is going to vote who doesn't understand \nprecisely what it is about. Every Senator who votes against my \namendment is going to know in spades that he is voting to continue to \nallow mining companies to mine on Federal lands with virtually no \nregulations to guide them, being able to put up an insufficient bond, \nand when they take bankruptcy and go south again, will leave the \ntaxpayers of America to pick up the tab. I don't know how I can put it \nany plainer than that.\n  Madam President, let me be just a little bit more dramatic, a little \nbit more graphic about why the anti-environmental rider in this bill \nshould be taken out.\n  I want you to bear in mind, last year we postponed it until November \n15. If my amendment is not adopted, that takes us down well past \nNovember. It takes us into about January 2001; and more and more \nenvironmental degradation, more rivers and streams polluted, more \nmining companies taking bankruptcy and heading south with an \ninsufficient bond.\n  That is for what you are going to be voting. For all of those who are \nrunning for reelection this year, when you go home and your opponent \nsays, ``Why did you vote against putting some regulations in to \nregulate the use of cyanide to keep it from going into our underground \naquifers and our rivers and streams; why did you vote to continue \nthat,'' I would like to hear your answer.\n  But just to give the taxpayers of America some information, if not my \ncolleagues who are not here this morning, in 1992, Galactic Resources, \nthe owner of the Summitville Mine in Colorado, took bankruptcy. They \nleft cyanide, acid, and metal runoff going into the underground \naquifers and the Alamosa River. Do you know what has happened since \nthen? The taxpayers of this country are paying over $1 million a year \nto try to contain cyanide and acid runoff from that mine, not Galactic \nResources.\n  The Summitville mine took bankruptcy and went south. That was in \n1992. The reason they were able to create an environmental disaster in \nthe State of Colorado is because Colorado's bonding regulations were \ninsufficient. Federal regulations are similarly flawed. We have \nconstantly postponed new regulations, and the regulations we were \noperating with were promulgated in 1981, and in 1981 we didn't even \nknow about cyanide poison being used in the mining process. Secretary \nBabbitt is trying his best to promulgate rules and regulations to make \nsure there will be no more Summitville mines.\n  So when people come walking onto the Senate floor to vote on this \namendment, remember, you get to go home and tell your constituents that \nthey are picking up a million-dollar tab a year because we do not have \nregulations to control gold mining in this country.\n  Now we have a brand new one in Montana. Pegasus Gold Company, which \nhas filed for bankruptcy recently closed the Zortman-Landusky mine on \nBLM and private land in Montana.\n\n[[Page S10337]]\n\nThey have filed for bankruptcy. Cyanide spills all over the place. And \nwho do you think is going to get to pick up the shortage on their bond? \nThe taxpayers of America.\n  And here is one, to be totally fair about it, that is not on Federal \nland, the Gilt Edge mine in South Dakota, another 1998 matter. They had \ncyanide leaks in the ground water, acid mine drainage, and they are in \nfinancial difficulty. And if they take bankruptcy, it is estimated that \ntheir bond will pay about 50 percent of the cost of cleaning up that \nmess.\n  The regulations that we are talking about trying to get promulgated \nto stop this outrage are not just to stop the use of cyanide. We are \nnot trying to stop the use of cyanide. We are trying to make them use \nit in a way that we know the plastic cover on the ground is strong \nenough to not break and leak. But the second thing we are talking about \nis making them put up a sufficient bond; in case they do have a \nspillage, in case they do go broke, the taxpayers will not be left with \nit.\n  The reason I use Gilt Edge is not because they are mining on Federal \nlands but because they are proposing to extend their operations onto \nNational Forest land.\n  So since 1976 we have been trying to stop mining companies from \nmining in an improper way, leaving the taxpayers with the tab. We have \nbeen trying a lot of other things without success. But if I were \nspeaking on national television to 268 million people in America and \nall the adults were listening, how many votes do you think I would get? \nAbout 90 percent of the American people. But, unhappily, I am not \nspeaking to 268 million Americans. Lord, how I wish I were; I feel \nsupremely confident as to how the American people would feel about \nthis.\n  So, Madam President, let me go back and make one other point and then \nI will allow some of my adversaries to have their say.\n  Let me describe for you how gold is mined today under modern methods. \nFirst of all, you have to dig up the earth. You dig up huge, cavernous \namounts of soil that supposedly has gold in it. You bring the soil into \nthe mine site, where huge plastic covers have been laid out on the \nground, and you dump this soil on this plastic cover that covers the \nground and presumably will hold any fluid or liquids that you put \nthrough this dirt. Huge pits. You ought to see them. They look like \nabandoned strip mining sites. But this modern method that I talked \nabout is new, brand new, and is causing all the damage that we need \nregulations to control.\n  Then they use a drip process along the top of this big mound of dirt \nwhere this cyanide drips through, and it seeps down through this huge \npile of dirt. The gold is attracted to this cyanide solution. Then it \npours out on the side into sort of a gutter, where the gold is strained \nout of it and the cyanide is recycled and once again put through this \ndrip process. It is like a drip irrigation system.\n  Now, the first thing you have to do is understand how lethal cyanide \nis, and the second thing you have to understand is that the reason some \nof these spills occur is that the plastic liners leak. Think about how \nominous it is. How would you like to live in the vicinity where you \nknew your underground water supply had cyanide leaking into it?\n  Mr. President, I have nothing against the National Academy of \nSciences, it is a fine organization. But we don't need another Academy \nstudy. The National Academy of Sciences has already examined the \nmatter. In 1978, when we enacted SMCRA, governing the regulation of \ncoal mining, a provision was included in the bill to require the \nNational Academy of Sciences to study the regulatory requirements \nneeded to address the environmental impact of hard rock mining. That \nstudy was completed in 1979. That same study found a need for a Federal \nregulatory framework.\n\n  In 1996, the Environmental Law Institute studied hard rock mining \nprograms and said the current regulations were insufficient. That was \nin 1996. In 1992, the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs \nprepared a study that found significant gaps in environmental \nregulation of mining. The GAO has studied this issue to death and has \nfound flaws in the administration of our mining laws.\n  The question then becomes, When you consider all the studies that \nhave been done and the damage that has occurred while we have been \ndoing studies, why in the name of all that is good and holy do we need \nanother study? I repeat, do we need another study to postpone this \nuntil after the year 2000, when a new Secretary, presumably, will take \noffice who does not even believe in studies, let alone environmental \nregulation? This is all a ploy. Everybody in the Senate knows that. \nWhen they vote today, they are going to think, ``Now, what kind of a \n30-second spot can somebody make out of me voting to continue mining \ngold with cyanide when the regulations were written before cyanide was \neven used in gold mining?'' And they think about it and they put it \nthrough this little filter, this little political filter in their ear, \nand say, ``Well, on the other side it says the National Academy of \nSciences. Who can object to the National Academy of Sciences studying \nsomething? It is a very prestigious organization.'' And they can \nprobably try to convince their constituents that they are trying to \nprotect them by having the National Academy of Sciences do a study \nwhen, in fact, the National Academy of Sciences could do what they need \nto do on their own in 2 months. But the list I just gave you shows this \nhas been studied and studied and postponed and postponed, until now we \nhave these environmental disasters on our hands that cost the taxpayers \n``gazillions.'' It is going to cost them a fortune.\n  And don't anybody make any mistake in your judgment about how this is \ngoing to play out. As I said, we had a solemn agreement last year. \nEverybody understood exactly what we were agreeing to. And, \nincidentally, we said the Secretary had to consult with all the Western \nGovernors. He has done that. Governor Miller, I think, is president of \nthe Western Governors' Association; he has notified Members of Congress \nthat they have been consulted with. Everything we agreed to last year \nhas taken place, and we come back here today and industry says, ``No, \nwe have to have one more study.''\n  I have said most of what I want to say. I just ask, what is the \nobjection, even of the Western Senators? What is their objection to the \nInterior Department, that they want to prohibit any update of the \nregulations? Nobody has cited a single objection to the drafts of the \nSecretary of Interior that were going to go into effect, that were \ngoing to be promulgated November 15 of this year. Do they object to \nmining companies having to file a plan before they start mining? Do \nthey object to requiring mining companies to post a bond sufficient to \ntake care of the devastation that they may cause? Do they object to a \nregulation that says they must reclaim the land when they finish mining \nit? What is the objection? Is it that they have to minimize the adverse \nimpact on the environment, if at all economically and technically \npossible? It does not say they have to. It says they have to minimize \nadverse impacts if at all technically and economically possible. Who \ncould object to that?\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, the amendment is up, isn't it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has not called up his amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3591\n\n            (Purpose: To remove an anti-environmental rider)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I now call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3591.\n       Strike line 19 on page 55 through line 6 on page 58.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, let me wish you a good morning as we \nproceed with the Interior appropriations process. I would like my \ncolleagues to note that I stand in strong opposition to Senator \nBumpers' amendment to strike the National Academy of Science study. \nWhat we have here is an organization of scientists that are objective. \nThey have a reputation of making decisions based on sound science and \nnot rhetoric. We\n\n[[Page S10338]]\n\nhave a good deal of rhetoric here in this body.\n  The language that Senator Bumpers would propose to strike is as \nsimple and straightforward as any legislative language can be. In spite \nof all words to the contrary, it does nothing more than direct the \nNational Academy of Sciences to review existing State and Federal \nenvironmental regulations dealing with the hard rock mining industry to \ndetermine the adequacy of these laws and those regulations to prevent \nunnecessary and undue degradation, and how to better coordinate Federal \nand State regulatory programs to ensure environmental protection. It is \nshort, it is sweet, and it is to the point.\n  The Senator from Arkansas has a long history in opposition to mining. \nIt is interesting to note that the State of Arkansas has a relatively \nsmall amount of mining activity, most of which is either on private or \npatented land, unlike the western part of the United States, Nevada, \nCalifornia, Idaho, my State of Alaska. I do not have a constituency in \nthe poultry industry. I could, perhaps, claim ``fowl,'' relative to the \nconstant objection from my good friend from Arkansas who clearly has no \nconstituency in the mining industry. But the point is, the mining \nindustry in the United States has been able to survive in an \ninternational marketplace, unlike the poultry industry which has a \ndomestic market and domestic concerns. My point is that the economy of \na good portion of the Western United States is dependent on the mining \nindustry.\n  It needs fixing, but it is not broke. It is rather interesting to \nnote that the reason we are here today, to a large degree, is that we \nhave yet to pass a mining law reform package in the U.S. Senate. It is \nfair to ask why. Let me tell you why, Madam President.\n  The Senator from Arkansas specifically asked the Senator from Alaska, \nwho chairs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, not to mark up \nthe mining legislation because he was working diligently with me and \nothers to try to put together a compromise that he could support.\n  But the point is, he asked and I put off Senator Craig's and my \nmining bill while he negotiated with industry on a comprehensive reform \npackage. I hope that effort is not over. But we would not be here today \nor have to go through this debate if our reform bill had come to this \nfloor for a vote, which I hope within the timeframe remaining it still \nmight. It was an effort to provide a balanced package that contained a \nhost of surface management protections along with royalty, but it was \nbecause he asked us to put off the mining law package that we are here \ntoday debating only a portion of the reforms envisioned in my mining \nbill.\n  Let me remind you, Madam President, the reform of mining law is \ncomplex. There are different minerals. It is not like the coal industry \nwhere you are dealing with one particular mine product. You are dealing \nwith gold, you are dealing with silver, you are dealing with copper, \nall of which have different complexities in the mining and, more so, \nthe refining process, different costs, and the realization that you may \nbe mining rich gold in one mine and much lower grade gold in another, \nyet the costs are significant. When you try to have uniformity in \napplication of mining law, it becomes very complex and often an \nimpossible task.\n  What we are proposing in our mining bill, as the Senator from \nArkansas knows, is a pattern similar to what is working in the State of \nNevada. My colleagues from Nevada will be addressing that. But that is \nbasically the application of a net royalty.\n  Madam President, hard as it is to believe that we agree on anything, \nI do agree with Senator Bumpers that it is an absolute shame that the \nCongress has been forced to intercede in what should be the Department \nof Interior's routine rulemaking process. This has been addressed by my \nfriend from Arkansas, but if we look back historically, we have been \nable to count on administration agencies to do an evaluation of needs \nthat is objective and straightforward before launching off and writing \nnew regulations. Sadly, under the current Office of the Secretary of \nthe Interior, this has not been the case. Let me tell you why.\n  The entire rulemaking effort for mining is rooted in a Secretarial \ndirective to the Bureau of Land Management in which he concludes that \nsince the Congress has not acted on mining reform, it is his intention \nto do so through the regulatory process. So here is the Secretary of \nthe Interior circumventing the will of Congress.\n  Why don't we have a bill here? We accommodated the Senator from \nArkansas in withholding on the markup so we could negotiate. Yet, he \nwants to move in and strike the involvement on a portion--a portion, \nMadam President--of the reform from having the independent study done \nby the National Academy of Sciences.\n  I am sure my colleagues understand what we have going on here. As we \nlook at giving the Secretary of the Interior the right to initiate \nrulemaking, circumventing the role of Congress, I think on most issues, \nmy friend will agree with me, there is no justification for it. There \nis a mining bill before this Congress. We would like to have it passed, \nbut we are waiting for a resolve by the Senator from Arkansas to \nnegotiate something that is satisfactory to him, as well as us. We have \na bill before this body, as I promised many of my colleagues after the \nlast vote on this issue that we would.\n  Let's go back to the proposed rulemaking, which the Senator from \nArkansas has referred to, at the Department of Interior. It is \ninteresting to note that no assessment of existing Federal laws and \nregulations, no assessment of existing State laws and regulations--\nsimply put, the result so far from the Department of Interior is, no \ndetermination of need whatsoever has come out of this process.\n  Governor Miller of Nevada perhaps put it best when he said the \ncurrent Department of Interior mining regulation effort is a solution \nlooking for a problem, and my good friend from Arkansas is here with \nhis continuation of his objection to this particular industry.\n  During the last appropriations cycle, we attempted to temper the \nSecretary's driving impulse to regulate with an amendment which would \nhave forced--forced--the Department of Interior to at least coordinate \nits efforts with the Governors of the affected States. My friend from \nArkansas said they met that obligation. The only difference is, the \nGovernors of the affected States didn't agree with the Department of \nInterior.\n  It was our hope through this coordinated effort the new regulations \nwould not drop a monkey wrench into the existing State-Federal \nregulatory network. Anyone, Madam President, with even a rudimentary \nunderstanding of how the mining industry is regulated understands that \nthe State governments play by far the largest role in oversight and \nenforcement of environmental regulations on the industry.\n  What is wrong with that? The Senator from Arkansas seems to put \nlittle credence in the oversight capability of the States. What is \nwrong with the States, the most concerned group with regard to their \nresponsibility concerning environmental oversight on the mining \nindustry? Is it better to have a faceless bureaucrat in Washington, DC, \ndictating what goes on in Nevada, California, Idaho, dictating to the \npeople of Idaho, the people of Alaska who live with the mining \nindustry, who take pride in their State, who take pride in the \nreclamation process to meet their obligations?\n  The reason for this is simple. Over time, the States have been \ndelegated Federal responsibilities for water quality, air quality, \nsolid waste management, and mine reclamation. These laws are the 800-\npound gorillas when it comes to mining.\n  Over time, these Federal programs have been fully integrated into \nState environmental protection laws. These interwoven laws form a \ncomplete and balanced net of environmental regulations that cover \nalmost every aspect of mining activity. And if they don't cover some, \nthey will, without so much as a thought given to the impact their \nrulemaking efforts would have upon existing Federal and State programs \nthat the Department of Interior took upon itself to launch into a major \nrewrite effort.\n  What is their agenda? Is it to run the domestic mining industry \noffshore? We have learned from what happened in Mexico and Canada when \nthe industry basically ceased to exist at its previous level because of \nrestrictions. And, remember, unlike the poultry industry,\n\n[[Page S10339]]\n\nwhich is a domestic industry and with which my colleague from Arkansas \nis familiar, the mining industry has to operate internationally. It \neither competes on an international basis or it doesn't. It is much \nmore complex.\n  Last year, at the request of Governor Miller of Nevada, Senator Reid \nput on an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill which would \nhave made it mandatory that the Interior Department at least coordinate \nefforts with the States--at least coordinate them. He did this only \nafter the Governor made it clear that coordination was not taking \nplace.\n  So I take issue with the general statement of my friend from \nArkansas. We were prepared last year to make Interior Department \ncoordination with the States mandatory. Senator Bumpers, however, saw \nfit to intercede on behalf of the Department of Interior with an \namendment which removed mandatory coordination with States and put in \nplace a requirement that the Secretary certify to the Congress that the \ncoordination had occurred, and the Secretary has done that. But the \nStates didn't agree. They didn't agree, Madam President.\n  While I have had doubts about this, I supported the approach. I was \nhopeful that the amendment would be received in good faith by the \nInterior Department and that they would make sure that the States \ninterested were factored into their mining regulation effort. What \nfollowed was the most, I think, disrespectful, in-your-face response I \nhave ever seen from the Department of Interior and any other agency of \nthe Federal Government.\n  In the Interior appropriations bill, when it was signed by the \nPresident November 11, 1997, a letter certifying that coordination with \nthe Governors had taken place was signed on Monday, November 14. Well, \nthey didn't agree. The cavalier attitude of the Interior Department is \nthe sole reason we are back here again this year. At this time, I urge \nmy colleagues not to be taken in by the rhetoric. Fool me once, shame \non you; fool me twice, why, shame on me.\n  It is obvious to me that we have seen examples that the Department of \nInterior is simply unwilling and incapable of following good government \npractice when it comes to regulating the industry. They have so \ncompletely lost their objectivity and become so biased against this \nindustry that they appear completely incapable of making objective and \nfair decisions.\n  It is just not the mining industry. Grazing on public land falls into \nthe same category; oil and gas exploration, same category; access to \npublic land; the administration talks about global warming and that gas \nis the answer--where are you going to get the gas if they won't allow \nexploration on public lands; timbering, Forest Service lands, and, of \ncourse, mining on western public land.\n  Our amendment does not make a finding one way or the other regarding \nthe ultimate needs for new regulations. It does direct an ``unbaised'' \nassessment of the need for new regulations be completed before--and \nthat is the whole purpose of the National Academy of Sciences--before \nthe Interior Department can finalize mining regulations.\n  With diminished budgets, increased need and the growing complexity of \nState, Federal and environmental protection laws, why on Earth would \nany responsible government manager propose a large-scale rulemaking \neffort without first establishing a solid and specific need?\n  Since it has become obvious that the Interior Department is either \nunwilling or incapable of accomplishing this assessment, then it is \nimperative that the Congress now step in and assume the responsibility. \nThey leave us with no other choice. Once the National Academy of \nSciences completes its assessment, the Interior Department will be free \nto proceed with its regulatory efforts. At that point, they will have \nthe information they need to rewrite the regulations in a way that \nfixes problems, if there are any, but not create problems.\n  The citizens of this Nation are entitled to a Department of Interior \nthat determines need before it acts, that doesn't waste money that it \nsorely needs in other places, a department that doesn't unnecessarily \ndisrupt a system of State and Federal regulations laboriously \nconstructed over decades to complement and enhance environmental \nprotection at the lowest possible cost.\n  The time has come to draw a line in the sand with this \nadministration. It is simply not in their purview to regulate an \nindustry out of existence without first establishing a need for that \nregulation. It cannot simply dismiss input from the affected States, \nwhich they have done. These States truly are our partners, not our \nenemies.\n  I have communications from the Governors of Nevada, Arizona, Idaho, \nUtah, Wyoming, and New Mexico, asking Congress to protect their \ninterests, asking us to support retention of the National Academy of \nSciences' objective study. Like us, they simply want the Interior \nDepartment to demonstrate a need for regulation before they step up on \nthe effort.\n  By voting to table Senator Bumpers' amendment we will certainly set \nin motion this study. It is my understanding it will be Senator \nBumpers' motion to strike.\n  Now, I am sure all of you will hear a great deal of verbiage about \nthis issue, but when the dust settles and the smoke has blown away, you \nonly have to ask yourself one question: Do we want to start a massive, \npotentially disruptive rulemaking effort before the need for the effort \nhas been established?\n  There you have it--short, simple and to the point. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in a vote against Senator Bumpers' amendment. In \nso doing, we will be sending a clear message to the administration that \ngood government is still important government, and the government that \nis best is the government that is close to the people. The State's \nvoice should be heard. The States play a critical role in environmental \nprotection. Their partnership and input is important. Let's have a \nfair, objective, qualified, scientific group, the National Academy of \nSciences, make the call.\n  How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 57 minutes; the \nSenator from Arkansas has 38 minutes.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield up to 15 minutes to my friend from the State \nof Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this Senator from Nevada would like 20 \nminutes, and the junior Senator from Nevada would like 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is quite satisfactory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, let's put this in proper perspective. Gold \nprices are at the lowest level in 19 years as of just last week. The \nmining industry has seen layoffs. Some of the companies have filed \nbankruptcy. This seems like a very inopportune time to come in and \nattack the mining industry. It is an industry which creates the best \nblue-collar jobs in America. I repeat, the best blue-collar jobs in \nAmerica come from mining.\n  Here is the Senator from Arkansas, again, as he does every year, \nattacking the mining industry. This year the attack is at a very \ninopportune time. I repeat, the mining industry is going through some \nvery difficult times.\n  In spite of paying the highest wages in blue-collar industry in \nAmerica, the mining industry in America is the best in the world. The \ncosts of production are extremely low. They are lower than Australia or \nany other country. We are competitive. But it has been very difficult.\n  Now, having said that, we also have to recognize that the gold \nindustry is a very important industry for the United States. We are a \nnet exporter of gold. It is one of the few things that we do that \ncreates a favorable balance of trade in America.\n  With that as the setting for this amendment, let me say this \namendment is attempting to strike from the bill language that is very, \nvery reasonable. The Secretary of Interior is attempting to do by \nregulation what he can't do by legislation. What right does he have to \noverrule what the will of the Congress is? He has no right to do that. \nHe has tried very hard. I am not making this up. He said in 1994 when \nhis legislative efforts failed,\n\n       We will explore the full range of regulatory authority we \n     now possess.\n\n  Since that comment, with a vengeance, the Secretary has gotten busy \non\n\n[[Page S10340]]\n\nthe regulatory side while making no attempt to work with Congress to \nreform the mining law bill. If we had had support from the Secretary's \noffice in the past 2 months, we may be here today talking about mining \nlaw reform rather than hacking away at this Interior bill.\n  The Governors, at their meeting in Medora, ND, in June of 1997, \npointed out in a resolution that the current State programs, as far as \nthey are concerned, are working well, and attempts to duplicate them \nshould be avoided.\n  What we have here is, again, something we like to talk about, but not \ndo much about, and that is talk about States rights. States rights are \nvery important to our framework of government. We have here a number of \nStates which are saying we are willing to work within the Federal \nconcept and all the laws that we pass in Washington that affect mining, \nbut let us regulate from the State level. This amendment is attempting \nto take that away.\n  The Secretary of Interior has proceeded undaunted with his rulemaking \nin spite of how the Governors feel. This led to language being included \nin last year's Interior bill that precluded the Secretary from \nexpending funds to rewrite 309. As the chairman of the full committee \nsaid a few minutes ago, showing absolute disrespect for Congress, the \nSecretary, 3 days after the President signed the Interior bill--we \nstuck language in the bill saying he had to confer with Governors--3 \ndays after signing that bill, he sent a letter saying that they had \nconferred and complied with the requirement to consult with the \nGovernors. Let's be realistic--within 3 days? This was, as chairman of \nthe full committee said, an in-your-face remark to Congress from the \nSecretary of Interior's office saying, ``We don't have to consult with \nyou.''\n  After numerous Governors, both individually and collectively, pleaded \nwith the Department not to forge ahead on rulemaking without bringing \nthem in the process, he continued. Only after months of letterwriting \nand handwringing did the Secretary send his task force out with a draft \nproposal. After the draft proposal was received, the Governor said, \n``We have seen it; we have looked at it. What are you trying to \ndo?'' It doesn't make any sense. The chairman of the full committee, \nthe junior Senator from Alaska, held a hearing. At the hearing, the \nGovernors testified, ``Where is the demonstrated need to rewrite the \n309 service management regulations?'' There was no response as to why \nit was necessary.\n\n  Madam President, understand that this isn't something that we have \ndreamed up. This isn't some anti-environmental piece of the Interior \nbill. In fact, what this is, is a clear demonstration that the mining \nindustry, the Governors from the States where mining is important, and \nthe rest of the country where mining is important, are simply saying \nwhat they want to do is have an independent, unbiased, competent body \ntake a look at the present regulations to see if they are OK. We have \nassigned the National Academy of Sciences, one of the foremost \nscientific bodies in the world, to take a look at this. That doesn't \nsound unreasonable to any reasonable person.\n  This language is not an anti-environmental rider that would somehow \ngut existing regulations. We don't touch existing regulations. We are \nsimply saying that it is within the purview and jurisdiction of \nCongress because it is something that we feel will add to a good \nresolution of this issue.\n  The Secretary has proceeded in a cavalier fashion for an outcome that \nwould seriously jeopardize the State's role as coregulators with the \nFederal Government in mining. There is talk about the atrocities toward \nthe environment in mining. I come from a family where my father was a \nhard rock miner. I have worked in the mines. I went with my dad when I \nwas a little boy into the mines. I have to acknowledge that many years \nago there were a lot of environmental degradations as a result of \nmining. The tailings from the mill just ran out wherever, and the dumps \nwere just not located in any specific place.\n  In short, the legacy that went on before bears no resemblance to the \ncurrent practices in the mining industry, nor the States' ability to \nregulate mining. They do a good job now. In the past two, two and a \nhalf decades, tremendous work has been done. I am really tired of \nhearing all the time that the 1872 mining law needs to be revamped. It \nhas been over 100 years and we have done nothing. That is a bunch of \nhogwash.\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, here are the pieces of legislation, the \nlaws, that have been passed that now govern mining: Migratory Bird \nTreaty Act, Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, Historic Buildings and \nSites, Fish and Wildlife, National Environmental Policy Act, Clean Air \nAmendments, Federal Water Pollution Control, Endangered Species Act, \nSafe Drinking Water Act, Toxic Substance Control Act, Resource \nConservation, National Forest Management, Clean Air Act, Federal Mine \nSafety and Health Act, Clean Water Act, Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation \nAct, Archaeological and Historical Preservation, Comprehensive \nEnvironmental Compensation Liability Act, Superfund, Clean Air \nAmendments of 1990. And there are more.\n  The 1872 mining law has been affected numerous times by Federal laws \nthat we have passed back here. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record a list of all the different amendments to \nthe 1872 mining law.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Amendments to 1872, Mining Law\n\n\n                              Federal Laws\n\n       1.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair to advise the Senator when \nhe has 5 minutes left of his 20 minutes.\n  There has been a lot of talk about how terrible things are in the \nmining industry. Yet, the Bureau of Land Management, a Government \nagency that I have great respect for, that is doing its best, controls \nmost of the Federal lands in the State of Nevada.\n  The Bureau of Land Management has put out a brochure. This isn't from \nthe State of Nevada, the State of Alaska, or the State of Colorado. \nThis is from the Federal Government. This applies to Nevada. It says on \nthe front, ``BLM, Mining Reclamation, You'd Be Surprised.'' My friend \nfrom Arkansas talked at great length about how bad cyanide is. Let me \nread from this brochure that is now being put out to everybody who \nwants a copy in the State of Nevada and the other Western States:\n\n       Cyanide is a toxic chemical which is used in most gold and \n     silver mining operations. BLM, again in cooperation with \n     Nevada's State agencies, such as Nevada Department of \n     Wildlife and Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, \n     require that mining operations using cyanide do so in an \n     environmentally sound manner.\n       All new ponds containing lethal concentrations of cyanide \n     must be netted or detoxified to prevent wildlife deaths.\n\n  Birds do not die as a result of cyanide:\n\n       All operations using cyanide are inspected at least \n     quarterly by BLM reclamation/compliance specialists.\n       Gold or silver ore leached with cyanide must be rinsed to \n     reduce levels to safe standards upon abandonment. Leach \n     facilities are engineered to prevent any ground or surface \n     water contamination.\n       All exploration, mine and reclamation plans must be \n     reviewed under the provisions of the National Environmental \n     Policy Act.\n\n  This brochure goes on to show the great things done with reclamation \nin mining. It shows the equipment that is doing this. It is amazing \nwhat they have done to reclaim the land to its former state.\n  There is a mine near my hometown of Searchlight, NV, that is desert. \nWhen they pull out the Joshua trees, yuccas, and all the others, they \nhave a nursery for those. And when that land is reclaimed, they have \nall those plants that they have taken out of the land and they put them \nback in. These aren't a bunch of environmental bandits out there \ntearing up the land.\n  The Federal Government agrees. My friend from Arkansas should read \nwhat the Federal Government wants. I suggest that my friend, the \nSecretary of the Interior, read the publication put out by his own \nagency. I say that about the Secretary of the Interior. He hasn't been \nfair to mining. I respect the work he has done as Secretary of the \nInterior in all areas except for mining, where he hasn't done a very \ngood job. He is opposed to mining. He makes big shows when a land \npatent is issued and issues a big check saying it is not fair that we \nhave to give this land to some miner. Remember these mining companies \npay an average of a quarter of a million dollars every time a patent is \nissued. In short, the Secretary should read his own literature. The BLM \nand mining operations are continually looking for the best way to \nrevegetate and reclaim mining lands. It shows pictures of it. It shows \nfinal reclamation at the Pinson Mine.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this brochure be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Bureau of Land Management,\n\n\n                                          Nevada State Office,\n\n                                                         Reno, NV.\n\n                 Mining Reclamation--You'd Be Surprised\n\n       You may not know that on public lands in Nevada: All mining \n     and exploration projects on public lands must be reclaimed.\n       All new mining operations greater than five acres, on \n     public and private lands in Nevada, must submit a detailed \n     mining and reclamation plan, must be bonded to ensure \n     compliance, and must protect the environment.\n       Under the State of Nevada's new mining reclamation law, all \n     operations must comply with numerous environmental protection \n     programs. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the State \n     of Nevada have developed a cooperative mine plan review \n     process which streamlines the approval process.\n\n\n BLM and mining operators are continually looking for the best way to \n                  revegetate and reclaim mined lands.\n\n       Revegetation test plots at Cominco American's mine in Elko \n     County, Nevada, help to determine what combination of seed, \n     fertilizer, mulch and topsoil create the best revegetation \n     results. BLM requires test plots at many mines in Nevada to \n     evaluate local growing and rainfall conditions. These test \n     plots enable mining operators and BLM to determine the most \n     successful revegetation methods.\n       You might be surprised to learn that Nevada produced over \n     60% of the Nation's gold in 1990!\n\n\n              Cooperative efforts enhance Riparian Areas.\n\n       Mining companies are working with the public to restore and \n     revitalize public lands--those affected by old mining \n     operations and even lands not in mining areas. The Sonoma \n     Creek stream bank stability project near Winnemucca \n     demonstrates how cooperation among the various users of \n     public lands can enhance riparian areas in Nevada. Mining \n     industry, ranching and government people all volunteered, \n     with BLM, to build gabions and stream structures to improve \n     the aquatic habitat of Sonoma Creek.\n       BLM, public land user groups and the mining industry plan \n     more cooperative efforts in the future. BLM invites the \n     public to help identify and participate in these activities.\n\n\n                           cyanide management\n\n       Cyanide is a toxic chemical which is used in most gold and \n     silver mining operations. BLM, again in cooperation with \n     Nevada's state agencies, such as the Nevada Department of \n     Wildlife and Nevada Division of Environmental Protection, \n     require that mining operations using cyanide, do so in an \n     environmentally sound manner.\n       All new ponds containing lethal concentrations of cyanide \n     must be netted or detoxified to prevent wildlife deaths. All \n     operations using cyanide are inspected at least quarterly by \n     BLM reclamation/compliance specialists.\n       Gold or silver ore leached with cyanide must be rinsed to \n     reduce cyanide levels to safe standards upon abandonment. \n     Leach facilities are engineered to prevent any ground or \n     surface water contamination.\n       All exploration, mine and reclamation plans must be \n     reviewed under the provisions of the National Environmental \n     Policy Act.\n\n\n                    excellence in mining reclamation\n\n       In 1990, Governor Bob Miller of Nevada awarded three \n     ``Excellence in Mining Reclamation'' awards to exploration \n     and mining operations in Nevada.\n       Pinson Mine, Borealis Mine and Independence Mining Co. were \n     recognized for outstanding and unique practices and projects.\n\n  Mr. REID. This brochure indicates also that mining companies, one of \nwhich is pictured here, have received an award for excellence in mining \nreclamation.\n  Mr. President, the State of Nevada is totally different from the \nState of Alaska. The State of Nevada is the most mountainous State in \nthe Union, except for Alaska. We have lots of mountains, over 11,000 \nfeet high--32 to be exact. Alaska has a lot of water. We don't have a \nlot of water. Mining regulations in the State of Alaska should be \ndifferent than those in the State of\n\n[[Page S10343]]\n\nNevada. The State of Alaska should have some control in setting the \nstandards for mining reclamation, mining bonding and other such things. \nThe State of Nevada should have different standards because we live in \na desert in Nevada. That is the point.\n  Each State is subject to different water quality conditions, air-\nrelated issues, issues that stem from local climate conditions, \ndisposal criteria, and other issues that are distinct from State to \nState. That is something the Federal Government must recognize, and the \nagency does. The BLM recognizes that because they have different \nstandards in each State. That is why the present regulations are \nworking pretty well.\n  Also, Mr. President, understand this. We have asked the National \nAcademy of Sciences to study this. We don't tell them what result to \nreach. We will accept what they come up with. Why shouldn't those who \nwant these regulations changed not accept it also? We are not asking \nfor some predisposed venue. We are not asking for some agency that is \ngoing to rule in a certain way. We have asked the finest science body \nin the world to look at these regulations and find out if they make \nsense.\n  Mr. President, I will offer a number of exhibits here. One is a \nWestern Governors' Conference resolution that indicates there is no \nneed for what the Secretary of the Interior is trying to do.\n  We have a series of letters from Governors from all over the United \nStates talking about why the Secretary is wrong.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Western Governors' Association,\n\n                                        Medora, ND, June 24, 1997.\n\n                        Policy Resolution 97-006\n\n     Sponsors: Governors Miller, Leavitt, and Symington.\n     Subject: Regulation of mining.\n\n\n                             a. background\n\n       1. Federal lands account for as much as 86 percent of the \n     lands in certain western states. Most of these lands are \n     ``public lands,'' under the stewardship of the Bureau of Land \n     Mangement (BLM).\n       2. The western states have legal jurisdiction over the \n     public lands, and have a strong interest in seeing that the \n     environment is protected on public and private lands within \n     state boundaries. While the BLM manages public lands \n     throughout the country, laws, policies and management \n     decisions for public lands have the most direct impacts on \n     the lives of the citizens of the western states where the \n     greatest amount of public lands are located.\n       3. Mining operations on public lands are an important part \n     of the economy of the West. They provide thousands of high-\n     paying jobs in predominately rural areas of the West and they \n     provide important revenues to states. The mining industry \n     also continues to play an important role in the nation's \n     economy and security.\n       4. Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act \n     (FLPMA), the BLM has authority to regulate mining and other \n     activities on public lands to ``prevent unnecessary or undue \n     degradation of the lands.'' The BLM adopted rules in 1981--\n     known as the 3809 rules--controlling impacts of mining \n     activities on the public lands. These rules contain narrative \n     reclamation standards, require operators to submit a plan of \n     operations for approval including a reclamation plan, and \n     require compliance with federal and state environmental, \n     wildlife protection, cultural resources and reclamation laws.\n       5. The Secretary of Interior announced earlier this year \n     his intention to revise the 3809 rules, and appointed a BLM \n     Task Force to explore changes that should be made to the \n     existing rules. The Secretary has directed the Task Force to \n     consider numerous changes to the 3809 rules, including the \n     adoption of significant new environmental regulatory \n     requirements in the form of performance standards.\n       6. The BLM 3809 regulations do not exist in a regulatory \n     vacuum. There exists today a large body of federal, state, \n     and local environmental laws and regulations that govern \n     mineral exploration, development and reclamation. This \n     includes Federal laws delegated to the states, such as the \n     Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. The existing 3809 \n     rules are an important part of the regulation of mining on \n     the public lands.\n       7. Western states also have comprehensive state mining \n     regulatory programs, enforced in coordination with federal \n     land management agencies. These state programs set criteria \n     for permitting exploration, development and reclamation of \n     mining operations, with provisions for financial assurance, \n     protection of surface and ground water, designation of post-\n     mining land use, and public notice and review.\n\n\n                     b. governors' policy statement\n\n       1. The Western Governors believe that responsible mining \n     activity on the public lands is important and states have a \n     vital interest in assuring that the environment is protected \n     and that mining sites are reclaimed for productive post-\n     mining uses.\n       2. Effective regulation of hard rock mining and reclamation \n     operations should continue to utilize and build on existing \n     state programs, state and federal laws and cooperative \n     agreements between state and federal agencies. Because of the \n     geographic and climatic diversity of the states and the \n     location of many mines on a combination of public and \n     adjacent private lands, the states are the most appropriate \n     and sensible level of environmental regulation for mining \n     which occurs on the public lands.\n       3. Revisions to 3809 regulations may not be necessary. More \n     consideration should be given to compliance with existing \n     regulations. States have filled and should continue to fill \n     any deficiencies identified in the statutory and regulatory \n     framework and its enforcement. Establishing burdensome or \n     duplicative new BLM regulatory requirements for mining is not \n     in the best interest of states or the nation.\n       4. Any new BLM regulations must recognize the dramatic \n     improvements since 1981 in state and federal environmental \n     regulation of mining on public lands and must not duplicate \n     or be inconsistent with those requirements.\n       5. The States have concurrent jurisdiction with the BLM \n     over public lands and should therefore be included as \n     partners in any effort to amend the 3809 regulations.\n       6. The bonding requirements of the BLM, as published in the \n     Federal Register dated February 28, 1997, should be revisited \n     as part of the effort to amend the 3809 regulations due to \n     the integral nature of bonding with the entire regulatory and \n     reclamation process.\n       7. The BLM time frame for regulatory review is too short to \n     provide sufficient review and comment by stakeholders.\n\n\n                   c. governors' management directive\n\n       1. Direct staff to work with the WGA Mine Waste Task Force \n     to participate in the ongoing effort by the Bureau of Land \n     Management to revise the 3809 regulations, emphasizing the \n     states' interest in avoiding duplication, needless regulatory \n     burdens and in preserving primacy of state regulation in the \n     environmental area.\n       2. The Task Force should provide assistance and support to \n     the BLM Task Force on the status and efficacy of state \n     regulatory programs, the status of memoranda of agreement \n     with the BLM, and should make recommendations for how current \n     state programs may be improved where applicable.\n       3.

Slade Gorton,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gorton: The Bureau of Land Management has \n     proposed significant revisions to its 3809 surface management \n     regulations for hardrock mining. I have followed this process \n     closely and believe the proposed changes are redundant, \n     burdensome and costly. These revisions, as currently written, \n     would place a hardship on our efforts to regulate mining in \n     Idaho.\n       Governor Bob Miller of Nevada has suggested that an \n     independent reviewer, such as the National Academy of \n     Sciences, evaluate the current federal and state regulatory \n     regimes to determine if there are problems that need to be \n     addressed. I support Governor Miller's suggestion and urge \n     you to support efforts to initiate and fund such a study.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                   Philip E.

Frank Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Energy & Natural Resources Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: In January 1996, Secretary Babbitt \n     announced that it was the Department of the Interior's (DOI) \n     intent to rewrite the 3809 surface management regulations for \n     hard rock mining. I have followed the process of regulatory \n     development, and am greatly concerned that this rewrite is an \n     attempt by DOI to interfere with and override state \n     regulatory programs that currently have jurisdiction over \n     hard rock mines.\n       New Mexico's hard rock mining law is one of the best in the \n     country, and has jurisdiction over mines on federal, state, \n     and private lands. The draft regulations DOI has proposed are \n     not more stringent than those of New Mexico, but they could \n     create significant problems for our program and our mines by \n     imposing conflicting requirements, and establishing an \n     unnecessary process for oversight and program certification.\n       Recently, one of my colleagues, Governor Bob Miller of \n     Nevada testified at a hearing in the Senate Energy and \n     Natural Resources Committee in Washington, D.C. that there \n     had been no demonstrated need to proceed with a rewrite of \n     the 3809 surface management regulations. He suggested further \n     that an independent reviewer, such as the National Academy of \n     Sciences, should evaluate the current federal and state \n     regulatory regime to determine if there are deficiencies that \n     need to be addressed.\n       Despite frequent requests from the concerned states, DOI \n     has not provided any evidence that the current 3809 \n     regulatory structure is not working. Problems with 3809 are \n     largely anecdotal, and commonly related to abandoned mines, \n     which would not be addressed by the proposed rewrite. New \n     Mexico and other western states have filled in the gaps they \n     perceived in 3809 with state laws. New Mexico has an \n     excellent working relationship with the federal land \n     managers, and together we are doing a good job regulating the \n     mining industry. The evidence is before us daily. It appears \n     most appropriate that DOI should assemble this evidence, \n     present it to your committee and allow our elected \n     representatives to decide what is best for the states they \n     represent.\n       This process of regulatory development cries out for a \n     concrete foundation to justify the time and expense that all \n     parties are committing to it. I appreciate your continuing \n     interest in this matter, and hope you will consider \n     requesting DOI or another reviewer to provide that foundation \n     before the process moves any further.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Gary E.

Mr. President, we had testimony taken at Chairman \nMurkowski's hearing in the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of \na number of different people. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record, together with a letter from the Western \nGovernors.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Excerpt From a Hearing Held by the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources, Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management, Tuesday, \n                             April 28, 1998\n\n\n            statement of hon. bob miller, governor of nevada\n\n       Governor Miller. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. In many \n     respects, I can just say ``ditto.'' In any case, I do \n     appreciate the opportunity to join Nevada's two Senators, \n     Harry Reid and Dick Bryan, to testify today on this \n     legislation.\n       This is not the first time I have spoken to this committee \n     about the need to bring reform to the Nation's mining law, a \n     law that was enacted 125 years ago, in 1872. For example, in \n     1993, I expressed my opposition to Senate bill 257, the \n     Mineral Exploration and Development Act. Since then, there \n     have been several attempts to resolve the debates regarding \n     the reform of the 1872 mining law.\n       While reform measures are never easy, I appreciate this \n     committee's persistence in trying to find common ground.\n       I opposed S. 257 for the same reason that I oppose S. 326 \n     and S. 327 today. These bills threaten the survival of one of \n     Nevada's mainstay industries, an industry which is critical \n     to the economic health of many rural communities.\n       It is well known that Nevada was founded on mining. What \n     may not be as well known is that Nevada continues to be a \n     world leader in gold production and produces the most silver, \n     magnesite, and barite in the Nation. Remarkably, Nevada has \n     achieved these production levels and is arguably the most \n     environmentally responsible mining region in the world. Yet, \n     I do not advocate the status quo.\n       Congress and the States should continue to work with the \n     industry and the environmental community to minimize mining's \n     effects on the land and on other land users.\n       All of us here today are concerned about mining reform, the \n     industry, and the environment. The questions of a fair patent \n     law to the taxpayers, mining contribution to the Federal \n     Treasury through a royalty and the environmental \n     responsibility of mining operations are all legitimate \n     concerns.\n       We must weigh these concerns with the knowledge that the \n     mining industry is an important contributor to the Nation's \n     economy, and to my State's economy in particular.\n       Nevada's mining renaissance has created approximately \n     13,000 jobs directly related to mining, with an additional \n     45,000 jobs indirectly related to the industry. These are \n     high paying jobs that average close to $50,000 per year.\n       Rural communities, such as Austin, Carlin, Elko, and \n     Winnemucca, are all dependent on a vibrant mining industry. \n     As all of you wrestle with these issues, I would hope that \n     you would keep in mind those communities\n\n[[Page S10345]]\n\n     and those families who built a future around a moderate, \n     environmentally sensitive mining industry.\n       I believe that S. 1102, the Mining Law Reform Act of 1997, \n     shows significant progress toward resolving the debates about \n     mining law. While minimal change could be made to the \n     bill, it is time to reach finality.\n       For too long, the mining industry has operated with \n     uncertainty about the future of mining law. The industry must \n     account for many variables that have profound effects on our \n     communities. The price of gold, for instance, is testament to \n     the vulnerability of this industry in an ever changing global \n     market.\n       Since July of 1997, the U.S. has lost 2,200 operational \n     jobs from the mining industry as a result of the drop of the \n     price of gold. Over the past 4 months, approximately 680 jobs \n     have been lost in Nevada.\n       To illustrate the point, the market value of gold is \n     hovering at around $300 per ounce. In comparison, production \n     costs per ounce of gold average at best in Nevada between \n     $260 to $280 per ounce. Many mines throughout the Nation \n     operate at well over $300 per ounce. It is imperative that we \n     minimize the variables and eliminate the uncertainty about \n     mining reform.\n       While I am familiar with the contents of each of these \n     bills, I will confine my comments to some of the broader \n     aspects of each as they relate to the reform of mining law.\n       There are mining law experts here today, obviously, who can \n     go into much greater depth.\n       First, I would like to make some brief remarks about the \n     Department of Interior initiative to amend its reclamation \n     regulations, termed the 3809 regulations, which I am sure the \n     Secretary will address in a few moments.\n       Since the beginning of this initiative, I have questioned \n     the legitimacy of, in essence, changing mining law through an \n     administrative process. I not only have had questions about \n     the motivations, but, moreover, I have had concerns about the \n     process by which the Department of Interior is amending these \n     regulations. But after repeated complaints about the process \n     through the Western Governor's Association, where we have a \n     nearly unanimous vote on this issue, the issue of process has \n     been dealt with.\n       However, I continue to have substantive concerns with \n     regard to the direction in which the proposed amendments are \n     going. In short, Interior is moving the responsibility for \n     environmental oversight of mining operations in my State and \n     other States to here in Washington, D.C.\n       This attempt at seizure of control by Interior is \n     particularly perplexing in view of the fact that many States, \n     especially Nevada, have moved aggressively to address the \n     environmental concerns of mining operations.\n       To date, there has been no real justification offered by \n     the department regarding the need to make changes other \n     than--and I quote a memo of January 6, 1997--directing the \n     department to begin the process of drafting such \n     regulations. It states: ``It is plainly no longer in the \n     public interest to wait for Congress to enact legislation \n     that corrects the remaining shortcomings of the 3809 \n     regulations. Instead, the time has come to resume the \n     process of modernizing the 3809 regulations first promised \n     at the end of the Carter Administration and begun at the \n     end of the Reagan Administration. To that end, I direct \n     you to restart this rulemaking process by preparing and \n     publishing proposed regulations.''\n       During my tenure as Governor, I have overseen the adoption \n     of Nevada's State law requiring reclamation of all lands \n     disturbed by mining. My State has also developed \n     comprehensive regulations governing water quality standards \n     of mining operations. These requirements are working well \n     because they were crafted with a great deal of cooperative \n     effort by the environmental community, the mining industry, \n     and State and Federal regulators.\n       Instead of proposing changes without sufficient \n     justification, Interior should work with the States, the \n     industry, and the environmental community to pinpoint the \n     possible needed modifications regarding reclamation.\n       Or perhaps Congress could help us with this impasse by \n     requesting an independent evaluation of the 3809 regulations \n     by a third party, such as the National Academy of Sciences.\n       I believe that this type of study would determine that \n     Nevada's reclamation law could serve as the model for the \n     rest of the States.\n       On two separate occasions, the United States Environmental \n     Protection Agency has praised Nevada for its hardrock mining \n     regulatory program, declaring that, ``Nevada's regulations \n     are considered to be among the best, the most comprehensive, \n     and several gold mining States now have or are developing \n     similar requirements.''\n       The preferable solution to the 3809 debate is the passage, \n     in my opinion, of S. 1102. The sponsors of this bill wisely \n     propose a comprehensive approach to mining reform which \n     offers reasonable answers to all of the major issues, \n     including permitting and surface management, royalties, \n     patents, and abandoned mines.\n       On the other hand, S. 326 and the Abandoned Hardrock Mines \n     Reclamation Act and S. 327, the Hardrock Mining Royalty Act \n     are piecemeal remedies that resemble previously proposed \n     legislation which Nevada and this committee have consistently \n     found unacceptable.\n       The mine permitting and surface management provisions \n     within S. 1102 will conform to those activities already being \n     conducted by our State regulators, as well as the U.S. Bureau \n     of Land Management. S. 1102 defers to existing State \n     reclamations and bonding requirements where they meet the \n     intentions of the Federal act. And the bill references \n     the other State and Federal acts already used to regulate \n     mining activities with respect to the environment.\n       One of the most widespread criticisms of the 1872 mining \n     law is its lack of royalty. S. 1102 details a methodology to \n     collect a 5 percent net royalty proceeds that is fair to the \n     public and the industry. This royalty, as you stated, Mr. \n     Chairman, closely resembles the State of Nevada's net \n     proceeds system, which has proven to be highly effective.\n       Nevada's system generates millions of dollars annually, \n     approximately $29 million during Fiscal Year 1997 alone. The \n     administrative cost of our program is about $200,000 \n     annually, or \\1/2\\ of 1 percent of the revenue.\n       S. 327's 5 percent net smelter royalty return would cripple \n     the production of minerals by taxing anywhere from estimates \n     of 92 percent to 98 percent of a mine's gross income. In \n     addition to the serious, immediate negative impact, the long-\n     term effects are significant because the growth of the \n     industry would likely halt or be limited due to the high \n     royalty level.\n       Congress should focus on placing royalty on the value of \n     Federal mines after costs associated with finding and \n     producing those minerals are subtracted. Such royalty would \n     be on the value of the mineral in the ground, before any \n     additional value was added.\n       A royalty has to be found that does not close mines and \n     stop new development. I believe that S. 1102 passes that \n     test.\n       While S. 326 has no royalty provisions, it would charge a \n     reclamation fee which would be in addition to other \n     royalties, such as proposed in S. 327, thereby creating an \n     even greater burden on miners. The appropriate vehicle to \n     fund abandoned mine clean-up is found also in S. 1102.\n       The patenting is an essential means to insure the \n     production of minerals. Patenting mitigates the risk of \n     losing the substantial financial investments taken by mining \n     operations during the often long permitting periods.\n       While S. 327 would abolish this necessary security process, \n     S. 1102 would change the patent prices to reflect the value \n     of today's public land. It would wisely halt the $2.50 to $5 \n     per acre fee and sell the patent for the surface land's fair \n     market value, which I think you addressed also.\n       Reclaiming Nevada's abandoned mines is a tall task, one \n     which the State has aggressively worked to address. With \n     funding through modest assessments on the industry which have \n     been supported by the industry, Nevada has been able to \n     secure over 4,000 abandoned mine sites. Yet there are \n     thousands more sites that need attention to prevent risk to \n     public health.\n       S. 1102 establishes an acceptable funding mechanism to \n     continue this effort and to secure dangerous sites.\n       Senator Craig has addressed the major issues pertaining to \n     mining law reform in a way that is good for the public, the \n     environment, and the industry, and I compliment him and all \n     of the other sponsors for their work in support of reasonable \n     mining reform.\n       As this committee and the Senate further address this \n     issue, I hope that you keep in mind, as I said previously, \n     the communities that rely on mining. This industry has built \n     towns and communities throughout the West which need to be \n     kept at the forefront of the thought process as you proceed \n     with this issue.\n       Thank you very much for the opportunity to appear, Mr. \n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Western Governors' Association,\n\n                                   Denver, CO, September 15, 1997.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: We, the undersigned, thank you for your \n     efforts and support to include states with hard rock mining \n     on public lands as co-regulators in the Bureau of Land \n     Management's current 3809 rulemaking process. We commend you \n     for highlighting that states have legal jurisdiction, \n     concurrent with the Secretary of the Interior's jurisdiction, \n     to regulate activities on the public lands.\n       As you know, the states impose strict controls on mining \n     activities on both public and private lands within their \n     borders. Our states work closely with federal land management \n     agencies--often through cooperative agreements--to ensure \n     that mining activities are comprehensively regulated to \n     control environmental impacts. These federal-state \n     partnerships should be preserved not disrupted by new federal \n     regulations adopted without the appropriate justification or \n     state input.\n       Representatives of the Bureau of Land Management and the \n     Department of Interior did consult with western state mining \n     regulatory staff prior to the formal scoping meetings for \n     developing an Environmental Impact Statement for the proposed \n     rulemaking. However, it became clear during that meeting that \n     BLM's rulemaking was undertaken not because of identified \n     problems on-the-ground but because there was direction to do \n     so from the Department of Interior. It appears that direction \n     essentially is framing the rulemaking rather than a \n     conclusive study such as that called for in your amendment. \n     Attached for your information is a\n\n[[Page S10346]]\n\n     copy of state comments to the Department summarizing the \n     issues raised at that meeting and a copy of a resolution \n     western governors adopted on the subject in June.\n       We want to bring to your attention the fact that the \n     Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995 exempted from FACA \n     consultations between state and federal governments that \n     involve their intergovernmental responsibilities and \n     administration. We support that exemption. Your amendment's \n     creation of a unique advisory committee for the purpose of a \n     joint study, however, does not appear to undermine the \n     exemption created by the Act.\n       In closing, we support your amendment because it recognizes \n     our concerns about the states' role as co-regulator and it \n     stresses the need to avoid regulatory duplication. We will \n     make our staff available to the Department of the Interior as \n     well as committees of Congress to ensure that we work \n     together to protect the environment in a coordinated, cost-\n     effective manner.\n       Thank you, again, for the interest you have shown in the \n     states' role in environmental management and regulation.\n           Sincrely,\n     Bob Miller,\n       Governor, State of Nevada.\n     Phil Batt,\n       Governor, State of Idaho.\n     Gary Johnson,\n       Governor, State of New Mexico.\n     Jane Dee Hull,\n       Governor, State of Arizona.\n     Mike Leavitt,\n       Governor, State of Utah.\n     Marc Racicot,\n       Governor, State of Montana.\n     Ed Schafer,\n       Governor, State of North Dakota.\n     Jim Geringer,\n       Governor, State of Wyoming.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what we have to realize here is that this is \nan effort to be fair. The language in the bill calls for a study by the \nNational Academy of Sciences. I repeat. We have not asked them to find \nin any certain way. Whatever they come up with is what we will go along \nwith.\n  I think that we owe the American people an honest debate about the \ncurrent regulations for hard rock mining and all the disasters that \nhave gone on in the past. There are a number of Superfund sites. That \nis one reason Superfund was passed--because of environmental \ndegradation that had taken place in the years gone by. Mining was part \nof that. We are not part of that anymore. I think that is good.\n  We owe the American people an honest debate about the current \nregulations of hard rock mining. We owe them the opportunity to know \nabout mining, and for the first time the truth about the environmental \npractices employed by modern-day mining--not what went on 30 years, 40 \nyears, 50 years, or 100 years ago. We owe the tens of thousands of \nAmericans who make a living at mining--or some occupation that relies \non mining--to know that certainly their jobs will be there when they \nshow up in the morning.\n  I say to everyone within the sound of my voice mining affects more \nthan the people that go down in the Earth or into the open pits. It \naffects more than them because we have industries all over America that \nrely on mining. These huge trucks that haul the ore out of the open pit \noperations cost over $2 million. To replace the tires on one of those \ntrucks costs over $25,000 each. Underground operations are very \nexpensive. That equipment comes from other parts of the United States \nother than the western part of the United States.\n  This industry is important to the economic viability of this country. \nThere is no one in this body, the Department of the Interior, or the \nmining industry that can predict the outcome of the review conducted by \nthe National Academy of Sciences. I can almost assure you the results \nwill be fair. That is all we are asking.\n  But let me say that I think we should approach this on a nonemotional \nbasis. When the study is completed, we will go forward as indicated in \nthe language that is in this bill with whatever they recommend.\n  Mr. President, it is important that this amendment fail. It is not \ngood legislation. It is something we have debated time and time again--\njust in a different setting.\n  I ask my colleagues to join in doing what is right for an industry \nthat is very important to the economic viability of this country.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, might I ask what time remains on either \nside? Senator Bumpers is controlling the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Each side has approximately 38\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleague, the Senator from Nevada. I yield \ntime to Senator Bryan.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Bumpers amendment.\n  This past summer, as I have each summer since being a Member of the \nSenate, I spent most of my time in what we in Nevada refer to as ``cow \ncounty'' in rural Nevada. Most of that time I spent in places that are \nnot widely known outside of Nevada. I was in Wells, Wendover, Elko, \nBattle Mountain, Winnemucca, Lovelock, Ely --some of the smaller \ncommunities in our State, but communities that are very dependent upon \nmining as the principal base of their economy.\n  In the northeastern part of our State, as a result of the situation \nthat relates to the international pricing of gold at or near record \nlevels over the last 20 years, these communities are hurt. These are \ngood-paying jobs of $46,000 or $47,000 a year with the full range of \nhealth benefits. They are premier jobs. These communities are hurting. \nSales tax collections are down.\n  So this is a major concern about what is happening to the principal \neconomic base in the northeastern part of our State, which is a mining \nindustry.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my friend and \ncolleague from Arkansas that would prevent the National Academy of \nSciences from studying Federal and State environmental regulations \napplicable to hard rock mining on Federal lands.\n  As many of my colleagues from the West are aware, the Interior \nDepartment is proposing major revisions of the regulations that govern \nhard rock mining on public lands known as 3809 regulations. The \nregulations were originally promulgated in 1980 and require miners to \nsubmit plans for operations for approval by the BLM. The existing \nregulations require mine operators to comply with all Federal and State \nenvironmental laws and regulations, require that lands disturbed by \nmining be reclaimed, and require that bonds be posted to assure that \nreclamation is complete.\n  The State of Nevada has one of the toughest--if not the toughest--\nState reclamation programs in America. Nevada mining companies are \nsubject to a myriad of Federal and State environmental laws and \nregulations, including the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the \nEndangered Species Act, among many others.\n\n  Mining companies must secure literally dozens of environmental \npermits prior to commencing mining activities, including a reclamation \npermit, which must be obtained before a mineral exploration project or \nmining operation can be conducted.\n  Companies must also file a surety or a bond with the State and the \nFederal land manager in an amount to ensure the reclamation of the \nentire site prior to receiving a reclamation permit.\n  Let me just say parenthetically that both as Governor and Senator I \nhave been to these mining locations for many, many years. Mining today \nis much different than mining was even a generation ago, and much, much \ndifferent than it was a century ago.\n  Some of the well-advertised misdeeds of mines in the past have to be \nfreely acknowledged as something that is a source of major concern in \nterms of its environmental impact. I think it is an embarrassment to \nthe modern-day mine manager whose philosophy and approach is much \ndifferent and who is sensitive to the concerns as to the environmental \nimpact. That represents the new Nevada and the mining operations that \nexist in my State with which I have firsthand familiarity.\n  A number of the Western Governors, including our own Governor of \nNevada, Governor Bob Miller, have expressed genuine concern about the \n3809 rulemaking--that it will unnecessarily duplicate existing Federal \nand State regulatory programs. Governor Miller, in his testimony before \nthe Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee earlier this year, \nsuggested that Congress call for an independent evaluation of the need \nto revive the 3809 regulations, and made the suggestion that\n\n[[Page S10347]]\n\nthe National Academy of Sciences would be an appropriate organization \nto conduct a sufficient study. I concur. The academy has a preeminent \nreputation for fairness and balance. This is not a committee that is \nassociated with the mining industry, nor controlled directly or \nindirectly by them.\n  I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee saw fit to follow the \nsuggestion of Governor Miller, because I must express that I, too, have \nserious questions concerning the need for the Interior Department's \nproposed regulations and revisions. The current 3809 regulations \nrequire compliance with all existing Federal and State environmental \nstandards and requirements, including the Clean Water Act, the State \nwater quality standards in particular.\n  The Interior Department proposes to add a new layer of requirements \non top of existing laws for both surface and ground water which extends \nbeyond the agency's regulatory reach--far beyond management and \nprotection of Federal lands. These proposed rules, if adopted, would \nresult in inconsistent or duplicative water quality standards or \ntechnology requirements because BLM can no longer accept State or EPA \ndeterminations as compliance with the 3809 regulations. I must say it \nis somewhat ironic that the duplication of existing Federal and State \nwater quality programs resulting from this proposal will, in my \njudgment, impose substantial additional costs on the Bureau of Land \nManagement without any corresponding environmental benefits.\n  The proposed regulations allow States to continue the common practice \nof joint administration of mine regulation--and this is significant--\nbut impose unrealistic demands for Federal approval of State programs. \nThe Interior regulations will effectively federalize reclamation laws \nin all of the Western States even on non-Federal land because the \nStates must amend their laws and regulations to comply with the Federal \nmodel in order to enter into an agreement for joint administration. \nInterior has proposed this requirement without any showing that \nexisting State reclamation laws and programs are inadequate.\n  And finally, the proposed regulations include numerous additional \nprocedural and substantive requirements that will encourage delay in \nmine permitting and appeals and litigation over permitting decisions. \nIt is clear that the Secretary of Interior is attempting to rewrite the \nmining law through the regulatory process. I share the Secretary's \ndesire to update the mining law, and I would say for the record that \nNevada's mining industry is in the forefront of recognizing that the \nmining law of 1872 needs to be updated. But that is a job for Congress, \nnot unelected bureaucrats. I am hopeful that the discussions that have \nbeen occurring between my colleague, Senator Bumpers, and the mining \nindustry will lead to an agreement on mining law. In the interim, \nhowever, I think it is important that we allow the National Academy of \nSciences to assess the need for the Interior Department's proposed \nregulations, and for that reason I urge my colleagues to defeat the \nBumpers amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls 30 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. And remaining on the other side is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-eight minutes 35 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I will accommodate the Senator from \nArkansas if he desires to speak at this time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. My good friend and colleague from Alaska, Senator \nMurkowski, mentioned the fact that I come from a State where poultry is \na big industry, which, indeed, it is. And they have been taking a lot \nof hits lately. Tyson Foods, which is by far the biggest poultry \ncompany in the United States, has been fined by the State of Maryland, \nbeen made to change their operations. The Secretary of Agriculture \nannounced last week that we need a totally new set of regulations \ndealing with animal waste, including poultry. They are subject to all \nkinds of regulations. I have been here for 24 years now, and I defy any \nSenator to tell me one time I ever objected to a regulation that dealt \nwith the environment where the poultry industry was involved. I wonder \nif the Senator from Alaska would tell us how he would feel if I came in \nhere knowing that the poultry industry was creating an environmental \ndisaster and said, well, I want 27 more months to study it--if last \nyear I came here with a proposal saying you can't do anything to the \npoultry industry until every Governor in the country or every Governor \nwhose State has poultry signs off on it, and, once you get that in \nplace, say, well, all the Governors have to be consulted, and you get \nthat in place, and then I come back and say, no, we need 27 more months \nto study it.\n  I don't know how people would react to that. I expect rather \nseverely. But I will tell you one of the differences. Very few States \nhave hard rock mining on Federal lands.\n  Incidentally, I might just at this point say, Mr. President, there \nwas an editorial a couple weeks ago in the New York Times entitled \n``Time for Mining Law Reform.'' I ask unanimous consent to have that \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial is ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Time for Mining Law Reform\n\n       With very little fanfare, the White House recently released \n     a three-paragraph statement announcing the formal transfer of \n     the New World Mine site to the United States Forest Service. \n     Thus ended, officially and happily, a four-year struggle to \n     prevent a Canadian mining company and its American subsidiary \n     from building an environmentally treacherous gold mine near \n     the border of Yellowstone National Park. But the forces that \n     defeated the mine, including the Clinton Administration, have \n     one more task ahead of them. That is to overhaul the 1872 \n     Mining Law, the antiquated Federal statute that made it so \n     easy for the company to acquire the mine site in the first \n     place.\n       Signed by Ulysses S. Grant to encourage Western \n     development, the law gives mining companies virtually \n     automatic access to Federal land and allows them to take \n     title to that land for a few dollars an acre--a process know \n     as patenting. The law does not provide for ``suitability'' \n     review to determine whether the mining operation could cause \n     unacceptable environmental damage. It also allows companies \n     that mine hard-rock minerals like gold and platinum to escape \n     any royalties similar to those paid by companies that extract \n     oil and coal from Federal lands. Finally, the law does not \n     require companies to clean up abandoned sites. According to \n     the Mineral Policy Center, an environmental group, a century \n     of unregulated mining has left behind 557,000 abandoned \n     mines, 50 billion tons of waste and 10,000 miles of dead \n     streams.\n       Powerful Western senators have always managed to block \n     reform. Nevertheless, Senator Dale Bumpers, long a champion \n     of reform, plans to use his final months in office before he \n     retires to push for something meaningful on the books. The \n     Arkansas Democrat has offered three related bills that would \n     end the patenting system, impose a royalty on the minerals \n     the mining companies extract and use that money to begin \n     cleaning up old mine sites.\n       The proposed environmental safeguards could be stronger. \n     There is, for example, no suitability provision that would \n     allow the Government to insulate certain lands from any \n     mining at all. This is a serious flaw, but years of \n     legislative futility have persuaded Mr. Bumpers that to \n     insist on such safeguards would doom even the modest reforms \n     he has proposed. He also believes that ending the patenting \n     system--which effectively allows mining companies to \n     privatize public lands--would make a big difference because \n     it would expose the companies to Federal environmental \n     regulations they can now safely ignore.\n       Mr. Bumpers concedes that those regulations need to be made \n     stronger, a task that Bruce Babbitt, the Secretary of the \n     Interior, has pledged to undertake. The ever-resourceful \n     Western Republicans have also anticipated that threat, \n     saddling this year's Interior appropriations bill with a \n     rider blocking Mr. Babbitt from issuing stronger rules for at \n     least two years--at which point they hope to have a less \n     conservation-minded secretary running Interior. That is one \n     more reason for President Clinton to veto that bill, which is \n     loaded with other destructive riders. Meanwhile, the Senate \n     should approve the Bumpers proposal, which, despite its \n     flaws, represents real progress. Its passage would give the \n     victory at Yellowstone lasting resonance.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. This says exactly what I have been saying, and that is, \nthe President ought to veto the Interior Appropriations bill if my \namendment is defeated. And I personally think he will.\n  With all these disasters which I have addressed, all we have had is \none delay\n\n[[Page S10348]]\n\nafter another. In 1993 they said, ``Well, we are working on a mining \nbill,'' and in 1994 the same people who said we are working on a mining \nbill and we should not deal with these regulations did everything they \ncould to stall until 2 weeks before we were to go home to make sure \nthere was no mining bill.\n  And then last year they said, ``We want all the Governors to have a \nsay in this. Don't put a regulation into effect that prohibits the \nleakage of cyanide from a gold mining site unless all the Governors \nhave signed off on it.'' They backed off that and they said, ``Well, \nthey have to be consulted.'' We said, ``Fine, they ought to be \nconsulted.'' So they were consulted. And the president of the Western \nGovernors' Association told the Senate Energy Committee that ``We have \nbeen consulted.'' So what do they do then? They come back and say, \n``Well, now we want the National Academy of Sciences to study the \nregulations''--anything under God's sun to keep from dealing with an \nunmitigated disaster.\n  Why are the people of America indifferent? They don't even know about \nit. There is no hard rock mining in my State. I am not running for \nreelection, but if I were running for reelection I wouldn't get any \nvotes in my State out of this issue. As Gilda Radner used to say--``if \nits not one thing, its another.'' And the Senator from Alaska alluded \nto the fact that I had, indeed, been working with the National Mining \nAssociation trying to craft something to reform the 1872 law that \nUlysses Grant passed and has been such an unmitigated disaster for this \nNation. Think about a law still on the books that Ulysses Grant signed \nto encourage people to go West. Is that a legitimate reason for \nallowing this 126-year-old bill to stay on the books--encourage people \nto go West? That is what we are dealing with.\n  And the Senator from Alaska said he and Senator Craig had a bill, and \nI asked them not to bring it up. That is true. I did that because I \nthought we were going to make a deal. The Chairman of the National \nMining Association--who is a very fine, honorable man, in my opinion, a \nman of immense integrity--and I worked extremely well together. We were \nhonest with each other, and our staffs developed a draft proposal. \nUnfortunately, that was before we ran it by the Western Senators. Two \nWestern Senators said we can't do this. And the Senator from Alaska \nsaid the reason they didn't bring up the bill he and Senator Craig \ncrafted was because he thought we had a deal. I thought I had a deal, \ntoo.\n  The bill they wanted to bring up, the bill they crafted and they said \nit was too late to bring up, let me tell you what it would do. It says, \nfirst, that environmental regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \nInterior cannot be stronger than the State where the mine is located. \nThink of that. There is no point in even having a Federal regulation. \nEach State would be a king with regard to mining on Federal land. Every \nState would determine what the environmental regulations would be, \nbecause the Federal regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \nInterior could be no stronger than the State regulations of a \nparticular State where a mine was located.\n  How foolish can you get? And, when it came to the royalty, they would \ngrandfather every mining company holding a valid claim. There are \n300,000 claims in this country. If you grandfather everybody who has a \nvalid claim, you would not collect enough royalties in the next 30 \nyears to buy a ham sandwich. There is nobody to pay it. After all, \npeople have been buying Federal lands for $2.50 an acre for the last \n130 years. You cannot charge them a royalty because they own the land. \nWe sold it to them for the princely sum of $2.50. So when you take all \nof them and everybody else who turns up with a valid claim, there is \nnobody left to pay a royalty.\n  Mr. President, let me make a philosophical point. I am an unabashed, \ncard-carrying, hardened environmentalist. In 1970, when I ran for \nGovernor in my State the first time, the environment was just then \nbecoming an issue in this Nation, albeit a fairly low key one. But it \nmade a lot of sense to me, based on what I had read, and so I began to \ntalk about the environment. I began to talk about Arkansas' magnificent \nrivers and streams and how they were being polluted. I began to think.\n  In 1966, I went fishing on the Buffalo River, the most beautiful \nriver in America. It was so magnificent. I had no idea that my own \nState had such a treasure. Two nights we camped out on a sandbar. We \nate and we drank and we created a lot of garbage, and the tour guide \ntook all the garbage that we created and put it in a plastic bag, waded \nout as far as he could into the river, and tossed it. And nobody \nthought a thing in the world about it. Finally, after a little bit of \nthat, somebody began to raise the question about the Buffalo River \nbeing polluted.\n  To shorten the story, we made it a national scenic river. It is a \npristine, clean river. People come from all over the world just to camp \nout on the banks of the Buffalo or to fish the Buffalo. It was not even \npopular with the local people when we made the Buffalo River a national \ntreasure, and today there is not anybody up there who would go back to \nthe old ways. So, yes, you are being addressed by a card-carrying \nenvironmentalist.\n  Do you know the other reason? I have three children and six \ngrandchildren. We talk about how much we love them, how they are our \nmost precious possession, how our whole life is calculated to make life \nmore pleasant for them, and then we come in here to vote for trash like \nthis.\n  We only have one planet. God, in his infinite wisdom and in the \nheavens, gave us one planet to sustain us forever. Not next week, not \nnext year--forever. We say, ``Well, God certainly didn't mean to stop \nputting cyanide poison into our underground aquifers and our streams \nand rivers, because there are jobs involved in this. God didn't intend \nthat.'' No--that is how specious the arguments are that I have been \nlistening to this morning. So you only get one chance to preserve the \nplanet.\n  You can buy these arguments about, well, what is wrong with the \nNational Academy of Sciences studying the rules for mining? Nothing, \nexcept they have already studied it. Everybody studied it. There are \nGAO reports galore. If the National Academy of Sciences is so important \nto us, why was it not mentioned last year, and the year before and the \nyear before that? It is a nicely crafted idea, because at the \nfundraisers, if anybody raises the question, you can say, ``What is the \nproblem with the National Academy of Sciences--it is a very prestigious \norganization--studying the rules on how we are going to mine?''\n  It would not take 27 months. Mr. President, 27 months is carefully \ncalculated to take us past the Presidential election of the year 2000.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Wisconsin, \nMr. Feingold, and the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, be added as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, Bill Clinton, my friend from my home \nState of Arkansas, has been taking a lot of trashing lately, a lot of \nit richly deserved. I am not here to defend the President. But I will \ntell you one thing. You can say a lot of things about him but you \ncannot say he is not an environmental President. I will tell you what I \nthink he will do. I think he will follow the advice of Dale Bumpers and \nthe New York Times and veto this bill if this amendment is defeated. I \ncan tell you I don't care how weak he is, I don't care how disturbed he \nis about all of this, I don't care how disturbed the American people \nare, I promise you there is one thing about him that he will not yield \non and that is the environment; and for the very same reason nobody in \nthe U.S. Senate ought to yield on it.\n  I know it is painful. I know companies are put upon because of the \nenvironment. But, when you think about what has happened to the \nenvironment over the past 300 years of history in this country, it is \ntime we implement strong measures.\n  Did you know that the rules right now say that you cannot even \nregulate a mine of 5 acres or less, you can go out and create all the \ndamage you want to on 5 acres? That is a pretty good spread for some \nmines. In the State of Nevada, there are 2,400 mines of 5 acres or \nless. Here is a letter from the BLM office in Reno, NV, to an \nassemblywoman in Nevada, about these 5-acre mine sites. The BLM says:\n\n\n[[Page S10349]]\n\n\n       Since enactment of BLM's surface management regulations in \n     1981 [that's the one we are still trying to live with, put in \n     effect in 1981, since the regulations in 1981] the BLM in \n     Nevada has processed nearly 10,000 notices. Currently, there \n     are approximately 2,400 active notice-level operations in \n     Nevada. There have been many environmental and operational \n     problems associated with the smaller operations in Nevada.\n\n  We aren't talking about 1872. We are talking about May 1, 1997. Let \nme repeat that.\n\n       There have been many environmental and operational problems \n     associated with the smaller operations in Nevada.\n       In summary, there are 90 exploration or mining sites of \n     five acres or less in Nevada where a reclamation bond would \n     have either probably prevented a new modern-day problem from \n     developing or would have been used to reclaim an \n     environmental problem.\n\n  You can defend that if you want to if you are from Nevada. That is \nyour privilege. Do you know something else? The Federal regs of 1981 \nare just like the Nevada law. We exempt all mines of 5 acres or less. \nThousands and thousands of them are exempt under Federal regulations. \nAnd you think that doesn't create environmental havoc?\n  Mr. President, I am not terribly optimistic about my chances of \nsucceeding today. Last year, happily, we were able to work out an \narrangement where we said we will consult with the Western Governors. \nNobody mentioned the National Academy of Sciences last year. I have \nbeen in the Senate 24 years and ever since I have been on this issue, \nnobody has ever mentioned the National Academy of Sciences. But \nsomebody cleverly came up with the idea and said, ``At your \nfundraisers, you can always defend yourself; you can say, `The National \nAcademy of Sciences did a study on that.' '' I sure hope they come up \nwith a good set of regulations. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 30 minutes \nremaining, and the Senator from Arkansas has 19 minutes 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield such time as my friend and \ncolleague from the State of Idaho might need, reserving at least 5 \nminutes for myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alaska, the \nchairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, first of all, \nfor the leadership role he has taken over the last good number of years \nto try to bring reform to the 1872 mining laws.\n  For some reason, the Senator from Arkansas would like to portray that \nmining is a rogue industry in our Nation that goes unregulated, outside \nenvironmental regulations, and he cited today 5-acre mine sites. They \nare not outside the environment, they are simply outside a plan of \noperation. My guess is, one could find piles of chicken manure in that \nState that violate environmental laws that are less than 5 acres that \nare not controlled. Does that sound silly and facetious on my part? \nYes, it does, and I apologize to the Senator from Arkansas for saying \nit, but I want him to understand that when he makes a statement like \n``5 acres, rogue, out of control,'' it is not true. It is not true in \nmy State that has very tight environmental laws, and it is not true in \nother mining States.\n  What the Senator from Arkansas would like to have you believe in his \ncompassionate statements about mining is that somehow these impact his \nState. His State is not a mining State, per se. Mine is. The Senator \nfrom Alaska has a mining State. The Senators from Nevada have a mining \nState. Those States have had mining for over 100 years, and some of \nthat mining they are not proud of, or I should say, were not proud of.\n  In the sixties and the seventies and the eighties and the nineties, \nthose States began to take control of their own environmental destiny, \nin part urged by the Senator from Arkansas, no question about it; in \npart, a product of the National Environmental Policy Act; in part a \nproduct of the Clean Air Act; in part a product of the Clean Water Act. \nAll of those came together to shape plans of operation and new mining \nstrategies for this country. I will tell you what it did in my State. \nIt cleaned up a lot of messes, messes by the definition of today's \nenvironmental standards and ethics, not definitions by mining and \nenvironmental standards of 70 or 80 years ago.\n  Why is the Senator standing up here this morning painting the world \nas if it were black, most importantly, painting the world of mining as \nif it were a disaster? The Senator from Arkansas knows it just \n``ain't'' so, but this is one of his causes celebres which you and I \nhave heard on this floor--and I serve with him on the committee--for a \nlong, long while.\n  What is the essence of this administration's attempt to rewrite the \n3809 regulations? My guess is that Secretary Babbitt and Solicitor \nLeshy are creating a solution for a problem that doesn't exist, or more \nimportantly, creating a solution that plays to their political base and \nhoping there is a problem out there to which they can attach it. I have \na feeling that down underneath all of this, this is just about the \nwhole of the problem that we are attempting to debate on the floor \ntoday.\n  There is no question that this Senator, the Senator from Alaska and a \ngood many other Senators want responsible mining law and we think, in \nlarge part, we have it, because the old 1872 mining law in one court \ncase after another, after another, after another, after another, after \nanother, piled up over 100-plus years, has transformed the world of \nmining in this country into not only the significant industry it is, \nbut the environmental-sensitive industry that it is today.\n  Yet, the Senator from Arkansas and others love to drag out 20-year-\nold pictures and 20-year-old stories as if they had just happened \nyesterday and say, ``Oh, look at these pictures and read this story; \nisn't it terrible what the world of mining is doing to the clear and \npristine lakes and rivers of our country?''\n  Let me tell you the mining story, the pictures and the story today \nabout those clear and pristine rivers. They were not once clear and \npristine. Mining tailings were dumped into them, and the rivers in my \nState, in one instance, ran murky the year round. But today the Coeur \nd'Alene River, flowing down through the major mining district of my \nState, runs clean. Fish propagate in it. Kids swim in it.\n  That wasn't true 20 years ago. It was a combination of Federal and \nState effort that produced that. But most importantly, it was the \nethics of the citizens and the government of the State of Idaho that \nsaid as a mining State, we have to do it right, and that is what \nWestern Governors are saying today to this administration and to the \nSenator from Arkansas and to a lot of others who like to use this as \ntheir political base.\n  Look at the politics of it, sure, but look at the reality of what we \nare doing. All of these States have very tight laws and regulations \ntoday. You heard it from the Senators from Nevada, one of the top \nmining States in the Nation today, employing tens of thousands of \npeople and bringing hundreds of millions of dollars into our economy. \nThey are doing it right. They are doing it under all of those \nenvironmental laws that were passed on this floor in the sixties and \nthe seventies and the eighties, and they are not backing away from them \nor trying to shrink from those laws. They are trying to improve them \nand better them.\n  So why is the Secretary of Interior and his Solicitor and the Senator \nfrom Arkansas looking for a solution to fit a problem that doesn't \nexist? I am not sure. I already suggested it does identify with their \npolitical base, but I am not so sure it identifies with the real world, \nespecially if a former Governor, who talks about how his State has done \nso well, believes that States ought to have powers and rights in these \nareas.\n  He and I have worked very closely together over the last several \nyears to reform the 1872 mining law and to attempt to empower those \nStates in cooperation with the Federal Government to assure that that \nrelationship and those kind of dynamics continue. On that I don't \ndisagree with the Senator from Arkansas, but I do disagree with the \nFederal Government and its heavy hand ignoring the States' Governors \nuntil we shove them into beginning dialog with them on the reform of \nthese rules.\n  Most of the Western Governors, however, who have problems, who are \nworking well with respect to mining operations within their boundaries,\n\n[[Page S10350]]\n\nwant the BLM to do a couple of things with any modification in \nregulation; and yet most Governors say they have not been worked with \nwell, they have not been listened to, and if you do not do major \nthings, that it will not happen.\n  Again, the heavy arm of the Federal Government will come down against \nStates. Once again, we violate or at least we ignore the Constitution \nof our country, all in the name of a current political cause that does \nnot seem to exist much more today because we addressed it a long time \nago. That is the essence of the amendment to the Interior \nappropriations bill by the Senator from Arkansas.\n  What did we do this year? Because of the difference between the \nDepartment of Interior and the Governors--the Western States Governors \nprimarily--we have said, ``Let's get the National Academy of Sciences, \nan impartial group, to step in between and examine this solution \nlooking for a problem.''\n  They are impartial. Both sides, I think, would respect their \nintegrity. And let us see how much of a problem there is out there. Let \nus scope the magnitude of it before we bring down the heavy hand of \nGovernment and put thousands of people out of work or risk putting \nthousands of people out of work and destroying some significant \neconomies in many of our Western States.\n  That is really the essence of what we do here today. It isn't that \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee has not been diligent. The \nSenator from Arkansas has been diligent. We just cannot agree. We have \nfundamental disagreements. I want mining. I want it alive and well and \ncreating jobs in my State--minerals and metals for the economy. And I \nam not so sure that that is what he wants. Or at least he wants it in a \nway that largely causes the investors in my State to go offshore to \nmake those investments--under the same environmental standards that \nthey would make in this country except they avoid the burdensome \nmultiyear regulatory process of a Government that really does not care \nabout the economies of investment and jobs because the cause they lift \nthemselves to is a cause higher.\n  That is the issue of this amendment. When you have a dispute between \ntwo concerned parties--and we do here; the Senator from Arkansas and I \nand others just fundamentally disagree--what is wrong with bringing an \nimpartial body in between us to examine the problem that by my \nestimation does not exist and by the estimation of the Senator from \nArkansas does exist?\n  What is wrong with bringing an impartial body to the fore for that \npurpose? That is exactly what the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee \nthought ought to be done, in consultation with the chairman of the full \nauthorizing committee, the Senator from Alaska. That is what we are \ndoing. And that is why the Senator from Arkansas is trying to stop it, \nbecause it might bring about a solution that works. And it would deny \nthis administration the right to slash and burn and destroy a mining \nindustry that they did not like out there on the public lands to begin \nwith.\n  Secretary Babbitt has not been bashful. Every time he has to comply \nwith the law, he gets on a soap box and degrades it and says that he is \nbeing forced to do certain things. Well, it is terrible when you are \nforced to abide by the law. Why should you shun it? But then again, I, \nas chairman of a subcommittee, the Senator of a full committee, and the \nSenator from Arkansas have invited Secretary Babbitt to the table for \nthe last 6 years to work out these problems. And their answer is, ``No. \nIt's to our advantage to have the politics of it, not the solution to \nit.''\n  That is the essence of the debate here on the floor. It really is, in \nmy opinion, that clear and that simple. You cannot talk about modern \nmining today and use 20-year-old examples, because most of those were \ncreated 20 years before they became a problem. Yet, that is the basis \nof the argument. That is the strength of any argument that they attempt \nto produce.\n  So I hope that my colleagues will stand with us today in opposing the \nBumpers amendment--that we should table that amendment--because while \nit can be partisan at times, this is not a partisan issue. The Senators \nfrom Nevada are Democrats, and I am a Republican, and we are from \nneighboring States.\n  Mining has been for 100 years a major part of our economy and yet \ntoday remains an important part of our economy. My State is touted as \nbeing one of the most beautiful, mountainous, high-desert States in the \nNation, with clear flowing streams, pristine mountain meadows. And 100 \nyears of a mining legacy? Yes. It seems like Idahoans did it right. \nThen while they were doing it right, they learned to do it better. And \nthere is no question that the environmental laws we passed here in the \n1960s and the 1970s and the 1980s helped them do it better.\n  But just a few years ago our reclamation laws, our mining laws as a \nState, were the example for the rest of the Western States to follow, \nand many of them did. Many of my miners have received national \nenvironmental awards for their productions, for their operations, for \ntheir facilities, and they are very, very proud of it.\n  So what is the advantage of standing here on the floor today and \npounding the podium and talking about the evil mining industry and the \nenvironmental problems it creates? Well, if you are an echo of the \npast, maybe there is value there. Or if you are the politics of \nyesterday, maybe there is value there. But if you really want to work \nwith our Western Governors, and solve a problem, and bring two divided \nsides together, then you do exactly what this bill does--you employ a \nneutral party, the National Academy of Sciences, to analyze at least \nthe proposed problem that Messrs. Leshy and Babbitt suggest exists, and \nexamine the solution that they have out there, searching for and coming \nup with a resolution.\n  I am quite confident that if the National Academy of Sciences \nproposes, that we will take a very, very serious look at disposing with \nthat. That is the issue here. Let us proceed in that manner. Let us not \ndivide the Federal Government and State governments any more. Let us \nbuild a working partnership, as we have had in the past, that will \nproject us, I think, into a productive future so that mining can remain \na strong part of our economy, as it should, and, in my opinion, as it \nmust if we are going to continue to have a free flow, an important \nflow, of minerals and metals to the critical economies of this country.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Might I ask how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 13 minutes 20 \nseconds remaining; the Senator from Arkansas controls 19 minutes 27 \nseconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask the Senator from Arkansas if he would care to go \nnext since we spoke last on the issue.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first of all, I want to make one point \nthat perhaps has not been made, and that is that this amendment only \napplies on Federal lands. Bear in mind, all mining does not occur on \nFederal lands. There are all kinds of mines in this country on private \nlands. There are some on State lands.\n  I might also say that we have given away 3.2 million acres of land in \nthe past 126 years. Well, we did not give it away; we charged $2.50 an \nacre for it. Lands the size of the State of Connecticut we have given \nto the mining industry in the past 126 years to mine on. Do you know \nwhat else? They own it. We gave them a deed for $2.50 an acre, and they \nown it. And these regulations do not apply to people who own their own \nland. The States regulate that.\n\n  One other point I want to make is that I believe the Senator from \nIdaho indicated something about my political position, my political \nbase. No. 1, there is no political base on mining in my State. There is \na political base for being on the side of keeping the environment as \nclean as possible, but that is not unique to my State. I assume that \nthere are some people even in Idaho and Alaska who want to keep the \nenvironment as clean as possible.\n  Let me say, as the Senators tick off all the laws that the mining \nindustry has to comply with--clean air, clean water, reclamation--tell \nus which one of those you want to repeal.\n\n[[Page S10351]]\n\n  In the 1970's when a number of environmental laws were passed, go \nback and look at the speeches that were given, and given again today, \nabout what a terrible disaster this would be if we passed this bill and \nmade people comply with these nonsensical, crazy regulations. It is \njust another case where the old Federal Government is trying to tell us \nhow to run our lives.\n  Do you know the reason the Coeur d'Alene River is now a clean, \npristine river? Because of the Clean Water Act. I applaud the people of \nIdaho who I assume didn't want that river to be polluted any further. I \ncan tell you, it may or may not have happened if it hadn't been for the \nFederal Government's intervention. I don't know where that beautiful \nriver in my State, the Buffalo, would be right now if we hadn't made it \na wild and scenic river and stopped the disastrous pollution of the \nriver.\n  In the 1970's 65 percent of the streams, rivers and lakes in this \ncountry were neither fishable nor swimmable. And because of the \nterrible old Federal Government and all their regulations imposing on \nthe business community of this country, today it is reversed--65 \npercent of the streams, lakes, and rivers of this country are fishable \nand swimmable. How I wish I could live long enough to see that figure \nat 100 percent.\n  It is expensive. It is expensive to undo a mess. As I said on the \nSenate floor last week in a different context but it bears repeating \nhere, as the English philosopher said, there is nothing more utterly \nimpossible than undoing what has already been done. Do you think Bill \nClinton wouldn't like to undo some of his past? Do you think people in \nmy State wouldn't like to undo some of the surface mining, the strip \nmining, that we allowed to take place? They just dug out the earth, \npiled it up in big layers, took the coal, and left it.\n  It is not even half over. When you consider the fact that mines of 5 \nacres and less aren't even regulated, when you think of all the 3.2 \nmillion acres of lands we have given to the mining industry, these \nlands are not included.\n  So what do we have? The Senator from Idaho said Senator Bumpers is up \nthere talking about what happened years ago. In 1992, in Colorado, \nSummitville's actions cost the taxpayers $30,000 a day; 6 years ago \nthat disaster occurred. What did they do? They polluted 17 miles of a \nriver. It is now a Superfund site.\n  Zortman-Landusky, 1998, in Montana--going broke. Taxpayers will get \nto pick up the tab while we do another study by the National Academy of \nSciences. Then you can go home and say, ``Yes, I'm for the \nenvironment.'' I think the National Academy of Sciences ought to study \nthese things as the disasters pile up. In 1998, in South Dakota, they \nare not quite broke yet, they are in financial difficulties. They had a \n$6 million bond, and the cleanup figure is now estimated at $10 \nmillion. Who picks up the difference? You know who picks up the \ndifference.\n  There are 557,000 hardrock mine sites that are abandoned. Today, 59 \nof them are on the Superfund list. The cost to the poor taxpayers: $34 \nto $71 billion, because the U.S. Congress engaged in sophistry, \nspecious arguments, as the pollution went on, as the unreclaimed mines \nwere left for the taxpayers to pick up the tab.\n  Think about 2,000 sites in our national parks that have to be \nreclaimed. Twelve thousand miles of rivers are polluted, and they say \nwe need another 27 months to study it.\n  I don't know much of anything else I can say about this. I will have \na lot more to say tomorrow when I offer yet another amendment on \nmining. Then the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Idaho can \nhave a big party and say, ``That mean old Senator from Arkansas, we \nhave heard the last of him,'' because you will have. I have been on \nthis subject now for 10 years, with just a few marginal successes. As I \npick up the paper in a few years and watch how things have gone, I will \nbe a detached taxpayer, still with strong feelings about it. All I can \nsay is, I did my best to try to save this planet for my children, my \ngrandchildren, and yours.\n  Let me repeat one more time, when you consider FLPMA, which we passed \nin 1978, when you consider the National Forest Management Act, when you \nconsider the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act, tell us, which ones \nwould you strike? Which ones would you repeal?\n  It reminds me, as a southerner, what a tough time we had coming to \ngrips with civil rights. Monday morning I will speak at an assembly at \nCentral High School in Little Rock where, 31 years ago, the National \nGuard was called to keep black children from going to school there. The \nArkansas Gazette, at that time the oldest newspaper west of the \nMississippi, took a strong stand against Orval Faubus, who was Governor \nand who called out the National Guard to keep those nine children from \ngoing to school at Little Rock Central High School.\n  They lost circulation down to about 82,000. Orval Faubus was elected \nsix times--the first Governor ever elected to a fourth term. Only one \nhad ever been elected to a third term. And who today would take that \nside of that question? There are a few, of course. Who today would want \nto go back to charging people to vote?--which they did when I was a \nyoung man. You had to go down to the courthouse and pay a dollar for a \npoll tax. Who would go back to that?\n  If I were to start talking about the literally hundreds of things \nthat we have done in this country that were terribly unpopular--I can \nremember when every doctor in America said, ``If you pass that Medicare \nbill, you will be sorry; it will be the end of health care in this \ncountry.'' Can you find me somebody today who doesn't like Medicare, \nincluding the medical profession? No. In the 1970's--go back and look \nat the speeches made when we passed a variety of environmental \nstatutes. I never read as many doomsday speeches in my life. Who would \ngo back to the time when we didn't have NEPA? Who would want to go back \nto the time where we emptied our garbage out in the Buffalo River in \nplastic bags?\n  Sometimes it is a long time coming, and the disastrous part of it is \nthat so much of it is irreversible; you cannot put it back the way God \ngave it to us. That might be getting too heavy on an issue like this. \nBut I am telling you, when you look at the statistics of how many \nabandoned mine sites there are right now, when you look at the fact \nthat we know what this is--this is nothing more than a dilatory tactic. \nThere is not one Senator who doesn't know precisely what this is about. \nIt is a simple delaying tactic.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time--\nMr. President, I will not yield back the remainder of my time. I think \nSenator Landrieu may wish to speak, so I will reserve the remainder of \nmy time for her.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to indicate how much \ntime remains on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 13 minutes. The \nSenator from Arkansas has 5 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise this morning to express strong \nopposition to the Bumpers amendment, and I urge my colleagues to oppose \nit as well. This amendment is a step backwards, Mr. President. It is a \nstep back toward more centralized government; it is a step back toward \nmore heavy handed regulations; and it is a step back toward making \nenvironmental policy with emotion and politics instead of science and \ncommon sense.\n  Mr. President, this argument really comes down to whether or not we \nwant environmental regulations to be determined on the state level by \nthose who have the greatest stake in a healthy environment and a strong \neconomy, or do we want to keep all the power inside the Washington \nbeltway and in the hands of federal politicians and bureaucrats.\n  This amendment would strike section 117 of the fiscal year 1999 \nInterior appropriations. What is so disturbing about this section that \nit must be struck, Mr. President? Section 117 is simply an attempt to \nreplace the emotionally and politically charged controversy surrounding \nthe revised 3809 regulations with good science. Section 117 would \nrequire that the National Academy of Sciences--hardly an organization \nin the pocket of the mining industry--perform a study of the adequacy \nof federal and state regulations\n\n[[Page S10352]]\n\ngoverning hardrock mining on our public lands before the Secretary of \nInterior moves forward with the new regulations. I find it baffling, \nMr. President, that a member of Congress would be opposed to \nintroducing an impartial and nonpartisan element to this heated debate, \nsuch as a study by the National Academy of Sciences.\n  Mr. President, this is not merely a philosophical debate. This debate \nis about jobs in rural America. We have learned by unhappy experience \nthat regulations spewed forth from Washington, D.C., with no regard for \nthose who are most affected by the regulations, often lead to a loss of \ncompetitiveness and jobs in rural areas.\n  I wish all of my colleagues could visit the many rural areas of my \nstate of Utah. They would find that opportunity has been whittled away \nfrom rural Americans who live among public lands. And why have these \ncitizens lost their ability to grow and prosper, Mr. President? Has it \nbeen because of a lack of effort or creativity? Of course not--rural \nareas in Utah are struggling because government bureaucrats have \nsystematically closed off opportunities to graze on public lands, to \nharvest timber on public lands, and to mine on public lands. I \nchallenge anyone to tell me that this trend has not led to a major loss \nof rural jobs, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the rural people of my state know that the source of \ntheir problems has been an onslaught of centralized government \nregulation. I would like to read a letter from a young constituent of \nmine, T.J. Seely. He sums up, better than I could, what the crux of \nthis debate is really about.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be entered \ninto the Record along with my remarks.\n  Mr. President, T.J. asks me in his letter, ``What are you doing about \njobs in rural Utah?'' Well, Mr. President, an important part of my \nanswer to T.J. will be that I voted against this amendment today, and \nthat I urged my colleagues to do the same.\n  There being no objections, the letter was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 19, 1998.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: My name is T.J. Seely. I'm from Ferron, \n     Utah. I am thirteen years old and I'm concerned that there \n     won't be any jobs when I'm out of high school.\n       My dad is forty years old. He works for one of Pacific \n     Corps. mines and I'm worried that he won't have a job.\n       In Utah I think that we have more of our share of Federal \n     lands.\n       What are you doing about jobs in rural Utah, and what can I \n     do about securing jobs in Utah?\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       T.J. Seely.\n\n                     Proposed BLM 3809 Regulations\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened with interest to the \ndiscussion that has taken place today regarding the Bumpers amendment \nand I would like to express my views on the BLM's proposed 3809 \nRegulations. I am concerned that my colleagues are facing another \nsituation, like others in the past, in which policymakers in this \nAdministration lacking support from Congress, nevertheless develop \npolicy based on a predetermined outcome. Once that policy is \nintroduced, we are then subjected to the usual vocalizing about the \nimportance of public input and the necessity of hearing views of all \ninterested parties.\n  BLM's justification for new regulations is spotty--advances in mining \ntechnologies and current regulations which have not been updated for 15 \nyears. Yet when we had this discussion last year, we agreed that since \nthe regulatory authority of western states would be called into \nquestion, it was important that we allow for significant input from \nthose impacted states. I am dismayed that the BLM draft regulations \nignored most of the input received last year. The result has been a \nproposal that was so top-heavy with prescriptive regulation it would \nnever pass muster if it were to move through the normal legislative \nprocess.\n  We find ourselves in a situation where the Western Governors, which \nhave individual state programs that are working very well with respect \nto mining in those states, wish to have greater input into the draft \nregulations. These Governors, regardless of party affiliation, have \nstated very clearly that the problems with the current law described by \nthe Secretary simply do not exist. They would prefer to have several \nlegal issues resolved prior to any modification of the current 3809 \nregulations. I do not see anything wrong with seeking guidance from an \noutside source as to how the current regulatory framework is deficient. \nI believe the language we have in this bill addresses those concerns by \nbringing in a non-biased entity to determine if the current regulatory \nframework is inadequate.\n  I sometimes wish we could be more candid with each other. I am amazed \nat what happens when we can sit down around the table and have an open \ndiscussion. We have been successful in the past, as my friend Senator \nBumpers well knows. Were it not for two or three candid discussions, we \nwould have never reached agreement on National Park concessions reform. \nBut this is a case where BLM is not willing to admit what it is really \ntrying to do. The Secretary should admit that he is trying to \naccomplish mining law reform through the back door because the \nAdministration lacks the votes in Congress. If he would simply say \nthat, I would say that I disagree with his position. But because of the \nlack of candor around here, we go through various machinations and we \nfind ourselves in this situation where we now have to bring in the \nNational Academy of Sciences to provide a non-biased review so we can \nget the information to Congress. I think this issue has moved to the \npoint where we are in need of unbiased, outside counsel. If there is a \nproblem, let's fix it, if not, let's leave well enough alone. But the \nfirst step is to identify if a problem really does exist.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, following the current debate, let me \npoint out a couple of things that I think the Senator from Arkansas may \nhave overlooked with regard to his general statement that we have \n557,000 sites in the abandoned mine category.\n  I think it is important to recognize what we have done. We have a \nsystem. The system is working. Fewer than 3 percent of those 557,000 \nare considered to be of a significant environmental concern. Surface \nwater contamination, ground water contamination, and Superfund make up \nless than 3 percent of these sites. The others--it is interesting to \nnote--34 percent, or 194,000, have been reclaimed and are considered \nbenign; 231,000, or 41 percent, have a surface disturbance. Obviously, \nif you are going to mine an area in an open pit, you are going to have \na surface disturbance. But that can be taken care of in the reclamation \nprocess. The trees can grow back.\n  I ask anybody who has visited the interior of Alaska to recognize the \ntechniques used with the gold dredges where they basically built this \ndredge in a pond and it dug ahead of itself and deposited the tailings, \nthe pond was not any bigger than the dredge, it simply moved, and yes, \nthe tailings were evident at the time, but now the trees have grown \nback into the tailings piles. That is what is happening in these areas \nwhere appropriate reclamation takes place, and the technology today is \nmuch more advanced than previously. So there is significant advancement \nin the process.\n  The system of reclamation is working, and the States take pride in \ntheir obligation to address reclamation associated with mining \nactivity. You can't create wealth, you can't create jobs, and you can't \ncreate prosperity without some kind of a footprint. Mining is no \nexception. But with the technology we have, we are addressing it and \ndoing a better job.\n  The problem with the proposal of my friend from Arkansas is that he \nsimply wants to have the Department of the Interior come in and dictate \nterms and conditions--a nameless, faceless bureaucracy, accountable not \nto the people within the States, not to the people who work in the \nmining industry, not to the people who have jobs, families, mortgages, \nbut to an indifferent Department of the Interior coming down with \nregulations that would basically strangle the mining industry as we \nknow it today and force it overseas.\n  We have had a discussion about the poultry industry. I am sorry that \nmy friend from Arkansas stepped out briefly, but I have done a little \ninvestigation in the last few minutes relative to the poultry industry \nin Arkansas, which I know very little about. Clearly, the Senator from \nArkansas is on record opposing any State regulation of mining that is \nevident today. But he doesn't oppose State regulation of his\n\n[[Page S10353]]\n\nState's biggest industry, and that is poultry. Small poultry farmers \nare not subject to Federal law, clean water regulation, even when large \ncorporations actually own the chickens. It is left up to State law, \neven though it is a major water quality issue in those States with high \npopulations of poultry. In Virginia alone, over 1,300 poultry \noperations produce 4.4 billion pounds of manure a year. A so-called \nsmall poultry operation can produce 540 tons of litter per year. I \nhaven't heard the Senator from Arkansas arguing in favor of Federal \nregulation, but perhaps we are getting ahead of ourselves and we don't \nneed to spread the issue around any more than we have, relatively \nspeaking.\n  Let me just highlight a few more points that I think are appropriate. \nLet's look at the gold industry in the United States today. The layoffs \ntotal approximately 3,500 workers--not because the gold isn't there, \nbut the world price of gold has declined. As a consequence, these \nmines, such as the HomeStake Mine in Lead, SD, a small community of \nfewer than 1,000 people, where there are over 466 people that are out \nof work--that issue is not as a consequence of the issue before us \ntoday, but it is a consequence of the mining industry's ability to \noperate internationally based on cost, based on the value of the gold \nin the ground, and a number of other considerations.\n  The point is, when you go into the mining industry, you go in for the \nlong haul. You are going to have good years and bad years. But I think \nit is appropriate that we take a look at the industry as it exists in \nthe Western States. There are 5,000 people employed in my State of \nAlaska. In California, there are 115,000 people with jobs directly or \nindirectly affected by the mining industry; Colorado has 19,000; Idaho \nhas 7,000; Montana, 9,000; Nevada has 11,000; South Dakota, 8,000; the \nState of Washington has 26,000.\n  So I remind the Senators from those States that are directly \naffected, with a significant payroll, a number of jobs are dependent \ndirectly or indirectly on the mining industry, and it is very important \nthat we have a mining industry that has regulations that are responsive \nto the legitimate environmental demands, but at the same time recognize \nthat this industry fluctuates with market price, world prices, unlike \nmany other items that we might not have a fair comparison with.\n  Finally, let me in the remaining moments again refer to the effort \nthat has been made that is pending before the U.S. Senate. It is ready \nfor markup. That is the mining bill that Senator Craig and I have \noffered. It was a solid foundation upon which to build mining reform. \nWe made an accommodation to the Senator from Arkansas not to mark it up \nin order for him to initiate an effort to reach a compromise with the \nmining industry to resolve long standing issues. Evidently, this has \nnot yet happened, although I still have hopes.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that the mining bill before us would have \npleased, I think, reasonable voices on both sides of the issue. It \nseeks reform, which brings a fair return to the Treasury. It protects \nthe environment and preserves our ability to produce strategic minerals \nin an international marketplace. I think the bill, when it eventually \nreaches the floor of this body, will receive support and pass. The \nlegislation protects the small miners, it maintains traditional \nlocation and discovery practices, and it is reform. It is an effort to \ndo the job right. Bad decisions are going to harm a $5 billion U.S. \nindustry whose products are the muscle and sinew of our Nation's \nindustrial output.\n  The future of some 120,000 American miners and their families and \ntheir communities is at stake here. So is the well-being of thousands \nof other Americans whose income is linked to manufacturing goods and \nservices which support this critical industry.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I am going to be offering a motion to \ntable Senator Bumpers amendment to strike at 2:15 when the Senate \nreconvenes\n  I want my colleagues to know ahead of time what my intentions are \nrelative to the disposition of the Bumpers amendment.\n  Finally, let me, for the record, indicate the position of the Western \nGovernors' Association, which wrote in a letter:\n\n       States already have effective environmental and reclamation \n     programs in place and operating. These programs ensure that \n     national criteria where they exist in current law are met and \n     allow the States site-specific flexibility for the remaining \n     issue.\n\n  We have letters from the Governors of Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, \nWyoming and Utah--written letters in support of having the National \nAcademy of Sciences conduct a review of the existing State and Federal \nregulations governing mining to determine their deficiencies.\n  One other point, Mr. President. I think it is noteworthy, to my \ncolleagues who have perhaps been following some of our Nation's \nenvironmental leaders, the comment that was made in December 1997 by \nformer Secretary of the Interior, Governor Cecil Andrus. When the 3809 \nregulations were promulgated back in 1980, Governor Andrus was \nSecretary of the Interior. So this gentleman knows of what he speaks.\n  In December, Governor Andrus stated:\n\n       For over 20 years, I submit, the 3809 regulations have \n     stood the test of time. These are the regulations that we are \n     talking about today, the ones the Secretary of the Interior \n     proposes to change.\n\n  Further, I quote:\n\n       Those regulations revolutionized mining on the public \n     lands. Bruce Babbitt, who should know better, is trying to \n     fix things that are not broken and accomplish some mining \n     reform laws through the back door.\n\n  Mr. President, that is just what this issue is about. I don't know \nwhat is good for the goose or the chicken, but I do know what is good \nfor the mining industry in the United States today; that is, to defeat \nand prevail on the motion to table the Bumpers amendment to strike.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the remainder of my time be indicated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I retain the remainder of my time and yield to my \nfriend from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, here is what the new regulations contain:\n  Regulations to minimize adverse environmental impacts, if \neconomically and technically feasible--that is a pretty big loophole; \nthat is what these new regulations provide--reclaim the land to its \nprior condition; bonding, enough bond to cover reclamation costs; and, \nprotect the air and water quality.\n  Let me ask my opponents on this issue, to which of those do you \nobject? To what do you object?\n  Mr. President, these arguments about the poor gold miners processing \ngold--I have heard those same arguments year after year, and sometimes \nwhen gold was more than $400 an ounce. If gold is cheap, that is the \nargument. If gold is high, then it is jobs. If neither apply, then it \nis that bad old Federal Government trying to regulate our lives--\nanything under God's Sun to keep from doing anything to make the mining \ncompanies of this country do it right.\n  This is the simplest amendment in the world. Everybody knows what it \nis. For 17 years, since 1981, we have been living with regulations for \nthe most part which were hopelessly out of date. In the meantime, we \nhave been allowing cyanide to go into the rivers and streams and the \nunderground aquifers of this country, and they don't want to do \nanything about it. They don't want a regulation or a rule that makes \npeople responsible for that.\n  I think I have said everything I can possibly say about this issue. I \nwill simply say I may lose this afternoon, and probably will. And when \n27 months have gone by, unless somebody takes it on again next year, \nmaybe we will get James Watt back as Secretary of the Interior and we \nwill not have to worry about things like this anymore. This is very \ncarefully crafted to say to Bruce Babbitt that you cannot do anything--\nyou can't do anything until the year 2001. At that time, my opponents \non this divinely hope that there will be a Republican President and \nthere will be a Secretary of the Interior who will do their bidding. \nThat may happen. And in the meantime, unmitigated, unfathomable \neconomic disasters will continue to occur.\n  If this is an issue for the Senate to do something about, all you \nhave to do is vote yes. If you do not want to do anything about it, \nthen vote no.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I yield the remainder of my \ntime.\n\n[[Page S10354]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me thank my friend from Arkansas \nfor his input and his consistent effort to bring this issue before this \nCongress, and certainly the U.S. Senate.\n  I must differ with him on his interpretation. It is not unmitigated \ndisaster. I think every Member of the Western States, and those States \nthat have mining, recognize that there are certainly ills. But there is \nalso an obligation and a pride to correct them, and those corrections \nare underway. But the suggestion that the Department of the Interior \nshould have the broad authority to come in with sweeping new \nregulations that would in many cases have an adverse effect on the \nindustry's ability to be internationally competitive is the threat \nproposed by the Department of the Interior. As a consequence, I would \nagain expect to offer a motion to strike the amendment, and a tabling \nmotion.\n  I yield the remainder of my time. I thank my good friend for the \nspirited debate. We will keep him informed of the progress and the \neventual resolve of this issue, if we don't get it done today.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is there 10 \nminutes equally divided beginning at 2:15 on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS.

The Senator from Louisiana is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague from \nArkansas to add just a moment of my thoughts to the tremendous argument \nhe has made to strike this language from the Interior appropriations \nbill and to try to move us on in a path of real reform on this issue, \nreform that is so long overdue. Since 1971, attempt after attempt after \nattempt has been made, either to pass laws to reform the 1872 statute--\nattempts that have failed because there is not enough support--or we \nhave tried to take some steps through regulations. Yet delay after \ndelay after delay has taken place.\n  I want to submit for the Record, to date $71 billion in damages have \noccurred at taxpayer expense from hard rock mining--$71 billion. Mr. \nPresident, we have 557,000 abandoned hard rock mining sites in the \nUnited States alone that have to be dealt with, 300,000 acres of \nFederal land left unreclaimed, 2,000 sites in national parks in need of \nreclamation, as well as 59 Superfund mining sites on the National \nPriorities List and 12,000 miles of polluted rivers.\n  When will the taxpayers get some relief from this law that is so far \noutdated and has long since met its original intent? Besides the giving \naway of the land for pennies, the taxpayers are then held to pick up \nthe tab for the damage that is caused. There are some reasonable \nsolutions that do not devastate the industry but they do begin to clean \nup our environment.\n  I support the Honorable Senator from Arkansas and ask all of our \ncolleagues to join with him in this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is time to be \ncharged against both parties when there is nobody speaking?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just say to what few colleagues \nmay be listening, in 1976, the Secretary of the Interior was charged \nwith the responsibility of making sure that people who mine on Federal \nlands belonging to the taxpayers of America, not cause undue \ndegradation of the land.\n  In 1981, the Secretary promulgated regulations to determine how \nmining would take place. It was obvious after that that the gold mining \ncompanies were using cyanide--cyanide--to mine gold. We have had three \nunmitigated disasters since 1981. We have cyanide running in the rivers \nand streams and our underground water supplies of this country.\n  In 1991, Secretary Lujan tried to change the rules so we could take \ncare of that, as well as other things that needed to be taken care of.\n  In 1993, everybody said, ``No, let's wait; we're going to get a new \nbill.'' Nothing happened.\n  In 1997, Secretary Babbitt started to promulgate rules to try to take \ncare of underground leeching of cyanide poisoning, as well as a whole \nhost of other things. Senator Reid got an amendment put on last year \nthat said every Governor in the West would have to sign off on that. We \nfinally compromised by saying the Secretary would have to consult with \nGovernors of the West, which he did and which they certified that he \ndid.\n  This year, they come in and say, ``No, let's don't do it yet; let's \nhave the National Academy of Sciences study it.''\n  It takes 27 months, 27 more months under this amendment to get these \nrules promulgated, carefully orchestrated to go past the year 2000 and, \nhopefully, to get a Secretary of the Interior to their liking so we can \ncontinue to pollute the rivers and streams of underground aquifers of \nthis country with cyanide poisoning.\n  People of this country have a right to expect something better than \nthat, and all I am doing is striking this so that the Secretary can go \nahead and issue the rules on November 17. If the Congress doesn't like \nthem, let them change them. But for God's sake, let's keep faith with \nthe American people and say we are going to do something about \nSummitville, CO, 1992. The bond was insufficient. They took bankruptcy. \nZortman-Landusky, MT, 1998; Gilt Edge, SD, 1998.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I plead with my colleagues and simply say let the \nSecretary do the job we hired him to do and promulgate the rules we \ntold him in 1976 he ought to promulgate.\n\n[[Page S10355]]\n\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I use the time delegated to the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. President, my friend from Arkansas and my friend from Louisiana \nare in some kind of a dream world. The fact of the matter is that the \nstatistics they talk about, for example, 300,000 acres damaged--the \nState of Nevada alone has 75 million acres. The Western United States \nis a vast area that still has areas in need of development. The mining \nindustry has the best blue-collar jobs in America. The price of gold is \nat a 19-year low. Companies are filing bankruptcy. People are being \nlaid off.\n  The mining industry creates a favorable balance of trade for gold. \nThe problems that they talk about are all problems that went on decades \nand decades ago. What we are talking about here is there are some \nregulations that the Secretary of the Interior who can't legislate--\nthey have tried, they can't legislate anything--so he said, ``We're \ngoing to get to you anyway, Mr. and Mrs. Mining Company; we're going to \ndo this through regulations. We're going to show you if we can't \nlegislate, we will regulate.''\n  What we are saying is, Mr. Secretary of the Interior, if you want to \nregulate, let's have the National Academy of Sciences, an impartial, \nunbiased, very recognized, sound scientific body look at these \nregulations to see if they need to be changed. We are willing to abide \nby what they come up with. This is not some antienvironmental rider \nthat is going to turn present regulations upside down. This is simply \nsaying let's take the regulations and have the scientists look at them, \nnot Secretary Babbitt who has been so unfair to mining.\n  Mr. President, they are looking for a solution to a problem that \ndoesn't exist. The Western Governors' Association said:\n\n       States already have effective environmental and reclamation \n     programs in place and operating. These programs ensure that \n     national criteria, where they exist in current law, are met \n     and allow state and site-specific flexibility for the \n     remaining issues.\n\n  That is all we want, is fairness. The Interior bill is a good bill. \nThis provision which calls for a study by the National Academy of \nSciences is the right way to go. This amendment should be defeated \noverwhelmingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time under the control of the opposition \nto the Bumpers amendment remains at 2 minutes even.\n  Mr. REID. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. REID. On this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I stand in strong opposition to Senator \nBumpers' amendment to strike the National Academy of Sciences study.\n  Before they cast their vote, I want my colleagues to consider these \npoints:\n  We put the National Academy of Sciences study language into the \nappropriations bill because the Interior Department has decided that \nthey can no longer wait for Congress to act on mining law. Apparently \nthese unelected officials know what's better for this country than the \nUnited States Congress.\n  We are doing it because the Department of the Interior has decided \nthat they are not interested in the opinions or concerns of the public \nland Governors and the constituents they represent.\n  Let me quote the Western Governors Association letter from February \nof this year:\n\n       States already have effective environmental and reclamation \n     programs in place and operating. These programs ensure that \n     national criteria, where they exist in current law, are met \n     and allow state and site-specific flexibility for the \n     remaining issues.\n\n  We put the Academy study into the appropriations bill at the specific \nrequest of the Governors of Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, \nWyoming, and Utah.\n  They all echo Nevada Governor Miller's concerns when he said:\n\n       Interior is moving the responsibility for environmental \n     oversight of mining operations in my State and other States \n     to here in Washington, DC. This attempt at seizure and \n     control by Interior is particularly perplexing in view of the \n     fact that many States, expecially Nevada [and my state--\n     Alaska] have moved aggressively to address the environmental \n     concerns of mining operations. To date, there has been no \n     real justification offered by the department regarding the \n     need to make changes. * * *\n\n  He goes on to say that in his opinion the Department of the Interior \nhas a solution looking for a problem.\n  A solution looking for a problem.\n  It is simply unacceptable for an agency to launch off on a major \nrulemaking effort that affects the effectiveness and efficiency of the \nentire environmental foundation of mining in the United States.\n  Let me close by quoting one of the modern environmental leaders, \nformer Secretary of the Interior Andrus:\n\n       In 20 years, I admit, the 3809 regulations have stood the \n     test of time * * * those regulations revolutionized mining on \n     the public lands. Bruce Babbitt--who should know better--is \n     trying to fix things that are not broken, and I suspect \n     accomplish some mining law reform through the back door.\n\n  Secretary Babbitt is trying to fix things that are not broken.\n  I couldn't have said it better if I tried.\n  The amendment that Senator Bumpers proposes to strike is as simple--\nit does ``nothing'' more than direct the National Academy of Sciences \nto review existing State and Federal environmental regulations dealing \nwith hardrock mining to determine the adequacy of these laws and \nregulations to prevent unnecessary and undue degradation and how to \nbetter coordinate Federal and State regulatory programs to ensure \nenvironmental protection.\n  The Department of the Interior has so completely lost its objectivity \nand has become so biased against this industry that they appear \ncompletely incapable of making sound decisions in this arena.\n  The citizens of this country are entitled to a Department of the \nInterior that determines need before it acts, that doesn't waste money \nthat is sorely needed in other places; a Department that doesn't \n``unnecessarily'' disrupt a system of State and Federal regulations \nlaboriously constructed over decades to complement and enhance \nenvironmental protection at the lowest cost possible.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in a vote to table Senator \nBumpers' amendment, and in doing so, we will be sending a clear message \nto the administration that ``good'' Government is still important, that \nStates play a critical role in environmental protection and that their \npartnerships and input are still important.\n  Mr. President, as you know, we have before us a vote, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the yeas and nays be requested--Mr. President, I \nam told that I should make that request after time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from Alaska that \nthe time has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is my intent to table the proposed Bumpers \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is set aside. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], for himself, Mr. \n     Sessions, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Grams, \n     Mr. Coats, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Bryan and Mr. Reid, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3592.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . PROHIBITION.\n\n       (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, prior to \n     October 1, 1999, Secretary of the Interior shall not--\n       (1) promulgate as final regulations, or in any way \n     implement, the proposed regulations published on January 22, \n     1998, at 63 Fed. Reg. 3289; or\n       (2) issue a notice of proposed rulemaking for, or \n     promulgate, or in any way implement, any similar regulations \n     to provide for procedures for gaming activities under the \n     Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.), in any \n     case in which a State asserts a defense of sovereign immunity \n     to a lawsuit brought by an Indian tribe in a Federal court \n     under section 11(d)(7) of that Act (25 U.S.C. 2710(d)(7)) to \n     compel the State to participate in compact negotiations for \n     class III gaming (as that term is defined in section 4(8) of \n     that Act (25 U.S.C. 2703(8))).\n       (b) Class III Gaming Compacts.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Prohibition on approving compacts.--Prior to October 1, \n     1999, the Secretary may not expend any funds made available \n     under this Act, or any other Act hereinafter enacted, to \n     prescribe procedures for class III gaming, or approve class \n     III gaming on Indian lands by any means other than a Tribal-\n     State compact entered into between a state and a tribe, on or \n     after the enactment of this Act.\n       (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph may be \n     construed to prohibit the review or approval by the Secretary \n     of a renewal or revision of, or amendment to a Tribal-State \n     compact that is not covered under subparagraph (A).\n       (2) No automatic approval.--Prior to October 1, 1999, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Tribal-State \n     compact for class III gaming, other than one entered into \n     between a state and a tribe, shall be considered to have been \n     approved by the Secretary by reason of the failure of the \n     Secretary to approve or disapprove that compact.\n       (c) Definitions.--The terms ``class III gaming'', \n     ``Secretary'', ``Indian lands'', and ``Tribal-State compact'' \n     shall have the same meaning for the purposes of this section \n     as those terms have under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act \n     (25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.).\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent two members of my staff, Andrew \nEmrich and Chad Calvert, be granted floor privileges during the \nduration of the debate on the Interior appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I rise to introduce this amendment to the Interior \nappropriations bill with my colleague, the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama, Mr. Sessions. This amendment has one very important purpose: \nto ensure that the rights of this Congress and all 50 States are not \ntrampled on by an unelected Cabinet official.\n\n  The amendment is simple and straightforward. It would prohibit the \nSecretary of the Interior from approving any tribal-State gambling \nagreement which has not first been approved by the tribe and the State \nin question. It would also prohibit the Secretary from finalizing the \nrules that were published this past January 22. If these rules are \nfinalized, the Secretary of the Interior would have the ability to \nbypass all 50 State governments in approving casino gambling on Indian \ntribal lands.\n  Mr. President, this is the third time in 2 years the Senate has had \nto deal with this issue of Indian gambling. I regret that an amendment \nis, once again, necessary on this year's Interior appropriations bill. \nHowever, until we understand the need for legislative action and effect \nhearings by the Indian Affairs Committee to resolve differences and \nreach a reasonable compromise in the Indian gambling process, this \namendment is essential.\n  Last year, I offered an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill \nthat prohibited Secretary Babbitt from approving any new tribal-State \ngambling compacts which had not first been approved by the State in \naccordance with State law. Although that amendment provided for only a \n1-year moratorium, the intent of that amendment was clear. Congress \ndoes not believe it is appropriate for the Secretary of the Interior to \nbypass Congress and the States on an issue as important as to whether \nor not casino gambling would be allowed within State borders.\n  Unfortunately, the Secretary did not think Congress was serious when \nwe passed the amendment last year. On January 22 of this year, the \nDepartment of the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, published \nproposed regulations which would allow the Secretary of the Interior to \nbypass the States in the compacting process. In effect, these proposed \nregulations would allow Secretary Babbitt to approve casino gambling \nagreements with the Indian tribes without the consent or approval of \nthe States. This action by the Secretary is a very big stick that \nencourages the tribes enough that they are not interested in any \ncompromise. That is precisely why Congress was willing to place the \namendment in last year's appropriations bill. Evidently, Secretary \nBabbitt did not think Congress was serious.\n  We also debated the issue of blocking the Secretary's proposed rules \nin February, and we had an amendment accepted to the supplemental \nappropriations bill by a voice vote. When speaking with House conferees \nwho attended the conference to the supplemental, several lobbyists \npainted our amendment as a Las Vegas protection bill. There are some \nlobbying groups that are trying that same tactic again this year. I \nwant everyone to be perfectly clear on this point. This amendment is \ndesigned primarily for those States that do not allow gambling--\nparticularly those that do not allow electronic gambling and especially \nthose States that do not allow slot machines. The interest in this \namendment from gambling States stems simply from their sincere desire \nto have the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, or IGRA, enforced. This \namendment does not in any way minimize the serious need for proper \nenforcement of existing law.\n\n[[Page S10357]]\n\n  In February, in an attempt to kill our amendment, which was only a \ncontinuation of the status quo, the Indian Affairs Committee sent out a \nnotice that the amendment should be defeated because hearings had been \nscheduled. What happened to those hearings? By passing this amendment, \nwe will ensure that the promises about the future won't change the \ncurrent law. We will make sure that the unelected Secretary of the \nInterior, Bruce Babbitt, won't single-handedly change current law. This \namendment will ensure that any change in IGRA is done in the right \nway--legislatively.\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment will ensure that the proper procedures \nare followed in the tribal-State compacting process. Some people have \nargued that changes need to be made in the Indian Gaming Regulatory \nAct. I don't necessarily disagree with my colleagues on that point. In \nfact, I would welcome an opportunity to review a number of provisions \nin IGRA in the proper context. However, if any changes are to be made \nto IGRA, those changes must come from Congress, not from the \nadministration. By even proposing these regulations, the Secretary of \nthe Interior has shown an amazing disregard for the constitutional role \nof Congress and the statutory prerogatives of all 50 States.\n  Actually, Mr. President, the timing of Secretary Babbitt's actions is \nrather ironic. In March, just 6 months ago, Attorney General Janet Reno \nrequested an independent counsel to investigate Secretary Babbitt's \ninvolvement in denying a tribal-State gambling license to an Indian \ntribe in Wisconsin. Although we will have to wait for independent \ncounsel Carol Elder Bruce to complete her investigation before any \nfinal conclusions can be drawn, it is evident that serious questions \nhave been raised about Secretary Babbitt's judgment and objectivity in \napproving Indian gambling compacts.\n  The very fact that Attorney General Janet Reno believed there was \nspecific and credible evidence to warrant an investigation should be \nsufficient to make this Congress hesitant to allow Secretary Babbitt to \ngrant himself new trust powers that are designed to bypass the States \nin the area of tribal-State gambling compacts. Moreover, this \ninvestigation should have taught us an important lesson: We in Congress \nshould not allow Secretary Babbitt, or any other Secretary of the \nInterior, to usurp the rightful role of Congress and the States in \naddressing the difficult question of casino gambling on Indian tribal \nlands.\n  As this controversial issue has developed, we have been promised \nhearings in the Indian Affairs Committee. A year ago, I was given the \noffer to even invite some of the witnesses. From my perspective, if the \npromise of those proposed hearings had caused us to back off this \namendment, the effect would have been that Secretary Babbitt would have \nhad his way today. This sentiment has been confirmed by lobbyists from \nthe various tribes which have made it abundantly clear that Secretary \nBabbitt fully intends to finalize his proposed rules. Our only way to \nstop this effort is to attach another amendment to this year's Interior \nappropriations bill. Let me assure you, if Secretary Babbitt has his \nway, there will be no need for the tribes to resolve problems at all \ninvolving gambling and IGRA in and with their States.\n  I do believe that this issue could be resolved with hearings and a \nbill--actual legislation from us, from Congress. But those hearings \nwon't happen as long as the tribes anticipate the clout of the \nSecretary's rule that bypasses the process, bypasses the States. Yes, \nthe courts have ruled that the current law--which was passed by \nCongress, not an appointed Secretary--gives an edge in the bargaining \nprocess to the States. But that process has worked. If there is a need \nto change that process, it should be changed only by a bill passed by \nCongress--not by rule and regulation.\n  I must stress that if we do not maintain the status quo, there will \nnever be an essential involvement by the States in the final decision \nof whether to allow casino gambling on Indian tribal lands. There will \nbe no compromise reached. The Secretary will be given the right to \nbypass us, the Congress of the United States, and to run roughshod over \nthe States.\n  Again, I want to stress that this amendment does not amend the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act, but holds the status quo for another year so \nCongress can review the situation.\n  Two years ago, Congress voted to establish a national commission to \nstudy the social and economic impacts of legalized gambling in the \nUnited States. One of the aspects the commission is analyzing is the \nimpact of gambling on tribal communities. As my colleagues know, this \ncommission just began its work last year and most likely will not \ncomplete its study for another year.\n  It is significant that this commission--the very commission that was \ncreated by Congress for the purpose of studying gambling--has now sent \na letter to Secretary Babbitt asking him not to go forward with his \nproposed rules. I would like to read this letter for the benefit of my \ncolleagues.\n\n       Dear Secretary Babbitt: As you are aware, the 104th \n     Congress created the National Gambling Impact Study \n     Commission to study the social and economic impacts of \n     legalized gambling in the United States. Part of our study \n     concerns the policies and practices of tribal governments and \n     the social and economic impacts of gambling on tribal \n     communities.\n       During our July 30 meeting in Tempe, Arizona the Commission \n     discussed the Department's ``by-pass'' provision for tribes \n     who allege that a state had not negotiated for a gaming \n     compact in good faith. The Commission voted to formally \n     request the Secretary of the Interior to stay the issuance of \n     a final rule on Indian compacting pending completion of our \n     final report. On behalf of the Commission, I formally request \n     such a stay, and trust you will honor this request until you \n     have had an opportunity to review the report which we intend \n     to release on June 20, 1999. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Kay C. James,\n                                                            Chair.\n\n  Mr. President, I think it would be wise for this body to follow the \nadvice of the very commission that we created to study the issue of \nlegalized gambling.\n  I want to emphasize again that we are the body that asked for this \ncommission. We created the commission to look at all gambling. The \nAmerican taxpayers are already paying for the study. The commission is \nalready doing its work. We need to let them finish. They have asked \nthat neither we, nor Secretary Babbitt, make any changes while they do \ntheir work. My amendment would give them that time.\n  The judicial branch has already preserved the integrity of current \nlaw. This amendment supports that. The President approved my amendment \nlast year by signing the 1998 Interior appropriations bill. I'm asking \nmy colleagues to take the same ``non-action'' once again. The Committee \non Indian Affairs must play a very important role here. They need to \nhold hearings and write legislation which specifically addresses this \nissue and then put it through the process. They will have time to do \nthat if this amendment is agreed to. This amendment would support \ngiving the Indian Affairs Committee and Congress, as a whole, time to \ndevelop an appropriate policy.\n  Mr. President, the Enzi-Sessions amendment is strongly endorsed by \nthe National Governor's Association. I would like to read a letter \nwritten on behalf of the Governors and which is signed by the entire \nexecutive committee. Listen to this very bipartisan appeal.\n  Here is the letter:\n\n       As members of the Executive Committee of the National \n     Governors' Association, we urge you on behalf of all \n     governors to adopt the Indian gaming-relating amendment to \n     the Interior Department Appropriations bill sponsored by Sen. \n     Michael B. Enzi (R-Wyo.) and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.). \n     This amendment would extend the current moratorium preventing \n     the secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior from \n     using federal funds to approve tribal-state compacts that \n     have not first been approved by the state, as required by \n     law. The amendment would also prohibit the secretary from \n     promulgating a regulation or implementing a procedure that \n     could result in tribal Class III gaming in the absence of a \n     tribal-state compact or from going forward with any proposed \n     rule on this matter in fiscal 1999.\n       The U.S. Secretary of the Interior has published a proposed \n     rule in which he asserts authority to establish such \n     procedures, and he has indicated his intent to issue a final \n     rule. The nation's Governors strongly believe that no statute \n     or court decision provides the secretary of the U.S. \n     Department of the Interior with authority to intervene in \n     disputes over compacts between Indian tribes and states about \n     casino gambling on Indian lands. Such action would constitute \n     an attempt by the secretary to preempt states' authority \n     under existing laws and recent court decisions and\n\n[[Page S10358]]\n\n     would create an incentive for tribes to avoid negotiating \n     gambling compacts with states. The secretary's inherent \n     authority includes a responsibility to protect the interests \n     of Indian tribes, making it impossible for the secretary to \n     avoid a conflict of interest or exercise objective judgment \n     in disputes between states and tribes. Governors have \n     submitted comments to the department outlining these and \n     other objections to the proposed rule.\n       The Governors have agreed to enter negotiations with Indian \n     tribes and the U.S. Departments of Interior and Justice to \n     achieve consensus regarding amendments to the Indian Gaming \n     Regulatory Act of 1988. Preliminary staff discussions will \n     take place in August or September in preparation for a \n     meeting of principals in November.\n       To avoid protracted litigation, provide Congress with time \n     to determine the proper scope of the secretary's authority in \n     this area, and permit the negotiations among tribes, states, \n     and the federal government to progress, the nation's \n     Governors respectfully urge Congress to adopt the Enzi/\n     Sessions amendment to extend the current moratorium through \n     the end of fiscal 1999 and prohibit the secretary from \n     issuing a final rule.\n       Thank you for your support of the Enzi/Sessions amendment. \n     The nation's Governors look forward to working with you.\n\n  It is signed by Governor George Voinovich, the chairman; Tom Carper \nof Delaware, the vice chairman; Governor Romer of Colorado; Governor \nLawton Chiles of Florida; Governor Bob Miller of Nevada; Governor David \nBeasley of South Carolina; Governor Howard Dean of Vermont; and \nGovernor Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin. It is definitely a bipartisan \nlist.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this amendment is also supported by the \nNational Association of Attorneys General. I would like to read from \nthe attorneys general letter of support. This is an excerpt.\n\n       The Attorneys General believe that the Secretary lacks any \n     statutory authority for the proposed procedures. Twenty-five \n     state Attorneys General led by Attorney General Bob \n     Butterworth filed a letter with the Secretary setting out our \n     views at length. We believe the Secretary must seek statutory \n     amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to achieve the \n     authority he asserts and have encouraged him to engage in a \n     dialogue with states and tribes to work toward that goal.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                            Attorneys General,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 1998.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Enzi and Sessions: We write in support and in \n     appreciation of your proposed amendment to S. 2237, the \n     Interior Appropriations legislation. Last year's Interior \n     Appropriations bill contained a provision establishing a \n     moratorium on implementation of procedures by the Secretary \n     of the Interior to permit tribal gaming where a state and a \n     tribe stall in negotiations and the state asserts sovereign \n     immunity in court proceedings.\n       The Attorneys General believe that the Secretary lacks any \n     statutory authority for the proposed procedures. Twenty-five \n     state Attorneys General led by Attorney General Bob \n     Butterworth filed a letter with the Secretary setting out our \n     views at length. We believe the Secretary must seek statutory \n     amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of achieve the \n     authority he asserts and have encouraged him to engage in a \n     dialogue with states and tribes to work toward that goal.\n       While the short time frame before this year's Interior \n     Appropriations is marked up prevents us from conducting a \n     formal survey of the Attorneys General, we can assure you \n     that there is an informal consensus to urge that the \n     moratorium remain in place during the coming fiscal year. \n     Continuation of the moratorium will avert the need for costly \n     and prolonged litigation over the Secretary's administrative \n     authority and encourage a meaningful dialogue about \n     amendments to the IGRA which would benefit the Secretary, the \n     tribes and the states.\n           Sincerely,\n     Nelson Kempsky,\n       Executive Director, Conference of Western Attorneys \n     General.\n     Christine Milliken,\n       Executive Director & General Counsel, National Association \n     of Attorneys General.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we have also received a number of letters \nfrom individual Attorneys General from a number of states, and my \ncolleague from Alabama, who himself was a distinguished State Attorney \nGeneral before coming to the United States Senate, will discuss these \nat more length. This letter is also supported by the National League of \nCities. I would like to quote from this letter of endorsement.\n  This is from the National League of Cities representing the cities \nand towns across our Nation.\n\n       While further legislation is required to remove the power \n     of the Interior Secretary to administratively create enclaves \n     exempt from state and local regulatory authority, passage of \n     this amendment would be a first step in this process.\n       Because passage of the Enzi/Sessions amendment would slow \n     the creation of new trust land in one narrow set of \n     circumstances, NLC urges support of this amendment as a first \n     step. The concept of allowing an appointed federal official \n     to overrule and ignore state and local land use and taxation \n     laws through the creation of trust lands flies in the face of \n     federalism and intergovernmental comity.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Supreme Court has ruled that provisions of the Indian \n     Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq. (IGRA) violate \n     certain constitutional principles that establish the \n     obligations, immunities and privileges of the states. The \n     Interior Department appears to be determined to implement the \n     remaining provisions of IGRA despite the fact that the \n     Supreme Court decision really requires a congressional re-\n     examination of the IGRA statute and the more general topic of \n     trust land designation. For these reasons, the NLC strongly \n     urges Congress to extend the current moratorium, as proposed \n     in the Enzi/Sessions amendment, through fiscal year 1999.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    National League of Cities,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 14, 1998.\n     Hon. Slade Gorton,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Gorton and Senator Byrd: I am writing to you \n     on behalf of the National League of Cities (NLC) to urge you \n     to support the Enzi/Sessions amendment to the FY '99 Interior \n     Appropriations Bill which seeks to continue the moratorium on \n     implementation of procedures by the U.S. Secretary of the \n     Interior for fiscal year 1999. The NLC urges support of the \n     Enzi/Sessions amendment in order to slow the creation of new \n     trust land. While further legislation is required to remove \n     the power of the Interior Secretary to administratively \n     create enclaves exempt from state and local regulatory \n     authority, passage of this amendment would be a first step in \n     this process.\n       Because passage of the Enzi/Sessions amendment would slow \n     the creation of new trust land in one narrow set of \n     circumstances, NLC urges support of this amendment as a first \n     step. The concept of allowing an appointed federal official \n     to overrule and ignore state and local land use and taxation \n     laws through the creation of trust lands flies in the face of \n     federalism and intergovernmental comity.\n       The membership of the NLC has adopted policy which declares \n     that: ``lands acquired by Native-American tribes and \n     individuals shall be given corporate, not federal trust, \n     property status.'' This policy is advocated ``in order that \n     all lands may be uniformly regulated and taxed under \n     municipal laws.''\n       The Supreme Court has ruled that provisions of the Indian \n     Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. 2701 et seq. (IGRA) violate \n     certain constitutional principles that establish the \n     obligations, immunities and privileges of the states. The \n     Interior Department appears to be determined to implement the \n     remaining provisions of IGRA despite the fact that the \n     Supreme Court decision really requires a congressional re-\n     examination of the IGRA statute and the more general topic of \n     trust land designation. For these reasons, the NLC strongly \n     urges Congress to extend the current moratorium, as proposed \n     in the Enzi/Sessions amendment, through fiscal year 1999.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Brian J. O'Neill,\n                                         President and Councilman.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, there is a growing number of groups, \nincluding the Christian Coalition which is very concerned about the \nexplosion of unregulated gaming in America. I have a letter from the \nChristian Coalition. I share with you a paragraph from that.\n\n       Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, every State has the \n     right to be directly involved in tribal-state compacts \n     without Federal interference. Every state also has the right, \n     as upheld by the Supreme Court in the Seminole Tribe of \n     Florida v. Florida decision, to raise its 11th Amendment \n     defense of southern immunity if a tribe tries to sue the \n     state for not approving a casino compact. However, in the \n     wake of the Seminole decision, the Department of Interior has \n     created new rules whereby a tribe can negotiate directly with \n     the Secretary of Interior on casino gambling compacts and \n     bypass a state's\n\n[[Page S10359]]\n\n     rights to be involved. These new rules are a gross violation \n     of states' rights. An unelected cabinet member should not be \n     given sole authority to direct the internal activities of a \n     state, especially with regards to casino gambling contracts.\n       Christian Coalition is also very concerned with the severe \n     social consequences of casino gambling. There is much \n     evidence that the rise of casino gambling leads to a rise in \n     family breakdown, crime, drug addiction, and alcoholism. With \n     such staggering repercussions, it is vital that tribal-state \n     gambling contracts remain within each individual state and \n     not be commandeered by an unelected Federal official.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          Christian Coalition,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: When the Senate considers the FY '99 Interior \n     appropriations bill, an amendment sponsored by Senator Enzi \n     (WY) and Senator Sessions (AL) is expected to be offered. \n     This amendment would protect states' rights in negotiating \n     tribal-state compacts, especially when negotiating casino \n     gambling.\n       Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, every state has the \n     right to be directly involved in tribal-state compacts, \n     without federal interference. Every state also has the right, \n     as upheld by the Supreme Court in the Seminole Tribe of \n     Florida v. Florida decision, to raise its 11th Amendment \n     defense of sovereign immunity if a tribe tries to sue the \n     state for not approving a casino compact. However, in the \n     wake of the Seminole decision, the Department of Interior has \n     created new rules whereby a tribe can negotiate directly with \n     the Secretary of Interior on casino gambling compacts and \n     bypass a state's right to be involved. These new rules are a \n     gross violation of states' rights. An unelected cabinet \n     member should not be given sole authority to direct the \n     internal activities of a state, especially with regards to \n     casino gambling contracts.\n       Christian Coalition is also very concerned with the severe \n     social consequences of casino gambling. There is much \n     evidence that the rise of casino gambling leads to a rise in \n     family breakdown, crime, drug addiction and alcoholism. With \n     such staggering repercussions, it is vital that Tribal-State \n     gambling compacts remain within each individual State and not \n     be commandeered by an unelected federal official.\n       The Enzi/Sessions amendment would prohibit the Secretary of \n     Interior, during fiscal year 1999, from establishing or \n     implementing any new rules that allow the Secretary to \n     circumvent a state in negotiating a tribal-state compact when \n     that state raises its 11th amendment defense of sovereign \n     immunity. It also prohibits the Secretary from approving any \n     tribal-state compact which has not first been approved by the \n     state.\n       Christian Coalition urges you to protect states' rights and \n     vote for the Enzi/Sessions amendment to the FY '98 Interior \n     appropriations bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Jeffrey K. Taylor,\n                          Acting Director of Government Relations.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I want to point out that this amendment does not affect any \nexisting tribal-State compact. It does not in any way prevent States \nand tribes from entering into compacts where both parties are willing \nto disagree on class 3 gambling on tribal lands within a State's \nborders. The amendment does ensure that all stakeholders must be \ninvolved in the process--Congress, tribes, States, the administration.\n  Mr. President, a few short years ago, the big casinos thought Wyoming \nwould be a good place to gamble. The casinos gambled on it. They spent \na lot of money. They even got an initiative on the ballot. They spent a \nlot more money trying to get the initiative passed. I became the \nspokesman for the opposition.\n  When we first got our meager organization together, the polls showed \nover 60 percent of the people were in favor of gambling. When the \nelection was held, the casino gambling lost by over 62 percent, and it \nlost in every single county of our State. The 40-point swing in public \nopinion happened as people came to understand the issue and the \nimplications of casino gambling in Wyoming.\n  That is a pretty solid message. We do not want casino gambling in \nWyoming. The people who vote in my State have debated it and made their \nchoice. Any Federal bureaucracy that tries to force casino gambling on \nus will obviously inject animosity.\n  Why did we have that decisive a vote? We used a couple of our \nneighboring States to review the effects of limited casino gambling. We \nfound that a few people--a few people--make an awful lot of money at \nthe expense of everyone else. When casino gambling comes into a State, \ncommunities are changed forever and everyone agrees there are costs to \nthe State. There are material costs, with a need for new law \nenforcement and public services. Worse yet, there are social costs. And \nnot only is gambling addictive to some folks, but once it is \ninstituted, the revenues can be addictive, too.\n  But I am not here to debate the pros and cons of gambling. I am just \ntrying to maintain the status quo so we can develop a legislative \nsolution rather than a bureaucratic mandate.\n  Mr. President, the rationale behind this amendment is simple. Society \nas a whole bears the burden of the effects of gambling. A State's law \nenforcement, social services, communities, and families are seriously \nimpacted by the expansion of casino gambling on Indian tribal lands. \nTherefore, a State's popularly elected representatives should have a \nsay in the decision about whether or not to allow casino gambling on \nIndian lands. This decision should not be made unilaterally by an \nunelected Cabinet official. Passing the Enzi-Sessions amendment will \nkeep all the interested parties at the bargaining table. By keeping all \nthe parties at the table, the Indian Affairs Committee will have the \ntime it needs to hear all the sides and work on the legislation to fix \nany problems that exist in the current system.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for the constitutional role of \nCongress and for the rights of all 50 States by supporting this \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Enzi \namendment on Indian gaming. I think it is patently unfair because it \nwill result in preventing Indian tribes from engaging in business \nactivities that are now enjoyed by non-Indian neighbors. If we are \ngoing to talk about the merits of gambling--and I noticed my friend \nfrom Wyoming spoke eloquently about the down side of gambling--maybe we \nought to shut down Reno and Las Vegas so millions, hundreds of millions \nof Americans cannot go there because it is bad for their health or \nsight or something.\n\n  We are not here, by the way, Mr. President, to defend the actions of \nthe Secretary of Interior, and I hope we will not confuse that. His \nmismanagement is one thing, but the letter of the law is something \nelse. And I firmly believe you can't fix an otherwise good bill, this \nInterior appropriations bill, with a bad amendment. This simply makes a \ngood bill bad.\n  The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 was a compromise to give \nState governments a voice in what kind of gaming would occur on Indian \nreservations within a State's borders. This was an unusual break from \nFederal Indian policy because States have no constitutional role in \nnegotiating with Indian tribes, as you know.\n  I was here in 1988, in fact, and helped write that original \nauthorizing legislation, IGRA, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. There \nwas no intent at the time to usurp State laws, but as with many laws we \nhave passed, there have been unintended consequences. The way it was \nwritten, a State can prevent a tribe from operating gaming facilities \non its reservation simply by refusing to negotiate with the tribe. And \nthat, of course, was upheld in the Seminole decision. My friend from \nWyoming has spoken to that.\n  But in 1988, it didn't occur to us, when we were writing the bill, \nthat States might simply refuse to negotiate in good faith. Since \ntribes are limited to those types of gaming allowed under State law, we \nhave tribes prohibited from being in the same business as their non-\nIndian neighbors. I think that is discriminatory in the least. It is \nwrong to do that, and I think it violates the treaties. I should also \npoint out to my colleagues that in many cases non-Indian gaming is \npromoted and even operated by State governments. They certainly don't \nwant the competition.\n  Since Congress' intent under IGRA was that States should not have the \nability to unilaterally veto gaming on Indian land, the Department of \nInterior has proposed regulations to address this situation. Although \nthe proposal may need refinement, we do not believe the Secretary \nshould be precluded from at least developing and proposing alternative \napproaches to State-tribal impasses in the gaming negotiations. In \nfact, in a letter issued on September 9, the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nhas stated\n\n[[Page S10360]]\n\nthe Enzi amendment could be very harmful in their ongoing negotiations.\n  Coming from a Western State, I am as supportive as anybody of States \nrights, but those who say this new procedure overrides the States are \nsimply wrong. Under the draft proposal, if a State objected to a \ndecision made by the Interior Secretary, that State could challenge \nthat decision in Federal court. For those who claim the Interior \nDepartment is acting without legislative oversight, I would point out \nthat Congress will have the authority to review any proposed \nregulations before they take effect. As those proposed regulations come \nbefore the authorizing committees, any new gaming regulations will get \na careful review, and if, after input from the rest of the Senate, \nthose regulations are found to be unacceptable, they simply will not \npass. We will legislate a new approach if they do not pass.\n  I understand that there are Members in the Chamber who are simply \nagainst gaming. That is not what this debate is about. Under Federal \nlaw, tribes are limited to the types of gaming allowed under the laws \nof the State in which they reside. In my own State of Colorado as an \nexample, there are two tribes, the Southern Ute and the Ute Mountain \nUte. They are limited to slot machines and low-stakes table games, just \nas the other gaming towns in Colorado. In Utah, State law prohibits all \ngaming. Therefore, no tribes can do any kind of gaming whatsoever, and \nthe tribes in other States cannot do gaming if a State law prevents \nthat.\n  Contrary to the statement already made that there have been no \nhearings, we have done hearings. We simply have not gotten to the \nimportant part of the legislation, which is a markup, but we will. This \ndebate is about whether a Governor of a State can limit a type of \nbusiness activity to certain ethnic groups. That is unfair and un-\nAmerican. Let's not jeopardize a good bill with a bad amendment. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote against the Enzi amendment and allow the \nregulatory and legislative process to work.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I support the Enzi amendment. I think a \nstatement may be helpful to my colleagues who have not followed this \nissue as closely as the Senators who have joined us on the floor for \npurposes of discussing this amendment, the statement of Justice Oliver \nWendell Holmes that a page of history may be more instructive than a \nvolume of logic. This issue dates back to the time of a court decision \ninvolving the Cabazon Indian Tribe. As a result of that decision, the \nCongress, in 1988, passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which has \nbeen referred to in the course of this debate as IGRA.\n  I think the philosophical underpinnings of that legislation continue \nto be valid. Let me make it clear, because sometimes my view is \nmisconstrued, I support the right of Indian tribes to enjoy \nentrepreneurial gaming activities to the same extent that State law, as \na matter of public policy, permits those entrepreneurial activities to \nbe available to all. So this debate is not whether you agree with \nIndian gaming or disagree with Indian gaming. I believe the tribes, \nsubject to the qualification I have just stated, have a right to \nparticipate in gaming to the extent that, as a matter of State policy, \na State chooses to permit gaming entrepreneurial opportunities.\n  We have marked contrasts in the West. The State of Utah, as a matter \nof State law--as the distinguished Senator from Colorado just pointed \nout--as a matter of State policy, permits no form of gaming. It is, in \nmy judgment, clear and properly so under IGRA that no tribe within the \nState of Utah would have a right to participate in any form of Indian \ngaming.\n  The contrast to my own State is quite marked. In Nevada, as a matter \nof public policy since 1931, a full range of gaming entrepreneurial \nactivities are available to the citizens of Nevada, and it is clear \nthat the tribes in Nevada have the same opportunity. And, indeed, there \nhave been five compacts negotiated with the tribes in the State of \nNevada to permit that.\n  Under IGRA, gaming is divided into three different categories \nreferred to as class I, class II, and class III. Class I and class II \nare not a part of this discussion. Class I deals with traditional \nIndian games; class II deals with bingo, and class III deals with \ncasino types of gaming, including slot machines.\n  Again, to repeat, the premise of IGRA is that a Governor of a State \nis obligated to negotiate with a tribe to provide the same \nopportunities to tribes in his or her State to the extent the States, \nas a matter of law, permit gaming in general in that State.\n  Here is what brings us to the floor again this year, as my \ndistinguished colleague from Wyoming points out. Under IGRA, what is \ncontemplated in those States that permit any form of gaming is a \ncompacting process under State law, where the Governors--and, indeed, \nin the law of some States it is the Governors and the State \nlegislators--are required to negotiate with the Indian tribes within \nthat State to provide those tribes with an equal opportunity to \nparticipate in the entrepreneurial aspects of gaming. There is no \nquarrel by this Senator with respect to that approach.\n  Here is what gives us cause for great concern. Some tribes have \nasserted that if the Governors of a respective State refuse to grant \nthem everything they want by way of gaming, even though what they want \nis beyond what is permitted as a matter of State law, that that \nconstitutes bad faith in the negotiating process. They want to be able \nto bypass that process; namely, the negotiation with the Governors, and \nin some States the negotiations with the Governors that must be \napproved by the State legislature.\n  The Enzi amendment does two things. No. 1, it prevents the Secretary \nof the Interior from moving forward to promulgate the final regulation \nthat would, in effect, seek by regulation to bypass or change the \nprocedure that currently exists. The second thing the amendment does is \nto prevent the Secretary of the Interior from, in effect, bypassing the \ncompacting process and authorizing a compact that is not in compliance \nwith State law.\n  My colleague from Wyoming has pointed out that this is an issue that \nis bipartisan in nature; this is not something that divides us on a \npartisan basis. It does not divide us regionally. It does not divide us \nphilosophically. Some of my colleagues who have spoken oppose gaming in \nall forms. I respect that. This Senator does not take that position. \nBut the National Governors' Association, the National Association of \nAttorneys General--both organizations of which I have been privileged \nto be a member in the past when serving as attorney general and \nGovernor of my State--have gone on record as supporting the Enzi \namendment. The reason why they are supporting this amendment so \nstrongly is they want to preserve the right of State governments to \ndetermine, as a matter of policy, what, if any, form of gaming activity \nis permitted.\n  So, for those who find some type of invidious discrimination in this \nprocess, I must say this Senator does not. To the extent that a State \npermits gaming, it is clear that Governors are obligated to negotiate \nthat same right to Indian tribes within the State. To the extent that a \nState, such as Utah or Hawaii, permits no form of gaming, the Governors \nof those two States are not required to enter into any kind of compact \nbecause those States, as a matter of public policy, have the right to \ndetermine what that policy is, and they have said, as a matter of \npublic policy, they oppose gaming, do not want any form to exist within \nthe State.\n\n  I must say, I thought we had hopefully put this issue to rest a year \nago when we offered a similar amendment to the appropriations bill. I \nthought we had sent a clear message that the Congress of the United \nStates does not want the Secretary of the Interior to bypass a process \nprovided by law; namely, for Indian tribes to negotiate with the \nGovernors as to what kind of gaming activity is to be permitted in that \nState consistent with that State's public policy. No sooner had this \nissue been approved by this body, the other body, and it became part of \nthe Interior appropriations bill last year, than the Secretary of the \nInterior began a rulemaking process that, in my judgment, is violative \nof the spirit and contrary to the law in terms of what is his \nauthority.\n\n[[Page S10361]]\n\n  It is that disagreement that brings Governors from all regions of the \ncountry, Democrat and Republican, in support of the Enzi amendment. It \nis that same concern that brings the Nation's attorneys general \ntogether in a similar bipartisan way to strongly support the Enzi \namendment. They do so as a matter of preserving and protecting the \nability of each State to determine how much, if any, or how little, \ngaming is to be permitted within that State.\n  So, this is not, my colleagues, an issue of whether one favors Indian \ngaming or opposes Indian gaming. It is not an issue of whether you \nsupport gaming or oppose gaming. This amendment is designed to preserve \nthe existing law which gives to each State Governor and the legislature \nthe ability in that State to determine whether gaming is to be \npermitted and, if so, what form of gaming.\n  This is an extraordinarily significant piece of legislation. I must \nsay, I am not familiar with any circumstances currently in the country \nwhere the tribes have not been able to negotiate a compact with those \nStates that permit some form of gaming. At last count, there were 150 \ncompacts negotiated in 20 States, pursuant to the law that was enacted \nby Congress in 1988. I am not suggesting that IGRA is perfect. I am not \nsuggesting that some modification or change may not be needed with \nrespect to some aspect. But that is a decision for the Congress of the \nUnited States, not a decision for the Secretary of the Interior. So I \nimplore my colleagues to support the Enzi amendment in a bipartisan \nfashion, because what it seeks to accomplish is to reserve to the \nrespective States the ability to determine what public policy will be \nwith respect to gaming activities conducted within that State.\n  As I have observed throughout my comments, to the extent that a State \nas a matter of public policy has determined that they will permit some \nform of gaming, it is clear in IGRA that State Governors are obligated \nto negotiate those same entrepreneurial opportunities, and I have no \nquarrel with that. That is the law. But what we are really talking \nabout here is an attempt to make an end run around IGRA. To the extent \nthat the Secretary of the Interior, by regulation or by determining \nthat an impasse exists, is able to bypass the State compacting process, \nno longer is it the State determining what the public policy with \nrespect to gaming in that State may be. It is the Secretary of \nInterior. I have great respect for the Secretary of Interior but, with \ngreat respect, that is not an authority that he, or any Secretary of \nInterior, ought to have.\n  That is an authority that ought to be reserved to the State and the \nState legislature. We would do real violence to the very carefully \ncrafted balance that was accomplished in IGRA when that was adopted a \ndecade ago.\n  For that reason, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nEnzi amendment when this comes for a vote. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for the \njunior Senator from Wyoming. I have heretofore on other occasions \naccepted and supported his various concerns in this area, but I want to \nshare with him and the Senate a situation that perhaps deserves some \nspecial consideration for New Mexico, even if it is for a time certain. \nLet me, as best I can, explain this.\n  First of all, there is a case called the Seminole case, very much \nunderstood in Indian country. It pertains to gaming in this manner. The \nFederal courts have ruled under the Seminole case that the States are \nimmune from suit and that means they can't be sued by an Indian tribe. \nSo we start with that premise.\n  In the State of New Mexico, we have 14 Pueblos and two Apache tribes \nthat have gaming houses and have compacts. But the compacts are very \ndifferent than anyone else's in the country, for a couple of reasons.\n  First of all, in order to make the compacts valid, the Supreme Court \nof the State of New Mexico ruled that the legislature had to be \ninvolved in getting this done, not just the Governor. The State of New \nMexico, through its legislature, I say to my friend Senator Enzi, came \nalong and imposed, not by way of compact agreement, but just imposed as \npart of the authority for the Governor to enter into a compact, that \neach casino owned by the various Indian groups be charged 16 percent on \ngross slot machine revenues.\n  Obviously, that has not been negotiated, and my friend from Nevada is \ntalking about compacts that are negotiated and that he doesn't know of \nany situation where they were not negotiated. I am suggesting one where \nthey were not negotiated, but pursuant to a mandate from the \nlegislature that charged them 16 percent gross tax on slot machines. \nThey either took it or left it. The Secretary, I say to the Senator \nfrom Wyoming, said, ``I'm not going to sign the pacts, because if I \nsign them, I am at least implicitly agreeing that the legislature can \ntax Indian casinos.''\n  He let the pacts go in under a provision that says if he doesn't sign \nit within a certain amount of time, it goes into effect anyway.\n  We have compacts with our Indian tribes being assessed 16 percent, \nand I am not here to ask the U.S. Senate for relief from that, for I \ndon't even know if 16 percent is right or not. All I know is it is a \nvery big piece of money for very small casinos, but we have nothing yet \nin New Mexico that rivals the smallest, most minute casino in the State \nof the distinguished Senator from Nevada who just argued in favor of \nthe Enzi amendment. They are very small casinos, with one exception, \nand even that is not a rival to anything the Senator has in a State \nthat has legalized gaming.\n  Our Indian people would like to contest the 16 percent. Isn't it \ninteresting, the Seminole case, which I just recited, prevents them \nfrom going to court, so they can get no relief from what they want to \nargue is an illegal imposition of this license fee, or at least \narbitrary and unreasonable based upon what they are making. There they \nsit.\n  The point of it is there is at least a hope and an avenue for \npotentially getting this issue into the courts if you leave the section \nin the law that Senator Enzi chooses to remove from the law, because it \nprovides for a remediation section and a Secretarial procedure which is \nbeing removed, so we will leave them in the status quo with no way to \nchallenge.\n  Frankly, I repeat, I don't know whether their challenge is going to \nbe valid or not, but it seems a little bit unfair that there is no way \nto challenge it even when a Secretary of the Interior is suggesting \nthat the States didn't have the authority to impose that tax or that \nmuch. The Secretary can't do anything about it either, because all he \ndoes is sign the pacts or let them go into effect based on the \nexpiration of time. In either case, you will have left the 16 percent \nlicense fee, gross fee, in place with no way to challenge it in any \ncourt because of the Seminole case.\n  I say to the Senator from Wyoming, he is probably going to win today. \nI haven't had a chance to explore how we might effect some justice and \nfairness here, but I do suggest that it is at least right for me to \ncome down here and object, and I believe there might be a way that you \ncan ameliorate New Mexico's problem by exempting them, by leaving the \nstatute that we are concerned with in place for the New Mexico licensed \ncasinos.\n  If you say you don't want it anywhere else, you want to wipe it out \nbecause it may have an opportunity to get around the need for compacts, \nyou could at least leave it in effect somehow or another for those in \nNew Mexico who are suffering under the situation which I have just \ndescribed.\n  Having said that, because of this, obviously I can't vote aye on the \namendment. You don't need to worry because I haven't been out lobbying \nSenators because this is a particular problem, very peculiar and \nparticular to New Mexico. The Indian people think they have a case for \njust fairness, that they ought to be able to challenge this, and they \nwill never have a chance to challenge it if your amendment wipes out \nthe statute which gives the Secretary some additional power.\n  The Pueblo of Laguna in New Mexico has done a great deal of research \non this.

Such \n     a drastic change should not be done through the mechanism of \n     a budget rider attached to a spending bill, with no hearings, \n     findings, tribal consultation of input.\n       Enzi-Reid-Sessions Rider will deny Indian tribes notice and \n     an opportunity for hearing which is tantamount to a denial of \n     the ``due process'' guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\n B. The Gaming tribes in new Mexico will have no remedy to address the \n  injustices that occurred over the state's failure to negotiate over \n                   gaming activities on tribal lands\n\n       In New Mexico, IGRA's Secretarial procedures provisions are \n     necessary to provide a remedy to the tribal governments who \n     have been unsuccessful in obtaining negotiated tribal/state \n     Class III compacts, a negotiated process that the states \n     clamored to obtain when IGRA was enacted. There are 14 \n     compacts in New Mexico, known as the ``HB 399 Compacts'' \n     which are the product of a state legislative process, and \n     which were not negotiated by any of the gaming tribes.\n       The gaming tribes in New Mexico were forced to (1) to \n     accept the compacts that they had no voice in drafting and \n     which were contrary to the federal law which authorized the \n     compact, or (2) to reject HB 399 and risk closure and \n     criminal prosecution by the U.S. Attorney. No state in this \n     country would tolerate such unfair and coerced treatment by \n     another government.\n       Some gaming tribes in New Mexico have challenged certain \n     provisions of the New Mexico HB 399 compacts as being \n     contrary to IGRA, and therefore, a violation of federal law. \n     HB 399 calls for a 16 percent `'revenue-sharing'' with the \n     state and hefty flat regulatory fees, even through IGRA \n     prohibits the state from assessing fees, taxes, and other \n     levies on tribal gaming and requires that regulatory costs \n     bear relation to the actual costs of regulating gaming \n     activists.\n       In addition, opponents of New Mexico Indian gaming have \n     challenged the validity of HB 399 compacts. If this action \n     succeeds, the gaming tribes will be prevented from getting \n     the state to the negotiating table, due to the state's 11th \n     Amendment immunity from suit. Again, the unfair and unjust \n     result will be that gaming tribes in New Mexico will have no \n     remedy to address these federal law violations.\n       The Pueblos and Indian tribes in New Mexico who may seek to \n     conduct lawful gaming activities on their tribal lands will \n     have no avenue to bring the state to the negotiating table. \n     This is an unfair and unjust result that will leave these \n     tribes with no remedy.\n\n   Pueblo of Laguna Position on ``Enzi-Reid-Sessions'' Indian Gaming \n           Restrictions FY 1999 Interior Appropriations Bill\n\n       The Pueblo of Laguna strongly opposes the budget riders to \n     the FY 1999 Interior Appropriations Bill, which would place \n     restrictions on Indian gaming activities that are otherwise \n     recognized and authorized pursuant to the Indian Gaming \n     Regulatory Act of 1988 (``IGRA''). Enzi-Reid-Sessions \n     amendment to the Interior Appropriations Bill (``Enzi-Reid-\n     Sessions Rider'') would prohibit the Secretary of the \n     Interior from promulgating alternate compacting procedures \n     where an impasse occurs in tribal-state negotiations, and it \n     would prevent the Secretary from approving Class III gaming \n     compacts that have not been the product of the tribal-state \n     negotiation and agreement Enzi-Reid-Sessions Rider would \n     constitute an unfair circumvention of IGRA's provisions which \n     were designed to protect tribal governments. Enzi-Reid-\n     Sessions Rider will constitute an denial constitutional due \n     process because gaming tribes in New Mexico will be left \n     without a remedy to address injustices that over occurred \n     over gaming.\n       The Pueblo of Laguna protests these budget riders on \n     substantive and procedural grounds. First, the budget riders \n     unfairly subordinate an area of inherent tribal governmental \n     authority, on reservation economic development, to state \n     government authority in violation of the Federal trust \n     responsibility to protect Indian tribes from the often \n     hostile state governments. Second, since the formation of the \n     Union, the United States has dealt with Indian tribes on a \n     bilateral government-to-government basis because Indian \n     peoples have a natural, human right to self-government that \n     predates the formation of the United States. The proposed \n     budget riders amount to nothing less than legislative \n     ``fiats,'' which disregard our government-to-government \n     relationship and tread on our inherent, human right to self-\n     government on our traditional homelands.\n       Before the passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of \n     1988 (``IGRA''), states had no authority to regulate Indian \n     gaming. The regulation of Indian gaming was the subject of \n     inherent tribal government authority. The states, however, \n     clamored for the passage of the IGRA to provide them a \n     ``voice'' in the development of Indian gaming regulatory \n     systems. Hence, IGRA was enacted to build strong tribal \n     governments, spark economic opportunities on depressed tribal \n     lands and economies, and it was a compromise that provided \n     states an opportunity to negotiate in ``good faith'' for a \n     role in regulating gaming on Indian lands. As initially \n     enacted, IGRA gave states a ``voice'' in regard to Indian \n     gaming, not a ``veto.'' IGRA's ``good faith negotiation'' \n     provision mandated states to negotiate in good faith for \n     Class III compacts with Indian tribes for gaming activities \n     that are permitted to be played in the state by any person or \n     entity. Tribes do not have to blindly accept state regulatory \n     laws because we have our own laws. IGRA intends tribes and \n     states to enter the negotiation and true sovereign-to-\n     sovereign accommodation. If states decline to negotiate in \n     good faith, IGRA provides tribes with a remedy; IGRA \n     authorized tribes to sue states in federal court for failure \n     to conduct good faith negotiations.\n       In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court disrupted this careful \n     compromise between tribal and state interests by striking \n     down the authorization to tribes to sue states for failure to \n     negotiate in good faith on the grounds that the states' 11th \n     Amendment immunity from suit bars such an action in federal \n     court (even though the states had originally asked Congress \n     for the opportunity to negotiate compacts with tribes). \n     However, the Court left intact IGRA's provision which allow \n     the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate alternate \n     regulations for the Class III gaming where an impasse \n     develops in state-tribal gaming negotiations. That is \n     because, under the Federal trust responsibility to protect \n     Indian tribes, Congress never intended to leave tribes \n     completely at the mercy of the states in regard to Indian \n     gaming. Congress intended to authorize only ``good faith'' \n     sovereign-to-sovereign negotiation. Yet is important to \n     recognize that state gaming laws and policy are adhered to \n     under the Secretarial procedures avenue. Therefore, the \n     Secretarial procedures do not provide a ``by-pass'' of state \n     law, as alleged by the proponents of the Enzi-Reid Sessions \n     Rider.\n       The Pueblo of Laguna strongly opposes the Enzi-Reid-\n     Sessions Indian gaming restrictions budget rider to the FY \n     1999 Interior Appropriations Bill.\n\n\n   a. the enzi-reid-sessions rider undermines federal law and policy \n regarding tribal self-government and the federal/tribal government to \n                        government relationship\n\n       1. Self-Government is a Natural Right of Indian Peoples. \n     Tribal governments predate the formation of the United \n     States, and as Indian peoples, we retain our original, \n     natural right to govern ourselves on our own lands. Under the \n     Federal trust responsibility to protect Indian tribes, \n     Congress should develop Indian affairs legislation based on \n     consultation and consensus with Indian tribes. Anything less \n     deprives Indian tribes of our inherent human rights to self-\n     government. The Enzi-Reid-Sessions Rider would constitute an \n     extreme altering of the comprehensive IGRA legislation, which \n     strikes a careful balance between federal, tribal, and state \n     interests. It is inappropriate and disrespectful to pursue \n     such important substantive tribal legislation as budget \n     riders to annual appropriations measures. The attempt to \n     alter the face of such legislation would signal a change in \n     federal-tribal relations. Clearly, this should not be done \n     through the mechanism of a budget rider attached to a \n     spending bill, with no hearings, findings, tribal \n     consultation or input.\n       2. Government-to-Government Relations. The Enzi-Reid-\n     Sessions Rider would undermine the government-to-government \n     relationship between the United States and the Indian \n     nations, which is grounded in the United States Constitution \n     and reflects inherent tribal rights of self-government. \n     Congress has long recognized its trust responsibility to \n     protect and promote tribal self-government. At the very \n     least, members of Congress should have the opportunity to \n     fully examine what impact the Enzi-Reid-Session Rider will \n     have upon tribal governments and to hear from the tribal \n     governments that will be impacted by the legislation. \n     Clearly, adoption of the Enzi-Reid-Sessions Rider will \n     undermine this government-to-government relationship. \n     Moreover, denying Indian tribes notice and an opportunity for \n     hearing is tantamount to a denial of the ``due process'' \n     guaranteed by the United States Constitution.\n\n\n     B. new mexico gaming tribes need IGRA's alternate secretarial \n          procedures to provide adequate safeguards and relief\n\n       1. Without IGRA's Secretarial procedures, tribes in New \n     Mexico will have no remedy. In New Mexico, the IGRA's \n     alternate procedures are necessary to provide a remedy to the \n     tribal governments who have been unsuccessful in obtaining \n     negotiated tribal/state Class III Gaming compacts. Currently, \n     there are 14 compacts in effect in New Mexico since 1997. \n     They were never negotiated and they contain provisions which \n     are detrimental to tribal governments and which may be\n\n[[Page S10363]]\n\n     in violation of federal policy. These compacts are referred \n     to as ``HB 399 Compacts'' because they are the product of a \n     state legislative process which has no room for tribal \n     governments at the negotiating tables. (HB 399 refers to the \n     House Bill enacted by the New Mexico Legislature). The gaming \n     tribes in New Mexico were faced with the unconscionable \n     choice: (1) to accept the compacts that they had no voice in \n     drafting and which appeared to violate the federal law which \n     authorized the compact, or (2) to reject HB 399 and risk \n     closure and criminal prosecution by the U.S. Attorney. No \n     state in this country would tolerate such unfair and coerced \n     treatment by another government.\n       2. The HB 399 Compacts impose an impermissible 16 percent \n     gross receipts ``tax'' on the Indian tribes of New Mexico, \n     which the tribes must pay to the state before they earn one \n     penny for themselves from their own establishments. As a \n     result, some of New Mexico's tribes are no longer able to \n     profitably operate gaming establishments. Two of the Pueblos \n     have filed a federal court action against the Secretary of \n     the Interior relating to his failure to review and remove HB \n     399's sixteen percent of slot machine revenue sharing \n     requirement, and the hefty flat regulatory fees that must be \n     paid to the sate pursuant to HB 299, as both being violative \n     of federal law. IGRA prohibits the state from assessing fees, \n     taxes and other levies on tribal gaming, and it requires that \n     regulatory costs must bear relation to the actual costs of \n     regulating Indian gaming. The United States has filed a \n     motion to dismiss based on the legal argument that the case \n     cannot go forward without the state of New Mexico, because \n     the state is an indispensable party that cannot be jointed \n     due to its 11th Amendment immunity from suit. Therefore, the \n     alternate Secretarial procedures authorized by IGRA are \n     necessary to provide the New Mexico gaming tribes a remedy in \n     the event that the Pueblos are judicially prevented from \n     obtaining relief. Preferably, the New Mexico gaming tribes \n     would prefer to seek a negotiated resolution with the state \n     to resolve these types of issues; but, pursuant to the \n     states' 11th Amendment immunity, the state cannot be \n     compelled to negotiate with tribal governments over these \n     matters.\n       3. HB 399 also contains a binding arbitration provision \n     which is designed to provide a mechanism to address and \n     resolve any breaches of the compact of failure to comply \n     therewith. Accordingly, other tribes in New Mexico are \n     engaged with the state in binding arbitration over the \n     sixteen percent revenue sharing and the regulatory fees. \n     However, in this context there is a real question of whether \n     the arbitrator can address the constitutional preemption \n     question of whether the IGRA preempts HB 399's flat \n     assessment of a set revenue sharing and regulatory fees. \n     Assuming that the New Mexico gaming tribes are prevented form \n     going forward with their federal court action and assuming \n     that the HB 399's arbitration process lacks the requisite \n     authority to decide federal preemption questions, the tribes \n     will be left without any remedy to address these important \n     issues.\n       4. In addition to the above-stated obstacles, other \n     opponents of Indian gaming in New Mexico have filed an action \n     challenging the validity of HB 399. If this action is \n     successful, the tribes will be without a remedy in any forum.\n       Clearly, New Mexico and other states should not be given \n     what amounts to a ``veto'' over Indian gaming by the Enzi-\n     Reid-Sessions Rider. New Mexico Indian gaming is a good, \n     productive local industry, which we respectfully submit \n     should be protected by our New Mexico delegation from anti-\n     Indian gaming legislation offered by delegations from other \n     states.\n                                  ____\n\n\nThe Need for Secretarial Procedures: State Law Invalidation of Approved \n                                Compacts\n\n       Under the decisions in State ex rel. Clark v. Johnson and \n     Pueblo of Santa Ana v. Kelly, a tribal-state class III gaming \n     compact that has been approved by the Secretary and has \n     ``taken effect'' under IGRA can nevertheless be declared \n     invalid on the basis of a state-court determination that the \n     compact was never validly entered into by the state. Such a \n     decision, based strictly on principles of state statutory or \n     constitutional law, would be unreviewable by any federal \n     court.\n       The case of State ex rel. Coll v. Montoya, currently \n     pending in state district court in Santa Fe (on temporary \n     remand from the state Supreme Court), is a broad attack on \n     the validity of House Bill 399, as enacted by the 1997 New \n     Mexico legislature, the bill that authorized the governor to \n     sign compacts and revenue-sharing agreements with the tribes. \n     Just as in Clark, the tribes are not parties to the case, and \n     so far the courts have turned a deaf ear to the argument that \n     inasmuch as the case seeks to invalidate the compacts, it \n     should not be allowed to proceed in the absence of the tribes \n     as parties. (In federal court, that point would conclusively \n     lead to dismissal of the case.)\n       If the Supreme Court were ultimately to rule for the \n     plaintiffs in Coll, and hold that HB 399 is invalid, that \n     could mean that Gov. Johnson never had valid authority from \n     the legislature to sign the compacts, and that the compacts \n     are ``void ab initio'' (invalid from their inception), as the \n     court said in Clark.\n       In short, even if a state legislature agrees to a compact, \n     and the compact is approved and takes effect under IGRA, the \n     decisions in Clark and Santa Ana mean that state courts are \n     still free to invalidate the compact on state law grounds, \n     even without the tribes being able to be heard. Tribes \n     attempting to operate in good faith under approved compacts \n     thus have no legal protection whatever, and their rights can \n     be cut off at the whim of a state Supreme Court.\n       Allowing the regulations authorizing the Secretary to issue \n     ``procedures'' under which a tribe could conduct class III \n     gaming even if the state refuses to enter into a compact \n     provides tribes with some leverage against recalcitrant \n     states, and against parties who would seek to invalidate \n     approved compacts as described above. By giving the tribes an \n     alternative, assuring them that (as Congress intended) they \n     would be able to conduct class III gaming that is permitted \n     in the state even if they cannot achieve valid, approved \n     compacts, the regulations change the strategic balance as \n     between tribes and the state. The state will be forced to act \n     reasonably, and anti-gaming zealots will be forced to \n     recognize that by going to court to attack approved compacts \n     they may cause a situation in which tribes will be able to \n     engage in class III gaming (under secretarial procedures) \n     with the state cut out of the process (and the revenues) \n     entirely. This restores the balance that Congress attempted \n     to create in IGRA, and gives the tribes a fair opportunity to \n     enjoy this important economic development opportunity.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would first like to congratulate the Senator from Wyoming, Senator \nEnzi for his amendment and his work on this issue. In his comments he \nhas laid out a detailed and comprehensive analysis of the problem and \nhas stated plainly and with integrity and insight exactly how it is we \nought to deal with it.\n  Let me try to briefly share some thoughts I have on this matter. I \nwas attorney general of the State of Alabama. In this capacity I was \none of 25 attorneys general who signed, just over two years ago, a \nletter to the Secretary of the Interior indicating to him our firm \nconviction and legal opinion that he did not have the authority to \nenter into compacts with Indian tribes in the manner detailed in the \nproposed regulations he drafted. Let me tell you why that is very \nimportant.\n  Alabama has one recognized Indian tribe, the Poarch Band of Creek \nIndians, a very fine group. Chairman Tullis of that tribe is a friend, \nand I have known him for many years. We had occasions, when I served as \nFederal U.S. attorney, to work on a number of issues, and I have always \nadmired his commitment and work.\n  He has at that Indian tribe a large bingo parlor. They make a \nconsiderable amount of money on it. Under Alabama law the tribe has the \nability to build a horse racetrack or a dog racetrack. But under the \nlaw the tribe does not and has not been given the authority by the \nGovernor of the State of Alabama to build a casino. Alabama has debated \nthis repeatedly, and the casino advocates have failed.\n\n  Let me provide some further background on this Alabama example. In \nAlabama, the Poarch Creek tribe has about 2000 members, and it owns \nabout 600 acres of property. It has been recognized for less than 30 \nyears, and it is a small tribe. But they own property, near both \nMobile, AL, where their primary location is, and also near Wetumpka, \nAlabama. The city of Wetumpka is near Montgomery, AL, and is roughly \n180 miles away from Mobile. The tribe would like to build casinos \noutside of Mobile and outside of Montgomery and Birmingham, AL, in the \nlittle town of Wetumpka where they have property.\n  Do you see the significance of this? If the Secretary of the Interior \ncan override the opinion of the people of the State of Alabama and give \nthis Indian tribe the right to build casinos on their land, then they \ncould build at least two, maybe three casinos in Alabama and would, in \nfact, abrogate the considered will of the people of the State who have \nconsistently rejected casino gambling.\n  It is just that simple. This is not an insignificant matter. We are \ntalking about giving the Secretary of the Interior, who is now under \ninvestigation by a special prosecutor for campaign contributions \narising out of his approval of one Indian tribe's activities with \nregard to gambling, the unilateral authority to override the considered \nopinion of States all over this country. If\n\n[[Page S10364]]\n\nthis amendment doesn't pass we are talking about the Secretary of the \nInterior having the ability to enrich selected tribes by millions or \nhundreds of millions of dollars overnight by the stroke of a pen.\n  That is a powerful thing. You can raise a lot of campaign money with \nthat ability to do such a thing. I do not think it is healthy. The \nattorneys general association, the National Association of Attorneys \nGeneral, steadfastly opposes the regulations promulgated by the \nSecretary of Interior that would give him this ability, and strongly \nsupports the Enzi-Sessions amendment. Allowing the Secretary to have \nthis kind of power is wrong. He does not have the constitutional power \nto do it, first, in my opinion, yet he persists in suggesting that he \ndoes and is moving forward with regulations that appear to suggest that \nin fact he will.\n  So what is the first thing that is going to happen if the Secretary's \nregulations are enacted? Lawsuits are going to spring up all over the \ncountry attacking his authority to do this and cost all kinds of money. \nAnd we are going to continue with litigation involving it. I think \nultimately he is going to lose. But what we are saying is, let us not \ngo down that road; let us not do that.\n  Let me show you what the midsized city of Wetumpka feels about this \nissue. Wetumpka is a wonderful town. I have a number of friends there. \nThis is what the mayor, Jo Glenn, wrote me. She writes this:\n\n       Our infrastructure and police and fire departments could \n     not cope with the burdens this type of activity would bring. \n     [That is a casino.] The demand for greater social services \n     that comes to the area around gambling facilities could not \n     be adequately funded. Please once again convey to Secretary \n     Babbitt our city's strong adamant opposition to gaming \n     facilities.\n\n  The City of Wetumpka support this amendment. Additionally, the \nMontgomery Advertiser states in an editorial written opposing the \nSecretaries proposed regulations that:\n\n       Direct Federal negotiations with tribes without State \n     involvement would be an unjustifiably heavy-handed imposition \n     of authority on Alabama. The decision whether to allow \n     gambling here is too significant a decision economically, \n     politically, socially to be made in the absence of extensive \n     State involvement. A casino in Wetumpka--not to mention the \n     others undoubtedly that would follow in other parts of the \n     State--has implications far too great to allow the critical \n     decision to be reached in Washington. Alabama has to have a \n     hand in this high-stakes game.\n\n  Let me note that others have expressed similar objections to the \nSecretary's proposed regulations. Attorney General Robert Butterworth \nof Florida and Attorney General Gale Norton of Colorado have written \nexpressing support for this amendment. My successor as Attorney General \nof Alabama, Bill Pryor, who is a brilliant lawyer, Tulane graduate, \neditor-in-chief of the Tulane Law Review, and a fine legal scholar--\nsays:\n\n       Again, I strongly support the proposed amendment [Enzi-\n     Sessions]. I have no confidence that the Secretary listens \n     when the states tell him that he lacks the power to override \n     their Eleventh Amendment immunity and that he operates under \n     an incurable conflict of interest when he proposes to act \n     [himself] as a mediator. The proposed amendment is necessary \n     to stop further action on the Secretary's part.\n\n  His opinion is shared, as I mentioned, by the National Association of \nAttorneys General. A number of other attorneys general have written me \nto express that same position as well.\n  Mr. President, I say again, this is not a matter of theoretical \ndebate now. We are beyond that. It is a matter of real public policy. \nAnd if you allow every Indian reservation in America to overnight, or \nstep by step, tribe by tribe, after having to wine and dine the \nSecretary of the Interior and sweet-talk the Secretary of the Interior \nand the President and maybe making campaign contributions, to induce \nhim to approve gambling, then we are going to have one of the most \nmassive erosions of the public's ability to set social policy within \ntheir State we have ever seen. This is really a major event.\n  Senator Enzi's proposal is reasonable. I am proud to be a cosponsor \nwith him on it. It simply delays this thing so we can make sure we are \ndoing the right thing.\n  As to Senator Domenici's problem, I think that will need to be dealt \nwith specifically and not as part of this amendment. But I believe we \ncannot allow this amendment to fail. The Governors, the attorneys \ngeneral, groups like the Christian Coalition, and others, support this \namendment, because they recognize the negative consequences that arise \nfrom allowing the Secretary of Interior to exert this sort of power.\n  I again thank Senator Enzi for his leadership.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today, as I have in prior years, to \noppose the amendment proposed by my colleague, the Senator from \nWyoming, Senator Enzi.\n  Mr. President, I have had the privilege of serving on the Committee \non Indian Affairs for over 20 years. And I believe that in order to \nfully appreciate and understand the matter before us, a brief review of \nthe history of our relationship with Indian country might help, because \nover the course of those 20 years, I have learned a bit about the state \nof Indian country and the pervasive poverty which is both the remnant \nand result of too many years of failed Federal policies.\n  Mr. President, there was a time in our history when the native people \nof this land thrived. They lived in a state of optimum health. They \ntook from the land and the water only those resources that were \nnecessary to sustain their well-being. They were the first stewards of \nthe environment. And those who came later found this continent in \npristine condition because of their wise stewardship.\n  Even after the advent of European contact, most tribal groups \ncontinued their subsistence way of life. Their culture and their \nreligions sustained them. And, Mr. President, they had very \nsophisticated forms of government, so sophisticated and so clearly \nefficient and effective over many centuries that our Founding Fathers \ncould find no other better form of government upon which to structure \nthe government of a new nation, the United States of America.\n  So our Founding Fathers--Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson--adopted \nthe framework of the Iroquois Confederacy, a true democracy, and it is \nupon that foundation that we have built this great Nation. But, \nunfortunately, there came a time in our history when those in power \ndecided that the native people were an obstacle, an obstruction to the \nnew American way of life and later to the westward expansion of the \nUnited States.\n  So our Nation embarked upon a course of terminating the Indians by \nexterminating them through war and the distribution of blankets \ninfected with smallpox. We nearly succeeded in wiping them out. \nAnthropologists and historians estimate that there were anywhere from \n10 million to 50 million indigenous people occupying this continent at \nthe time of the European contact. By 1849, when the United States \nfinally declared an end to the era known as the Indian wars, we had \nmanaged to so efficiently decimate the Indian population that there \nwere a mere 250,000 native people remaining in the lower 48.\n\n  Having failed in that undertaking, we next proceeded to round up \nthose who survived, forcibly marched them away from their traditional \nlands, and across the country. Not surprisingly, these forced marches--\nand there were many of these trails of tears--further reduced the \nIndian population because many died along the way.\n  Later, we found the most inhospitable areas in the country on which \nto relocate the native people and expected them to scratch out a living \nthere. Of course, we made some promises along the way; that in exchange \nfor tribal lands in the millions of acres we would provide them with \neducation--at least we promised them education--health care and \nshelter.\n  We told them, often in solemn treaties, that these new lands would be \ntheirs in perpetuity. There are many wonderful treaties in our \narchives, some that begin with phrases:\n\n       As long as the sun rises in the East and sets in the West, \n     and waters flow from the mountain tops to the sea, this land \n     is yours.\n\n  We promised them that their traditional way of life would be \nprotected from encroachment by non-Indians and that we would recognize \ntheir inherent right as sovereigns to retain all powers of government \nnot relinquished. Their rights to hunt, fish, gather food, to use\n\n[[Page S10365]]\n\nthe waters that were necessary to sustain life, were also recognized as \npreserved in perpetuity for their use.\n  But over the years, these promises and others were broken by our \nNational Government, and our vacillations in policies, of which there \nwere many, left most reservation communities in economic ruin.\n  It grieves me to repeat this, but there were 800 treaties solemnly \nentered into by the Government of the United States and the leaders of \nIndian country--800. It was the responsibility of this body, the U.S. \nSenate, to ratify these treaties. Mr. President, 430 of them were \nignored. They lie in our files at this moment; 370 were ratified by the \nU.S. Senate. And of the 370, we proceeded to violate every single one \nof them.\n  The cumulative effects of our treatment of the native people of this \nland have proven to be nearly fatal to them. Poverty in Indian country \nis unequal anywhere else in the United States. The desperation and \ndespair that inevitably accompanies the economic devastation that is \nfound today in Indian country accounts for the astronomically high \nrates of suicide and mortality from diseases. For Indian youth between \nthe ages of 18 and 25, the rate of suicide is 14 times the national \nnorm of the United States.\n  Within this context, along came an opportunity for some tribal \ngovernments to explore the economic potential of gaming. It didn't \nprove to be a panacea, but it began to bring in revenues that tribal \ncommunities didn't have before. Then the State of California entered \nthis picture by bringing a legal action against the Cabazon Band of \nMission Indians, a case that ultimately made its way to the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Consistent with 150 years of Federal law and constitutional \nprinciples, the Supreme Court ruled that the State of California could \nnot exercise its jurisdiction on Indian lands to regulate gaming \nactivities.\n  This was in May of 1987. In the aftermath of the Supreme Court's \nruling, we got into the act, the Congress of the United States. During \nthe 100th session of the Congress, I found myself serving as the \nprimary sponsor of what is now known as the Indian Gaming Regulatory \nAct of 1988. There were many, many hearings and many, many drafts \nleading up to the formulation of the bill that was ultimately signed \ninto law.\n  Initially, our inclination was to follow the well-established and \ntime-honored model of Federal Indian law which was to provide for an \nexclusively Federal presence in the regulation of gaming activities on \nIndian lands. The Constitution and the laws of our land say the \nrelationship will be between the Federal Government and the Indian \ngovernment. Such a framework would have been consistent with \nconstitutional principles, with the majority of our Federal statutes \naddressing Indian country, and would have reflected the fact that as a \ngeneral proposition, it is Federal law, along with tribal law, that \ngoverns most all of what may transpire in Indian country.\n  But State government officials--Governors, attorneys general--came to \nthe Congress, demanding that a role in the regulation of Indian gaming \nbe shared with them. Ultimately, we acquiesced to those demands. After \nmuch thought, many hearings, much debate, the Congress of the United \nStates selected a mechanism that has become customary in dealings \namongst sovereign governments.\n  This mechanism, a compact between a State government and a tribal \ngovernment, would be recognized by the Federal Government as the \nagreement between two sovereigns as to how the conduct of gaming on \nIndian lands would proceed.\n  The Federal participation in the agreement would be accomplished when \nthe Secretary of the Interior approved the tribal-State compact as part \nof the law. In an effort to ensure that the parties would come to the \ntable and negotiate a compact in good faith, and in order to provide \nfor the possibility that the parties might not reach agreement, we also \nprovided a means by which the parties could seek the involvement of the \nFederal district court, and if ordered by the court, could avail \nthemselves of a mediation process. It is not for the Indian leaders to \ndetermine whether the process is being carried out in good or bad \nfaith.\n  The court will decide that, and the court is not an Indian court. It \nis the district court of the United States of America. That judicial \nremedy and the potential for mediated solution when the parties find \nthemselves at an impasse has subsequently been frustrated by the ruling \nof the Supreme Court upholding the 11th amendment, the amendment that \nprovides immunity to the several States of the Union.\n  Thus, while there are some who have consistently maintained that \nsovereign immunity is an anachronism in contemporary times, in this \narea at least, the States still jealously guard their sovereign \nimmunity to suit in the courts of another sovereign.\n  In so doing, the States have presented us with a clear conflict, \nwhich we have been trying to resolve for several years.\n  Although 24 of the 28 States that have Indian reservations within \ntheir boundaries have now entered into 159 tribal-state compacts with \n148 tribal governments, there are a few States in which tribal-state \ncompacts have not been reached.\n  And the conflict we are challenged with resolving is how to \naccommodate the desire of these States to be involved in the regulation \nof Indian gaming and their equally strong desire to avoid any process \nwhich might enable the parties to overcome an impasse in their \nnegotiations.\n  The Secretary of the Interior is to be commended in his efforts to \nachieve what the Congress has been unable to accomplish in the past few \nyears.\n  Following the Supreme Court's 11th amendment ruling, the Secretary \ntook a reasonable course of action.\n  He published a notice of proposed rulemaking, inviting comments on \nhis authority to promulgate regulations for an alternative process to \nthe tribal-state compacting process established in the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act.\n  Thereafter, he followed the next appropriate steps under the \nAdministrative Procedures Act, inviting the input of all interested \nparties in the promulgation of regulations.\n  When the Senate acted to prohibit him from proceeding in this time-\nhonored fashion, he brought together representatives of the National \nGovernors Association, the National Association of Attorneys General, \nand the Tribal Governments, to explore whether a consensus could be \nreached on these and other matters.\n  In fact, a working group of those interests will be meeting this week \nin Denver to pursue the Secretary's initiative.\n  In the meantime, my colleagues propose an amendment that would not \nonly prohibit the Secretary from proceeding with the regulatory \nprocess, but which would prevent those State and tribal governments \nthat desire to enter into a compact from securing the necessary Federal \napproval.\n  By the latter formulation, my colleagues would federally pre-empt \nwhat is otherwise the prerogatives of sovereign governments--namely the \nState and tribal governments--to pursue that which is their right under \nFederal law and their right as sovereigns.\n  Once again, there have been no hearings on this proposal--no public \nconsideration of this formulation--no input from the governments \ninvolved and directly affected by this proposal.\n  Last year, the Secretary of the Department of the Interior made clear \nhis intention to recommend a veto of the Interior appropriations bill \nshould this provision be adopted by the Senate, and approved in House-\nSenate Conference.\n  I would suggest that it is unlikely that the Secretary's position has \nchanged in any material respect--particularly in light of all that he \nhas undertaken to accomplish, including frank discussion amongst the \nState and tribal governments.\n  As one who initiated a similar discussion process several years ago, \nI am more than a little familiar with the issues that require \nresolution.\n  However, in the intervening years, court rulings have clarified and \nput to rest many of the issues that were in contention in that earlier \nprocess.\n  I have continued to talk to Governors and attorneys general and \ntribal government leaders on a weekly if not daily basis, and I \nbelieve, as the Secretary does, that the potential is there for the \nState and tribal governments to come to some mutually-acceptable \nresolution of the matters that remain outstanding between them.\n\n[[Page S10366]]\n\n  I believe the Secretary's process should be allowed to proceed.\n  I also believe that pre-empting that process through an amendment to \nthis bill could well serve as the death knell for what is ultimately \nthe only viable way to accomplish a final resolution.\n  The alternative is to proceed in this piecemeal fashion each year--an \namendment each year to prohibit the Secretary from taking any action \nthat would bridge the gap in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that was \ncreated by the Court's ruling and which will inevitably discourage the \nState and tribal governments from fashioning solutions.\n  This is not the way to do the business of the people.\n  There are those in this body who are opposed to gaming.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I count myself in their numbers. I am \nopposed to gaming.\n  Hawaii and Utah are the only two States in our union that criminally \nprohibit all forms of gaming, and I support that prohibition in my \nState. We don't have bingo or poker.\n  Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I have walked many miles \nin Indian country, and I have seen the poverty, and the desperation and \ndespair in the eyes of many Indian parents and their children.\n  I have looked into the eyes of the elders--eyes that express great \nsadness.\n  I have met young Indian people who are now dead because they saw no \nhope for the future.\n  I have seen what gaming has enabled tribal governments to do, for the \nfirst time--to build hospitals and clinics, to repair and construct \nsafe schools, to provide jobs for the adults and educational \nopportunities for the youth--and perhaps most importantly, to engender \na real optimism that there can be and will be--the prospects for a \nbrighter future.\n  It is for these reasons, and because of their rights as sovereigns to \npursue activities that hold the potential for making their tribal \neconomies become both viable and stable over the long term, that I \nsupport Indian gaming.\n  If our country--this great Nation--had followed the provisions in our \ntreaties and abided with our promises, then there would be no need for \nme to be supporting Indian gaming.\n  Mr. President, it is for these reasons, that I must, again this year, \nstrongly oppose the efforts of my colleagues to take from Indian \ncountry, what unfortunately has become the single ray of hope for the \nfuture that native people have had for a very long time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Enzi amendment \nwhich restricts the Secretary of Interior's ability to move forward \nwith a rule that would supplant a state's ability to decide what types \nof gaming activities would be permissible on Indian lands.\n  The proposed rule, announced by the Secretary in January, circumvents \nCongress' role in deciding the framework for regulating Indian gaming.\n  Congress is the best body to lay out the process for establishing the \nbalanced framework for tribal state negotiations over Indian gaming.\n  The proposed rule would upset the necessary balance and invest in the \nSecretary an exceptional amount of authority in deciding the outcome of \nthese negotiations. Its effect would be the expansion of Indian Gaming \nnotwithstanding the objections of a state.\n  This Enzi amendment is simple and fair. It simply restricts the \nInterior Secretary from promulgating as final regulations a rule that \nwould allow him to decide whether a state is negotiating with a tribe \nin good faith; and which types of gaming activities a state must accept \non tribal lands.\n  There is a long history to this issue and it is something that the \nGovernors feel quite strongly about.\n  In fact, on July 23, the National Governor's Association wrote \nSenators Lott and Daschle encouraging the Senate to support passage of \nthe Enzi amendment.\n  As the letter states:\n\n       The nation's governors strongly believe that no statute or \n     court decision provides the Secretary . . . with authority to \n     intervene in disputes over compacts between Indian tribes and \n     states about casino gambling on Indian lands. Such action \n     would constitute an attempt by the Secretary to preempt \n     states' authority under existing laws and recent court \n     decisions and would create a incentive for tribes to avoid \n     negotiating gambling compacts with states.\n\n  What this issue is about is states rights and whether this Congress \nis going to give the Secretary of Interior--who has fiduciary and trust \nresponsibilities to the tribes--the authority to dictate to states \nwhich gaming activities they must accept.\n  I do not believe we are prepared for the unfettered proliferation of \nIndian gaming.\n  The Supreme Court, in the Seminole decision, did great harm to what \nwe sought to do when we enacted IGRA.\n  The courts have made a mess of the compacting process we put in place \nin 1986.\n  The result is that we are now faced with the dilemma of (1) who must \ndecide whether or not a state is negotiating in good faith; and (2), \nwhat types of gaming activities is a state required to negotiate over.\n  As the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs said in his April 1st \ntestimony before the Indian Affairs Committee: ``Any attempts [to \ndecide] this issue administratively is certain to draw court challenges \nand for that reason, we would prefer legislation.\n  Secretary Gover is right, a decision of this import should not be \nleft entirely in the hands of a federal official who is statutorily \nbiased against a state.\n  The Department of Interior is responsible for administering IGRA--not \nreauthorizing it.\n  Last year's Interior Appropriation's bill--which the President \nsigned--included a similar provision that prevented the Secretary from \napproving class III (casino styled) compacts.\n  The Secretary's decision in January evidenced the Department's intent \nto disregard the clear congressional intent of last year's bill.\n  This issue should be resolved legislatively and the Enzi amendment \nwill ensure that solution. It will do so in a manner that is respectful \nof state's rights.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Enzi \namendment. It is quite simple, but I would like to briefly restate the \neffect of the amendment in order to frame my remarks. The amendment \nwould prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from promulgating new \nregulations empowering the Secretary to approve class III gambling \nactivities without State approval.\n  Mr. President, as a result of the Supreme Court ruling in the \nSeminole of Florida versus the State of Florida, and subsequent \nactivities by the Secretary of the Interior, we are confronted with a \nsituation where an unelected federal official, using the rulemaking \nprocess, is seeking to empower himself with the ability to supersede \nthe authority of the popularly elected State government, and to impose \nIndian gambling activity on an unwilling State.\n  Mr. President, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act attempted to \nconstruct a delicate balance, the intent of which was to provide a \ndefinitive role for the States in determining whether to allow the \nintroduction of new gambling activities. The Court's ruling has upset \nthis balance.\n  During debate over the fiscal year 1998 funding measure, a similar \nmeasure to the one we are debating today was adopted. It was adopted \nwith the understanding that congressional action was needed in order to \naddress this concern, as well as others, with IGRA. However, no action \nhas yet been taken. And thus, we have the need to extend this \nmoratorium.\n  Now, what does all of this mean to the individual States? The \ndistinguished Senator from Wyoming has already placed into the Record \nthe various letters of support from the nation's governors, and states \nattorneys general. I will let that support speak for itself. I would \nlike to relate the experience of the State of Indiana.\n  I have here an article from the Indianapolis Star. The article \ndocuments the latest development in a struggle that has been on-going \nin Northern Indiana for several years now. The article begins: \n``Potawatomi tribe buys land near Indiana town; A reservation would be \nOK, resident says, but many fear a casino would eventually follow.''\n  The article goes on to describe that; ``The Pokagon Band of the \nPotawatomi Indians acquired land in Indiana, the first step toward \nestablishing a reservation and casino in the State.'' A spokesperson \nfor the tribe points out in this article that they intend to do\n\n[[Page S10367]]\n\nmany important things with the land they have purchased; provide \nhousing, schools, and a health clinic. However, she goes on to point \nout that a land-based casino in Indiana is among the tribe's eventual \ngoals.\n  The Pokagons have been attempting for several years now to purchase \nland in the area. However, they have met with significant resistance \nfrom local landowners and community leaders for fear that casinos would \nfollow any land sale. In fact, over the past 2 years, the town counsel \nof North Liberty, the town adjacent to the land purchase, has \nunanimously passed two resolutions in opposition to casino gambling. \nFurther, the Governor of Indiana has announced his opposition to Indian \ngambling amid public outcries against the proposition.\n  Yet, Mr. President, under the rules proposed by the Secretary, the \nwill of the people of North Liberty, of the elected representatives of \nthe State of Indiana, would be laid to waste by an unelected federal \nofficial. By any interpretation of IGRA, this was not the intention of \nCongress in passing the law.\n  The gambling industry is booming. In 1988, only two states (Nevada \nand New Jersey) permitted casino gambling. By 1994, 23 states had \nlegalized gambling. During this time, casino gambling revenue nearly \ndoubled. In 1993, $400 billion was spent on all forms of legal gambling \nin America Between 1992 and 1994, the gambling industry enjoyed an \nincredible 15 percent annual growth in revenues.\n  Many of my colleagues would look at this performance and say ``good \nfor them.'' Many would cite the gambling industry as an American \nsuccess story. I am not so enthusiastic. There are many unanswered \nquestions regarding the hidden costs of rolling out the welcome mat for \nthe gambling industry. Many of the promises made by the gambling \nindustry--of jobs, economic growth, and increased tax revenues--are \ndubious at best. The statistics on the devastating impact on our \nfamilies are beginning to roll in. Concern about teenage gambling \naddiction is growing as more and more teens are lured by the promise of \neasy money. Crime and suicide numbers are sky-rocketing in communities \nwhere gambling has taken root.\n  The National Gambling Impact Study Commission is currently studying \nthis issue. By passing this resolution, we will create the necessary \ntime to modify IGRA to ensure the law is clear in protecting the rights \nof the individual states. It will allow the states to determine how and \nwhen gambling operations will begin or expand within their borders, and \nto look to the report to the Gambling Commission for help in making \nthose decisions.\n  I commend the efforts of the Senators from Wyoming and Alabama in \nbringing this issue before the Senate, and urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the Indianapolis Star \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Indianapolis Star Sept. 2, 1998]\n\n Potawatomi Tribe Buys Land Near Indiana Town; a Reservation Would be \n   OK. Resident Says, But Many Fear a Casino Would Eventually Follow\n\n                             (By Don Ward)\n\n       North Liberty, Ind.--The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians \n     has acquired land in Indiana, the first step toward \n     establishing a reservation and casino in the state.\n       The 2,600-member tribe, which is based in Michigan, \n     acknowledged this week that it has bought 135 acres along \n     Ind. 4 near North Liberty.\n       ``This is a significant first step, but not necessarily \n     toward getting a casino,'' Pokagon spokeswoman Maureen \n     Shagonaby said Tuesday.\n       ``Our overall goal is, an always has been, to establish a \n     land base to provide housing, schools and a health clinic for \n     our members. But unfortunately, everyone thinks all we're \n     interested in is a casino.'' Shagonaby confirmed the tribe \n     also is considering the purchase of 900 acres adjacent to the \n     135-acre tract.\n       The site is about 15 miles south of South Bend and Elkhart, \n     where the Pokagon faced fierce opposition as tribal officials \n     scouted for land.\n       But the tribe also has faced opposition here.\n       North Liberty, whose downtown extends only about a half-\n     mile and has a population of 1,360, was targeted by the \n     Pokagons as a possible reservation site as early as 1996.\n       Since then, the Town Council has unanimously passed two \n     resolutions against casinos.\n       ``We're not against the Pokagons coming into the area to \n     live and raise children, but it they want to bring in a \n     casino, I'm not for that type of industry,'' said beauty \n     salon owner Kelly Prentkowski, 32. ``Our town is not about \n     profit and gain.''\n       Shagonaby conceded that a land-based casino in Indiana is \n     among the tribe's eventual goals but said, ``There's no time \n     line for it. That's a decision the tribal council will \n     make.''\n       Last year, during the town's bitter debate over casinos, \n     groups gathered signatures on petitions both for and against \n     the gambling facilities. But City Clerk Paul Williams said he \n     couldn't remember which group brought in more signatures. \n     Many names were duplicates, he said.\n       Many residents thought the issue was dead until this week, \n     when they learned of the tribe's deal to buy the tract, \n     located near a golf course and the Kankakee River just \n     northwest of town.\n       A casino supporter, Greg Shortt, 33, quickly organized a \n     news conference and invited Pokagon representatives to \n     discuss their plans.\n       Shortt, who lives in Plymouth but runs a package liquor \n     store on North Liberty's main street, is president of the 2-\n     year-old citizen group ``Pro Casino.'' ``North Liberty is \n     already a tourist town because we've got Pokagon State Park, \n     and a casino would be added value for our town,'' he said.\n       Casino opponents say they fear increased traffic would \n     negatively affect the rural town and that a casino would do \n     nothing for local businesses.\n       ``We don't need 10,000 people and tour buses driving in and \n     out of town every day,'' said Marian Spitzke, 51. ``They're \n     not going to stop and shop or eat here. They'll just go right \n     to the casino and then leave.''\n       Ted Stepanek, 70, owner of the town barber shop, said, \n     ``I'm not against gambling--I just don't want it here.''\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to support the Enzi-\nSessions amendment which ensures that the Secretary of Interior does \nnot circumvent Congress and the States in gaming on Indian lands. It \nwould also extend the moratorium on expansion of gambling on tribal \nlands.\n  The growth of the gambling industry in this country in recent years \nhas been explosive. Twenty years ago, only two States allowed casino \ngambling. Today, the industry reins in $40 billion each year in 23 \nStates and generates revenues that are six times the revenue from all \nAmerican spectator sports combined. The amount of money wagered \nannually in the United States exceeds $500 billion.\n  It concerns me that this explosive growth in the gambling industry \nhas taken place during the same time period that so many other aspects \nof our culture have declined. Two years ago, Congress enacted PL-104-\n169, which established the National Gambling Impact and Policy \nCommission for the purpose of studying the social and economic impact \nof gambling and reporting its findings to Congress. I supported that \nlegislation. In fact, not one member in either the House nor the Senate \nrose in opposition to that legislation. This I believe, illustrates the \nneed Congress has to gather more information on the implications of the \nextraordinary growth of the gaming industry. Until the findings of the \nCommission are available to guide the actions of Congress, I simply \nbelieve that it is reasonable for Congress to not take any action that \nmay proliferate a problem in our society until the ramifications are \nbetter understood.\n  The problems correlated with gambling are serious. Increased family \nviolence, child abuse, suicide, white collar crime, alcohol abuse, \nprostitution, drug activities, and organized crime have all been linked \nto gambling. Furthermore, I am concerned about the destructive societal \nimpact of compulsive gamblers. Compulsive gamblers will bet their \nentire savings and anything of value that can be sold or borrowed \nagainst while neglecting family responsibilities to pursue the short-\nlived thrill of betting. They are more likely to abuse their spouses \nand their children, and most have contemplated suicide. Compounding \nthese problems, there is speculation that the gambling industry \nactually targets these vulnerable individuals as well as another \nfaction of vulnerable individuals--the poor.\n  And, the economic benefits promised to communities which open their \ndoors to gambling are often exaggerated. On the contrary, some \nmunicipalities have found that casinos flourished at the expense of \nexisting businesses, and that the incidences of theft and larceny \nincreased.\n\n[[Page S10368]]\n\n  In fact, I would like to submit for the record an article which was \nprinted in the Topeka Capitol-Journal on April 28, 1998. The article \nchronicles the difficulties that two Northeast Kansas counties are \nfacing as a result of two Indian casinos recently established within \nthe counties. This year, the local State Representative appealed to the \nState legislature to provide a special financial grant to deal with \nrising law enforcement and social service costs. Since one casino \nopened, the number of arrests in that county for driving under the \ninfluence, possession of drug paraphernalia, and possession of \nmarijuana has increased sharply. The sheriff says there has been an \n``explosion'' in criminal cases of forgery, narcotics abuse, possession \nof stolen property, and worthless checks. Even more troubling is that \nwhen the counties asked the owners of the casinos to help reimburse the \ncounties for the increased law enforcement costs, the tribes refused. \nThis is an example of how the economic development brought about by the \ntribes has been a drain, not a boon, to the local government and \neconomy.\n  Yet, while I have qualms about the possible destructive effects of \ngambling, I recognize that many will maintain that these claims are \nspeculative and dispute that there is a conclusive link between \ngambling and increased crime. This is why I think we need to receive \nthe Commission's report before allowing any new facilities to be \nestablished. The National Gaming Impact Study Commission itself agrees, \nas does the National Governor's Association and the Christian \nCoalition.\n  Mr. President, I do not want my views to be construed as opposition \nto the chance for economically deprived Indian nations to bring needed \neconomic activity to their communities. On the contrary, I commend the \nefforts to generate income and become more self-sufficient in view of \ndecreasing Federal aid. I think that it is a positive thing that tribes \nare striving to provide employment, health care, housing, and other \nimportant services without Federal assistance.\n  However, even the benefits of gaming to the tribes themselves is a \nquestion. Typical problems are a direct result of disorganized, \nfractionalized, and historically poor communities and their lack of \nexperience in managing large sums of money. Unfortunately, the lack of \nunderstanding of what the management of gaming facilities entails has \nspelled disaster for a large number of tribes. Furthermore, signs of \nincreased crime are seen on the tribal lands, too. Economic development \nthat invites destructive behavior is not sustainable and is not a \nhealthy way to provide for social services to a community.\n  This amendment takes a moderate approach. it does not ban Indian \ngaming and does not affect gaming compacts which already are \noperational or already have been approved. It simply places prohibits \nthe Secretary from approving any new Tribal-State compacts. It also \nprohibits the Secretary from promulgating rules that are designed to \ncircumvent Congress and all 50 States until Congress better understands \nthe societal ramifications of the Federal Government's actions to \napprove gambling, and I believe this is a reasonable approach to take.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to briefly make a few comments in \nstrong support of the amendment. I do so not because it will assist my \nState of Minnesota, which already has an established gaming compact \nwith Minnesota Indian tribes, but because this is an issue of \nfundamental fairness for States and localities.\n  I find it difficult to understand how anybody can argue that the \nSecretary of the Interior should be given the authority to approve a \nclass III gaming compact, absent the consent of the State in which the \ngaming is to occur. States must, I believe, have the authority to \nnegotiate and object to gaming compacts. If you remove their right to \nobject to a gaming compact, then you remove their right to negotiate a \ngaming compact as well.\n  Similar to what now happens in trust applications, the tribal \nauthority will have little incentive for negotiating in good faith, \nknowing that the Secretary of the Interior can come in and improve \ntheir compact and bypass the State anyway.\n  Our States and localities are much too often becoming irrelevant in \nthe decisionmaking process of the Department of the Interior when \nconsidering tribal-related situations.\n  The amendment we are addressing here today prevents a Secretary of \nthe Interior from ignoring the impact of gaming operations on States \nand localities and from circumventing their authority and making \nunilateral decisions.\n  Mr. President, States must have the right to negotiate gaming \ncompacts without undue interference from the Federal Government and \nwithout the heavy hand of an overactive Secretary of the Interior \nwaiting to usurp that authority.\n  Again, the Enzi-Sessions amendment has the support of the National \nGovernors' Association, the National Organization of Attorneys General, \nand the Christian Coalition.\n  The amendment extends the current moratorium placed on the Secretary \nof the Interior from using Federal funds to approve tribal-State \ncompacts, again, without the consent of the States. It doesn't only \nprevent Secretary Babbitt from moving forward on new regulations but in \nfact gives him authority to bypass State approval.\n  So I urge my colleagues to stand up for the rights of our States by \nsupporting the Enzi-Sessions amendment.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank everybody involved for all of the \ngreat discussion this afternoon.\n  I feel compelled to answer some of the questions that were raised \nduring the course of the debate.\n  I would like to particularly thank Senator Sessions and all of the \nother cosponsors who are on the bill cosponsoring the amendment with \nme.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Sessions for the comments on \nbehalf of attorneys general, since he is a former attorney general from \nAlabama.\n  He gave me copies of letters. One is from my own attorney general, \nWilliam Hill of Wyoming; another is from Mark Barnett of South Dakota; \nanother is from Bill Pryor of Alabama; another individual letter is \nfrom Mr. Gale Norton, attorney general of Colorado; another is from the \nHonorable Carla Stovall, Topeka, KS; another letter is from Robert \nButterworth of the State of Florida; another is from Don Stenberg of \nthe State of Nebraska; another is from Frank Kelley of the State of \nMichigan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                      Cheyenne, WY, July 28, 1998.\n     Re Enzi/Sessions Amendment to Interior Appropriations Bill.\n     Chairman Slade Gorton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Ranking Member Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senators Gorton and Byrd: This office is writing in \n     support of and urges the adoption of the Indian gaming \n     amendment to the Interior Department Appropriations Bill \n     sponsored by Senator Michael B. Enzi and Senator Jeff \n     Sessions. Last year's Interior Appropriations Bill contained \n     a provision establishing a moratorium on implementation of \n     proposed procedures by the Secretary of the Interior to \n     permit tribal gaming where a state and a tribe reach an \n     impasse in negotiations and no tribal/state compact is \n     entered into. The Enzi/Sessions amendment would extend that \n     moratorium.\n       This office believes that the Secretary of the Interior \n     lacks statutory authority to use the proposed procedures and \n     must seek amendment of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act for \n     this authority. To this end, numerous state attorneys general \n     and governors have initiated negotiations with the Secretary \n     and the Indian tribes in an effort to reach agreement on \n     amendments to the Act. Preliminary discussions are currently \n     taking place in preparation for a meeting at which all \n     interests will be represented, probably sometime between now \n     and November, 1998.\n       Continuation of the moratorium will avert the need for \n     costly and prolonged litigation over the Secretary's \n     authority and will allow for meaningful discussions \n     concerning amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act \n     which will benefit the Secretary, the tribes and the states.\n\n[[Page S10369]]\n\n       Thank you for your support of the Enzi/Sessions Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  William U.

Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Slade Gorton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senators: I am writing this letter in support of the \n     amendment of Senators Enzi and Sessions to S. 2237, the \n     Interior appropriations bill. This amendment would continue a \n     provision included in last year's Interior appropriations act \n     which established a moratorium on implementation of \n     procedures by the Secretary of the Interior to permit tribal \n     gaming when a state and tribe stall in negotiations and the \n     state asserts sovereign immunity in court proceedings.\n       It is my view that the Secretary plainly lacks statutory \n     authority for the proposed procedures. A detailed letter to \n     the Secretary of the Interior has set out the views of \n     twenty-five attorneys general that the Secretary lacks such \n     authority. I believe, as do the other attorneys general, that \n     the Secretary must seek statutory amendments to the Indian \n     Gaming Regulatory Act to achieve the authority he asserts and \n     I join with the other attorneys general in encouraging the \n     Secretary to engage in a dialogue with the states and the \n     tribes on this matter.\n       I appreciate your consideration of the moratorium amendment \n     to Senate Bill 2237.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     Mark Barnett,\n     Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                    Montgomery, AL, July 23, 1998.\n     Re Proposed Enzi-Sessions Amendment to Interior \n         Appropriations Bill.\n     Senator Slade Gorton,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Senator Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n       Gentlemen: I write to register my strong support for an \n     amendment to the Department of the Interior appropriations \n     bill proposed by your colleagues, Senators Enzi, Sessions, \n     Lugar, Brownback, Ashcroft, and Grams. That amendment would \n     continue the moratorium imposed in last year's bill on the \n     Secretary's implementation of procedures that would empower \n     the Secretary to allow tribal gaming when a tribe and a state \n     stall in negotiations and the state asserts its Eleventh \n     Amendment immunity in court proceedings.\n       I believe that the Secretary lacks the statutory authority \n     to propose procedures that would have the effects of \n     abrogating the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity and \n     compelling the states to negotiate with Indian tribes \n     regarding the permissible scope of Class III gaming. Several \n     state Attorneys General provided comments to this effect in \n     1996 when the Secretary published his Advance Notice of \n     Proposed Rulemaking. The Attorneys General repeated their \n     objections to the Secretary's proposed course of action in \n     June 1998 when they submitted comments on Interior's Proposed \n     Regulations. Notwithstanding the presence of a moratorium, \n     the Secretary continues to propose expanding his authority in \n     this area. The amendment that your colleagues have proposed \n     would make clear the limits on the Secretary's authority to \n     abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n       Again, I strongly support the proposed amendment. I have no \n     confidence that the Secretary listens when the states tell \n     him that he lacks the power to override their Eleventh \n     Amendment immunity and that he operates under an incurable \n     conflict of interest when he proposes to act as a mediator. \n     The proposed amendment is necessary to stop further action on \n     the Secretary's part. Continuing the moratorium on action by \n     the Secretary will allow negotiations between the attorneys \n     general and the tribes to continue and will preclude a \n     lawsuit by one or more states against the Secretary. Such an \n     expensive and protracted lawsuit is almost certain in the \n     event the Secretary continues on his present course.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                       Bill Pryor,\n     Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n         State of Colorado, Department of Law, Office of the \n           Attorney General,\n                                        Denver, CO, July 24, 1998.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Enzi and Sessions: I write in support of your \n     proposed amendment to S. 2237, the Interior Appropriations \n     legislation.\n       I believe that the moratorium concerning the Secretary's \n     regulations regarding Indian gaming should remain in place \n     during the coming fiscal year. Continuation of the moratorium \n     will avoid the need for costly and prolonged litigation over \n     the Secretary's administrative authority and encourage a \n     meaningful dialogue about amendments to the IGRA which would \n     benefit the Secretary, the tribes and the states.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gale A.

Slade Gorton,\n     Chairman, Interior Subcommittee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     Ranking Member, Interior Subcommittee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senators Gorton and Byrd: I am writing in support of \n     the Enzi-Sessions proposed amendment to the Interior \n     Appropriations Bill.\n       On behalf of the State of Kansas, I joined several other \n     Attorneys General in opposing the Department of Interior's \n     proposed regulations establishing an administrative means by \n     which Indian Tribes may bypass the compacting process set \n     forth in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), 25 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 2701 et seq. In the IGRA, Congress has provided \n     that States should have a specific role in that process. I \n     and other Attorneys General believe that the Secretary has no \n     legal authority to rewrite the IGRA as has been proposed in \n     those regulations. Such a task is obviously the province of \n     Congress.\n       Whiel I am confident that the courts would agree with my \n     position regarding the Secretary/Department's lack of \n     authority to promulgate these regulations, the Enzi-Sessions \n     amendment would avoid the need to litigate the issue before \n     Congress has the opportunity to consider whether IGRA should \n     be so amended. I therefore support the Enzi-Sessions \n     amendment.\n       As a matter of background, the State of Kansas has entered \n     into Compacts for Class III, i.e., casino gaming with the \n     four resident Tribes. The existing compacting process in the \n     IGRA worked for us. The State and the Tribes negotiated in \n     good faith, believing that these were the only four Tribes \n     with Indian lands within the State that could be used for \n     Indian gaming purposes.\n       Since completing our compacting process with the four known \n     Kansas Tribes, the State has been approached by numerous \n     other Tribes interested in gaming revenues; these Tribes \n     assert various ``claims'' to land in the State, thus \n     evidencing a very real need to ensure that the compacting \n     process remains neutral so the State is not arbitrarily \n     forced by the Secretary acting as a sponsor to Indian Tribes \n     into additional gaming that was never envisioned by the IGRA.\n       Moreover, the Secretary's proposed regulations not only \n     adversely affect the interest of States, but also pit Indian \n     Tribes against each other. For example, the four resident \n     Tribes in Kansas have a strong interest in ensuring that they \n     recover on their significant investment in developing gaming \n     within the State, an interest which is adversely affected by \n     the gaming ambitions of new, non-resident Tribes.\n       I am willing to meet with the Department, Tribal, and State \n     representatives to seek agreement on amendments to the IGRA \n     that will address the concerns of Tribes with regard to the \n     compacting process, but I am opposed to any unilateral effort \n     on the part of the Department to usurp the authority of \n     Congress as the proposed regulations have done.\n       Thank you for your favorable consideration of this \n     amendment.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                 Carla J. Stovall,\n     Attorney General of Kansas.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Office of Attorney General,\n\n                                  State of Florida, July 24, 1998.\n     Re amendment to Interior appropriations bill sponsored by \n         Sens. Enzi, Sessions, Lugar, Brownback, and Grams.\n\n     Hon. Slade Gorton,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, D.C.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, D.C.\n\n       Dear Senators Gorton and Byrd: I am writing this letter to \n     voice my support for the Interior Appropriations amendment \n     sponsored by Senators Enzi, Sessions, Lugar, Brownback, and \n     Grams. The purpose of this amendment is to prohibit \n     specifically the final adoption of rules by the Department of \n     the Interior regarding Indian gambling.\n       These proposed rules are an outgrowth of the Seminole Tribe \n     decision of the Supreme Court and represents an attempt to \n     legislate a remedy for Indian Tribes in the absence of \n     statutory authority. My views, and those of twenty four other \n     Attorneys General, are set forth in detail in our letter of \n     June 19 to Secretary Babbitt commenting on the proposed \n     regulations. In short, we feel that there is no statutory \n     authority for the Department to adopt such rules and that the \n     rules are fundamentally flawed because, in those rules, the \n     Secretary arrogates to himself the authority to determine \n     whether the State has negotiated in good faith and what the \n     proper scope of gambling on Indian reservations should be \n     based on his interpretation of State law.\n\n[[Page S10370]]\n\n       In conclusion, I wholly support the efforts of the sponsors \n     of the subject amendment. We are currently attempting to \n     negotiate a consensus amendment to the Indian Gaming \n     Regulatory Act that will obviate the perceived need for such \n     regulations and I believe that the proposed Appropriations \n     amendment will help those negotiations along by lessening by \n     the pressure on the parties and avoiding litigation over the \n     validity of the regulations.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n       Sincerely,\n                                            Robert A.

The Secretary of the Interior should not be \n     allowed to authorize types of gambling on Indian reservations \n     when that gambling would be illegal if conducted anywhere \n     else within the state.\n       It is my opinion that the Secretary of the Interior lacks \n     any statutory authority to permit tribal gaming where a state \n     and a tribe stall in negotiations and the state asserts \n     sovereign immunity in court proceedings. Your proposed \n     legislation will support this position.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                     Don Stenberg,\n     Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                State of Michigan,\n\n\n                               Department of Attorney General,\n\n                                       Lansing, MI, July 31, 1998.\n     Hon. Mike Enzi,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: Currently there are tribal-state \n     compacts between the State of Michigan and seven Indian \n     tribes, each of which received federal recognition prior to \n     the effective date of IGRA. Since conclusion of these seven \n     compacts, federal recognition has been extended to four \n     additional Indian tribes. Litigation initiated in federal \n     court against the State of Michigan under IGRA by one of \n     these newly recognized tribes was successfully defended on \n     Eleventh Amendment grounds resulting in entry of an August \n     23, 1996 order of dismissal in Little River Band of Ottawa \n     Indians, et al v. State of Michigan, U.S. District Court, \n     Western District, No. 5:96-CV-119.\n       Without question, the 1996 decision in Seminole Tribe of \n     Florida v. State of Florida, 517 US 44; 134 L Ed 2d 252; 116 \n     S Ct 1114 (1996), has precipitated a need for thorough review \n     of federal policy regarding tribal gaming operation. However, \n     pending completion of that task, I share the position held by \n     most state Attorneys General that the Secretary of Interior \n     lacks authority to unilaterally promulgate rules for the \n     operation of activities defined as class III gaming under \n     IGRA. As the state official with the responsibility under \n     Michigan law to defend all lawsuits against the state, it is \n     my firm conviction that a decision to advance a valid defense \n     should not be influenced by a threat that a particular \n     defense will precipitate an unauthorized response by a \n     federal agency.\n       In light of the foregoing, I wish to voice my support for \n     your effort to adopt a narrowly focused amendment to the \n     Department of Interior appropriations legislation which will \n     preclude steps to authorize class III gaming without specific \n     authorization by an impacted state.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Frank J. Kelley,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I also thank the other Senators who have \naddressed this along with me, and I want to make some comments on the \nthings that were said.\n  I would particularly like to thank the Senator from New Mexico for \nhis comments. More particularly, I would like to thank him for all the \neducation he gave me a year ago when we debated this amendment. That \nwas one of the first amendments that I worked on, and I have to say it \nneeded a lot of work. With his cooperation, and with the Senator from \nHawaii, we came up with an amendment that protected the status quo. It \nwas an amendment that we thought would keep things from moving forward \nand supplanting the States' ability to negotiate it. I found out later \nthat there are even some more careful wordings that have to be done on \nbills that we work on around here. Had I done it more particularly \nabout finalizing the rule itself, perhaps we would have avoided the \nneed to bring it up again. I didn't. So we need to talk about it some \nmore.\n  I mentioned that what we are really trying to do with this amendment \nis to preclude the finalization of rules and regulations that would \nsupplant the States. I will be one of the first to admit that at the \npresent time the States have the bigger stick. Until the rules get \napproved and the bigger stick switches hands, and the tribes have the \nbigger stick and the control of that stick forever--if we leave the \nstick in the hands of the States, there is an easy way to change that \nin the interim and to make the kinds of exemptions that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico talked about. The way to do that is to have hearings by \nthe Indian Affairs Committee--hearings that are balanced, hearings that \ntake into account how difficult it is to properly negotiate between the \nStates and the tribes.\n  We can come up with a compromise piece of legislation. That piece of \nlegislation would eliminate this amendment on an appropriations bill \nand this amendment in any future years. But we have to have that \ndiscussion. We have to see what the arguments are between the States \nand the tribes and get those resolved. I know there is common ground. \nWe have hit around the edges of it today. But there have been \nstatements on both sides that take it a little bit further each way \nthan probably it ought to be. But I can tell you that we are not going \nto get it resolved and we will just give the whole stick to the tribes \nunless we put this amendment on the bill.\n  I thank the Senator from Hawaii for the care and concern with which \nhe has spoken in every instance that we have debated this issue. This \nis the third time. I appreciate today particularly the 20 years of \nexperience that he has on this and the tremendous knowledge that he has \nabout the history of the tribes in the United States.\n  I grew up in Sheridan, WY, 60 miles from the Crow Reservation, which \nis in Montana. But I have had the opportunity to work with them and the \ntribes in Wyoming before. This is not an attempt to take away from the \nIndian tribes. This is an attempt to get that fair playing field \nthrough hearings, through legislation--not through something by an \nunelected Secretary of the Federal Government to put it in the hands of \nCongress. We are the ones who ought to be making these kinds of \ndecisions. If there are decisions left undone, we ought to go back and \nredo them so that they take care of all the problems. We need to have \nall of the interested parties. We need to have hearings on it.\n  The comment was raised that on my amendment there haven't been \nhearings. I kind of have to contest that a little bit, because this is \nthe third time we have debated it, which is a form of hearing among the \nMembers. It is not my fault that there have been no hearings on this. \nThe Indian Affairs Committee has not held hearings on this in spite of \nthe requests last year, in spite of that being the primary way that we \ncan bring everybody together to focus on the issue and to come up with \na solution that will work for everybody.\n  I don't think this is a death knell for the talks between people. \nInstead, it is the beginning of a process that can work with the Indian \nAffairs Committee to see that we have some hearings, reach a solution, \nand bring it to conclusion. It is in the hands of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee. But there is only a need for them to meet on it, if we pass \nmy amendment.\n  I ask that you pass the amendment. I will briefly summarize some of \nthe points.\n  It maintains the status quo of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act for \none more year. It preserves the right of Congress to pass laws. It \ncontinues the incentive for tribes and States to pursue legislative \nchanges to IGRA. It gives the Indian Affairs Committee time to hold the \nhearing and recommend the IGRA changes. It prevents Secretary Babbitt \nfrom bypassing Congress. It protects States rights without harming the \nIndian tribes. And it honors the advice of the National Gambling Impact \nStudy Commission so that they can finish their work, as they requested.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I know of no one else desiring to speak on \nthis Enzi proposal. It seems to me that it is a relatively simple one. \nIt simply enjoins for one additional year the right of the Secretary of \nthe Interior to avoid the requirements of both the 11th amendment and \nof present law by making it a determination that a State has\n\n[[Page S10371]]\n\nnot engaged in good faith in negotiating a class III gambling compact \nand that it has stated its sovereign immunity in an action by an Indian \ntribe or another kind against it.\n  In light of the fact that the report of a long-term commission on the \neffect of gambling in the United States has not yet been made, it seems \nto me that this is a reasonable amendment. I know of no request for a \nrollcall vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I believe we are ready to vote on the Enzi amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3592) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ENZI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Ashcroft, \nis here and will be ready in just a few moments to present an amendment \nrespecting the National Endowment for the Arts. We will debate that \nuntil debate is completed. I rather suspect that amendment will require \na rollcall vote. But this is to notify Members who are interested in \nthe National Endowment for the Arts that this will be their opportunity \nto speak on that subject. It was the subject of some controversy and a \nnumber of speeches last year, and I suspect there may very well be \nMembers on both sides who would like to make their views on the subject \nknown, and they are invited to come to the floor.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I understand now that Members on both \nsides have agreed to a 1-hour--I will withhold that request at this \npoint.\n  Is the Senator ready?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am prepared to go ahead.\n  Mr. GORTON. Then, Mr. President, I will yield the floor and I will \nask the Senator's indulgence, if we have cleared a time agreement, to \nget that time agreement. We would like to have a vote on the amendment \nbefore the lecture by Senator Byrd at 6 o'clock this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3593\n\n(Purpose: To eliminate funding for the National Endowment for the Arts \nand to transfer available funds for the operation of the National Park \n                                System)\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I come for the second straight year to offer an amendment to the \nInterior appropriations bill, and I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3593.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Beginning on page 109, strike line 21 and all that follows \n     through line 18 on page 110 and insert the following:\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     amount available under the heading `National Park Service, \n     Operation of the National Park Service' under title I shall \n     be $1,325,903,000.''.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I come to the floor for the second \nstraight year to offer an amendment to the Interior appropriations \nbill. This amendment, while dealing with a relatively small amount of \nmoney--and I wince a little bit when I call the amount of money small, \nbut in comparison to the multibillion-dollar funding bill it does \naddress a small percentage of that bill--addresses a profound and \nfundamental issue that is before this body. Should the Federal \nGovernment be in the business of judging and funding art? Should the \nFederal Government be telling the rest of the country this is good art, \nor this is not good enough for the Federal Government, signaling to the \nrest of the country this art is superior or this art is worthy of your \nsupport while other art is not?\n  While my efforts last year to eliminate funding for the National \nEndowment for the Arts were unsuccessful, I am compelled to continue to \nraise this issue, hoping to persuade my colleagues that the Federal \nGovernment should resign from its role as a national art critic. It \nseems to me that to have the Federal Government as an art critic which \ndetermines what type or types of art are superior to other types of art \nis not something that a free nation would want to encourage. Government \nshould not be in the business of subsidizing free speech or putting its \nso-called ``Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval'' on certain pieces of \nso-called art. My amendment simply eliminates the $100 million \nappropriated by the bill to the National Endowment for the Arts, and it \ntakes the available funds and puts them toward the renovation and \npreservation of our national park system.\n  Since the last time we debated this issue, two relevant events have \noccurred regarding the National Endowment for the Arts. First, news \nabout the play, and I quote the title here, ``Corpus Christi,'' which \nthe NEA had agreed to fund, has become available; and, secondly, the \nSupreme Court of the United States has rendered a decision in the case \nof National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley.\n  I would like to discuss each of these developments as well as other \narguments and show how they support elimination of funding for the \nNational Endowment for the Arts.\n  The play ``Corpus Christi'' is merely the latest example of why we \nshould defund the National Endowment for the Arts.\n  In the last few months, we have heard a great deal about the play \nplanned to be staged by the Manhattan Theatre Club in New York City. \nThis play, entitled ``Corpus Christi,'' has generated a lot of \ncontroversy because of its content and because the National Endowment \nfor the Arts approved a $31,000 grant to the theater to fund production \nof this play.\n  Let me give a brief chronology of the involvement of the National \nEndowment for the Arts with ``Corpus Christi.'' The Manhattan Theatre \nClub first applied to the National Endowment for the Arts in October of \n1995 to request funding for ``Corpus Christi.'' The theater's summary \nof the project activity stated as follows:\n\n       MTC is requesting support from the National Endowment for \n     the Arts for the world premiere of Terrence McNally's new \n     play, CORPUS CHRISTI. The production is scheduled for fall, \n     1996 on Stage 1.\n\n  I continue to quote:\n\n       Mr. McNally will develop the rehearsal draft of the script \n     in house at Manhattan Theatre Club during the next year. \n     CORPUS CHRISTI is a play for 13 actors. Requested and \n     matching funds will be spent on development, preproduction, \n     rehearsal and the subscription run of the play at the \n     Manhattan Theatre Club.\n  That was the summation of the project activity included in the \nrequest for funding as submitted by the Manhattan Theatre Club. The NEA \napplication asked the applicant to ``give a detailed description of the \nproposed project,'' including, among other things, ``the degree of \ndevelopment of the project.'' The Manhattan Theatre Club supplied the \nNEA with the following description:\n\n       Spirituality has been one of the major themes in Terrence \n     McNally's most recent plays at MTC. His next play, Corpus \n     Christi, will be an examination of good and evil. He will use \n     certain miracles in the life of Christ as the inspiration for \n     the story, which will have a contemporary setting.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Corpus Christi is an extremely ambitious new work for Mr. \n     McNally. MTC is proud to serve as the artistic home for this \n     eminent American playwright. Our relationship with him is one \n     of the most important and far-reaching models in our \n     commitment to writers. We are confident that this project \n     will break new ground for Mr. McNally as an artist, and that \n     it will continue our tradition of providing innovative, \n     important new plays to audiences in our community and beyond.\n\n  That was from the Manhattan Theatre Club grant application of October \n2, 1995.\n\n[[Page S10372]]\n\n  The NEA approved the grant to fund Corpus Christi. On June 14, 1996, \nthe NEA informed the Manhattan Theatre Club that it had been awarded a \n$31,000 grant ``to support expenses for the development and world \npremiere of the new play, `Corpus Christi,' by Terrence McNally, as \noutlined in your application cited above and the enclosed project \nbudget.''\n  On December 17, 1996, however, the Manhattan Theatre Club wrote the \nNEA requesting a scope change amendment to its grant so that it could \nreceive Endowment funding for the New York premiere of Donald \nMargulies' ``Collected Stories,'' instead of for ``Corpus Christi.'' \nThe Theatre Club gave this sparse description of the new project:\n\n       ``Collected Stories'' follows the relationship between an \n     esteemed writer, Ruth Steiner, and her promising student, \n     Lisa Morrison. As Lisa gradually transforms from protege to \n     peer, so does her relationship with Ruth. MTC has produced \n     [Margulies'] `The Loman Family Picnic,' the Obie winning \n     `Sight Unseen' and `What's Wrong With This Picture.' This \n     continues a very important artistic relationship between \n     [Margulies] and MTC.\n\n  The National Endowment approved the scope change request. It switched \nthe funding from Corpus Christi to the Collected Stories application. \nBased on that single paragraph, the NEA approved the scope change \nrequested in January, 1997.\n  It was after that time that we began to understand something about \nCorpus Christi. We had heard very little about either the Manhattan \nTheatre Club or Corpus Christi until the last few months. Recently we \nhave begun to see the truth about Corpus Christi and the reason for \nswitching from one pocket to the other the grant application. We have \nlearned more about the play for which the National Endowment for the \nArts awarded a grant--but did not fund--because the Manhattan Theatre \nClub, not the NEA, requested a scope change in its grant.\n  On May 29 of this year, the New York Times reported that it had \nobtained a draft of the script for Corpus Christi, and stated that this \ndraft, quoting from the New York Times:\n\n       * * * suggests that rather than having specific phrases or \n     scenes likely to cause controversy, it is the overall tenor, \n     focus and point of the work that could be most at issue.''\n\n  While the Manhattan Theatre Club had described the play in its fall \nschedule as telling the story of ``a young gay man named Joshua on his \nspiritual journey'' and providing Mr. McNally's own unique view of the \n``greatest story ever told,'' the New York Times columnist found a very \ndifferent kind of story.\n  From beginning to end, says the columnist, the script:\n\n       * * * retells the Biblical story of a Jesus-like figure \n     from his birth in a Texas flea-bag hotel * * * to his \n     crucifixion as ``king of the queers'' in a manner with the \n     potential to offend many people. Joshua has a long-running \n     affair with Judas and sexual relations with the other \n     apostles. The draft ends with the frank admission: ``If we \n     have offended, so be it. He belongs to us as well as you.''\n\n  A writer for a London newspaper, The Guardian, gave even more \ndescriptive details of the play Corpus Christi, which initially had \nbeen funded directly by the National Endowment and then, at the \nsuggestion of the Manhattan Theatre Club, had its NEA funding switched \nto another project of the theater to avoid the direct funding of Corpus \nChristi. Most of the details given in The Guardian cannot be discussed \non the Senate floor. However, the columnist concludes that, ``the \nplay's wit rests on its deliberately offensive, knowing re-\ninterpretation of the scripture.''\n  Once the truth about Corpus Christi became public, the NEA quickly \ndisavowed any involvement with the play. On June 10, the NEA sent a \nletter to Members of Congress stating emphatically that ``the NEA is \nnot in any way supporting development or production of Corpus \nChristi.'' Yet it can't be denied that the NEA approved funding for the \nplay, regardless of the vague description given it at the time of the \ngrant request.\n  The NEA fully intended to use taxpayers' money to subsidize Corpus \nChristi. As a matter of fact, I believe that with the switching of the \ngrant from the one pocket to the other of the Manhattan Theatre Club, \nthe subsidy has the same impact. It was only at the later request of \nthe Manhattan Theatre Club, not the NEA, that the money was diverted \nfrom Corpus Christi to the alternate project.\n  I am glad that no Federal funding directly went to pay for Corpus \nChristi. But it is because the Manhattan Theatre Club, not the NEA, \nmade the change or sought the change. And nevertheless, when you have a \ncomposite of activities of an organization like Manhattan Theatre Club, \nsome of which are subsidized locally or paid for locally, others of \nwhich are subsidized federally, the capacity to maintain that \nparticular play as part of the offering of the club is assisted and \nsimply made possible by the continuing support of the National \nEndowment for the Arts. Despite all the past controversy, despite all \nthe improvements to the NEA statutes, there is still something \nfundamentally wrong with public funding of the arts.\n  This matter involving the NEA, the Manhattan Theatre Club, and Corpus \nChristi, demonstrates a number of problems we have when the Federal \nGovernment tries to fund art.\n  First, the NEA does not exercise proper oversight in awarding grants. \nIt seems incredible that the NEA would approve such a significant \nchange in a grant request--from one project to a completely different \none--based on a single paragraph description in a letter from the \ngrantee. Is this an appropriate exercise of oversight?\n  This action demonstrates how little the NEA knows about the projects \nit funds. It is supposed to judge based upon ``artistic excellence''--\nbut how, based upon the Manhattan Theatre Club's first description of \nCorpus Christi--or based upon the sparse description of ``Collected \nStories''--can any person or review panel make an informed decision \nregarding artistic excellence?\n  Second, the NEA's ease in allowing the Manhattan Theatre Club's scope \nchange demonstrates that the agency chose to fund the project based \nupon the Theatre's reputation, rather than upon the merits of a \nparticular project. Such an action seems to be allowing de facto \n``seasonal support,'' which even the NEA admits is forbidden by law.\n  Seasonal support was the concept of saying we would just simply, as \nthe Government, give a particular organization, an art organization, an \namount of money in which to conduct a season's activities. It would not \nbe with reference to specific activities of the organization. ``We are \ngoing to fund their 1998 season, or their 1996 season, or subsidize the \nseason.''\n  The Congress, because it wanted more supervision on the part of the \nNEA--it wanted assessments of the quality and nature of those items \nbeing subsidized--outlawed or otherwise made improper, season support. \nIt is forbidden in the law. Yet, when the NEA allows organizations \nsimply to switch grants back and forth, it obviously provides a basis \nfor the same kind of problems to arise as would arise when you just \nsimply turned over the money to the organization to support a season, \nwithout regard to the specific matters being subsidized.\n  This situation also demonstrates the underlying problem with \ngovernment funding of art. Government is not in a good position to \ndetermine what is art. When government funds art, it is put in a Catch-\n22 situation.\n  Many Americans, including myself, feel strongly that the Government \nhas no business funding any theater that is going to openly and proudly \ndenigrate the religious faith of a large segment of Americans.\n  However, if one takes this view, he will be accused of censoring or \nmaking unconstitutional value judgments. My view is that the \nsubsidization of art is wrong in the first place, but certainly not to \nprovide funding is not to censor, but that is the kind of charge that \nis made.\n  On the other hand, if you can't make value judgments based on the \ncontent of art, you will end up funding offensive and indecent \nmaterials.\n  When the Government funds art, it will always have to make value \njudgments on what is art and what is not, which is not an appropriate \nfunction of Government. The only way to solve this problem is to get \nthe Government out of the business of funding art.\n  For those who say this is an issue of free speech, I ask you, How \nfree is speech when the Government pays? Not very.\n\n[[Page S10373]]\n\n  The events surrounding the National Endowment for the Arts' funding \nof the Manhattan Theatre Club in Corpus Christi underscore the need for \nthe Federal Government to get out of the business of funding art, which \nis a form of speech. Speech is not free if the Government funds it. If \nthe Government says that some speech is better than other speech and \nprefers it by providing a subsidy, the Government is impairing the \nright of every citizen to speak and to express himself freely.\n  Let me now turn to the second significant event that occurred since \nthe last time we debated this issue on an appropriations measure, and \nthat is the Supreme Court's recent decision in National Endowment for \nthe Arts v. Finley.\n  In National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, the Supreme Court \nupheld the Federal statute directing the NEA to take into consideration \n``general standards of decency and respect for the diverse beliefs and \nvalues of the American public'' in making grants.\n  In the case of the National Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, I \nrepeat, the Supreme Court upheld the will of the Congress expressed in \nthe statute, signed by the President, directing the National Endowment \nfor the Arts to take into consideration ``general standards of decency \nand respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public'' \nin making grants.\n  While some have said this ruling will appropriately address concerns \nover the offensive attacks on religious groups and otherwise offensive \nmaterial that has been funded by the NEA, this is simply not the case.\n  In its opinion, the Supreme Court noted that the NEA has implemented \nthe law ``merely by ensuring the representation of various backgrounds \nand points of view on the advisory panels that analyze grant \napplications.''\n  It is interesting to note that the Supreme Court upheld the Federal \nstatute directing the NEA to take into consideration certain standards, \nand to see how the NEA had attempted to comply with the statute: by \nappointing individuals who might or might not represent those \nstandards--``merely by ensuring the representation of various \nbackgrounds and points of view on the advisory panels. . . .'' That was \nthe response of the NEA.\n  The Court also said that the decency and respect provision does not \npreclude awards to projects that might be indecent or disrespectful. \nAnd, in fact, the Court cautioned against any future use of the decency \nand respect standard to discriminate on the basis of viewpoint.\n  Moreover, in response to the Finley decision, Chairman Ivey said that \nthe ruling was a ``reaffirmation of the agency's discretion in funding \nthe highest quality art in America'' and that it would not affect his \nagency's day-to-day operations.\n  What you have is the Supreme Court affirming the Congress' effort to \nshape the decisions of the NEA for subsidizing art and to move those \ndecisions away from the affronts to the religious traditions of \nAmericans. But then you have the chairman of the NEA saying that the \nruling of the Court was a ``reaffirmation of the agency's discretion in \nfunding the highest quality art in America'' and that it would not \naffect his agency's day-to-day operations.\n  Obviously, if the Congress' effort to provide a guideline for decency \ndoes nothing to affect the agency's day-to-day operations, we are going \nto have problems similar to the problems that came up surrounding the \nCorpus Christi funding.\n  Hence, the Finley case does nothing to solve the underlying problem \nconfronting us and, in fact, demonstrates that Government simply should \nnot be in a position to determine what is art and what is not.\n  There are a number of other reasons why we should stop funding the \nNEA. I question whether it is a proper role of the Federal Government \nto subsidize free speech as we do through the NEA. Government \nsubsidies, even with the best of intentions, are dangerous because they \nskew the market toward whatever the Government grantmakers prefer. The \nNational Endowment for the Arts grants place the stamp of U.S. \nGovernment approval on funded art. This gives the endowment enormous \npower to dictate what is regarded as art and what is not.\n  A number of art critics and even artists themselves have observed \nthis. Jan Breslauer, Los Angeles Times art critic, puts it this way. \nShe says that the NEA's subsidization of certain viewpoints poses great \nproblems--and I quote Jan Breslauer:\n\n       [T]he endowment has quietly pursued policies rooted in \n     identity politics--a kind of separatism that emphasizes \n     racial, sexual and cultural differences above all else. The \n     art world's version of affirmative action, these policies . . \n     . have had a profoundly corrosive effect on the American \n     arts--pigeonholing artists and pressuring them to produce \n     work that satisfies a politically correct agenda rather than \n     their best creative instincts.\n\n  Jan Breslauer is basically saying that a subsidy which encourages art \nthat the market would not otherwise respect or encourage corrupts the \narts and entices people into producing a kind of art that they would \nnot otherwise pursue for its artistically rewarding aspects. Rather, \nsuch a subsidy pressures them to produce work that satisfies a \npolitically correct agenda.\n  In my judgment, this is not only an inappropriate disposition of \ntaxpayers' dollars. When we find out that the Government purchase of \nart corrupts the arts by pressuring artists to work in politically \ncorrect areas instead of in areas that best reflect their creative \ninstincts, we have gone beyond damage to the taxpayer: we have begun to \ndamage the artistic community itself.\n  Joseph Parisi, editor of Poetry magazine, the Nation's oldest and \nmost prestigious poetry magazine, I might add, said that disconnecting \n``artificial support systems'' for the arts, such as cuts in NEA \nfunding, has had some positive effects.\n  Parisi has said that cuts in Federal spending for the arts are \ncausing ``a shake-out of the superficial.'' What he is basically saying \nis when we cut subsidies for the arts, we knock out superficial art \nthat is not of value.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       The market demands a wider range, an appeal to a broader \n     base. Arts and writers are forced to get back to markets. \n     What will people buy? If you are tenured, if the Government \n     buys, there is no response to irrelevance.\n\n  Here is an artist who simply says, in effect, that a subsidy to the \narts not only wastes taxpayers' money but it corrupts the artists \nthemselves.\n  In short, the Government should not pick and choose among different \npoints of view and value systems and continue politicizing the arts. \nGarth Brooks fans pay their own way, while the NEA canvases the Nation \nfor politically correct art that needs a transfusion from the Treasury. \nIt is bad public policy to subsidize free expression.\n  I would also like to point out that Congress has no constitutional \nauthority to create or fund the NEA. It is true that funding for the \nNEA is relatively small, although it is hard to say that $100 million \nis small. It is small in comparison to the overall budget. Regardless \nof the amount of money involved here, elimination of this agency would \nsend the right message that Congress is taking seriously its obligation \nto restrict the Federal Government's actions to the limited role \nenvisioned by the framers of the Constitution. Nowhere does the \nConstitution grant any authority that could reasonably be construed to \ninclude the promotion of the arts.\n\n  During the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, as a matter of \nfact, in 1787, Delegate Charles Pinckney introduced a motion calling \nfor the Federal Government to subsidize the arts in the United States. \nAlthough the Founding Fathers were cultured individuals who knew \nfirsthand of various European systems for public arts patronage, they \noverwhelmingly rejected Pinckney's suggestion because of their belief \nin limited constitutional government.\n  Accordingly, nowhere in its list of powers enumerated and delegated \nto the Federal Government does the Constitution specify a power to \nsubsidize the arts. And that was in the face of a specific proposal to \ndo so at the convention, but was overwhelmingly rejected.\n  There are a number of other reasons why we should eliminate funding \nfor the National Endowment for the Arts, but time does not allow me to \nenumerate them. Suffice it to say, it is time to end the Federal \nGovernment's role of paying for and thereby politicizing art.\n  Former New York Times art critic Hilton Kramer observed this \nphenomenon back in the early 1980s and spoke\n\n[[Page S10374]]\n\nalmost prophetically about how NEA funding could in fact harm the arts. \nHe put it this way:\n\n       The imperatives now governing much of the commentary \n     devoted to art tend not to have anything to do with the real \n     artistic issues, much less with the problem of artistic \n     quality. They tend to be political. This, too, was probably \n     inevitable given the role that [our] government now plays in \n     our cultural life.\n\n  I continue quoting:\n\n       So quickly has this role acquired the status of something \n     external and irreversible that there now exists an entire \n     generation of artists, critics, curators and bureaucrats who \n     have come of age believing that the life of art is \n     inconceivable without it. One sometimes wonders what they \n     think the life of art in this country was like before 1965. \n     It may come as news to them to learn that American art did \n     not begin with the formation of the National Endowment for \n     the Arts, and that there were great art museums flourishing \n     in this country long before there were agencies in Washington \n     monitoring, directing and subsidizing their activities. Of \n     all the changes that have occurred on the American art scene \n     since 1965, this one may well prove to be the most fateful of \n     all, for it already shows signs of making the politicization \n     of art, and of our thinking about art, a permanent feature of \n     our cultural life. And this, I think, is not good news for \n     the future of American art--or indeed, for the future of \n     American society.\n\n  Thoughtful individuals understand the pollution that politics and \ngovernment bring when they seek to subsidize art and favor some art \nover other art. We need to heed Mr. Kramer's warning and get the \nFederal Government out of the business of being a national art critic.\n  My amendment would do this by eliminating funding for the National \nEndowment for the Arts and by putting available funds toward a more \nlegitimate cause--preserving and maintaining our national parks. Our \nnational park system, comprising 376 units and about 83 million acres, \nis America's most educational playground, teaching more than 270 \nmillion visitors per year about our Nation's history, about our \nculture, about our traditions, and our natural landscapes.\n  Our national parks are often the choice for family vacations, school \nfield trips, researchers, and foreign tourists. They represent an \nappropriate devotion of the resource which would otherwise go to \nsubsidize art in a way which is counterproductive to the quality of art \nin our culture and many times is an affront to the understanding, \nbeliefs, and closely cherished religious traditions of the American \npeople.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this important amendment, \nthis amendment which would zero out funding for the National Endowment \nfor the Arts and make the remaining available funds available to the \nnational park system for renovation and restoration and maintenance of \nthe parks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, by reason of the Byrd lecture this \nevening, I now ask unanimous consent that the time between now and 5:30 \np.m. be divided, with 17 minutes for the opponents of the amendment and \n8 minutes for the proponents of the amendment, and that at 5:30 the \nmanager of the bill or his designee be recognized to offer a motion to \ntable, and that no second-degree amendments be in order prior to the \ntabling vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I note the presence of the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I am going to use very little of this time and will \nallow him to speak on it.\n  Mr. President, the eloquent and thoughtful Senator from Missouri has \nraised two specific criticisms of the continuation of funding for the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. One relates to a notorious anti-\nChristian play called ``Corpus Christi'' about to be produced in New \nYork City, the sponsor of which originally received the tentative NEA \naward on the basis of an application described by the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Personally, I think the NEA should probably have turned down that \napplication at the time at which it was granted on the ground that it \nsounded as though the play was on no subject other than a very standard \nand Orthodox Christian theme which is perhaps inappropriate for funding \nby government.\n  In any event, the National Endowment for the Arts has not funded the \nproduction of that play, might well have decided that it did not wish \nto subsidize anything else that the theater was doing, but certainly \nhas not breached any of the requirements which Congress has laid down \nfor the National Endowment for the Arts itself. Had it gone ahead \nknowing what the play was about, we might be having quite a much longer \ndebate here today and one in which the future of the National Endowment \nfor the Arts might be very seriously under threat, including, from \namong others, this Senator.\n  Secondly, the Senator from Missouri quite accurately describes the \ndecision of the Supreme Court on the decency standards included in \nformer and current versions of the funding for the National Endowment \nfor the Arts. I say, joining myself with the Senator from Missouri as a \nformer State attorney general, that I was somewhat disappointed in that \nSupreme Court decision which largely ducked the fundamental issues that \nwere involved in the limitations Congress has placed on the way in \nwhich the National Endowment for the Arts can make its grants.\n  The Supreme Court at least nominally upheld those decency provisions \nbut raised some very serious questions about their future applicability \nunder future challenges. The bottom line was, however, that the \nNational Endowment for the Arts, that had refused to fund certain \nactivities by Ms. Finley, among others, was upheld in that refusal.\n  As long as the courts continue to uphold the National Endowment when \nit engages in that kind of rejection, I think we will be in good shape. \nIf at some time in the future the Supreme Court should say that this \nCongress does not have the ability to provide limitations on the use of \nthis money to enforce commonly held decency standards in the United \nStates, we will be debating a different issue. But at the present time \nwe are debating the issue of the continuation of the National Endowment \nfor the Arts under the rules under which it has operated for the last \ncouple of years, during which it has not funded grants that outraged a \nsignificant majority or even a very large minority of the American \npeople.\n  The great bulk of the grants--or rather most of the money that the \nNational Endowment for the Arts uses--goes to State art agencies. Most \nof the rest goes to institutional kinds of activities--symphony \norchestras, art museums and the like. The restrictions on the NEA \nfunding of individual projects are very, very significant and have \nprevented the kind of controversies that took place 5 or 6 years ago.\n  In other words, Mr. President, it is my view that the reforms that \nhave been imposed on the National Endowment for the Arts by the \nCongress of the United States have, in fact, worked, and the grants \nmade by the National Endowment for the Arts help the arts scene all \nacross the country, which are far more decentralized than they were \nbefore, in far more underserved areas, in far more deserving entities \nin small towns and small cities around the United States.\n  On balance, it seems to me highly appropriate to continue the modest \nsupport that Congress gives for the NEA imprimatur. And almost all of \nour constituents involved in the arts tell us that even a tiny grant \nfrom the National Endowment provides for the arts and entities that get \nthe great bulk of their money from charitable contributions, from \ngenerous-minded people in their own communities. I attended an opening \nof a new concert hall in Seattle on Sunday in which perhaps $100 \nmillion or more was spent for the Seattle Symphony Orchestra, an \noccasional minor recipient of grants from the NEA. That fund drive was \ngreatly strengthened by the kind of support that the NEA gives. It is \nalmost solely financed by State government, county government, local \ngovernment contributions, and even larger contributions from the \nprivate sector itself.\n  The NEA, for better or worse, is a catalyst for arts support, private \nand public, all across the United States, and the endowment should be \ncontinued.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n[[Page S10375]]\n\n  Mr. COATS. How much time remains of the Senator from Washington?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes 29 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. GORTON. Is the Senator not an opponent of the amendment?\n  Mr. COATS. Of the proponents' side of the issue, how much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Ashcroft has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I yield such time as the Senator from Indiana may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nAshcroft's amendment. I have thought long and hard about this issue. We \nhave debated it a number of times in committee and on the floor. I have \ncome to the conclusion that the Senator's amendment is a correct \namendment. It is correct because in so many ways this agency, the \nNational Endowment for the Arts, has shown itself as not responsive to \nthe Congress and not responsive to the American people. This is, in \nmany ways, a difficult position for me to take because I have long been \na supporter of the central mission of the NEA. A number of beneficial \ngrants have been given to institutions in Indiana, and projects have \nbeen promoted that I do believe serve a public interest.\n  I don't dispute the fact that knowledge and beauty are among some of \nthe highest calls of any culture. But sadly, that has not been the \ndebate of the last few years. We are not discussing the role of the \narts in our society. There will always be a prominent role for art and \nculture in our society. What we are discussing here is the role of \npublic subsidy of that art, and the question of whether or not we \nshould appropriate tax dollars from our constituents to fund these \ntypes of projects, particularly when it seems that year after year that \nfunding raises questions and controversy.\n  Whenever we seem to revisit this matter, we return to one central \nquestion: Do we in Congress have the right to take money from citizens \nand allow it to be used in ways that, for many, go against some of \ntheir most deeply held religious and moral beliefs?\n  Over the last several years, several Members have been trying to \nensure that Federal dollars are not used in ways that offend a majority \nof Americans. The Senator from North Carolina has tried to stop support \nfor the most offensive projects by restricting the ability of the \nNational Endowment for the Arts to fund projects which defile or offend \npeople's religious beliefs, and projects which depict the body in \ndegrading and offensive ways. This effort to limit objectionable \nprojects by holding all grants to a decency standard was a fiscally \nand, I believe, morally responsible position, one that was supported, \nhappily, by a majority of the Senate. I was pleased to see that the \ndecency standard was upheld by the Supreme Court this past June by a \nvery substantial vote of 8-1.\n  Mr. President, the Senate should not have a role as art critic, and \ncertainly not a role as censor. But it does have, as its primary and \ndefining purpose, the role of determining if public funds are spent in \nthe public interest.\n\n  I started out these comments by expressing my support for the central \nmission of the promotion of the arts and my appreciation for the grants \nthat have been made to different projects in Indiana--worthy grants. \nHowever, in spite of this, I remain convinced that, during the last \nthree decades in particular, the National Endowment for the Arts has \nfailed in its mission to enhance cultural life in the United States. It \nhas brought controversy to the whole area. Despite numerous attempts to \nreform it, the NEA attempts to support what I think are often \npolitically correct but patently offensive projects. I don't think we \ncan ignore this.\n  I think the central question is whether or not this is the best use \nof the taxpayers' dollars. There are alternatives. I have supported and \nvoted for efforts to privatize this whole function. I have supported \nand voted for efforts to block grant these funds to State councils, \nwhich I think are much more responsive and responsible in terms of how \nthey are distributed. I have looked for alternative ways of providing \nincentives to support some of these very valuable contributions that \nare made through various projects that exist in our States. But I have \nbeen discouraged time after time in terms of our ability here to rein \nin what I think is often an inappropriate use of these taxpayers' \ndollars. For that reason, I support the amendment being offered by the \nSenator from Missouri and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I yield half of our remaining time to the \nSenator from Massachusetts and half to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to notify me when 4\\1/2\\ \nminutes have passed.\n  Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the National Endowment for \nthe Arts and full funding for the agency as provided in the \nAppropriations Committee bill.\n  I commend the committee for its continuing strong support for this \nimportant agency. I commend Senator Gorton, Senator Byrd, and many \nother members of the committee who have demonstrated impressive \nleadership on this issue, and essential funds are being provided to \nsupport Endowment programs in vital areas such as music, dance, visual \narts, theater, opera and arts education.\n  For nearly a decade, Congress has debated the proper role of the \nFederal Government on the arts. Each year, a small group of Endowment \nbashers have led a charge against the agency--and each year the charge \nhas effectively been turned back.\n  The funds provided in the current bill are the same amount approved \nby the Senate last year after lengthy debate and deliberation. The bill \nalso includes the priorities and limitations on these funds from last \nyear to ensure the effect of distribution of funds to neighborhoods and \ncommunities across the country.\n  The arts have a central and indispensable role in the life of \nAmerica. The Arts Endowment contributes immensely to that life. It \nencourages the growth and development of the arts in communities \nthroughout the nation, giving new emphasis and vitality to American \ncreativity and scholarship and to the cultural achievements that are \namong America's greatest strengths.\n  Compelling research underscores the role of the arts in student \nperformance in other academic subjects as well. A recent study by the \nCollege Board demonstrated a direct correlation between study of the \narts and achievement on SAT scores. Students who had four or more years \nof arts courses scored 59 points higher on the verbal part of the SAT \ntest and 44 points higher on the math part--compared to students with \nno equivalent courses in the arts.\n  If you were to, on the Senate floor, give us one indicator that can \nmake a difference in enhancing the academic achievement and \naccomplishment of the young people in this country, the arts and the \nstudy of the arts has a record which is really second to none, let \nalone the value that it has in terms of enriching our culture and our \nhistory and the history of this Nation.\n  The arts are also an important part of the economic base of \ncommunities across the country. A study by the New England Foundation \nfor the Arts emphasizes the economic impact. In 1995, cultural \norganizations in the region had a total economic impact of nearly $4 \nbillion. During that time, over 99,000,000 people attended events and \nperformances sponsored by cultural organizations. That number is nearly \n8 times the entire population of New England. Clearly, programs in \ntheater, music and art are significant community assets for both \nresidents and tourists.\n  That benefit is one of the reasons why the United States Conference \nof Mayors strongly supports adequate funding for the arts and \nhumanities. At their meeting last June in Reno, NV, the Conference \nadopted a resolution reaffirming its support of the Arts and Humanities \nEndowments and calling upon Congress to fund the agencies at the level \nof the President's fiscal year 1999 request. Although the bill we are \ndebating today does not reach that amount, the level of funding is \nreasonable in light of the many other pressures in the budget, and I \nhope we can join in a bipartisan effort to enact it.\n  Bill Ivey, the new chairman of the Arts Endowment has pledged to \ncomply\n\n[[Page S10376]]\n\nfully with the new regulations on oversight and outreach established by \nCongress last year. In an effort to reach out to new communities, the \nEndowment has developed a new pilot project, ArtsREACH, to help states \nthat have received five or fewer grants during the previous two years. \nThis new effort is a productive way to bring the Endowment's programs \nto new audiences in small neighborhoods across the country, and I \ncommend Chairman Ivey for his leadership.\n  Mr. President, I remember the wonderful lines of President Kennedy \nwhen he talked about the age of Phidias also being the age of Pericles, \nand the age of de Medici is also the age of Leonardo da Vinci, and the \nage of Elizabeth is the age of Shakespeare. The point is that at the \ntime when we have had the greatest intellectual achievement and the \nmost creative aspects of civilization, going back to the time of the \nGreek civilization, we have also had ennobling periods in terms of the \nvalues of our own society and our own history and our own forms of \ngovernment.\n  Mr. President, this is a modest proposal. It used to be that we \nallocated the equivalent of two stamps for every American, in terms of \nthe arts. Now the reduction is down to one stamp. In this great Nation \nof ours, it seems to me that we can allocate those resources in ways \nthat will help and assist, preserve, support, and further the arts in \nour society. I hope the amendment of the Senator is not accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have two observations to make. We have \nhad this debate virtually every year since I have been in the Senate. I \ndon't want to repeat myself, although I have discovered since being \nhere that there is no such thing as repetition in the Senate. We always \npretend as if we have never said it before.\n  Two things. One, a historic comment by John Adams, writing to his \nwife Abigail. He said:\n\n       I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty \n     to study mathematics and philosophy. My sons ought to study \n     mathematics and philosophy, geography, natural history, naval \n     architecture, navigation, commerce, and agriculture, in order \n     to give their children a right to study painting, poetry, \n     music, architecture, statuary, tapestry, and porcelain.\n\n  One of the dearest dreams of our Founding Fathers was that we, as a \nnation, would turn our attention to the arts and have our children and \ngrandchildren do the same. The second point is that we have heard a \ngreat deal of various aspects of grants from the NEA, where they have \ngone and what tremendous harm they are doing.\n  I would simply like to share with the Senate where the funds from the \nNEA go in my home State. I don't usually list projects in my home \nState. But I think in this case it would make a good anecdote to some \nof the things we have heard.\n  In Utah, NEA funds have been used for children's theater with \neducational outreach in Coalville, Kamas, Duchesne, Roosevelt, Castle \nDale, Salina, Beaver, and Price.\n  To those Senators who say they have never heard of those towns, I say \nthat most people in Utah have never heard of them either. They are \namong some of our smallest communities. Without the NEA money, they \nwould not have this educational outreach.\n  NEA funds have helped fund community arts' councils around the State, \nincluding those in Springdale, Vernal, Richfield, Riverton, Cedar City, \nand Bluffdale, again in rural Utah.\n  NEA funding in Utah includes the Festival of the American West, the \nChildren's Museum of Utah, the Northern Utah Choral Society, the \nChamber Music Society of Logan, the Payson Community Theater, the Utah \nShakespearean Festival, the Dixie Art Alliance, the Sundance Children's \nTheater, Ballet West, Repertory Dance Theatre, Quarterly West, Ririe-\nWoodbury Dance Foundation, the Utah Symphony, and recently the central \nUtah Highlanders Pipe Band.\n  The projects that I have listed are Utah projects organized by \nUtahns. The vast majority of the money spent on them is raised in Utah \nby Utahns. But here comes a bit of national recognition that brings \npride and satisfaction to the local folks all across my State that says \nwhat you are doing is important, what you are doing deserves national \nrecognition, and what you are doing deserves Federal support.\n  I find as I walk around Utah spontaneously people coming up to me, \nsaying, ``Senator, for all the things you do, the one thing we most \nappreciate is your defense of the arts.'' I would be unfaithful to \nthose who asked me to continue that defense if I did not rise again, as \nI have on every occasion when this issue has come up, and make it clear \nthat I support these appropriations.\n  I support the chairman of the subcommittee in the way he has handled \nthese appropriations. It is a legitimate expenditure of public funds. I \nhope it continues.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to commend the Chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Interior, Senator Gorton for his work, and the work \nof his staff in providing an increase in appropriations for the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. I believe that the Committee \nrecommendation reflects a sound understanding about what this public \nagency does. In recommending an increase in funding for NEA, the \nCommittee has acknowledged the positive impact that the NEA has made to \nour nation, especially in the areas of education and exchange of \ncultural programs across the country.\n  As I just mentioned, one area that deserves particular attention is \neducation. Broad based activities involving the arts make a significant \nand positive difference in the lives of millions of children each year.\n  It is in the national interest to provide support for programs which \nmake the arts part of the education of our young people and NEA has \nfunded extraordinary programs that do just that. By exciting students \nabout learning--by making music, visual arts and song part of their \nlives--in school, afterschool or on weekends, we are strengthening \ntheir education. By strengthening their education, we are strengthening \nour nation.\n  A recent study has shown that students of the arts are more \nsuccessful on the SAT. In 1995, College Board figures showed that \nstudents who had studied the arts four or more years scored 59 points \nhigher in the verbal and 44 points higher in the math portions of the \nSAT compared with students who had no course work or experience in the \narts. Increasing our nation's young people's exposure to the arts has \nmeasurable good results.\n  The NEA has also made a significant difference in extending the \navailability of the arts in communities throughout the country. There \nare programs supported by the NEA which are of immeasurable benefit to \nfolks all across this nation--in every one of our States. Recently, the \nNEA has implemented the ArtsREACH program which is designed to increase \nthe direct NEA grant assistance to underserved areas. ArtsREACH holds \ngreat promise in providing more American communities with the financial \nassistance that is necessary to strengthen their own locally-based arts \nendeavors.\n  While federal funding for the arts is but a small part of overall \nfunding for the arts, the federal funds distributed by the NEA make a \nBIG difference in spreading the cultural and artistic wealth of our \nnation to small towns and communities everywhere. This commitment to \npromoting outreach, accessibility and participation in the arts, in my \nview, is the most important mission of the NEA. And it is something \nthat the NEA has done quite well since its creation in 1965.\n  The NEA's commitment to excellence in and access to the arts is \nevident in the types of grants it made to Vermont. Vermonters--and \nothers visiting the state--will now have an opportunity to learn more \nabout the pottery produced in Bennington from the late 18th century \nthanks to a grant made to the Bennington Museum; they will have an \nopportunity to hear the Vermont Symphony Orchestra perform in rural \ncommunities as part of the statewide ``Made for Vermont'' tour; they \nwill hear radio broadcasts on traditional storytelling as part of the \n``New England Touchstones'' series produced by the Vermont Folklife \nCenter. Another NEA grant will allow Vermont to export and share some \nof its talent with other states. NEA has provided support to the \nManchester Music Festival so that the Music Festival Orchestra can play \nin schools in Vermont, New Hampshire, New York and Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S10377]]\n\n  It is examples like the ones I mentioned from Vermont, which \nunderscore the value of the federal government's role in fostering our \ncultural heritage.\n  There is great value in ensuring that all individuals have an \nopportunity to experience the beauty of dance, the magic of theater, \nthe enchantment of reading, and the wondrous way that visiting a museum \ncan take you to another place. Our federal investment in the arts \nyields returns of immeasurable value.\n  For those who have been skeptical of providing funds to the NEA in \nthe past, I would hope that they would take note of the significant \nchanges that have been made by Congress and the Agency itself to \nimprove operations and make the NEA more responsive to the needs of the \nAmerican people. Bill Ivey has recently taken over as Chairman of the \nNEA and I believe we should give him an opportunity to succeed. As I \nmentioned, the ArtsREACH program will go a long way in ``spreading the \nwealth'' of the NEA more widely. This program represents a step in the \nright direction taken by the agency. There are now members of Congress \nsitting on the National Council on the Arts who are able to participate \n``first-hand'' in the grant making decisions of the Agency. Caps on \nfunds available to any one State are in effect assuring a more fair \ndistribution of funds to all States. These improvements thoughtfully \nand directly address criticisms that have been made in the past.\n  Art is important to the people of this nation and the NEA helps make \nthe arts a part of more peoples lives. Just two weeks ago, over 2,600 \npeople waited in line for over six hours outside the National Gallery \nof Art to secure a ticket to the upcoming exhibition of works of art \npainted by Vincent Van Gogh. The temperature was 97 degrees! yet people \nbraved the heat for hours just to have the opportunity to admire the \nworks of this great master painter. This exhibition would not be \npossible without the support that the NEA provides though indemnity and \nclearly, this type of sponsorship is just the kind of thing the people \nof our nation want us to invest in--the numbers make that clear!\n  Society, since the beginning of time, has left behind a chronicle of \nthe past through its art. We will be remembered and understood by the \narchitecture, monuments, arts and writing we pass on to the next \ngeneration. What we do today will have an enormous impact in the future \nand how we as a nation are perceived in the future. We must not be \nshortsighted and we should recognize that nurturing and preserving the \nheart and the soul of our country today will preserve the greatness of \nthe nation for all time.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will stand firm in and support the \nrecommendation made by the Interior Appropriations Committee and \nsupport this modest increase in funding for the NEA.\n  The National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the \nHumanities and the Institute for Museum and Library Services are \nagencies with small budgets that provide extraordinary service to the \npeople of this nation. I encourage my colleagues to support each of \nthese agencies.\n  Again, I would like to thank Senator Gorton for his leadership on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, would the Senator from Arkansas like the \nlast 2 minutes that is available?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I would. I thank the Senator very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, since I have been in the Senate, I have \ncome to the floor--and I would not want to miss my last opportunity \nbefore I leave the Senate--to express my strong, strong support of the \nNational Endowment for the Arts.\n  We talk a lot in this country about how uncivil we have become; how \nuncivil our children have become. During the same time--I am not making \nthe correlation--the National Endowment for the Arts' funding has gone \ndown about 50 percent. I think it was close to $200 million when I came \nhere.\n  I can tell you an experience I had when I was overseas waiting to \ncome home after the war, and was bored to death. I have told this story \nbefore. But it is worth repeating. I saw a sign up on the bulletin \nboard one day: ``Would you like to learn about Shakespeare? Come to \nsuch and such a room tonight.'' So about six people just like me, bored \nstiff, waiting to get home, went over. It turned out that a Harvard \ndramatist--a drama coach from Harvard--had put up the sign.\n  He began to tell us about Shakespeare. He began to tell us about \nHamlet. He had a tape recorder. In those days I had never seen a tape \nrecorder. I remember. He said, ``Listen to this.'' He spoke into his \ntape recorder and he proceeded to deliver Hamlet's speech to the \nplayers. It was a magnificent thing. It was the most mellifluous voice \nI had ever experienced. He played it back on his tape recorder. I was \njust stunned. It was just so beautiful. He handed us the tape recorder, \nand he said, ``We are going to have each one of you do the same \nthing.'' I remember. I was about the second one. He handed us the \nscript. I cannot tell you how embarrassed I was. I went ahead, and read \n``Speak the speech, I pray.'' I read the whole speech. I still remember \nit. I will not repeat it here. Then he turned the tape recorder on, and \nit came back. It was pure ``Arkansas redneck.''\n  I made up my mind right then that I did not want to sound like that \nthe rest of my life. To be brutally frank with you, if it had not been \nfor the experience I had with that drama coach for all of those \nnights--about six nights--I daresay I might not be standing on the \nfloor of the Senate today. It was just a happenstance, just an \nopportunity.\n  Every time we give a child that kind of an opportunity, we are always \na stronger, better, more civilized nation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized, and \nhas 3 minutes 26 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the National Endowment \nfor the Arts--not because I am against art, but because I favor art; \nnot because I want to corrupt art, but because I want it to remain \nuncorrupted.\n  Let me address some of the issues that have been raised. It was just \nsaid that we lack civility; so we need Government funding for the arts. \nWe have seen that Government funding has frequently meant pornography, \nobscenity, attacks on religious faith, Mapplethorpe--I don't have to go \nfurther.\n  We have had great art. We have had great civility in this country. \nBut we have not had an increase of civility, as we have had the \nNational Endowment for the Arts, since the 1960s. I challenge whether \nthat is the case.\n  Secondly, it was said that those who study art get better grades in \nschool. Well, undoubtedly they do. But since the 1960s, when we started \nthe National Endowment for the Arts, we have not seen an increase in \nthe Scholastic Aptitude Tests, we have seen a decrease in them. Art is \none thing. Federally subsidized art is another.\n  It has been alleged that people are grateful for art welfare, that \nthey come and they say, ``Thank you for the art money you give us.'' \nWell, I don't know of a single time when the Government hands out money \nthat people don't gratefully come by and say, ``Thank you for the money \nyou give us in our community.''\n  It has been alleged that the Founding Fathers such as John Adams \nliked art. Of course they liked art. They had better art to like in \nmany circumstances than we do. It wasn't art corrupted by the Federal \nGovernment or a subsidy that demanded that the art be politically \ncorrect or that it be on the cutting edge of some social theory.\n  The suggestion is that our founders wanted us to have great art. Yes, \nthey did, but they didn't want it in the Constitution, and they \nspecifically rejected authority in the Constitution to fund art.\n  Let's just make it clear that the Federal Government does not need to \nbe signaling to the art community or Americans what art is good art or \nwhat art is bad art. As a matter of fact, it even corrupts our \nfoundations. About a year ago, the Orange County Register carried an \neditorial which said that so many foundations don't bother to assess \nwhat is going on anymore; they just look for where NEA is sending its \ngrants, and they have their grants follow on.\n\n[[Page S10378]]\n\n  I think we would be better off if we urged people consuming or \nfunding art in this country to be careful about it, to think about it \nin terms of its quality, to think about it in terms of its potential \nfor greatness, to think about what it calls us to. Does it call us to \ngreatness? The Federal Government, with its sense of politics, doesn't \nneed to be signaling that some art is worthy, some speech is worthy, \nother art is unworthy, other speech is to be disregarded.\n  It is not that we do not believe in art in America. All of us \nunderstand that the gifts of expression which God has given us are to \nbe developed and they should be developed educationally and by \nindividuals. But because art is expression and because it is related to \nvalues and because it is speech, it is inappropriate for the Government \nto say that some art is to be funded, some art is to be subsidized, and \nother art is to be disregarded, that other art is somehow unworthy and \nnot to be provided merit.\n  I believe that we will be a more civil society if we have a \nmarketplace which determines what happens in the art community rather \nthan a subsidy from Government. I believe we will be a well educated \npeople, but it will be when we understand art for its value to us, not \nart that we receive at the hand of Government or art that becomes a \npart of a welfare state for the rich or for others in the community. I \nbelieve that art is an expression that ought to be regarded as an \nindividual's choice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The manager of the bill.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to table the Ashcroft amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table the Ashcroft \namendment No. 3593. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I commend the full committee and our \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee for the hard work on this bill. As \na member of the subcommittee, I am especially grateful to our chairman, \nthe distinguished Senator from Washington (Mr. Gorton) for his \nsensitivity to the special needs and concerns of New Mexicans. We live \nin a State with vast Federal land ownership. Programs within the \nInterior Department and the Forest Service, especially, which are \nfunded by this bill, have a major impact on the lives of my \nconstituents. As in previous years, it has been a pleasure working with \nSenator Gorton to craft a bill that is good for both New Mexico and the \nNation.\n  I am especially pleased that this bill accommodates additional \nfunding for the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque and \nthe El Camino Real International Heritage Center, as well as for \nBandelier, Aztec ruins and Petroglyph national monuments, the Rio \nPuerco watershed rehabilitation, and the Middle Rio Grande Bosque \nResearch proposal. This bill also provides increased funding for the \nvanishing treasures initiative and continues support for my Indian \ndiabetes initiative.\n  At a time when we are asking every committee of the Senate to work \nwith tight spending caps to preserve and extend the progress we have \nmade in balancing the budget, the committee has reported to the floor a \nbill that still provides for an increase in spending for our national \nparks. Hard choices were made to achieve this increase and I applaud \nthe committee's work in providing this increase.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/15/senate-section/article/S10354-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue that is \nof great importance to my state. For over 30 years the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority has administered a parcel of land in Kentucky called Land \nBetween the Lakes. For those of you who have not had the pleasure of \nvisiting this region, Land Between the Lakes is used for recreational \nand educational activities and for pure enjoyment of the land's beauty.\n  In 1961 TVA proposed to President Kennedy that land between Lake \nBarkley and Kentucky Lake be established as a national recreation area. \nIn 1963 that proposal became a reality. Initially, TVA was to \nadminister Land Between the Lakes for about 10 years as a temporary \ndemonstration project after which permanent administration would be \ndetermined. Though no formal proceedings were held to determine who \nshould administer Land Between the Lakes it has been the custom and \npractice of Congress to provide annual appropriations to TVA for Land \nBetween the Lakes.\n  TVA has invested years in creating a program that meets the needs of \nall Land Between the Lakes visitors. According to the Administration \nLand Between the Lakes is ``the hub of tourism and recreation industry \nthat annually generates $400 million in economic activity in nine \ncontiguous counties.'' TVA has the equipment, it has the resources and \nit has employees to do the job correctly. TVA has a vested interest in \nprotecting the integrity of the land, a vested interest like the \noriginal landowners who want to assure their land in Kentucky receives \nthe upmost care and protection. And Mr. President, people in the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky have deep cultural ties to the land. Land \nBetween the Lakes is not just another recreation area--it is a part of \nfamily history. Kentuckians gave up their rights to property that had \nbeen in their family for generations, so the whole world would have the \nopportunity to enjoy Land Between the Lakes and its natural resources.\n  Creation of Land Between the Lakes as a national recreation area was \nnot without incident. But over the years TVA has proven itself as a \nworthy guardian of one of Kentucky's most precious resources. Land \nBetween the Lakes is a place for both the young and old, Kentuckians \nand visitors to our state to appreciate nature in its purest form. TVA \nis keeping a promise made to the original land owners to conserve, \nprotect and keep the land in its natural state.\n  Mr. President, a provision of this bill transfers the administrative \nauthority of Land Between the Lakes to the National Forest Service if \nCongress does not appropriate $6 million to manage the recreation area. \nBut in Kentucky, we believe if it isn't broken don't fix it. The people \nof Kentucky who sacrificed their family land to create Land Between the \nLakes do not want this transfer to occur. They cannot understand why \npeople in Washington want to take away TVA's administrative authority \nof Land Between the Lakes when Kentuckians are happy with the status \nquo, and I'm having a hard time explaining why people who don't live in \nKentucky are making this decision. It doesn't make sense to my \nconstituents and I agree.\n  If Congress is willing to appropriate $6 million for Land Between the \nLakes for the Forest Service, then it's sending a clear message that it \nsupports continued funding for Land Between the Lakes. If Congress \nintends to fund Land Between the Lakes then it makes sense to fund it \nthrough TVA, an established and successful route of management.\n  Who administers Land Between the Lakes may not be an issue of \nnational importance, but for Kentuckians it is a matter of pride and \nhonor in protecting their land. For the last couple of years we've all \nheard how important it is to give local communities the power to make \ndecisions that directly affect their lives. When it's in Congress' best \ninterest, they're all for giving local communities the power to make \ntheir own decisions. But for Kentuckians who gave up their land to help \ncreate Land Between the Lakes, Congress believes it knows better what's \nin their best interest.\n  This provision threatens the integrity of the land and the integrity \nof the people of Kentucky. My fellow Kentuckians have never been shy \nabout letting me know what is best for them and I've never been afraid \nto listen. Transferring administrative authority of Land Between the \nLakes away from TVA is a bad move. The proposal of this transfer has \ncaused an emotional response and divided communities. It does not \nrepresent the best interest of Land Between the Lakes, the original \nlandowners' families, nor the people of Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/15/senate-section/article/S10379-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

MARIAFRANCA MORSELLI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the life work of \nDr. Mariafranca Morselli.\n  In 1964, it was our good fortune that Dr. Morselli joined the Maple \nResearch team at the University of Vermont. She has been a family \nfriend and an informal advisor to me for decades.\n  Her research has considerably helped the Maple Syrup Industry to \nimprove production methods and the quality and maple products. This \nwork has been invaluable to my home state.\n  Vermont is the largest producer of maple syrup in the United States. \nThere are approximately 2000 sugarmakers in the state and the industry \nprovides about 4000 jobs in Vermont. Maple sugaring is critical to \nmaintaining the beauty of the working landscape of Vermont, providing \nadded income to help family farms stay in business.\n  We take great pride in the worldwide acclaim for the quality and \ntaste of Vermont maple products.\n  Dr. Morselli is a pioneer. She received her doctoral degree in \nNatural Sciences and Botany from the University of Milan, Italy in \n1946, and taught in a college in Milan. After working in both Italy and \nthe United States, she settled in Vermont to continue her research.\n  In 1983, she was the first woman to received the Outstanding Service \nAward in research by the North American Maple Syrup Council. In 1988, \nshe received three awards, each time as the first female recipient: the \nResearch Service Award from the International Maple Syrup Institute; \nthe Maple Syrup Person of the Year Award from the Vermont Maple \nIndustry; and the Maple Syrup Producer of the Year Award from the \nVermont Maple Sugar\n\n[[Page S10380]]\n\nMakers' Association. In 1991, Dr. Morselli was the first woman to be \ninducted into the American Maple Hall of Fame.\n  She also volunteers her time in activities related to improving \neducation at all levels for women in math and science. She has been \nappointed to the Governor's Commission on Women and to the Vermont \nDevelopmental Disabilities Council. In recognition of her commitment to \nthe role of women in academia, upon her retirement from the University \nof Vermont, students and colleagues established ``The Mariafranca \nMorselli Leadership Award.'' The award is given yearly to an \nundergraduate woman who has made special contribution as a scholar and \nin advancing equity for women.\n  Mariafranca has incredible energy. In fact, in 1985, the Burlington \nProfessional Women honored her as one of Vermont's Most Exciting Women.\n  She never slows down. Earlier this month, Governor Dean of Vermont \nappointed Dr. Morselli to the state Affirmative Action Council.\n  I applaud her tireless efforts to improve the world in which we live. \nI am proud to call Dr. Mariafranca Morselli my friend. I also want to \nmention how much her friendship meant to my late mother, Alba Leahy. My \nmother always enjoyed her conversation with Dr. Morselli. She \nespecially enjoyed them because she could use her native tongue, \nItalian.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks an \narticle from the Burlington Free Press be included in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Sept. 7, 1998]\n\n                  Scientist Continues Activist Duties\n\n\n           Dean appoints retired educator to advisory council\n\n                            (By Susan Green)\n\n       As the sole female on the faculty of the University of \n     Vermont's botany department for almost 25 years, Mariafranca \n     Morselli was determined to give her gender a boost.\n       Gov. Howard Dean has appointed the South Burlington \n     resident to the Affirmative Action Council, a 15-member \n     advisory board that examines issues of equal opportunity for \n     minorities in the state.\n       ``She's a tremendous asset,'' Dean said of the 75-year old \n     Morselli, who is a native of Italy. ``I recognize her \n     important efforts to advance women in the field of science.''\n       The Milan-born educator also advanced Vermont's maples for \n     more than two decades, from 1964 through 1988, as a research \n     professor familiar with the trees and the people who tap \n     them. After she retired from teaching, Morselli continued her \n     involvement with the industry through projects for the North \n     American Maple Syrup Council. In 1991, she became the only \n     woman ever elected to the National Maple Museum Hall of Fame.\n       ``When I first started, I felt quite humble,'' she said of \n     her foray into the largely male world of maple production. \n     ``Vermonters did not pay much attention to a scientist who is \n     a woman who came from another country. But I was working for \n     them and got their trust.''\n       During an otherwise privileged childhood, Morselli adopted \n     a feminist perspective because her mother was ``a society \n     belle who imparted a stern sense of duty in life and work,'' \n     she said.\n       With her husband-to-be, Mario, she came to the United \n     States just after World War II. Although not romantically \n     attached at the time, they both taught at an Illinois \n     college: His field was chemistry, before he turned to writing \n     about military history; hers were zoology and botany.\n       The couple moved to Italy and married in 1949. They \n     returned to America eight years later, living in New York and \n     skiing in Stowe.\n       The purchase of a Danville farm in 1959 provided the \n     impetus for the Morsellis to make Vermont their full-time \n     home in the early 1960's. They have three grown daughters, \n     including state archaeologist Giovanna Peebles, and four \n     grandchildren.\n       Morselli, who is chairwoman of the American Association of \n     University Women's public policy committee and serves as \n     environmental coordinator for the League of Women Voters, is \n     constantly on the go. In her spacious condo near Kennedy \n     Drive, the phone keeps ringing and the fax is always humming.\n       ``I have tremendous energy,'' she said, referring to her \n     extensive community service. ``I think it comes from my \n     Yankee/northern Italian stock.''\n       The other clue to Morselli's activism might be her sense of \n     free will. ``I always told my students, `You are your \n     destiny,' '' she said.\n       Beyond that, ``I love my work. I love my husband. I love my \n     family. Love has been the motif of my life.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/15/senate-section/article/S10379-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10380-S10381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, 1998 is a very special year for \ncelebrating Hispanic roots in New Mexico. This year we are \ncommemorating the 400th anniversary of the first permanent Settlement \nin the Southwest, which took place in the Espanola Valley near San Juan \nPueblo of New Mexico in 1598.\n  Dozens of meaningful and beautiful events have already been held in \nhonor of this anniversary. I participated in a particularly stirring \nevent at the San Gabriel Chapel in Espanola last spring. The Spanish \nMayor of Espanola, Richard Lucero, organized a very special event with \nGovernor Earl Salazar of San Juan Pueblo and Governor Walter Dasheno of \nSanta Clara Pueblo to unveil the design for a commemorative stamp \nfeaturing the San Gabriel Chapel and the ``Spanish Settlement of the \nSouthwest--1598.'' This is 22 years before the Pilgrims landed at \nPlymouth Rock.\n  The Governors and the Mayor exchanged stories about the importance of \ntheir respective cultures to each other. All those present were moved \nby the stories of lasting friendships formed on baseball fields, and \nmarriages between Indians and Hispanics. There were also strong \nexpressions of Hispanic and Indian intent to keep forging their futures \ntogether, along with the Anglo culture. I wish those meaningful stories \nand moments could have been enjoyed first hand by more New Mexicans.\n  In July, I was back in Espanola for annual fiesta and the official \nfirst sale of the United States commemorative stamp. This starkly \nbeautiful stamp has done more than I first imagined to bring a new \nunity to the historic Espanola Valley. Both the Spanish and Indian \ncultures in this valley have openly expressed and celebrated the \npositive aspects of bringing two distinct cultures together.\n  The Quarto Centenario, or 400th Anniversary, is a most vital and \nmemorable commemorative year for New Mexicans and for our nation. New \nMexico's newspapers are reporting many of the historical details of the \nearly Spanish colonization of the Southwest. Educators and museums are \nproviding many opportunities to revisit our state history through \nmusic, dance, and lectures.\n  The Archdiocese of Santa Fe has recently published ``Four Hundred \nYears of Faith.'' This fascinating review of the critical role of the \nCatholic Church in shaping the culture of New Mexico is well told and \nbeautifully illustrated, including photographs of all the Catholic \nChurches in New Mexico.\n  Don Juan de Onate, the original Spanish colonizer, was accompanied by \nthe Sons of St. Francis who walked into northern New Mexico with Onate \nin 1598. As described in the book from the Archdiocese, ``What resulted \nfrom the first struggles was nothing less than the birth of New Mexico \nculture and Catholicism that can truly be called indigenous to this \nland. The reconciliation between the Spanish and Indian people produced \na faith capable of adapting to different circumstances, as well as \nbeing inclusive of the many different peoples already present and those \nthat would follow.''\n  ``The eminent Pueblo scholar Professor Joe Sando has written of these \npositive accomplishments. He notes that the Pueblo Indians have fared \nmuch better under the Spanish than the Indians on the East Coast of the \nUnited States. There are no Indian markets in Boston or New York. Their \nIndian culture was pretty well destroyed. In New Mexico, Indian culture \nstill flourishes.''\n  Spain has also been an active participant in the Quarto Centenario. \nThe Vice President of Spain, Francisco Alvarez-Cascos, and the Spanish \nAmbassador to the United States, Antonio de Oyarzabal, and their \ndelegation visited key Spanish historic sites in New Mexico last \nspring.\n  This Spanish delegation traveled to Espanola and San Juan Pueblo, \nwhere Onate's original expedition established the first Spanish \nsettlement in the Southwest. A powerful reconciliation meeting was held \nwith New Mexico Pueblo Indian leaders at San Juan Pueblo.\n  At this historic meeting, Indian leaders stressed the beneficial \naspects of Spanish settlement, like art, agriculture, trading, \ngovernment, and the\n\n[[Page S10381]]\n\nintroduction of Catholicism. The Indian proclamation, however, also \nstated that the period of settlement ``brought great suffering and \npain'' for both the Pueblo people and the colonizers.\n  This day of reconciliation in late April focused on forging stronger \nties between Spain and the Indian pueblos, with the promise of \neducational, economic development and cultural opportunities.\n  As a follow-up to the promises of this historic reconciliation, \nhundreds of New Mexicans, are planning to go to Spain in November on a \ntrade and cultural exchange mission.\n  The Spanish Vice President Alvarez-Cascos summarized the day in his \nremark that, ``We are the sons of our past history, but we are also the \nfathers of our future.'' He said the two peoples ``want to know each \nother better to build a new friendship.''\n  A sacred buffalo dance was performed by Pueblo dancers with men \nwearing authentic buffalo headdresses. Hundreds of New Mexicans \nattended this outdoor event on the San Juan Pueblo Plaza in spite of \nthe blustery weather. The spirit of unity and harmony was apparent to \nall who attended.\n  Thus the original site where Onate met the Ohkay Owingeh Indians, \nPlace of the Strong People, and renamed their home San Juan de los \nCaballeros (hence, the San Juan Indians), was also the sight of a \npowerful reconciliation meeting 400 years after Onate proclaimed it the \ncapitol of the Kingdom of New Mexico.\n  The Spanish delegation also visited the site of the future Hispanic \nCultural Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico. As planned, this will be \nour nation's largest Hispanic cultural center.\n  To build this national and international cultural center, local \npublic and private contributions have been raised, exceeding $20 \nmillion. These funds will build an art gallery, museum, restaurant, \nballroom, ampitheater, and literary arts center.\n  Federal money of about $18 million will be used to match these local \ncontributions and to build the planned Hispanic Performing Arts Center. \nAltogether, approximately $40 million will be invested in this new \ncultural and educational attraction featuring the many aspects of \nHispanic culture, history, and arts.\n  We New Mexicans are looking forward to this new showcase for Hispanic \nart, dance, music, food, and history. I feel a new pride among \nHispanics of New Mexico as they prepare to offer this new treasure for \nthe enjoyment of visitors from all over America and the world.\n  In master calendars of New Mexico events for the Cuarto Centenario, \nover 180 events are listed. These range in purpose from lectures and \nreenactments to cultural performances, and parades. Prominent New \nMexico women in the arts, politics, and education will be featured in \n``Nuestra Mujeras'' (Our Women). The ``Dia de La Raza'' (Day of \nHispanics) will be a major event in October with events at the \nUniversity of New Mexico, the new Albuquerque Civic Plaza, and the \nAlbuquerque Museum. When moving events like these are attended and \nremembered, New Mexico and America will have a better sense of pride in \nits Spanish roots.\n  As our nation celebrates and acknowledges Hispanic Heritage Month in \n1998, I wish to commend the thousands of New Mexicans who have worked \nso hard to bring their Spanish heritage to the forefront during the \nCuarto Centenario--the 400th anniversary of the first permanent Spanish \nsettlement in the Southwest. Americans can be grateful for these fine \nmoments of remembrance, reconciliation, and cultural gems for creating \na stronger future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/15/senate-section/article/S10380-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:25 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 892.

A bill to amend the Federal Land Policy and Management Act \nof 1976 to exempt the holder of a right-of-way on public lands granted, \nissued, or renewed for an electric energy generation, transmission, or \ndistribution system from certain strict liability requirements \notherwise imposed in connection with such a right-of-way; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                       rights-of-way legislation\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Daschle, Smith of Oregon, Baucus, Burns, Johnson, and Craig, \nin introducing legislation making an important adjustment to the way \nthe Government manages rights-of-way over federal lands. The provisions \nin this bill address the situation involving liability standards for \nelectric utilities that utilize federal rights-of-ways to provide \nelectricity to rural communities.\n\n  I am pleased to be working on this issue with my good friends and \ncolleagues from Oregon, Bob Smith and Peter DeFazio. Chairman Smith has \nintroduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives, which \nreceived a hearing in the House Resources Committee earlier this year. \nDuring that hearing, one of my constituents, Mr. Bill Kopacz of \nMidstate Electric in LaPine, Oregon testified on the need to reform the \ncurrent federal policy of requiring strict liability for fires that \noccur in right-of-ways.\n  Under strict liability, the holder of a right of way is responsible \nfor all injury, loss, or damage, including fire suppression costs, \ncaused by the holder of the right of way without regard to the holder's \nnegligence.\n  The problem that this legislation addresses is best illustrated by \nthe experience of the Midstate Electric Cooperative of LaPine, Oregon.\n  As a matter of prudent maintenance, Midstate trims or removes trees \non right-of-ways that pose a risk of falling onto electric lines. On \nfederal rights-of-way, the cooperative consults with the appropriate \nland management agency--which of course must approve these management \nactions. After proposing the removal of a number of trees on a Forest \nService right-of-way in 1984, Midstate was told by the agency that it \ncould cut some down, but had to leave other specified trees standing. \nOf course the predictable happened--one of the trees that Midstate had \nproposed cutting, which the Forest Service had refused to allow to be \nremoved, fell into a power line and started a fire.\n  In the end it cost more than $326,850 to put that fire out--and \nMidstate Electric got the bill. Since the fire resulted from a \nmanagement decision of the Forest Service, Midstate went to court in an \nattempt to appropriately assign the financial liability of fighting the \nfire. Midstate lost the court action because of a ruling which \ninterpreted right-of-way contracts as holding the co-op and other \nright-of-way lessees to a strict liability standard.\n  The 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act provided federal \nagencies with the authority to impose strict liability for costs \nassociated with hazards on federal lands. Prior to 1976, agencies \nrecovered costs associated with hazards, such as costs required to put \nout a fire, on the basis of normal negligence.\n  This bill would replace that strict liability standard in favor of a \nnormal negligence standard that is routinely used in private right-of-\nway contracts. The new standard will say: if you caused it, you are \nresponsible for it. Rural electric cooperatives, investor-owned \nutilities and municipalities are not looking to pass the buck to the \nAmerican taxpayer. If they are negligent in maintaining federal rights-\nof-way, they should bear the responsibility. However, by enforcing any \nstandard more rigid than that, the land management agencies are \npurposefully transferring cost to private citizens.\n  The minimum impact of the current strict liability policy is higher \nelectric rates for those rural communities who live in close proximity \nto public lands. The possibility exists, however, of even more punitive \nimpacts in the form of the loss of insurance coverage for entities with \nfederal rights-of-way liability.\n  In my judgement, this legislation restores an appropriate balance to \nthe shared responsibility of both the land manager and the utility in \nreducing the natural hazards along a right of\n\n[[Page S10384]]\n\nway. As we saw in the Midstate case, because the Forest Service bears \nno exposure to costs associated with fire and risk prevention, the \nForest Service simply did not allow the full use of measures to reduce \nthose risks.\n  This legislation will not only benefit the state of Oregon. Utilities \nall through the United States have rights-of-way permits with our land \nmanagement agencies. This proposal is of interest in states such as \nCalifornia, Idaho, Florida, Minnesota, Montana, Wyoming and \nPennsylvania. I believe my proposal is fair and balanced legislation \nthat protects our rural communities. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues and the Administration to perfect this legislation in the \nwaning days of the 105th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX:\n  S. 2473. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the deduction for meal and entertainment expenses of small \nbusinesses; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                            tax legislation\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I introduce a very important bill \nfor small businesses and the self-employed in Louisiana and throughout \nour country. My bill would restore the 80 percent deduction for \nbusiness meals and entertainment expenses, thus eliminating a tax \nburden that has seriously hampered many small businesses in our \ncountry.\n  Small business is a powerful economic engine, both nationwide and in \nLouisiana. Small businesses have helped to create the prosperity that \nwe have all enjoyed in the last few years. They are leaders in the \ninnovation and technology development that will sustain our economy in \nthe 21st century. Nationwide, small business employs 53 percent of the \nprivate work force, contributes 47 percent of all sales in the country, \nand is responsible for 50 percent of the private gross domestic \nproduct.\n  For these reasons, I believe the tax code should encourage, not \ndiscourage, small business development and growth. For the more than \n225,000 self-employed and for the thousands of small businesses in \nLouisiana, business meals and entertainment take the place of \nadvertising, marketing, and conference meetings. These expenses are a \ncore business development cost. As such, a large percentage of these \ncosts should be deductible.\n  For many years, businesses were allowed to deduct 100 percent of \nbusiness meals and entertainment expenses. In 1987, this deduction was \nreduced to 80 percent. The deduction was further reduced in 1994 to 50 \npercent because of the misconception that these meals were ``three \nmartini lunches.''\n  Contrary to this perception, studies show that the primary \nbeneficiary of the business meal deduction is not the wealthy business \nperson. Studies indicate that over two-thirds of the business meal \nspenders have incomes of less than $60,000 and 37 percent have incomes \nbelow $40,000. Low to moderately priced restaurants are the most \npopular types for business meals, with the average check equaling less \nthan $20. In addition, 50 percent of most business meals occur in small \ntowns and rural areas.\n  In 1995, just one year after the deduction was reduced to 50 percent, \nthe White House Conference on Small Business established the \nrestoration of the deduction as one of its top priorities for boosting \nsmall business. In Louisiana alone, it is expected that the positive \neconomic impact of this proposal could exceed $67 million in \nindustries, such as the travel and restaurant industry, that employ \nover 120,000 people. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2473\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SMALL BUSINESSES ALLOWED INCREASED DEDUCTION FOR \n                   MEAL AND ENTERTAINMENT EXPENSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (n) of section 274 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to only 50 percent of \n     meal and entertainment expenses allowed as deduction) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(4) Special rule for small businesses.--\n       ``(A) In general.--In the case of any taxpayer which is a \n     small business, paragraph (1) shall be applied by \n     substituting `the applicable percentage (as defined in \n     paragraph (3)(B))' for `50 percent'.\n       ``(B) Small business.--For purposes of this paragraph, the \n     term `small business' means, with respect to expenses paid or \n     incurred during any taxable year--\n       ``(i) any corporation which meets the requirements of \n     section 55(e)(1) for such year, and\n       ``(ii) any partnership or sole proprietorship which would \n     meet such requirements if it were a corporation.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1998.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 2475. A bill to amend title IV of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 to protect the rights of participants and \nbeneficiaries of terminated pension plans; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n            pension plan participant protection act of 1998\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto strengthen protections to retirees who, through no fault of their \nown, find themselves without a job or the pension they worked hard for \nbecause their company went under.\n  This situation happened in 1991 when Pan Am World Airways went out of \nbusiness leaving 45,000 employees--15,000 of which reside in New York \nState--jobless and without their promised pensions. For the last seven \nyears these hardworking Americans have fought a losing battle with the \nPension Benefits Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to get a fair benefit \ncalculation and appeals process. In addition to former Pan Am \nemployees, this issue affects hundreds of thousands of former employees \nof companies whose pension plans have been taken over by the PBGC.\n  Our senior citizens are a valuable resource to this country. Many of \nthem are entitled to receive private pensions as a result of their \nloyal years of service to their employers. In 1974, the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act (ERISA) was enacted to provide certain \nbasic protections to retirees regarding their pensions.\n  In general, private employers are required to act as fiduciaries with \nrespect to most of their activities in connection with their pension \nplans. Those fiduciaries are prohibited from commingling plan assets, \nmust provide regular disclosure concerning plan assets and are required \nto act ``solely in the interest'' of the participants. Participants may \nbring suit, in Federal Court, if required information is not provided \nwithin 30 days of request. A participant may seek a determination of \nthe amount of his or her benefit, in Federal Court, if the plan fails \nor refuses to render a determination as to the amount of benefit the \nparticipant is entitled to receive under the plan.\n  ERISA also created a Federal agency, the PBGC, to pay benefits to \nparticipants in pension plans who are unable to pay such benefits. PBGC \nfunctions as an insurer, collecting premiums from solvent plans and \npaying benefits to participants in failed plans. Since the enactment of \nERISA, the PBGC has become the Trustee of plans involving more than one \nmillion participants.\n  While the PBGC does an admirable job with respect to its obligations \nto continue payments to participants in terminated plans, those \nparticipants do not enjoy the same legal protections guaranteed to all \nplan participants under ERISA. In general, PBGC performs its functions \nas a government agency and not as a fiduciary.\n  Mr. President, in plans trusteed by the PBGC, participants have no \nright to disclosure regarding the amount of their benefits and may not \nappeal an adverse determination until an appealable decision is \nrendered--which in many cases does not occur for more than ten years. \nOnce issued, the PBGC decisions must be appealed within 45 days or a \nparticipant may lose all rights. If a determination is appealed, \nparticipants must follow a complicated and time consuming appeals \nprocess. Many of our senior citizens are confused and overwhelmed by \nthis process and as a result, inadvertently surrender many valuable \nlegal rights.\n  In addition, under current law, the PBGC is permitted to commingle \nfunds from all of the retirement plans that it terminates and may use \nthose retirement funds to pay for expenses of other\n\n[[Page S10385]]\n\nplans as well as its general overhead expenses.\n  At a minimum, our senior citizens, in plans trusteed by the PBGC, \nneed and deserve the same protections accorded to every other \nparticipant in a plan covered by ERISA. This bill restores some of \nthose protections and requires that the PBGC issue an appealable \ndecision within one year of the date the PBGC becomes the Trustee of a \nplan. The bill provides for the establishment of participants' \ncommittees to represent the interests of the participants and permits \nsuch committee to serve as Trustee of the terminated plan. Where more \nthan one group seeks appointment as Trustee the federal courts would be \nrequired to select the Trustee that would best serve the interests of \nthe participants.\n  My bill also establishes a participant advocates office to assist \nparticipants with explanations, benefits disputes and, if necessary, to \nappeal adverse determinations by the PBGC. In addition, the bill \nclarifies existing law, empowering the federal courts to remove a \nTrustee in the event the Trustee commits any breach of it fiduciary \nduty.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2475\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill for the relief of Wei Jengsheng; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                wei jengsheng freedom of conscience act\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I seek my colleagues' \nsupport for the Wei Jengsheng Freedom of Conscience Act. This bill will \ngrant lawful permanent residence to writer and philosopher Wei \nJengsheng, one of the most heroic individuals the international human \nrights community has known.\n  For years, Mr. President, Wei has stood up to an oppressive Chinese \ngovernment, calling for freedom and democracy through speeches, \nwritings, and as a prominent participant in the Democracy Wall \nmovement. His dedication to the principles we hold dear, and on which \nour nation was founded, brought him 15 years of torture and \nimprisonment at the hands of the Chinese communist regime. Seriously \nill, Wei was released only after great international public outcry. Now \nessentially exiled, he lives in the United States on a temporary visa \nand cannot return to China without facing further imprisonment.\n  Mr. President, granting Wei permanent residence will show that \nAmerica stands by those who are willing to stand up for the principles \nwe cherish. It also will help Wei in his continuing fight for freedom \nand democracy in China.\n  I woul like to thank Senators Hatch, DeWine, Hutchinson, and \nBrownback for cosponsoring this bill. I should note also that this \nlegislation has been endorsed by important human rights groups such as \nLaogai Research Foundation and Human Rights in China.\n  I urge my colleagues to send a strong signal about America's \ncommitment to human rights, human freedom, and the dignity of the \nindividual by passing this bill to grant Wei Jengsheng lawful permanent \nresidence in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/15/senate-section/article/S10383-5", "month": "09", "year":

                      MS. MONICA LEWINSKY\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 276\n\n       Whereas, on January 17, 1998, President Clinton testified \n     in a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Paula Jones and \n     denied a sexual relationship with a former White House intern \n     Monica Lewinsky;\n       Whereas, President Clinton's personal lawyer, David \n     Kendall, stated on September 13, 1998 that the President \n     ``absolutely'' sought to mislead Ms. Jones's lawyers in the \n     January 17 deposition;\n       Whereas, during a January 26, 1998 White House news \n     conference, President Clinton stated, ``I did not have sexual \n     relations with that woman, Ms. Lewinsky'';\n       Whereas, President Clinton invoked Executive Privilege in \n     an effort to limit grand jury questioning of aides Bruce \n     Lindsey, Sidney Blumenthal, Cheryl Mills, Nancy Hernreich and \n     Lanny Breuer;\n       Whereas, none of President Clinton's claims of Executive \n     Privilege were ever supported by the courts;\n       Whereas, on May 22, a federal judge denied a previous \n     motion by the President to prevent Secret Service agents from \n     being compelled to testify before a grand jury;\n       Whereas, on July 7, 1998, a federal appeals court denied \n     the President's appeal and ruled that Secret Service \n     employees must tell the grand jury what they observed by \n     guarding the President;\n       Whereas, on July 29, 1998, President Clinton agreed to \n     testify from the White House in response to a subpoena issued \n     by the Independent Counsel's office;\n       Whereas, on August 17, 1998, President Clinton testified \n     before a grand jury and made an address to the nation \n     admitting ``an improper relationship'' with Monica Lewinsky;\n       Whereas, the President has unnecessarily and improperly \n     prolonged the investigation of Independent Counsel Kenneth \n     Starr;\n       Whereas, the President knowingly provided inaccurate \n     information in a sworn deposition and in public statements \n     about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky;\n       Whereas, the President invoked improper claims of Executive \n     Privilege, attorney-client privilege and Secret Service \n     privileges: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that President Clinton \n     has unnecessarily delayed the investigation of the \n     Independent Counsel, and\n       (2) President Clinton should reimburse the American \n     taxpayer for the costs associated with the Independent \n     Counsel's investigation of his relationship with Ms. \n     Lewinsky.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, last Friday, Congress and the American \npeople were finally able to read the 445-page report on the \ninvestigation of the independent counsel, Judge Kenneth Starr. It is \nnow, of course, the constitutional duty of the House of Representatives \nto review that report and determine whether the articles of \nimpeachment, censure, or whatever action, are indeed warranted against \nthe President.\n  I rise today not to discuss that specific issue of impeachment or \ncensure, but I rise today to discuss the issue of equity. For the last \n7 months, due to the actions of the President--and I might add, the \nPresident alone--substantial costs have accumulated as a result of the \nPresident's intentional strategy. And that strategy is to delay and \nthwart the investigations of Judge Kenneth Starr.\n  Mr. President, I think it is the duty of this body to discuss and \nreflect on the cost that has been borne by the American public as a \nresult of the calculated deception that has gone on for the last 7 \nmonths. Certainly, it has been evidenced by the report that it was a \ndeception, a deception to cover up and delay. It is clear that after \nthe President testified on January 17 in Paula Jones' sexual harassment \nlawsuit that the President began a calculated plan to mislead and \nbasically deceive the independent counsel and the American public with \nhis ``legally accurate'' testimony in the Jones case.\n  Indeed, when the President's attorney, David Kendall, was asked \nyesterday if the President was purposely attempting to mislead the \nattorneys for Paula Jones during his sworn deposition, he replied \n``absolutely.''\n  Mr. President, it has been 7 months now, 7 months since President \nClinton sought to prevent the independent counsel from determining the \nveracity of his statements. Despite the fact that the Clinton \nadministration issued a statement in 1994 that the administration would \nnot invoke executive privilege for any personal wrongdoings, the \nPresident withdrew and reasserted claims of executive privilege on five \nspecific occasions. These claims were warrantless and served as nothing \nmore than a delay tactic. In fact, not one of the claims of executive \nprivilege was found by a court of law to be justified.\n  As a result of the President's plan for public deception--I hate to \nuse that word, but I can't put it in any other term--and certainly \ndelay, the investigation of independent counsel Starr was unnecessarily \nprolonged for approximately 7 months, despite the fact that the \nPresident, in January of 1998, promised, promised, the Congress and the \nAmerican public to cooperate fully with the investigation.\n  Lastly, the President refused six invitations to voluntarily testify \nbefore the independent counsel's grand jury. It was only when he was \nfaced with the subpoena and the result of the DNA test and the reality \nthat the tests would soon be completed that the President finally \nappeared before the grand jury.\n  Where are we? What does all this really mean? It means that for more \nthan 7 months, President Clinton has pursued a strategy of deceiving \nthe American people and the Congress and purposely delayed and impeded \nthe independent counsel's investigation. The cost of the President's \ncampaign of delay and deception totals nearly $4.4 million.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter from the Office of the Independent \nCounsel be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                            Office of the Independent Counsel,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 11, 1998.\n     Mr. David L. Clark,\n     Director, Audit Oversight and Liaison, U.S. General \n         Accounting Office, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Clark: This is in response to Senator Frank \n     Murkowski's letter to you dated September 3, 1998, requesting \n     certain costs incurred by this Office relating to the Monica \n     Lewinsky investigation. In your meeting with personnel in our \n     Office on September 4, 1998, we agreed to provide you with \n     answers to the Senator's questions as accurately as possible. \n     As we mentioned in that meeting, our financial accounting \n     system does not categorize costs by case, or project. \n     Therefore, we determined the cost by estimating the time \n     spent on the Lewinsky investigation by all staff members. \n     Further, the Lewinsky portion of certain general costs was \n     allocated based on those estimates.\n       The enclosed spreadsheet displays a Summary of Expenses \n     relating to the Lewinsky investigation. The expenses are \n     categorized in the same manner as our Financial Statements \n     shown in GAO's audit reports. Work on the Lewinsky \n     investigation continues today and many members of our staff \n     are still working on this matter. For purposes of this \n     request, we chose to account for costs recorded through \n     August 31, 1998. Subsequent costs have not yet been recorded. \n     To include them here would decrease the accuracy of the costs \n     we have computed. Should the Senator request costs after \n     August 31, we will certainly update the enclosed Summary.\n       In response to question 1 of Senator Murkowski's letter: \n     for the period January 15 through August 31, 1998, Lewinsky-\n     related investigation costs for personnel compensation and \n     benefits (including employees and detailees) are $1,861,456. \n     Contract Services (including consultants) costs are $884,110. \n     Most incumbent members of this Office have devoted more than \n     50% of their time to the Lewinsky matter. Many staff members \n     over the past eight months, both old and new, have worked \n     considerable overtime hours,\n\n[[Page S10388]]\n\n     most of which were related to the Lewinsky investigation and \n     many were for uncompensated attorney-hours.\n       Question 2 of the letter requests the cost of witnesses \n     associated with the Lewinsky investigation. These costs \n     amount to $13,841, which is included in the Summary, under \n     various categories.\n       Question 3 of the letter, Lewinsky-related travel costs, is \n     shown in the Summary as $949,895.\n       Should you or the Senator's office have any questions about \n     the estimate, please call Paul Rosenzweig or me at 202-514-\n     8688.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Jackie M.

The total is $4.3 million, roughly \n$4.4 million. That is the cost to the American taxpayer.\n  The question that I brought up earlier was one of equity. Equity \ndemands the costs of the delays should be borne by the President and \nnot the taxpayers of this country.\n  I ask that my colleagues support me in the resolution that I have \nsubmitted which would require the President to reimburse the American \ntaxpayers for the expenses that resulted from the delays of the \ninvestigation, the delays that were initiated and caused directly by \nthe President.\n  My colleagues should note that this resolution is not unprecedented. \nWe, in Congress, have required Members under investigation by the \nEthics Committee to reimburse the committee for the costs of the \ninvestigation. The same standard should apply in the case of the \nPresident of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/15/senate-section/article/S10387-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 277--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT \n   TO THE IMPORTANCE OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC ISLAND \n                                NATIONS\n\n  Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Byrd, \nMr. Thomas, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Roth, Mr. Ford, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nMurkowski, and Mr. Sessions) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 277\n\n       Whereas the South Pacific region covers an immense area of \n     the earth, approximately 3 times the size of the contiguous \n     United States;\n       Whereas the United States seeks to maintain strong and \n     enduring economic, political, and strategic ties with the \n     Pacific island countries of the region, despite the reduced \n     diplomatic presence of the United States in the region since \n     World War II;\n       Whereas Pacific island nations wield control over vast \n     tracts of the ocean, including seabed minerals, fishing \n     rights, and other marine resources which will play a major \n     role in the future of the global economy;\n       Whereas access to these valuable resources will be vital in \n     maintaining the position of the United States as the leading \n     world power in the new millennium;\n       Whereas Asian countries have already recognized the \n     important role that these Pacific island nations will play in \n     the future of the global economy, as evidenced by the Tokyo \n     summit meeting in October 1997 with various Pacific island \n     heads of state;\n       Whereas the Pacific has long been regarded as one of the \n     ``last frontiers'', with an enormous wealth of uncultivated \n     resources; and\n       Whereas direct United States participation in the human and \n     natural resource development of the South Pacific region \n     would promote beneficial ties with these Pacific island \n     nations and increase the possibilities of access to the \n     region's valuable resources: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) it is in the national interest of the United States to \n     remain actively engaged in the South Pacific region as a \n     means of supporting important United States commercial and \n     strategic interests, and to encourage the consolidation of \n     democratic values;\n       (2) a Pacific island summit, hosted by the President of the \n     United States with the Pacific island heads of government, \n     would be an excellent opportunity for the United States to \n     foster and improve diplomatic relations with the Pacific \n     island nations;\n       (3) through diplomacy and participation in the human and \n     natural resource development of the Pacific region, the \n     United States will increase the possibility of gaining access \n     to valuable resources, thus strengthening the position of the \n     United States as a world power economically and strategically \n     in the new millennium; and\n       (4) the United States should fulfill its longstanding \n     commitment to the democratization and economic prosperity of \n     the Pacific island nations by promoting their earliest \n     integration in the mainstream of bilateral, regional, and \n     global commerce and trade.\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that \ntoday, along with Mr. Akaka, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \nThomas, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Roth, Mr. Ford, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Murkowski and \nMr. Sessions to submit the Pacific Island Summit Resolution.\n  Since the end of World War II, the U.S. has lacked a strong \ndiplomatic policy and presence in the Pacific Region. This has become \nmore prevalent in recent years. Often characterized as a policy of \n``benign neglect,'' the current situation is insufficient to continue \nthe role of the U.S. as the leading world power as we enter the new \nmillennium.\n  The Pacific region covers an immense area of the Earth, approximately \nthree times that of the contiguous United States. Increasing \nenforcement of treaties demarcating exclusive economic zones are \nrevealing Pacific Island countries that wield control over vast tracts \nof the ocean, marine fisheries and undersea minerals; resources that \nwill play a major role in the future of the global economy.\n  As natural resources around the world dwindle, access to the \nrelatively untapped resources in this region of the world will become \nincreasingly important. The U.S., as the leading world power, should \nseek to maintain strong ties to this region. By cultivating diplomatic \nrelationships with these leaders today, we foster strong economic ties \ntomorrow.\n  In October 1997, then-Prime Minister Hashimoto held a summit meeting \nin Tokyo, Japan with various Pacific Island heads of state. Clearly, \nJapan is aware of the unlimited potential of this region, its valuable \nresources, and the importance of gaining access to them. It is \neconomically and strategically important that we not stand idly by \nwhile other countries step into the vacuum created by the present U.S. \npolicy.\n  This resolution, Mr. President, encompasses all of these ideas in \nexpressing the sense of the United States Senate that a summit meeting \nbetween the President and leaders from the Pacific region would be an \nexcellent opportunity for the U.S. to strengthen its position \neconomically and strategically. These Pacific Islands in return will be \nprovided the rare opportunity to share their interests, visions for the \nfuture, and concerns with the leader of the world's most powerful \ndemocracy. It is my sincere belief that this summit will rebuild a \nfoundation neglected since the end of World War II and be the beginning \nof a mutually beneficial relationship between the U.S. and this great \nregion.\n  Congressman Eni Faleomavaega introduced similar legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives, which speaks to the importance of developing \nand maintaining close diplomatic and economic ties with the Pacific and \nthat a Pacific Island Summit would aid the U.S. considerably in \nattaining this goal. It is my hope that this legislation will be \nconsidered and approved in both chambers expeditiously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/15/senate-section/article/S10388-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10388-S10389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                BUMPERS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3591\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Ms. Landrieu) proposed\n\n[[Page S10389]]\n\nan amendment to the bill (S. 2237) making appropriations for the \nDepartment of the Interior and related agencies for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike line 19 on page 55 through line 6 on page 58.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  ENZI (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3592\n\n  Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \nAshcroft, Mr. Grams, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Bryan, and Mr. Reid) proposed an \namendment to the bill, S. 2237, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, as we approach a new century, we \nfind ourselves in a year of multiple milestones.\n\n[[Page S10390]]\n\nThis year, the world celebrates the 50th anniversary of the founding of \nthe State of Israel, and we also congratulate the pioneering Florida-\nIsrael Institute on its 10-year anniversary.\n  The Florida-Israel Institute, created by the Florida Legislature in \n1988 to expand ties with Israel, has been a success by any measure:\n  Catalyst. Now 23 other states have official links with Israel. \nFlorida set the pace, and its Florida-Israel Institute continues to \nserve as a model for the rest of the nation.\n  Trade boom. Total trade between Florida and Israel tripled between \n1987 and 1996, with dramatic increases in exports from Florida to \nIsrael and imports from Israel, according to federal statistics.\n  Cultural bridge. The Florida-Israel Institute brings Israel to \nFlorida and Florida to Israel, via the arts, business, academia and \nresearch on topics of mutual interest that include agriculture and the \nenvironment.\n  Examples span the spectrum of the human experience. The Institute \nbrought Israeli jazz pianist Liz Magnes to Florida, and sent Florida \nprofessors to Israel and Jordan. It helped sponsor the one-woman show \n``Nomi'' at the University of Central Florida, and sent Florida \nbusiness leaders to Israel.\n  A premier feature of the Florida-Israel Institute is scholarship. The \nInstitute carries out the time-honored precept that knowledge is a key \nto human understanding and a powerful weapon against fear and hate.\n  The Florida-Israel Institute just awarded scholarships to 57 Israeli \nstudents for the 1998-99 academic year. These students will study on \ncampuses throughout Florida, enriching campus life for all and then \nserving as ambassadors for life, linking Florida and Israel. The \nInstitute--co-hosted by Florida Atlantic University and Broward \nCommunity College--has strong roots in education.\n  As a repeat visitor to the Middle East, I know there is no substitute \nfor first-hand experience in understanding the challenges facing \nIsrael. My wife, Adele, and I were honored to return to Israel this \nyear to help celebrate the 50th anniversary.\n  Likewise, the Florida academics, entrepreneurs and civic leaders who \nvisit Israel--thanks to the Florida-Israel Institute--bring back a \nkeener understanding and a deeper appreciation of our special \nrelationship with our ally State, Israel.\n  On this special 10-year milestone, I call on my colleagues to join me \nin saluting the founders, managers and advisory board of this exemplary \npublic-private partnership: the Florida-Israel Institute.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/15/senate-section/article/S10389-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO THE ARGUS CHAMPION\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, Not too many businesses last a \ngeneration or two, much less for 175 years, but the Argus Champion \nseems to be Energizer Bunny of the newspaper business. This longevity, \nwhich is rare, is due primarily to its commitment to the local \ncommunity. The Argus Champion has served its community well by \nproviding local news and national news of interest. As a result, the \nArgus Champion has developed a loyal following in its hometown of \nNewport and the surrounding areas.\n  Although the paper has had numerous owners, editors, reporters, and \nstaff over the years, the Argus Champion has consistently published a \nhigh-quality newspaper that reflects New Hampshire's traditions and \nheritage. The paper also has changed with the times, switching to color \nformats in 1997 and expanding news coverage in surrounding areas in an \neffort to bring a better product to more Granite Staters.\n  In many ways, our local newspaper is the chronicler of the times, \nprinting important stories about the local community and the people who \nlive in it. The Argus itself recognizes this special role, and each \nweek offers to its readers a variety of local historical information \nthrough a feature column. We look forward to seeing pictures of our \nneighbors and their children volunteering to raise money for a \nworthwhile cause, or participating in the Boys and Girls Scouts and the \nLittle League Baseball team. We also value our local paper for all of \nthe announcements about milestones in our lives, including weddings, \nbirths, deaths, promotions, and others. We also appreciate the \npolitical coverage provided to the community as it helps the voters \nmake informed decisions in the ballot booth and understand how the \nactions of their elected officials affect their everyday lives.\n  The Argus Champion has brought the community together by focusing on \nlocal news and it is that tradition that we celebrate today on the \n175th Anniversary of the paper's beginning. A warm congratulations to \nall of those who have contributed to the success of the Argus Champion \nand best wishes for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/15/senate-section/article/S10390-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO SISTER MARY MERCIA MORAN, R.S.M.\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an \noutstanding woman in Rhode Island, Sister Mary Mercia Moran, R.S.M., \nwho is celebrating her 50th year as a Religious Sister of Mercy.\n  Originally from New York City, Sister Mary Mercia entered the \nReligious Sisters of Mercy in Providence on September 8, 1948. She made \nher Final Profession on August 15, 1954. Sister Mary Mercia has \ndedicated her life to educating the children of the Diocese of \nProvidence. Since 1951, she has taught at several schools including: \nSt. Patrick in Providence, St. Matthew in Cranston, St. Mary in \nPawtucket and St. Brendan in East Providence. Since 1967, Sister Mary \nMercia has been teaching Second Grade at Sacred Heart School in East \nProvidence.\n  I was fortunate enough to be her student at St. Matthew's School. She \nwas, and is, an inspiring, demanding, and nurturing teacher. \nGenerations of Rhode Island children have prospered because of her \nfaithful dedication.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in commending Sister \nMary Mercia for her many contributions to the children of Rhode Island \nand selfless dedication to helping others. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/15/senate-section/article/S10390-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MARRIAGE PENALTY TAX\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my \ncolleagues to support the elimination of the marriage penalty tax. Our \nnation has recently witnessed violent assaults on children at school, \nan explosion of sexually explicit material on television and the \nInternet, and increasingly plentiful and inexpensive drugs. Now more \nthan ever, our nation needs strong families.\n  Unfortunately, our tax code encourages just the opposite. It \ndiscourages marriage and places an undue financial burden on couples, \nsimply for being married. According to the Congressional Budget Office, \n21 million married couples paid an average of $1,400 more in income \ntaxes in 1996 than they would have if they were single. This ``marriage \npenalty'' is immoral and patently unfair. We are sending the wrong \nmessage to the American people, and it's time for Congress to take \naction.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support the \nelimination of the marriage penalty tax as the centerpiece of upcoming \ntax legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/15/senate-section/article/S10390-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10390-S10391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMEMORATION OF SEPTEMBER'S HEALTH-RELATED EVENTS\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight National \nCaregivers Day.\n  As such, I wanted to show my appreciation to those who work so hard \nto meet the needs of the mentally and physically disabled, the elderly, \nand the terminally ill. Our nation is blessed to have individuals \nmotivated by a caring and giving attitude toward others.\n  Indeed, there are roughly 1.6 million elderly and disabled people in \nour nation receiving care in one of approximately 16,800 facilities \nthroughout the country and countless others providing in-home \nassistance. These thousands of individuals live each day loving, \nnurturing, and supporting those entrusted to their care and on behalf \nof the United States Senate, I want to say thank you.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to recognize other health-care \nrelated commemorations in the month of September: National \nRehabilitation Week, Mental Health Workers Week, National Vision \nRehabilitation Day, and Deaf Awareness Week.\n\n[[Page S10391]]\n\n  National Rehabilitation Week, September 13-19, gives us an \nopportunity to commend the nearly 43 million people with disabilities \nin America who daily display their courage and determination. It also \ncalls to our attention the unmet needs of our nation's disabled \ncitizens.\n  Mental Health Workers Week is set aside for us to thank those who \nhave dedicated their talents to improving the mental health of our \nnation. Nearly half of all Americans between the ages of 15 and 54 \nexperience a psychological disorder during their lifetime. \nPsychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers, and \nothers are there every day to help those Americans who are experiencing \nproblems pick up the pieces and move forward with their lives--truly \nimportant work.\n  September 16 is National Vision Rehabilitation Day, which recognizes \nthe tremendous lack of understanding we have of vision loss and the \nlack of availability of vision rehabilitation services. National Vision \nRehabilitation Day gives us the chance to promote aggressive education \nand treatment for people with vision problems. As the baby boom \ngeneration moves into the retirement years, we need to begin learning \nhow to deal with serious eye diseases like macular degeneration, which \ncurrently affects thousands of people and about which--when it comes to \ncauses and treatment--we know very little.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to recognize Deaf Awareness Week \nand the opportunity it provides to recognize the deaf culture \nexperienced by nearly one million Americans. Most people don't know \nthat American sign language is the third most widely used language in \nAmerica, and that Washington, D.C. is home to the only deaf university \nin the world, Gallaudet University. Deaf Awareness Week allows us to \ndiscover the significant contributions offered by individuals who \nhappen to be deaf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/15/senate-section/article/S10390-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO AL BEAUCHAMP\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ntrue public servant, a dedicated husband and father, a Rutland, Vermont \ncommunity leader, and a friend. I rise today to pay tribute to Al \nBeauchamp, who passed away on September 5, at the age of 72.\n  The eloquent editorial printed in the Rutland Daily Herald on \nTuesday, September 8, expresses best how much Al meant to the community \nof Rutland, and to the entire State of Vermont. I ask that the text of \nthat editorial be included in the Record. \n\n             [From the Rutland Daily Herald, Sept. 8, 1998]\n\n                              Al Beauchamp\n\n       Alfred J. Beauchamp of Rutland, who died on the weekend at \n     the age of 72, was one of those citizens who do a great deal \n     of work for a community but in such a quiet way that many \n     others in the community aren't aware of what he has \n     accomplished.\n       Whether it was in business, in civic work or in politics, \n     he was a master craftsman at achieving consensus and getting \n     things done.\n       His Rutland High School yearbook entry (Class of 1944) gave \n     a pretty good preview of what his career would be like. With \n     the high school nickname of ``Al-bo'' the notation takes up \n     17 lines of participation from freshman to senior years for \n     Alfred Joseph Beauchamp. Some examples:\n       ``Class president, 2,3; orchestra, 1,2,3,4; pit orchestra, \n     2,3,4; band, 1,2,3,4; president of band, 3; Student Council, \n     1,2,3,4; Student Council president, 4; home room president, \n     1; home room basketball, 1,2,3,4; National Honor Society, \n     3,4; varsity basketball, 4; varsity track, 3; all-state band, \n     1,2,4.''\n       There are a number of other entries in the list, but the \n     citations give an indication of very active participation in \n     the school community, a proclivity for community work that \n     was to continue throughout his life.\n       In 1944, the year Al Beauchamp graduated from high school, \n     the involvement of the United States in World War II was \n     reaching its climax. In those days, every able-bodied male \n     who reached the age of 18 knew what was in his immediate \n     future--he would be taken into the military. The only \n     question was whether the call would come in the July or \n     August after high school graduation.\n       Al Beauchamp didn't wait for the draft. He joined the \n     Merchant Marine, and in the course of his service was in a \n     number of wartime convoys.\n       After that there was college, entering the insurance \n     business, a family, and innumerable civic activities like the \n     local Chamber of Commerce, where he eventually became \n     president, and the United Way, to name just two.\n       As a member of the state Senate from Rutland County, Al \n     Beauchamp served two terms. He was also a trustee of his alma \n     mater, the University of Vermont, and was a member of several \n     other state boards.\n       At the end of his second Senate term there were a number of \n     people in Rutland, including the late publisher of the \n     Herald, Robert W. Mitchell, who felt he could be in line to \n     go on to be lieutenant governor, and eventually advance even \n     further.\n       But there was no question at the time, as is still the case \n     today, that continued involvement in politics means more and \n     more time spent away from close ties with family, so he chose \n     not to continue in that line.\n       True to his nature, he put family and community above \n     personal ambition. That was Al Beauchamp all the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/15/senate-section/article/S10391-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "15", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LEADER'S LECTURE SERIES\n\n  Mr. GORTON.
