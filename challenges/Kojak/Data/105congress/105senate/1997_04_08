Mr. President, several of us have asked this morning for \na half hour to talk about an item that is of particular interest now, \nand that is taxes. It is of particular interest because we are now \nclose to April 15, when taxes are more real to us all than they are at \nsome other times. We want to talk about taxes because they are part of \nthe Republican agenda. We have talked, over the years, about the idea \nof allowing families to spend more of their own money, allowing \nbusinesses to be able to invest and create jobs in the private sector. \nI think it is appropriate to talk about taxes because it has been an \narea of controversy--the idea of whether or not we ought to have an \neffort at tax relief at the same time we seek to balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, I am here to tell you that having been in my home \ndistrict in Wyoming over the past week, as most of us have, and having \na series of town meetings, the issue that came up most often is: What \nare you going to do\n\n[[Page S2804]]\n\nabout taxes? What are you going to do about the capital gains tax? What \nare you going to do about estate taxes or some tax relief for families \nto be able to help take care of their own children?\n  So I feel very strongly about it. Let me just say that too often when \nwe talk about taxes and the budget, I think it seems that we are \ntalking about arithmetic and bookkeeping when we talk about budgets. It \njust seems to me that when we talk about budgets, we are really talking \nabout something quite broader than that, and that is the direction of \nthis Government and whether or not we want to have more central \nGovernment, or whether we want to have less, whether we want to move \nmore of our activities back closer to people at the State and local \ngovernments, or whether we want to continue to build up more and more \nat the central Federal Government level.\n\n  With that concept, the philosophical direction that is inherent in \nthose decisions is also a decision about taxes and, I suspect, if \npossible, although we haven't done it for 30 years, to balance the \nbudget and to continue to spend at the same time. You do that by \nraising taxes. That is the way you do that. That is what the President \ndid several years ago, to move toward a balanced budget by continuing \nto spend but to raise taxes.\n  There is a philosophical difference of view. There are those who \nbelieve that we ought to have more Government, who believe that the \nGovernment actually spends money to a better advantage than people \nthemselves do, who believe that we ought to have more and more \nfunctions carried on at the Federal level in the central Government. \nThat is a legitimate point of view. I don't happen to share it.\n  I think, Mr. President, that quite often when we talk about the \ndetails of issues, really at the center of it is that issue of whether \nyou want more Government or whether you want less. It is a pretty basic \nphilosophical issue. That is what we are talking about here. It does \nseem to me that--No. 1, when you have a tax burden on the American \ncitizens that averages between 38 and 40 percent in taxes for families, \nthat is a heavy burden. That is a very heavy burden.\n  It seems to me, of course, that there are lots of ways in which we \ncan reduce the size of the Federal Government. We can contract, we can \nhave more things done in the private sector, and we can move more of it \nto the State government. There are a lot of the things out of the $1.7 \ntrillion budget we don't have to do. Many of those things have been \nthere forever and they just go on because they go on. I guess I am \nsuggesting that we ought to take a long look at that budget. In my \nview, one of the priorities for this Congress and for this Senate ought \nto be to balance the budget and provide tax relief for American \ncitizens. That is what it is all about, I believe, so we want to talk \nabout that.\n  There is a different view. There are those who, I think legitimately \nfrom a strategic point of view, say, ``Let us balance the budget \nfirst.'' That is OK, I guess, if you are committed then to doing the \ntax relief. However, I believe we ought to deal with them at the same \ntime. I am one who signed a letter--there were 16 of us, I believe--to \nthe leader saying that we ought to deal with the whole concept of the \nsize of the budget, how we balance the budget and how we give tax \nrelief to American families and to business. That seems to be what we \nought to do.\n  What did I hear about at home? I heard about capital gains taxes. I \nheard an awful lot about the idea that people would like to be able to \ninvest in businesses if they could make some profit over time, even if \nit is nothing more than inflation over time, and about paying taxes on \nthe investments for the inflation they have made. That discourages \nthem. We have a lot of small businesses in my State, as is true \neverywhere. Small business is the backbone of this economy. We have a \nlot of farmers and ranchers and families who have spent their whole \nlives putting together an estate in their ranch or farm. Now we find, \nquite often, because those are not really cash-flow cows--there is a \ngreat deal of asset value there, but not much cash--you have to dispose \nof that property in order to pay the taxes. You can't pass it on to \nyour family. There is a lot of concern about that.\n  Well, Mr. President, I have been joined by several of my associates \nto talk for a little bit about taxes this morning. So I yield to my \nfriend, the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the Senator \nfrom Wyoming for yielding time and for organizing this time to talk \nabout the desperate need for tax relief for American families and \nbusinesses. I rise today in very strong support for meaningful and \npermanent tax relief for American families and businesses. This is, I \nbelieve, no time for us as conservatives, no time for us as \nRepublicans, no time for us as Americans to retreat or backtrack or to \nequivocate on our commitment to the American people that we will fight \nfor them and fight for tax relief.\n  One of the problems--and there are many--with the President's budget \nis that he matches temporary, very narrowly targeted tax cuts with \npermanent tax hikes. So while the minimal targeted tax cuts would be \nsunsetted, the American people will be obliged to continue to pay and \npay and pay the tax increases. Not too long ago, Mr. Greenspan, \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, testifying before the Senate Banking \nCommittee, said, ``Ultimately, you cannot solve the long-term deficits \nfrom the receipt side. It's got to be from the expenditure side.''\n  Put very plainly, it seems to me that Mr. Greenspan is saying that \nthe problem we have in our chronic deficits is not that the Federal \nGovernment does not have enough money, it is not that our National \nGovernment does not have enough revenues; it is that we are, in fact, \naddicted to spending. So the question is--and the debate continues to \nexist--Can we balance the budget and provide tax relief simultaneously? \nI think the answer to that is an emphatic, yes. The problem is not that \nwe don't have enough revenues or that we need to increase taxes. The \nproblem has been and continues to be that we spend too much and that we \ncannot get a control on our spending habit and that we are unwilling to \ndeal with the very real problem of entitlement spending that consumes \nmore and more of the budget pie.\n  So I suggest that we can cut taxes and that we must cut taxes for the \nAmerican people. There are three areas, I think, particularly that we \nneed to emphasize. First, as the Senator from Wyoming emphasized, was \nfamily tax relief. Families today, working families, hard-working \nfamilies, are being squeezed more and more by an ever larger tax bite--\nalmost 40 percent for the average family--at the Federal, State, and \nlocal level, which is more than they are spending for housing, for \neducation for their children, for health care, more than they are \nspending for recreation, all combined together, they are spending to \nthe tax collector. That is too much. That is unfair.\n  I also was listening to my constituents over the recess. We had 12 \ntown meetings in Arkansas. In Fayetteville, AR, after making a speech \nand taking questions for more than an hour, a gentleman came up to me \nand said, ``Senator, something is wrong in America.'' He said, ``I was \nraised in a family of eight of us. There were eight children. Mom \nstayed home, dad worked. Dad, as a single breadwinner in a single-\nincome family, he could provide for the eight of us. We had a pretty \ngood life. My dad had a high school education. Now I have a college \ndegree, two children. My wife and I both work, and we can barely keep \nthings together. Something is wrong.'' While there may be many, many \nanswers to that question, what is wrong and what has happened--a big \npart of it--is that Government has gotten larger, and as Government has \ngotten larger, its demand on the family has increased and the amount \nthat it confiscates from the American family of higher taxes has grown \nto the point that the American family has a very difficult time paying \nit.\n\n  We need family tax relief. We need estate tax relief. There are fewer \nthings I heard more about during my town meetings than the need for \nestate tax relief. There are fewer taxes in this country I believe that \nare more un-American than the estate tax. There are fewer taxes that \nare more of a killer and a destroyer of the American dream than the \nestate tax.\n  We used to say that part of the American dream is if you work hard,\n\n[[Page S2805]]\n\nsave your money, and if you invest well, that you not only will have a \nbetter life, but you will be able to pass that on to your children and \ngrandchildren so that they will have greater opportunities than we \nhave. But today, if you work hard and if you have done well, we will \ntake 55 percent of it in estate taxes. It is killing that American \ndream, or a big part of that American dream. I think that is wrong.\n  There are five bills in the Senate to reform or to eliminate the \nestate tax. I am on all of them. I think we need to at least raise the \nexclusion. But better yet, we need to eliminate it. It is a very \nineffective way to fund the Federal Government anyway. We are 65 cents \nshort in collections for every dollar that we receive from the estate \ntax. It is a very ineffective way of funding Federal programs.\n  Then, finally, I want to mention that we desperately need immediate \ncapital gains tax relief. I heard a great deal about this. This is what \nthey say. They say, yes, the Republicans are for capital gains tax \nrelief, that it is a tax break for the wealthy. Well, we know that the \nvast majority of tax filers will at some time in their life file \ncapital gains on their tax returns, most of those being middle-income \nearners. It is not a tax break for the wealthy.\n  Let me tell you how it plays out in Arkansas. A young couple started \n30 years ago building a poultry farm in the Ozark Hills. They spent \ntheir life paying off that mortgage. They are getting up in age. They \nare not wealthy. But they have worked their whole lives to pay off that \nfarm. Maybe they can no longer tend that big farm, or maybe they want \nto move into town close to the hospital, or maybe they need to get in \nclose to the grandchildren. They go to sell that farm. They discover \nthat the capital gains taxes would be so high that they can't afford to \nsell the farm they worked a lifetime to pay for. They are not wealthy. \nBut that is what we have done with the capital gains tax.\n  I will give you one other example. My chief of staff is from Stone \nCounty, AR. Stone County has one of the largest per capita incomes in \nthe State of Arkansas. His parents own a little cafe called Cody's Cafe \nin Fifty-Six, AR, next to the State park. It is a good restaurant. It \nhas good food. I recommend it. I eat there when I am in Fifty-Six, AR. \nBut Todd's parents wanted to sell that little restaurant. It is a mom-\nand-pop operation. They don't have many employees. It is a very small \ncafe. They wanted to sell it and put it into another business, in \nanother restaurant in another part of Arkansas. They had a buyer, \nsomebody who was going to buy that cafe-restaurant. Those buyers \nundoubtedly were going to expand, and they were going to hire \nadditional employees as well. Todd told his parents, ``Before you make \nthat deal, before you sign that contract, be sure to check with your \naccountant. Find out what the capital gains taxes will be.''\n\n  When they checked they found they couldn't afford to make that sale. \nSo they hung onto it. They continued to operate it.\n  But I want you to think with me, my colleagues. What would have been \nthe impact had they been able to make that sale, had we not had the \nexorbitant capital gains tax we impose? We would have had a new \nbusiness started with new employees. The economy would have been \nstimulated with more taxes being paid to the Federal Treasury. We would \nhave had new business owners there in Stone County with the desire to \nexpand that restaurant operation, hire additional employees and, \ntherefore, not only stimulate the economy in Stone County, but pay more \ntaxes to the Federal Treasury.\n  You take that little example from Stone County, AR, and multiply that \nthousands of times across the United States, and you begin to get the \npicture of what we could do in stimulating the American economy, and \ntherefore making it easier for us to balance the Federal budget if we \nwould simply cut drastically and dramatically the capital gains tax \nrate. I believe we need to do that.\n  So I know there are others who are here to speak. I just want to \nconclude by saying this is no time for us to retreat on our promise \nmade to the American people that we are going to work for tax relief. I \nbelieve it is the moral equivalent of what President Bush did in 1990. \nI admire and love President Bush, but I think he made a terrible \nmistake when he told the American people ``no new taxes,'' and then \nviolated that pledge in reaching a budget deal. We must not, in our \ndesire to reach some mythical budget deal, forsake, abandon, or \nequivocate on the promise and the pledge we made to the American people \nthat we have come up here to lessen that ever-increasing tax burden \nunder which they labor.\n  So I, for one, will continue to work for a budget that is going to \nhave family tax relief, estate tax relief, and capital gains tax relief \nfor the American people.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I want to ask the Senator if there is a Fifty-Six, AR.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. There is a Fifty-Six, AR, and Cody Cafe is the place \nto eat.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2803-7", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2805-S2807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE SINKING OF THE ``TITANIC'', TAX DAY, AND OTHER MANMADE DISASTERS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, 1 week from today, we will mark the \nanniversary of two infamous, manmade disasters. One may slip by \nunnoticed. I am certain the other will not.\n  The first disaster we will commemorate next Tuesday is the 85th \nanniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, an event made all the more \ntragic because it could have been prevented. The story of the Titanic \nis a sad story of excess, of man's ongoing reach for something bigger, \nsomething more powerful.\n  The second manmade disaster is the arrival of tax day. Now, I do not \nmean to draw a direct comparison between the loss of life in the \nTitanic incident and the plight of America's working men and women. But \nfor many Americans, April 15 is another potent symbol of man's ongoing \nreach for something bigger and more powerful. The bigger and more \npowerful entity in this case is not the world's largest ship, but the \nlargest government the world has ever known. And Washington's constant \nneed to expand its reach has imprisoned working families in a \ndisastrous cycle of taxation.\n  Look what our outrageous tax burden has done to families over the \npast 40 years. Taxes today dominate the family budget. The annual tax \nbill for a typical family now averages $21,365-- significantly more \nthan they spend on food, clothing, and shelter every year.\n  Factor in State and local taxes and the hidden taxes that result from \nthe high cost of government regulations, and a family today gives up \nmore than 50 percent of its annual income to the government. We pay an \nespecially high price in my home State of Minnesota--a study released \nlast year by Harvard University revealed that Minnesota taxpayers pay \nthe seventh highest taxes in the Nation.\n  Taxes are not merely an inconvenient fact of life. They are the \n1990's version of highway robbery.\n  Who has borne the brunt of these ever-increasing taxes since the \n1940's? Working families with children. No wonder these Americans shake \ntheir heads in dismay each April.\n  Mr. President, when my colleagues and I in the sophomore class were \nelected in 1994, we were sent here by our constituents on a promise \nthat we would balance the budget and cut taxes. That same promise was \nmade by the Members of the new freshman class. And we do not intend to \nlet 1 more year pass without delivering on those promises. Tax relief \nand deficit reduction can and must go hand in hand. Any budget \npresented in this Chamber that favors deficit reduction at the expense \nof lower taxes--what Washington's big spenders like to call the save-\nthe-dessert-for-after-dinner approach--is nothing more than an exercise \nin futility. Until the opponents of tax relief recognize that what they \ncall dessert is what most taxpayers consider their salary, we will \nnever reach agreement on a budget.\n\n  I would like to also add that I received a letter today from a mayor \nback home who opposed tax relief. He didn't call it dessert, but he \ncalled it political goodies that we would like to disperse to our \nconstituents. Allowing working men and women to keep more of their \nmoney is what he calls political goodies.\n\n[[Page S2806]]\n\n  This is the mindset of many who are serving in government today, \nwhether they be local, State, or Federal officials. Somehow the \npeople's money is somehow government's claim, and if we want to make \nsure that they can keep some of it, it is somehow political goodies.\n  But it was later in his letter that I found what was really his real \nconcern. In the letter I think he felt that lower taxes could mean \nfewer dollars to be sent from Washington to his town. So his concern \nwasn't the political goodies, but it could mean fewer dollars if we \nreduce the size and scope of the Federal Government. That is money that \nwould be allowed to be spent, or really the pork from Washington--not \npolitical goodies but pork. Let the Federal Government raise the taxes \nrather than having the local taxes support the programs for pork that \nthey want. So, in other words, provide for their residents. It is \nreally great that we can stand here and get credit for spending their \nmoney--the taxpayers' money--for programs, for what really is pork that \nthe Government thinks that they should have, or that they need. It is \ngreat that we have this great ability to figure out for the local \ncitizens what is best for them.\n  The American people have spoken very clearly on this point. A USA \nToday-CNN-Gallup Poll released just last week confirms what many of us \nhave been saying all along: Tax cuts must be part of any budget \nagreement we enact this year. When asked if they think the Republicans \nshould drop their attempts to include tax cuts in their overall plan to \nreduce the budget deficit, or should they keep the tax cuts in their \nplan, fully 70 percent of the respondents said the tax cuts should \nstay. Seven out of ten Americans are calling on us to keep our tax-\ncutting pledge. And a majority agreed that tax cuts and deficit \nreduction can be accomplished at the same time.\n  Mr. President, if Congress intends to make the strongest possible \nstatement in support of working Americans, we will not do it by \nbuilding a bigger Federal Government that demands more taxpayer \ndollars. We will do it by cutting taxes and leaving families a little \nmore of their own money at the end of the day.\n  Earlier this year, I was proud to join my colleagues, Senator \nHutchinson and Senator Coats, in reintroducing this desperately needed \ntax relief in the form of the $500 per-child tax credit.\n  The $500-per-child tax credit takes power away from Washington and \nputs it back with families, where it can do the most good. Once we \nleave that money in the family bank account, taxpayers are empowered to \nuse it meeting the needs of their families, whether that is clothing, \nmedical and dental expenses, insurance, or even groceries, or \neducation.\n  Mr. President, there is no action Congress can take today that will \nmake next Tuesday, April 15, any easier for America's working families. \nBut we have before us unlimited opportunities to profoundly change \nevery other tax day, far into the future. Washington created the mess \nwe are in, and the taxpayers are now demanding that Washington get us \nout of it. Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from Wyoming \nfor putting this order together at this propitious time to discuss tax \npolicy in the country with April 15 looming on the horizon and \nAmericans all over the country concerned about the amount of money we \npay to the Federal Government in Federal income taxes.\n  Mr. President, I have an important announcement to make. I have been \nauthorized to announce that on tax day, April 15, the U.S. Senate will \nhave a historic opportunity to vote on a resolution which will express \nthe sense of the Senate that we support a requirement that Congress, \nthe House and the Senate, be required to raise taxes with a \nsupermajority. In other words, that we could not raise taxes with a \nbare majority, that it would require a two-thirds vote for a tax \nincrease to go in effect, much like the requirement in States \nthroughout the United States, and a very successful requirement, I \nmight add. The full House is actually going to vote on tax day on the \nactual constitutional amendment. Our resolution will be a sense of the \nSenate in support of that same concept. Obviously, we are not prepared \nyet to actually vote on the constitutional amendment.\n  The reason for this, Mr. President, is that the average family of \nfour back in 1948 paid about 5 percent of its income in Federal taxes. \nBut today that burden is about 24 percent. And, as our colleague from \nMinnesota just noted, if you add the State and local taxes to the mix, \nwe are paying about 40 percent of our income in taxes to government.\n  The last tax increase to pass in the Congress in 1993 was the largest \nin history. And, yet, it failed to even achieve a majority in the U.S. \nSenate. There was a tie of 50-50. President Clinton's largest tax \nincrease in history only passed because Vice President Gore came to the \nChamber and cast the deciding vote. We believe that it ought to be at \nleast as difficult to raise taxes as it is to cut them. It is now \neasier, sadly, to raise taxes than it is to cut them.\n  Consider this irony. This two-thirds majority would fix this problem, \nby the way. When we passed the balanced budget amendment of 1995, the \nPresident vetoed it. It included big tax cuts. The President vetoed it. \nWe had to have a two-thirds majority to overcome the veto, and we \ncouldn't do that. So it would have required a two-thirds vote for us to \nreduce taxes. But, as I pointed out, the biggest tax increase in the \nhistory of the country in 1993 passed without even a majority vote.\n  As I said, Mr. President, we think it ought to be at least as hard to \nraise taxes as it is to cut them. That is why we are going to be voting \non April 15 to support the principle that there should be a \nsupermajority for Congress to raise taxes.\n  The Kemp commission, appointed by the Speaker of the House and the \nprevious majority leader of the Senate, came to this conclusion about \nthis requirement. I am quoting: ``The commission believes that a two-\nthirds supermajority vote of Congress will earn Americans' confidence \nin the longevity, predictability, and stability of any new tax \nsystem.''\n  They made that point in recommending this two-thirds supermajority of \nboth Houses of Congress to raise taxes as a key component of our tax \npolicy. As I said, there are 14 States that currently have some form of \ntax limitation in effect. There was an interesting study in 1994 by the \nCato Institute which found that a family of four in States with tax and \nexpenditure limits faces estate and tax burdens that are $650 lower on \naverage 5 years after the implementation than it would have been if the \nState tax growth had not been slowed. In other words, the people who \nlive in States that have these supermajority requirements are better \noff, pay less in taxes than those States which do not have such a \nrequirement.\n\n  It also matters, Mr. President, how we raise or lower taxes. Or I \nshould say, put it another way, how we increase revenues to the \nTreasury matters because you can increase revenue to the Treasury not \nby raising tax rates but actually by lowering certain tax rates.\n  We all agree that lower tax rates stimulate the economy, which \nresults in more taxable income and transactions and more revenue to the \nTreasury as a result. In fact, the tax cuts out of the early 1980's \nmake this point. They spawned the longest peacetime economic expansion \nin our Nation's history.\n  Revenues to the Treasury, the Federal Treasury, increased as a result \nfrom $599 billion in fiscal year 1981 to $990 billion in fiscal year \n1989, up about 65 percent.\n  On the other hand, higher tax rates discourage work and production \nand savings and investment so there is ultimately less economic \nactivity to tax. That is exactly what Martin Feldstein, the former \nChairman of the President's Council on Economic Advisers, found when he \nlooked at the effect of President Clinton's 1993 tax increase. He found \nthat taxpayers responded to the sharply higher marginal tax rates \nimposed by the Clinton tax bill by reducing their taxable incomes by \nnearly $25 billion. They did that by saving less, investing less, and \ncreating fewer jobs, and the economy eventually paid the price in terms \nof slower growth.\n\n[[Page S2807]]\n\n  In other words, as I said, how Congress raises taxes is more \nimportant than how much it can tax. The key is whether tax policy \nfosters economic growth and opportunity. And that is why we believe, as \nI said before, that it ought to be more difficult to raise tax rates. \nIt ought to be just as easy to cut taxes. We should raise tax rates \nonly if there is enough consensus on that to provide a two-thirds \nmajority of both Houses of Congress.\n  So on April 15, tax day, all of us in the Senate will have the \nopportunity to go on record to tell our constituents where we stand. Do \nwe believe that it ought to be just as difficult to raise taxes as it \nis to cut them? We will have the opportunity to vote on the principle \nof requiring a supermajority in Congress to raise taxes. And I \ncertainly hope that my colleagues will support us in that vote.\n  I thank the Senator from Wyoming for this time.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased now to yield to my friend, \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, who has actually been chairman of our 1994 \ngroup. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for having this time \ndevoted to such a significant issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time which has been \nallotted to Senator Thomas be extended until the hour of 11:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think something that is very significant that has not \nyet been said was touched upon by the distinguished Senator from \nArizona [Mr. Kyl], when he approached the economics of this issue. \nUnfortunately, when we talk about tax reductions, there is a mindset \nthat if you reduce taxes, you reduce revenues. History has shown us \nvery clearly that is not the case.\n  In fact, it was a Democrat who first came up with the idea that you \ncould actually increase revenues by reducing taxes, and that was \nPresident Kennedy back in the early 1970's when he said we have a \nproblem in this country; we have to increase revenues, but we also are \novertaxed, so the best way to increase revenues is to reduce the tax \nrates.\n  Now, today, the Democrats do not think that way. The liberals in \nCongress think that it is a static situation, and that if you raise \ntaxes nothing else happens.\n  That, of course, is not true. I remind my colleagues that in 1980, \nthe total amount of money used to run Government was $570 billion, the \ntotal revenue that came in in 1980. In 1990, the total revenue that \ncame in to run Government was $1 trillion 30 billion. That is almost \nexactly double what it was in 1980.\n  Well, what happened during that decade? During that decade, we had \nthe largest tax reductions we have ever had in this country's history. \nSo the same thing that happened back during the Kennedy administration \nwhen he had the wisdom to say we have to increase revenues and the best \nway to do this is to reduce taxes happened again in the 1980's. \nUnfortunately, we have an administration in the White House that does \nnot understand this.\n\n  In fact, I was amazed early in this administration when Laura Tyson, \nwho is the chief economic adviser to the President of the United \nStates, President Clinton, back in 1992 said--and this is nearly a \ndirect quote--there is no relationship between the level of taxes a \nnation pays and the amount of economic productivity of that nation.\n  That is saying they believe if you tax everybody 100 percent, they \nare going to work as hard as if you taxed them 10 percent. This is what \nSenator Kyl was getting to, that there is a relationship between the \nlevel of taxation and the productivity of a nation. In fact, to be \nspecific, for each 1-percent increase in economic activity of a country \nit increases new revenue $24 billion.\n  So those of us who are conservative, those of us who believe that \nwhat history has taught us is very factual are standing here saying we \nwant to lower taxes, we want to do as Senator Kyl suggested and make it \nmore difficult for people to raise taxes. I suggest, if you go back and \nlook at the votes that took place to raise taxes, at least in the 10 \nyears I have been here, it has always passed by maybe 1 or 2 percent. \nIf you put a supermajority on that, I believe we can accomplish a lot.\n  And so as the speakers before me have indicated, there are a lot of \nadvantages here to get this machine working and to become more \nproductive, and if for no other reason than the distinguished Senator \nfrom Minnesota said--we who are elected to the Senate, that is, those \nof us in the Chamber right now, in 1994 committed and promised that we \nwould vote for a balanced budget and reduce taxes, and we are going to \ndo that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, let me just sort of wind up on our tax \nthing and say that if you are like me--a weekend from now it will be \nApril 15 and all of us I hope are beginning to think about preparing \nour tax returns. It is a headache, of course, and so we tend to \nprocrastinate. We are taxed too high, I am sure. And I am sure also \nthat people out there look at Washington and wonder if all that talk \nabout tax relief is just talk.\n  We are here to say that it is not. Tax relief for families in \nAmerica, for small business, is alive and well and one of the good \nideas that is coming out of Washington, I hope soon. By next year, it \nis our hope that as we begin to think about compiling tax returns we \nwill have accomplished what Americans deserve and expect from \nWashington as a matter of fact--reforms that let families keep more of \ntheir money. Republicans want to lower the tax burden and provide some \ncommon sense to the tax system.\n  Currently, according to the Census Bureau, a typical family of four \nspends more than 3 hours of every 8-hour day working for dollars that \nare dedicated to Federal, State and local taxes. That is an average of \nalmost 40 percent of income--40 percent of our income to continue to \ngrow a central government. You get big government and you get a bloated \nbureaucracy. Instead, we ought to be able to use those dollars to \nincrease our businesses, to feed our kids, to send them to school. So \nwe need reform, smart reform, smart tax reform. That has a nice ring to \nit, doesn't it?\n  I hear also in town meetings more and more about the IRS. Let me tell \nyou that at least to some extent you cannot do much about the IRS until \nyou change the system and make it simpler. Which taxes to reform? Where \nshould we start? The inheritance tax for one. We have already talked \nabout that. Here is one that makes no sense at all. We spend more time \navoiding inheritance taxes than we do paying them. People who have \nspent time in business and farms cannot pass it on to their own \nfamilies. The current tax penalizes the development of wealth and \nbusiness. That is wrong. It is really a matter of freedom. Citizens own \ntheir property and families should not be compelled to sell it if the \nhead of the household passes away. In the West it is an environmental \nproblem. The view of the West, the mountains will be subdivided unless \nwe act.\n\n  How about capital gains reduction? Entrepreneurs and small business \ninvestors take substantial risks when they open or invest in \nbusinesses. Cutting capital gains will increase economic growth. Add to \nthat tax credits for our families with children. Grant a $500-per-child \ntax credit and give families the opportunity to do some things.\n  When it is all wrapped up, tax reform should have to pass a simple \ncommonsense test. Does it impose the lowest possible compliance and \nenforcement? Does it encourage growth? Does it work to help strengthen \nfamilies? By anyone's measure, our current system does not pass this \ntest. So we deserve a Saturday in April with our family instead of \nsitting with a stack of receipts and the Tax Code. We want tax \nsimplicity. We want tax relief.\n  The President's proposed budget, according to the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, the President's fiscal year 1998 budget contains a net tax \nincrease of $23 billion over 10 years. That is not tax relief. That is \nmore burden. That is not what we need in the future. The President \nneeds to come to the snubbing post and join with us on taxes and reform \nin balancing the budget. We can do that, and our opportunity is now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I came to the floor to visit about a very \nimportant issue, the issue of the chemical weapons treaty and the \nrequirement the Senate vote on that treaty. But before I do that, I \nwant to tell my colleagues of a circumstance that exists in our part of \nthe country that they have no doubt seen and heard on the television \nand radio and that is the worst blizzard we have seen in some 50 years \nin North Dakota on top of a flooding condition that was already \nexisting that looks to be a 100-year flood.\n  Last evening, I and my colleagues from North and South Dakota went to \nsee President Clinton in the White House along with the head of the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency to discuss the emergency that \nexists in our part of the country.\n  The President has made a disaster declaration. He has signed it. \nThere is now a team of people from FEMA in the Dakotas beginning to \nwork, beginning to marshal equipment from around the country--\ngenerators, snow removal equipment, and a whole range of things that \nwill be necessary to deal with this crisis.\n  I want to tell my colleagues of the kind of crisis that exists. \nAgain, we had a blizzard that in many parts of North Dakota gave us 15, \n18, and 20 inches of snowfall on top of a circumstance that already \nexisted that would have provided us and will provide us with a flood \nthat is a 100-year event. So this is an enormously difficult time for \nNorth Dakotans. We have had the spectacle of people actually \nsandbagging in the middle of a blizzard, which is a very unusual event. \nNormally you fight a flood or normally you fight to survive a blizzard, \nbut we have had the confluence of two events that is enormously \ndifficult. We have substantial livestock death. We have reports of \npeople missing entire livestock herds. The stories of people helping \none another in coping this past weekend are compelling and gripping, of \ncourage, neighbor helping neighbor. It is a very tough time in the \nDakotas.\n  My colleagues and I will likely be going back out--we just came \nback--with the senior team which the President will send. He intends \nJames Lee Witt and I believe at least one other Cabinet Secretary and \nsome others as part of a senior team from the administration to go out \nand to survey the damage and to begin the active work of supervising \nthe people who are already on the ground.\n  This is as tough a time as anything I have ever seen in the Dakotas. \nMost North Dakotans tell me it is the toughest winter they have ever \nseen. The blizzard this weekend, as I indicated, is the toughest we \nhave had in 50 years in North Dakota, and it came on top of five or six \nsuccessive blizzards in North Dakota that essentially shut down our \nState on five or six occasions previously. As of Saturday evening, this \npast Saturday evening, in North Dakota traffic was stopped in virtually \nevery direction on every road. It was a very difficult time and remains \na very difficult time with thousands of North Dakotans still without \nelectricity after many days. This is a crisis which will continue to \nexist because of the flooding which has not yet crested in many parts, \nespecially of the Red River.\n  I thank President Clinton; I thank James Lee Witt, the head of FEMA; \nI thank our colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, who join together in \ntimes like this to extend a helping hand to people who need help and \nwho are fighting their way through a crisis that is very difficult to \ndeal with.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2808-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would like to mention two additional \nitems very quickly. One is an issue that has just been discussed at \nsome length on the floor about a budget and tax relief. My hope is that \nwe will find a way to have a bipartisan compromise on a budget. The law \nrequires that by April 15 a budget be enacted by this Congress. It is \nclear now that the Congress will miss that date. But the date is less \nimportant than the result. The result ought to be a budget that \nachieves balance so we are not spending our children's money, often on \nthings we do not need.\n  We ought to decide that there is as much energy in this Chamber to \nbalance the budget as there was to change the Constitution of the \nUnited States. I said during the debate on the constitutional provision \nthat was offered here that you could change the Constitution now, and 2 \nminutes from now you would not have altered the deficit by one penny. \nWhat will alter the budget deficit and eventually eliminate the budget \ndeficit will be individual spending and taxing decisions inside the \nbudget by Members of the U.S. Senate and U.S. House. I think it is past \nthe time in which the President and Members of Congress, Republicans \nand Democrats, join together to say here is where we ought to head and \nhere is the road map by which we get there, to establish balance.\n  I have cast hard votes and tough votes. In 1993 I cast an awfully \ntough vote. We have reduced the budget deficit by 60 percent in the \nlast 4 years. If we continue down that road, we can eliminate the \nFederal budget deficit, and we should. I am willing to cast more tough \nvotes, and I hope very much we can decide this is not a partisan issue \nbut rather a shared issue for Republicans and Democrats who decide that \nthere is merit and virtue in balancing this Federal budget and not \ncharging what we are now spending to our kids and grandkids.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2808-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2808-S2809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CHEMICAL WEAPONS TREATY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to speak about another \nissue that is very important this week as well. This week the Senate \ncomes back from a 2-week break and turns to the question of nuclear \nwaste. That is an important issue and one I hope this Congress and the \nPresident will address seriously and solve. But there is another issue \nthat is very important that has a deadline that we must address, and \nthat is the issue of the chemical weapons treaty.\n  We now have a circumstance in which this country, with 160 other \ncountries, has signed a convention in which a chemical weapons treaty \nto the Geneva Disarmament Conference in 1994 was negotiated and \ncompleted. It was initiated by President Bush, supported by President \nReagan, it was continued under President Clinton and submitted to the \nU.S. Senate for ratification.\n  The chemical weapons treaty will restrain the proliferation and will \nreduce the threat of the use of chemical weapons in our lifetime. It is \nthe first ever treaty to try to ban an entire class of weapons of mass \ndestruction. Never again should men and women in our lifetime face a \nweapon of mass destruction called a chemical weapon or poison gas. We \nhave a treaty that has now been signed by 70 nations, more than the 65 \nthat is needed to ratify the treaty, so it will go into effect on April \n29 of this year. This country has not yet ratified it. Our key allies, \nAustralia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and others, have \nalready ratified this treaty, and we need to do so and we need to do so \nby April 29.\n  There are opponents of this who say, ``No, this is not a perfect \ntreaty.'' And it is not. Opponents say, ``If we adopt this treaty, \nSaddam Hussein is not going to adopt the treaty, so what are we doing \nhere?'' Because some will commit murder, do we not want to make murder \na crime in America? We understand there are some who may not want to \nabide by this treaty. This country has already made a decision, in the \nmid-1980's, that we are going to destroy our stockpile of chemical \nweapons. We have already made that decision. We made a decision under \nPresident Bush and continued it under President Clinton to negotiate a \nchemical weapons treaty. That treaty was negotiated. Seventy nations \nhave now ratified it, and we have not yet done so, and we should. \nRatifying it will strengthen this country, not weaken this country. \nThose who allege that ratifying the chemical weapons treaty will \nsomehow weaken this country's hand, in my judgment, are wrong. I \nrespect their opinion, but they are wrong. It is urgent and necessary \nthat we, by April 29, ratify this treaty. We are able, with our allies, \nto provide leadership to destroy an entire class of weapons of mass \ndestruction in our society. If we do not take this opportunity to do \nit, we will have made a very grave mistake.\n  I was not here when we were testing nuclear weapons in massive \nquantity, but I know when it was proposed that\n\n[[Page S2809]]\n\nwe cease testing nuclear weapons and have a test ban on nuclear \nweapons, there were some who stood up and said we cannot do that \nbecause it will weaken our country. Yet we had a ban on testing nuclear \nweapons, and it was the right thing to do. History tells us it was the \nright thing to do.\n  This is the right thing to do as well. It is very important that we \nunderstand this must be part of the Senate's business this month. If we \ndo not take the opportunity to provide leadership in banning the use of \nchemical weapons, a weapon of mass destruction in our society, if we do \nnot take the opportunity to establish that leadership, we will have \nmade a very grave error.\n  This is not a case of one side of a debate being soft headed and \nfuzzy and the other side being the real prodefense folks. The people \nwho support this--former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, \nformer Secretaries of State James Baker, Larry Eagleburger, former Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency head Ron Lehman--all urge the Senate to \nratify the chemical weapons treaty, none of whom can be alleged to have \nbeen soft on defense issues. These are people very prodefense, people \nwho are very concerned about making certain that we do not lose \nadvantage, that we are a strong country, that we can defend ourselves. \nBut these are people who also believe, as did President Bush, that this \ntreaty makes sense for our country, to provide leadership on the \nabolition of chemical weapons. Leadership on the abolition of poison \ngas as a weapon in war makes great sense for our country and great \nsense for humanity.\n  The reason I raise the question today is this. We have a limited \ntime, and a deadline of April 29, to ratify this treaty in order for us \nto be part of the regime that begins to develop the methods by which \nthis treaty is enforced. Yet, we have no agreement even to bring the \ntreaty to the floor of the Senate for a vote or discussion. Some of us \nbelieve very strongly that, with the exception of the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill, for example, or with the exception, \nperhaps, of a budget bill to balance the Federal budget--which we \nshould do--with the exception of those things we ought to make sure \nthis is first in line. Until we have assurance this is first in line, \nwe ought not be doing other business. This ought to be brought to the \nfloor of the Senate, and we ought to have agreement to do that soon.\n\n  I hope we will have an aggressive and significant discussion about \nthis treaty. My understanding is the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma may intend to speak some about this treaty and some of his \nconcerns about it. But my hope is, perhaps this afternoon--I intend to \ncome back to the floor--some of us can have a discussion back and \nforth. I have great respect for people who take an opposite view on \nthis and on other issues. We do not have to call each other names \nbecause we disagree with each other. Debate ought to be to evaluate \nwhat are the merits of a position, what are the facts, and what \nconclusions can one develop from those facts.\n  My position is to say I think we ought to do this. It is an easier \nposition, I must say, to oppose it. It is an easier position. That is \nnot to say opposing it is necessarily wrong, and there are cases where \nthe opposition might be the right position on some issues. But Mark \nTwain once said, when he was asked to debate, ``Of course, but I need \nto take the opposing side.'' They said, ``But we have not even told you \nwhat the topic is.'' He said, ``That doesn't mean anything to me. That \ndoesn't matter. I only need to take the opposing side because that \ndoesn't require any preparation.''\n  The point he was making is it is always easier to take the opposing \nside. I say to my friend from Oklahoma, that doesn't mean the opposing \nside in every debate is wrong. But in this case, the need to ratify the \nchemical weapons treaty, the affirmative side is the right side for \nthis country. It is urgent and has a time deadline, and we ought to do \nit. I hope this afternoon, perhaps, we can have some thoughtful \ndiscussion about what are the merits of this, why do we have such a \nlarge group of Republicans and Democrats from the Bush administration \nand the Clinton administration and many others who believe this is a \npriority for this country and believe it is something that this country \nought to take a lead on.\n  My hope is that at end of the day today, or this week, we will have \nan agreement by which we can at least bring this to the floor, even \nthough some might want to vote against it. I think those who want to do \nthat should give us the opportunity to have a debate and a vote on the \nchemical weapons treaty. We very much owe that to this country. If and \nwhen we get to the decision to give us a debate and a vote on the \nchemical weapons treaty, I will be happy with that. We have to make our \nbest case and we have to make an affirmative case for this treaty. We \nhave that responsibility. But we cannot do that if we are prevented \nfrom seeing it brought to the floor of the Senate for a debate and a \nvote.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  Does the Senator from Oklahoma intend to speak?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2808-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2809-S2811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have the utmost respect for my \ndistinguished colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan. I have to \nadmit, however, I seem to disagree with him more than agree with him. \nLet me just cover a couple of things that he said that I feel quite \nstrongly--I am sure he believes them, but they are certainly not true.\n  First of all, as far as the deadline is concerned, it seems like \nevery time you want to get something done you impose a deadline and say \nwe have to do it by--in this case, the 29th of April. There is no \ndeadline on this. Once this thing goes, the vote takes place, we can \nbecome a part of it if we want to wait until June or July or August. \nThere is no deadline.\n  I am reminded a little bit of the deadline they had when we had, I \nbelieve it was, the GATT Treaty. We had a special session of the U.S. \nSenate that was held in November, before the new Senate came in--this \nwas in 1994--that would allow those individuals who were defeated or \nwho retired to vote on something and not the new person who was \nelected. My daddy taught me a long time ago if the train is coming \nfast, slow it down. That is what we need to do with the Chemical \nWeapons Convention. We had a debate on this last fall. I think the \ndebate was a very fruitful one, and a lot of things came out. So let us \nnot talk about a deadline of the 29th. I look forward to debating this \nand discussing this with the Senator from North Dakota this afternoon.\n  The next thing that he said that I take issue with is the idea that \nit is easier to oppose than to support the Chemical Weapons Convention. \nHe is saying it is easier. Maybe it was easier for Mark Twain. This is \nnot easier, because I will tell you I have been very outspoken in \nopposition to this Chemical Weapons Convention, and all I hear from \npeople is, ``You mean you are for chemical weapons?'' That is not the \nissue at all. It is a lot easier to demagog this thing and say, ``Let's \nsign this and do away with chemical weapons.'' We are not going to do \naway with chemical weapons, and we all know that.\n  As far as this is not a matter, as he stated, between the fuzzies and \nthose in favor of a strong national defense, let us wait until the vote \ntakes place and make that determination. I will wager that when the \nvote takes place, we will find out that those individuals with the \nhighest American security ratings would be the ones who will oppose the \nChemical Weapons Convention. That is a very easy thing to do. Just take \nthe ratings and look and see how the vote comes out. Those individuals \nwho consistently vote against such things as the National Missile \nDefense System, Theater Missile Defense System, vote for all of these \ndisarmaments. A lot of the motive there is to put that money into \nsocial programs. I think we all know that.\n  Let me just cover a couple of things in this brief period of time. \nFirst of all, this is not global. The Senator from North Dakota talked \nabout Spain and about France and about all these countries. We don't \nhave a problem with\n\n[[Page S2810]]\n\nthese countries. Let us look and see who is not a part of this. Iraq is \nnot a part of this.\n  North Korea is not a part of this. Libya is not a part of this. Syria \nis not a part of this. If you ask any ``in'' person, in a logical \nmanner, ``Who do you think would be the greatest threat to the United \nStates,'' and you name the top 15, those countries would be there. It \nis not global. Those countries that involve themselves in terrorist \nactivities are countries that are not a part of this. Of course, I \nthink we all understand it does not cover terrorist activities anyway.\n  Let's look at the countries that are a part. Iran is now a signatory \nhere, and yet Iran, if anyone here believes that they will keep their \nword in destroying all of their chemical arsenal, then I have a bridge \nI would like to sell them, because that is not going to happen. We know \nit is not verifiable, and there is no better evidence of that than \nafter the Persian Gulf war when the United Nations was given incredible \npower to go out and examine and inspect and try to determine whether or \nnot Iraq, who we had just defeated, had chemical weapons, then we find \nout through our intelligence community, that even with those very \nstringent inspection abilities that the United Nations had, that Iraq, \nstill, was developing various weapons of mass destruction, including \nchemical weapons.\n  I think it is important to show that it is not effective, that it \nwill not banish poison gas or shield our soldiers, as Clinton claims. \nJane's Defense Weekly came out last week and reported that Russia has \ndeveloped three new nerve agents without using any of the precursor \nchemicals banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention. What does that \nmean, Mr. President? It means that they are already out there trying to \nfigure out and trying to develop chemical weapons that can be used that \nare not using the precursor chemicals that would be banned. In other \nwords, let's assume everybody is honest and everybody is complying, it \nis all verifiable, and all the countries belong to it. When it gets \ndown to it, the bottom line is, you can still come out with chemicals \nthat do not use these precursor chemicals. So, it would not be \neffective in that respect.\n  I think we should also look at the constitutionality of this. I know \na lot of times things are passed around here over the fact that it is a \nviolation of the Constitution. I happen to be the chairman of the Clean \nAir and Private Property and Wetlands Subcommittee of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee. It is almost a daily thing that the \nGovernment takes land away from people without due compensation. So we \nknow that there are things happening that violate constitutional \nrights. But in this case, it would permit searches and seizures without \nwarrants or probable cause. I think this is a very serious thing.\n  And as far as trade secrets, we would be giving up something here. We \nall hear we are going to all destroy our chemical weapons. We have not \nstopped to realize what we are giving up in order to have this utopia \nthat we seem to think is going to appear. One is, we have to open up \nand allow countries, like Iran, to inspect our chemical companies and \nour fertilizer companies and our cosmetic companies to see if there is \nanything in there that they are using and they would be able to get a \nlot of technology from this. This is something with which we have to be \nconcerned.\n  Then we have more regulations on American business. This is something \nthat we deal with. I have often said there are three reasons we are not \nglobally competitive in this country. One is we are overtaxed; the \nother is our tort laws; and the other is we are overregulated. How can \nwe compete with other countries when we are overregulated? This is one \nmore regulation, one more set of forms that all these companies--\ncosmetic companies and others--will have to fill out.\n  Then, of course, we have the thing that is talked about quite often, \nand that is, this is going to make us much more comfortable in terms of \nour defense against any type of chemical weapons.\n  I have an editorial, that I will be asking in a minute to be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my remarks, from the Wall Street \nJournal. I hope my friend from North Dakota, the distinguished Senator \nwho spoke before me, will listen to this. I will read the last couple \nof sentences in this editorial from the Wall Street Journal, which is \ndated February 19, 1997:\n\n       The biggest danger of ratification is that it would \n     similarly lull the U.S. and other responsible nations into \n     the false belief that they are taking effective action \n     against the threat of chemical weapons. The case for this \n     treaty strains belief too far.\n\n  Lastly, let me suggest that a lot of the people, who are very fine \npeople, who have signed on and said, ``Yes, we want the United States \nto be a part of the Chemical Weapons Convention,'' have not really \ntaken the time to study and see what we are giving up. I will share \nwith you just a couple of things that came from a meeting of February \n27, 1997, when General Schwarzkopf, who is supportive of ratification \nof the Chemical Weapons Convention, was before our Senate Armed \nServices Committee, and I asked him a few questions.\n  I asked him questions concerning how it would affect terrorists. Of \ncourse, he agreed it would not have any effect.\n  Then I said:\n\n       Do you think it wise to share with countries like Iran our \n     most advanced chemical defensive equipment and technologies?\n       General Schwarzkopf. Our defensive capabilities?\n       Senator Inhofe. Yes.\n       General Schwarzkopf. Absolutely not.\n       Senator Inhofe. Well, I'm talking about sharing our \n     advanced chemical defensive equipment and technologies, which \n     I believe under Article X [they] would be allow[ed]  . . . Do \n     you disagree?\n\n  Then he said:\n\n       I'm not familiar with all the details . . ..\n\n  One of the problems we have is, so many people who are supporting the \nratification of this Chemical Weapons Convention have not read all the \ndetails, have not read what we are giving up, I say to the \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota, and we are giving up many \nthings that would normally be considered private.\n  Lastly, I will say, in conclusion, that there are a lot of people who \nare opposed to this. They are very prominent in the defense community. \nCertainly, four of our past Secretaries of Defense are opposed to the \nratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Rumsfeld, Schlesinger, \nwho, incidentally was in a Democrat administration, Weinberger, and \nDick Cheney have all taken positions and said this is not in the best \ninterest of the United States.\n  So, I hope we will have a lengthy debate on this, and I am hoping, \nquite frankly, that we are not going to be able to bring this up until \nwe have had a chance for a thorough debate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the testimony from the \nSenate Armed Services Committee hearing of February 27, 1997, be \nprinted in the Record, and immediately following that, the Wall Street \nJournal editorial dated February 19, 1997, be printed in the Record, in \nthat order.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nExcerpt from the Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing, February 27, \n                                  1997\n\n       Senator Inhofe. If the Chemical Weapons Convention were in \n     effect, would we still face a danger of chemical attack from \n     such places as Iraq [which has not signed the CWC]--or Iran \n     [which] actually signed onto it?\n       General Schwarzkopf. Senator, I think that the answer is \n     probably yes. But, I think the chances of that happening \n     could be diminished by the treaty only because it would then \n     be these people clearly standing up and thumbing their noses \n     at international law--and it would also help us build \n     coalitions against them if that were to happen.\n       Senator Inhofe. Aren't they still thumbing their noses \n     right now in Iraq?\n       General Schwarzkopf. There's no question about it, \n     Senator--I mean the fact that they used it in the first place \n     against their own people but, I still feel--we have renounced \n     the use of them and I am very uncomfortable placing ourselves \n     in the company with Iraq and Libya and countries such as \n     North Korea that have refused to sign that Convention. The \n     problem with those kinds of things is that verification is \n     very difficult and enforcement is very difficult. . . .\n       Senator Inhofe. General Shali[kashvili] I think in August \n     of 1994 said that ``even one ton of chemical agent may have a \n     military impact.'' I would ask the question: Do you believe \n     that an intrusive, on-site inspection--as would be allowed by \n     the Chemical Weapons convention--would be able to detect a \n     single ton or could tell us conclusively that there isn't a \n     single ton?\n       General Schwarzkopf. No, no as I said earlier, we can't \n     possibly know what's happening on every single inch of every \n     single territory out there where this would apply.\n\n[[Page S2811]]\n\n       Senator Inhofe. And as far as terrorists are concerned, \n     they would not be under this?\n       General Schwarzkopf. Of course not.\n       Senator Inhofe. Like any treaty, we have to give some \n     things up, and in this case, of course we do and there are a \n     couple of things that I'd like to [explore]--the \n     interpretation from the White House changed--they said that \n     if the Chemical Weapons Convention were agreed to, that it \n     would affect such things as riot control agents like tear gas \n     in search-and-rescue operations and circumstances like we \n     faced on Somalia--where they were using women and children at \n     that time as shields. Do you agree that we should be \n     restricted from using such things as tear gas?\n       General Schwarzkopf. I don't believe that is the case but I \n     will confess to you that I have not read every single detail \n     of that Convention so, therefore, I really can't give you an \n     expert opinion. I think you could get a better opinion here.\n       Secretary White. I am going to hesitate to give a \n     definitive answer because there has been, in the \n     administration, a very precise and careful discussion about \n     what exactly, and in what situations, this would apply and \n     when this wouldn't apply. . . .\n       Senator Inhofe. Do you think it wise to share with \n     countries like Iran our most advanced chemical defensive \n     equipment and technologies?\n       General Schwarzkopf. Our defensive capabilities?\n       Senator Inhofe. Yes.\n       General Schwarzkopf. Absolutely not.\n       Senator Inhofe. Well, I'm talking about sharing our \n     advanced chemical defensive equipment and technologies, which \n     I believe under Article X [they] would be allow[ed] to [get]. \n     Do you disagree?\n       General Schwarzkopf. As I said Senator, I'm not familiar \n     with all the details--I--you know, a country, particularly \n     like Iran, I think we should share as little as possible with \n     them in the way of our military capabilities.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 19, 1997]\n\n                           A Dangerous Treaty\n\n       Among the many good reasons why the Senate should not \n     ratify the Chemical Weapons Convetion is a substance known as \n     A-232. This highly lethal nerve agent was concocted by a \n     Russian scientific team precisely for the purpose of \n     circumventing the terms of the CWC, which both the U.S. and \n     Russia have signed but not yet ratified. A-232 would escape \n     scrutiny under the treaty because it is made from \n     agricultural and industrial chemicals that aren't deadly \n     until they are mixed and therefore don't appear on the CWC's \n     schedule of banned chemicals.\n       The world has known about A-232 since the May 1994 \n     publication on this page of an article by a Russian \n     scientist, who warned how his colleagues were attempting to \n     camouflage their true mission. It is now the subject of a \n     classified Pentagon paper, reported in the Washington Times \n     earlier this month, on the eve of what is shaping up to be an \n     escalation of the battle joined in September over \n     ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n       The Administration was forced to sound the retreat then, \n     pulling the treaty from consideration when it became clear \n     that the Senate was preparing to vote it down. Now it's \n     trying again, this time in full cry about the urgency for \n     U.S. ratification before April 29, the date it goes into \n     effect. For now, Senator Jesse Helms has kept the treaty tied \n     up in the Foreign Relations Committee, making the sensible \n     argument that the new Senate ought first to focus on matters \n     of higher priority then ramroding through a controversial \n     treaty that merits careful deliberation.\n       The Administration, meanwhile, is mounting a full-court \n     press, with the President offering a plea for ratification in \n     his State of the Union address ``so that at last we can begin \n     to outlaw poison gas from the earth.'' This is an admirable \n     sentiment--who isn't against marking the world safe from the \n     horrors of poison gas?--but it's far from the reality. In \n     fact, ratification would more likely bring the opposite \n     results.\n       Article XI is one of the key danger areas. It would \n     obligate U.S. companies to provide fellow signatories with \n     full access to their latest chemical technologies, \n     notwithstanding American trade or foreign policy. One country \n     delighted at the prospect of upgrading its chemical industry \n     is China, which, upon signing the CWC, issued a declaration \n     saying, ``All export controls inconsistent with the \n     Convention should be abolished.'' No doubt Cuba and Iran, to \n     name two other signatories, share the same sentiment. That \n     Russian team that came up with A-232 no doubt could \n     accomplish much more with the help of the most up-to-date \n     technology from the U.S.\n       Verification is an insurmountable problem, and no one--not \n     even the treaty's most ardent supporters--will promise that \n     the treaty can be enforced. In the Administration's \n     obfuscating phrase, the CWC can be ``effectively verified.'' \n     Yet if chemical weapons are easy to hide, as A-232 proves, \n     they are also easy to make. The sarin used in the poison-gas \n     attack on the Tokyo subway was created not in a fancy lab but \n     in a small, ordinary room used by Aum Shinri Kyo's amateur \n     chemists. The treaty provides for snap inspections of \n     companies that make chemicals, not of religious cults that \n     decide to cook up some sarin in the back office. The CWC \n     wouldn't make a whit of difference.\n       Those snap inspections, by the way, could turn into a huge \n     burden on American businesses, which would have to fork out \n     millions of dollars in compliance costs (through the biggest \n     companies no doubt would watch the heaviest burden fall on \n     their smaller competitors).\n       More than 65 countries have already ratified the CWC, \n     including most U.S. allies. But somehow we don't think the \n     world is more secure with Australia and Hungary committed to \n     ridding the world of chemical weapons when such real threats \n     as Libya, Iraq, Syria and North Korea won't have anything to \n     do with the CWC. How can a treaty that professes to address \n     the problem of chemical weapons be credible unless it \n     addresses the threat from the very countries, such as Syria \n     and Iraq, that have actually deployed these weapons?\n       With or without the CWC, the U.S. is already committed to \n     destroying its chemical weapons by 2004. That doesn't mean \n     the rest of the world shares any such commitment; what \n     possible peaceful purpose does Russia have in the clandestine \n     production of A-232? Instead of pushing a treaty that can't \n     accomplish its impossible goals, the Administration would be \n     better advised to use its clout, rather than that of some \n     planned U.N.-style bureaucracy, in getting the Russians to \n     stop making nerve gas.\n       It's hard to find a wholehearted advocate of the treaty. \n     The gist of the messages from most of its so-called champions \n     is that it's a poor deal, but it's the best on offer. But \n     their cases have acknowledged so many caveats that it's hard \n     to see how they've reached such optimistic conclusions. The \n     biggest danger of ratification is that it would similarly \n     lull the U.S. and other responsible nations into the false \n     belief that they are taking effective action against the \n     threat of chemical weapons. The case for this treaty strains \n     belief too far.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to add my voice to the statement \nthat the Senator from North Dakota made a little earlier in the \nproceedings about the importance of us getting on to a vote on the \nChemical Weapons Convention. I believe very firmly that this is an \nissue which has been hanging around the Senate for too long. We have \nhad many--in fact, years of consideration. We have had, I believe, 14 \nhearings now on the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  The convention was supported, of course, by the previous \nadministration. President Bush signed the agreement. We need now in \nthis administration, the second Clinton administration, to go ahead and \nratify it. There is an important date coming up which is the 29th of \nApril, which is the date by which we need to take action. Let me \naddress that issue first, because I know the Senator from Oklahoma did \nspeak to the fact that, in his opinion, April 29 was not a date of any \nconsequence and it did not matter whether we did anything this month or \nnot on the treaty. This is sort of a recent argument that has been made \nand one I think needs to be responded to.\n  A failure to ratify by April 29 will have significant adverse \nconsequences for our security and for U.S. businesses as well. Our \nability to oversee the first critical days and months of implementation \nof the treaty will be lost. We now have Americans who are heading up \nthe various divisions that monitor the treaty's budget and security \nmeasures and industry inspections, and those individuals, those \nAmericans who now are involved in that will be replaced by individuals \nfrom countries that have ratified the treaty if we do not take action \nby the 29th of April.\n  Moreover, Americans will not be able to be hired as inspectors with \nthese international teams if we do not ratify the treaty. Hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in sales of American chemical companies and many \njobs in many of our States will be at risk as a result of mandatory \ntrade restrictions which were originally designed to pressure rogue \nstates to join in the treaty. Those will be applied to us, Mr. \nPresident, if we do not go ahead and vote and ratify this treaty.\n  Failure to ratify, of course, relegates us to the so-called \ninternational pariahs that we give a lot of speeches about here on the \nSenate floor, countries like Libya and North Korea. We would be \nsquandering U.S. international leadership in the fight against chemical\n\n[[Page S2812]]\n\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction.\n  There have been many speeches given on the floor and by our President \nabout how the United States, at this particular point in history, is \nthe indispensable Nation. We are the one remaining superpower in the \nworld, both militarily and economically and, as such, we have a \nparticular responsibility to lead. Our failure to take action on this \ntreaty on the Senate floor is an abrogation or default of that \nresponsibility and one I think that I do not want to be any party to.\n  Another issue that has been raised, which I think needs to be \naddressed, is this issue which involves the question of whether or not \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention could be interpreted as providing rogue \nstates with the ability to acquire advanced U.S. technologies if we \nenter into this treaty. The issue was raised at the Armed Services \nCommittee hearing that we had a couple of weeks ago. In fact, the \nSenator from Oklahoma was there and requested that we get some kind of \nstatement from our Department of Defense in writing about their view of \nthis.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated April 2 to \nSenator Robert Smith and signed by Franklin Miller, who is the Acting \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Policy be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n                                   Assistant Secretary of Defense,\n\n\n                                             Defense Pentagon,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 1997.\n     Hon. Robert C. Smith,\n     Senate Dirken Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: During my 5 March 1997 testimony before \n     the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces of the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee, several questions were raised regarding \n     the impact of the Chemical Weapons Convention on the ability \n     of rogue nations to acquire advanced U.S. technologies and \n     the impact of the Convention on U.S. industry. I am pleased \n     to provide the Administration's official response on these \n     matters.\n       Article X: Assistance and Protection Against Chemical \n     Weapons. One concern expressed during the hearing was whether \n     Article X of the CWC might force us to share with nations \n     like Iran our most advanced chemical defense technologies and \n     equipment. I am pleased to reconfirm that Article X, which \n     establishes procedures for State Party requests and possible \n     responses to requests for assistance against chemical \n     weapons, does not require the U.S. to share its advanced \n     chemical weapons defenses and defensive technologies with \n     countries such as Iran. Assistance is defined in the treaty \n     as including items ranging from protective equipment to \n     medical antidotes and treatments.\n       States Parties obligations under Article X may be met in \n     one of three ways--by contributing to the voluntary fund \n     (managed by the Organization); by concluding agreements with \n     the Organization concerning the procurement, on demand, of \n     specific types of assistance; or by declaring (within 180 \n     days after the CWC's entry-into-force) the kind of assistance \n     it might provide in response to an appeal by the \n     Organization. To meet its obligations under Article X \n     therefore, the U.S. can choose from a variety of options and \n     forms of assistance none of which require sharing our most \n     advanced chemical defense or equipment.\n       Senator Inhofe raised a particular concern regarding \n     Paragraph 3 of Article X. This paragraph states that ``Each \n     Party undertakes to facilitate, and shall have the right to \n     participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, \n     material and scientific and technological information \n     concerning the means of protection against chemical \n     weapons.'' The inclusion of the words ``facilitate'' and \n     ``possible'' underscores that no specific exchange is \n     required and that any exchange which does occur is limited to \n     that which we determine would be appropriate and permitted \n     under the Convention.\n       A specific concern also was raised regarding whether \n     paragraph 5 of Article X would require the release of \n     advanced and classified information about defensive \n     capabilities and technologies. Paragraph 5 requires the \n     international Technical Secretariat that administers the \n     Convention to establish and maintain ``for the use of any \n     requesting State Party, a data bank containing freely \n     available information concerning various means of protection \n     against chemical weapons as well as such information as may \n     be provided by States Parties.'' As stated in the Article-by-\n     Article Analysis submitted to the Senate on November 23, \n     1993, ``freely available'' means ``from open public \n     sources.'' Further, the CWC imposes no obligation on states \n     parties to contribute to this database. Hence, the provision \n     will not require the release of classified or otherwise \n     sensitive information about U.S. chemical defenses.\n       Article XI: Economic and Technological Development. A \n     second area of concern raised in the hearing was whether \n     Article XI of the CWC, which relates to cooperation in the \n     field of chemical activities for purposes not prohibited by \n     the CWC, might force our industry to share dual-use \n     technologies and manufacturing secrets with other nations. \n     Article XI does not require private businesses to release \n     such proprietary or otherwise confidential business \n     information, nor does it require the U.S. Government to force \n     private businesses to undertake such actions.\n       Access to Information During Inspections. A final area of \n     concern raised during the hearing was whether the CWC might \n     permit nations, such as Iran, to have access to some of our \n     most critical technologies and manufacturing secrets during \n     inspections. In this context, a question was raised as to \n     whether the CWC required modification to preclude rogue \n     nations from getting access to our technologies during \n     inspections.\n       The CWC will not provide nations, such as Iran, with access \n     to our most critical technologies and manufacturing secrets. \n     The CWC, which was written with the help of U.S. chemical \n     industry representatives, already contains important \n     protections for industry, including provisions relating to \n     routine and challenge inspections that were designed to \n     protect against the loss of confidential business \n     information.\n       The Convention stipulates that States Parties have the \n     right to prohibit inspectors of any nationality from \n     conducting inspections within their territory or any other \n     place under their jurisdiction or control. Additionally, in \n     the case of challenge inspections, the Convention stipulates \n     that the inspected State Party has the right to reject \n     inclusion on the inspection team of an observer from the \n     country requesting the challenge. The Convention stipulates \n     that these teams are composed of international civil servants \n     ``who meet the highest standards of efficiency, competence \n     and integrity.'' If they violate their obligations to hold \n     all information confidential they will be subject to severe \n     penalties, including the possible loss of immunity from \n     prosecution by the inspected State Party.\n       The Confidentiality Annex to the Convention provides \n     further protection for confidential information at facilities \n     undergoing inspections. Paragraph 13, for example, specifies \n     that ``States Parties may take such measures as they deem \n     necessary to protect confidentiality, provided they \n     fulfill their obligations to demonstrate compliance. . . \n     .'' Paragraph 16 requires ``due regard . . . to the \n     requirement of protecting confidential information,'' \n     while paragraph 17 limits the information in the \n     international inspectorate reports to ``only . . . facts \n     relevant to compliance.''\n       With regard to the question of access, in neither routine \n     inspections nor challenge inspections does the Convention \n     require any facility to allow inspectors unlimited access. \n     For routine inspections, the United States has the right to \n     negotiate a facility agreement for each facility, which will \n     define the degree of access that inspectors would have, \n     including ``specific and detailed arrangements with regard to \n     the determination of those areas of the facility to which \n     inspectors are granted access'' (Paragraph 16 of \n     Confidentiality Annex). This facility agreement would provide \n     the facility with the opportunity to protect sensitive \n     information. Moreover, since advance notice would be given \n     for routine inspections, the facility would have ample time \n     to prepare for the inspection.\n       In the case of challenge inspections, the CWC also provides \n     for ``managed access'' that will be conducted in accordance \n     with constitutional obligations with regard to proprietary \n     rights or searches and seizures. Moreover, the facility that \n     is challenged will participate in the negotiations on the \n     degree of permissible access. While the U.S. and the facility \n     shall make every reasonable effort to provide the inspection \n     team an alternative means to satisfy the stated concerns \n     about the facility's compliance, the facility is not \n     obligated to allow inspectors to have unfettered access \n     within the facility.\n       I hope this information clarifies the matters that were \n     raised during the 5 March 1997 hearing. As I stated in my \n     opening remarks, the Department of Defense firmly believes \n     that the Chemical Weapons Convention is in the national \n     security interests of the United States. We strongly support \n     its prompt ratification by the United States and approval of \n     its accompanying implementing legislation. If I may be of \n     further assistance to you and to the members of your \n     Subcommittee, please do not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      Franklin C. Miller (Acting).\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this letter goes into great detail about \nwhy there is no provision in the treaty and there is nothing in the \ntreaty that our Department of Defense would interpret as putting an \nobligation on us to provide sensitive technologies to rogue states:\n\n       Senator Inhofe raised a particular concern regarding \n     Paragraph 3 of Article X. This paragraph states that ``Each \n     Party undertakes to facilitate, and shall have the right to \n     participate in, the fullest possible exchange of equipment, \n     material and scientific and technological information \n     concerning the means of protection against chemical \n     weapons.''\n\n  The letter goes on to say:\n\n\n[[Page S2813]]\n\n\n       The inclusion of the words ``facilitate'' and ``possible'' \n     underscores that no specific exchange is required and that \n     any exchange which does occur is limited to that which we \n     determine would be appropriate and permitted under the \n     Convention.\n\n  I think it is clear from this analysis that our own Department of \nDefense feels very comfortable with the provisions of this Chemical \nWeapons Convention. The overriding context that this convention is \npresented to us in has to be considered, Mr. President, whenever you \nare debating the chemical weapons treaty or the Chemical Weapons \nConvention.\n\n  Sometime over a decade ago, the United States made a decision to \nterminate the use of chemical weapons and, in fact, to destroy our \nstockpile of chemical weapons. President Reagan signed the law to do \njust that. In accordance with that, President Bush came along, after \nPresident Reagan, and went ahead and carried out that policy and \nentered into the Chemical Weapons Convention on behalf of the country \nand sent the treaty to the Senate for consideration. It has been \nlanguishing here ever since President Bush sent it here for \nconsideration.\n  I think that we would have a very different debate and you would have \na very different lineup of people on different sides of this issue--\nand, frankly, you would have many more people in opposition to this \ntreaty--if, in fact, we had not made a decision and put in our own law \na provision to renounce the use of chemical weapons. But we did. We \nmade that decision. President Reagan signed that law.\n  And now for people to come to the floor and say, no, no, we are going \nto be putting ourselves at some kind of disadvantage if we enter into a \ntreaty with 161 other countries which would subject them to the same \nkind of policy decision which we already made some decade ago, just has \nno logic to it.\n  Clearly, there are problems in verifying this treaty. There are \nproblems in verifying any treaty. They are probably complicated when it \ncomes to verifying a treaty to ban chemical weapons because it takes \nsuch a small amount of technology and such a small amount of space to \nproduce chemical weapons. But that does not mean that we should just \ngive up on any and all efforts to verify and any and all efforts to \ninspect.\n  I think Madeleine Albright, our Secretary of State, made the point \nvery well in a statement she made yesterday where she said, just \nbecause there may be people--and there are people--who will continue to \nmurder and pillage and sell drugs, does not mean we should not pass \nlaws to prohibit that. We should pass those laws. We should do our very \nbest to enforce those laws and implement them. That is true with \nchemical weapons as well.\n  There may be people--and there undoubtedly will be--some rogue states \nand some individual groups, terrorist groups, that try to violate this \ntreaty. All I can say is, we need to redouble our efforts to enforce \nthe treaty once we ratify it. We need to work with other countries to \ngain their assistance in doing that enforcement.\n  Clearly, it is in the best interest of the people of this country \nthat we take every action we possibly can to reduce the likelihood that \nchemical weapons will ever be used against Americans in future \nconflicts or in a nonconflict situation. Perhaps the biggest threat \nthat we face is not in the use of chemical weapons in a conflict. The \nbiggest threat may be the kind of an incident that occurred in Japan in \na subway where a terrorist group decides that for some perverted reason \nthey are going to engage in the use of chemical weapons. This treaty \nwill help us to ferret out those kinds of incidents, those kinds of \nrisks and to deal with them ahead of time. I think it is clearly in our \nbest interest to do so.\n  Mr. President, let me just say that I have confidence that the \nSenate, if allowed to vote on this issue, will vote by the necessary \nsupermajority to go ahead and pass the treaty and ratify the treaty. \nWhat we are up against now is an inability to get the treaty to the \nfloor for a vote. And that, I think, is a very sad procedural \ncircumstance that we have. We have a committee chair who has announced \nthat he may or may not allow this issue to be reported from the \ncommittee so that the full Senate can express its will on the subject.\n  Mr. President, I hope very much that my colleagues will join me in \nseeing to it that we do get this issue to the floor, and that we go \nahead and vote on the treaty. If a Senator wants to vote against the \nChemical Weapons Convention and go home and explain to his or her \nconstituents why they voted against the Chemical Weapons Convention, \nthen fine. That is the way the system is supposed to work.\n  But for us to deny Members the right to vote is really indefensible, \nin my view, on an issue of this importance. This is tremendously \nimportant. I have urged, as several Members know, the Democratic \nleader, and indicated to the majority leader that I thought it was \nirresponsible for the Senate to continue doing business as usual while \nthis issue continues to languish in committee.\n  The deadline is approaching. This is time sensitive. We need to go \nahead and get the issue to the floor and allow a good debate, allow \namendments, and allow a vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  I think that needs to be our top priority this April. And we are \nstill early enough in the month that we can bring this to the floor, \ndebate it, vote on it, and let the Senate do its will. The American \npeople have a right to expect that from us. And clearly we need to go \nahead and follow that course of action.\n  I think for us to continue with discussions about: Well, it does not \nreally matter whether we sign up now or sign up in June or maybe July \nor maybe this fall some time, that is not accurate, Mr. President. It \ndoes matter. And we will be giving up a leadership role that we should \nhave on arms control issues. We will be giving up a leadership role we \nshould have on the banning of chemical weapons. Clearly, I think that \nis contrary to the best interests of the people I represent and \ncontrary to the best interests of the American people generally.\n  Mr. President, I urge the majority leader and my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to put aside other business, and bring this issue to \nthe floor. Let us vote on it. Let us have a debate. Anyone who wants to \noffer an amendment should be able to do that. Anyone who wants to offer \nimplementing legislation should be able to do that. The Senate should \nvote on it, and then get about other business. So I hope that is the \ncourse we follow.\n  Mr. President, I know there will be additional chances this afternoon \nand later on to debate this issue in more depth. I look forward to \nthose. I believe very firmly that this is one of the most important \nissues this Congress, this 105th Congress, will address. I hope very \nmuch that we will clear the other procedural matters and the other \nsubstantive matters that are on the agenda and get on to a vote on the \nChemical Weapons Convention.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor and suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2811-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2813-S2817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEDICARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as I indicated yesterday, I intend to come \nto the Senate floor each day this week as part of an effort to build \nbipartisan support in the Senate for Medicare reform. It is very clear \nto me that there is a rare window of opportunity now for the Senate to \nact on this issue, a window, an opportunity I think would be a serious \nmistake to not exploit.\n  We know that the Federal deficit is a bit lower than was anticipated \nthis year, in the vicinity of $108 billion. We are seeing that there is \na fairly benign economic environment. Certainly, there are still folks \nhurting in our country, but, overall, the economy has been positive. We \nknow that we are a few years away from what I believe is sure to be a \ndemographic earthquake, with many more older people in our country, and \nolder people who need and deserve good quality health care.\n  Yesterday, I tried to outline what I thought were the central \nprinciples of comprehensive Medicare reform. Beginning today, Mr. \nPresident, I intend to\n\n[[Page S2814]]\n\ntry to outline some of the specific aspects of what Medicare reform \nought to consist of and how to get this program on track for the 21st \ncentury so that it operates in a fashion that is good for both older \npeople and for taxpayers.\n  Right now, in much of the United States, the Medicare Program is a \n30-year-old, ``Tin Lizzy''-style operation that rewards waste and \npenalizes frugality. This is particularly unfortunate since the end \nresult is that in communities like my own in Portland, OR, that hold \ndown costs, the end result for all the heavy lifting is simply a \nsmaller reimbursement check. I believe what we have today under the \nMedicare Program is a situation where because of the reimbursement of \nformula, a sleep-inducing, eye-glazing concept known as the average \nadjusted per capita cost, you have a situation where in much of the \nUnited States there are few, if any, choices for older people under \nMedicare because health plans are reluctant to come to those markets, \nor you have a situation where it is almost impossible for an older \nperson to navigate the system simply because they cannot obtain \nunderstandable, coherent information about their Medicare choices.\n  Mr. President, it would be impossible for you to be able to see this \nchart, but I intend in the days ahead to blow this up because it makes \nmy point with respect to how Medicare has made it difficult to have \ntrue competition like the competition that exists in the private sector \nfor health care. This chart, which obviously is going to be difficult \nfor you, Mr. President, and those who may be watching to see, involves \na wall that has been set up in Los Angeles with all of the information \nthat an older person has to go through in Los Angeles to make choices \nabout choosing a health plan. It clearly illustrates, in my view, what \nwe have seen with the Medicare Program over the last few years.\n  Because the reimbursement formula encourages waste and penalizes \nfrugality, we will have, in many areas, few choices for Medicare, \ndiscouraging competition, or, as I have shown through this chart and \npicture developed by the General Accounting Office, you will have just \na blizzard of information that older people find it very difficult to \nnavigate and make sense out of, thereby making it hard for them to have \nreal choice in their health system.\n\n  The irony, of course, is that every Member of the U.S. Senate knows \nwhat a competitive health system could look like, and a competitive \nhealth system that avoids the kind of problems I have just demonstrated \nwith this chart from the General Accounting Office. Mr. President, 21st \ncentury Medicare could really be modeled around the very program that \nMembers of the U.S. Senate participate in, known as the Federal \nemployee health benefits plan. The Federal employee health benefits \nplan offers enrollees a portfolio of plans, each one with somewhat \ndifferent service offerings. Consumers are helped to make appropriate, \nindependent choices because the managers of the Federal employee plan \npay attention to the details, including the way plans develop written \nexplanations presenting what individual policies will or will not do.\n  So for Members of the U.S. Senate, it is possible to get \nunderstandable, coherent information about what is available for \nSenators and their families. But if you are an older person who wants \nto compare and shop for health care, you have to try to figure out how \nto make sense of this incomprehensible picture that I just showed, \ndemonstrated by the General Accounting Office.\n  In addition, in the Federal employee health system, policies are \ninspected and reviewed on performance, and Federal employee plan \nparticipants are then given what amounts to report card grades on many \nof the important care provisions so that average consumers can sit down \nat their kitchen table and make plan-against-plan comparisons when they \nchoose their coverage.\n  Again, the difference between what is available to older people in \nmany parts of the United States for Medicare and what is available to \nthose Federal employees and Members of the U.S. Senate is striking in \nits contrast. Members of the Senate and Federal employees are going to \nbe in a position where they can make plan-against-plan comparisons so \nas to inject some competition in the system. Again, the General \nAccounting Office tells us that no such features exist in much of \nMedicare.\n  Finally, the Federal employee benefits managers look for high-quality \nservice at competitive rates for employees. They work on a competitive \nbasis to upgrade the quality and prices for the plan, while keeping \npremium rates at the lowest possible level. At the same time, these \nmanagers work to diminish risk selection by the plans, so that the \nolder individuals who are part of the Federal employee plan, or persons \nwith disabilities or chronic conditions, will not be eliminated from \ncoverage when they want to enroll.\n  Again, we see an effort to deal with the central questions that face \nhealth care reform in America, making sure that people are in a \nposition to compare their plans so that there is real competition, and \nto make sure that nobody is left behind just because they are older or \nthey suffer from a chronic condition.\n  So, in addition to these very positive features, in recent years, \naverage Federal employee health plan premium increases have stayed \nbelow 3 percent per year per enrollee, while the Medicare Program has \nseen average annual increases of almost 9 percent during the same \nperiod.\n  So, Mr. President, what we are seeing is that well-structured \ncompetition, like in the system that Members of the Senate belong to, \ncan work. It can work for patients and consumers in making sure they \nhave good quality care. It can work for taxpayers in that it holds \ncosts down, and it, for all practical purposes, is very similar to the \nsystem that we have in my hometown of Portland, OR.\n  In my hometown, Portland, we have the highest percentage of older \npeople in the Nation now participating in managed care. It is about 60 \npercent. Certainly, while not perfect, it avoids much of the set of \nproblems that we have seen in other parts of the country. You don't see \nthe gag clauses, for example, in our plan. And, hopefully, the U.S. \nSenate will pass the legislation this session that Senators Kyl, \nKennedy and myself have introduced to make sure that, as we go to the \n21st century, all patients understand their options and all of them \nknow about the various services that are available. But we don't have \nthose gag clauses in Portland, and we do have high-quality managed \ncare, and we are able to do it for substantially less than much of the \nrest of the Medicare system. The per capita rate in my hometown, the \nper person rate for Medicare participants, is still $60 to $80 below \nthe national average for Medicare.\n  One of the things that I hope the Senate will do, on a bipartisan \nbasis, is lift these penalties against towns like my home community \nthat have done the heavy lifting and have ended up being penalized for \nit. I think, on a bipartisan basis, the U.S. Senate should make changes \nin Medicare to lift the reimbursement for low-cost counties, \nparticularly in rural communities, and by doing so, benefit both \nseniors and taxpayers. Seniors will benefit from having the opportunity \nto get good-quality health plans in their areas, and it will also bring \nreal choice and real competition for the first time to those areas. The \nfact of the matter is, many of those communities haven't been able to \nunleash entrepreneurial and competitive forces into their health \nsystems such as we have in the private sector, because Medicare isn't \npaying those low-cost communities a fair rate. I have made changes in \nthat discriminatory reimbursement proposal in my Medicare reform plan, \nand I hope the U.S. Senate will accept that in this session.\n  I was pleased to see that, in the last week or so, the head of the \nHealth Care Financing Administration, Dr. Vladeck, has indicated that \nthere is a significant backlog of needed changes required to bring \nMedicare up to date. I hope that we will see more discussion of that in \nthe days ahead. I felt that it was positive news to see those comments \nfrom the head of the Health Care Financing Administration.\n  Mr. President, finally, let me say that I think, in addition to \npromoting competition, using the model of the Federal employee health \nplan, it's time for Medicare to look to the Federal employee health \nplan and the private sector for ways to improve quality in our health \nsystem. Again, there is nothing\n\n[[Page S2815]]\n\npartisan about the agenda to improve health care quality, but this is \nan area where Medicare has also lagged, both in relation to Federal \nemployees and the private sector. In other parts of our health system, \nit's possible, for example, to get good statistics on disenrollment, \npeople leaving because they are not satisfied with the plan. It is \npossible to get information about providers who leave a system because \nthey, too, feel it doesn't adequately address the needs of patients in \nproviding good-quality health care.\n\n  In other parts of the health system, there are grievance procedures, \nand we know, for example, how long it takes people to get through a \ngrievance procedure, or how long it takes to get a referral, or what \nhappens when you are denied benefits. In each of these areas so central \nto providing quality health care in America, Medicare is lagging behind \nthe Federal employee health system, and Medicare is lagging behind much \nof the private sector. In my legislation, we would change that. We \nwould require that these critical measures of quality be made available \nthrough report cards and other measures. I emphasize that today, Mr. \nPresident, because I think that, as we look to the 21st century of \nMedicare, we have an opportunity over the next few years to redesign \nthe system and try to get it on track for the next century when we will \nhave many more older people depending on Medicare.\n  So the alternative is very clear: A bipartisan effort to bring \ncompetition and choice and a new focus on quality in the Medicare \nProgram, or to continue business as usual and face what the General \nAccounting Office has told us will be a program that has simply run out \nof money when we hit the next century. I believe that, after years of \nbickering and partisanship on this issue, there is an opportunity now \nto address Medicare reform in a bipartisan way. Democrats have been \nright in the Senate to call on making sure that benefits are defined, \nthat older people have guaranteed, secure benefits. Republicans have \nbeen correct, in my view, in calling for more competition and more \nchoice in the system. Today, I have tried to talk about how that \ncompetition and choice exists in the program that Members of the Senate \nbelong to and is also available in much of the private sector.\n  Mr. President, this issue is so important that in the next century I \nbelieve that the public is going to ask every Member of the U.S. \nSenate, ``What were you doing to try to get Medicare on track?'' This \nprogram isn't just an important part of the Federal budget. It is going \nto be the Federal budget for the next 15 or 20 years. So now is the \ntime to act to get the program on track. I believe that this can be \ndone in a bipartisan way.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as I have said, I intend to come to the \nSenate floor each day this week part of an effort to help build \nbipartisan support in this body for Medicare reform.\n  Not via an independent commission. Not in the next Congress. But now, \nand by us, the Members of the 105th Congress.\n  I think we have an historic opportunity to transform Medicare from a \n30-year-old, tin-Lizzie style social welfare program into a 21st \ncentury, comprehensive seniors health care system that is humane, cost-\nefficient and sustainable.\n  The reformed Medicare Program I envision, and which I think is within \nour grasp, is a health plan that is about choice, quality and access, \nand also about the efficiencies that characterize much of the Nation's \nprivate health care marketplace.\n  But changing Medicare will require tough decisions, tough votes and, \nas in turning a battleship in mid-ocean, a good deal of time and \npatience on the part of beneficiaries and health care providers.\n  We must start by making the right moves, the right changes, today, \nbefore some 75 million baby boom generation retirees begin swamping the \nMedicare Program in 2013.\n  In my private conversations with colleagues, I've been arguing that \nthis is the classic pay-me-now, or pay-me-later situation. Structural \nchanges enacted in the next year or two will not be easy. But in the \nface of what Congress would have to overcome beginning early in the \nnext century, these changes will seem like child's play.\n  Medicare's problems are a snowball rolling down hill, picking up \nspeed and mass on almost a daily basis. Now is the time to slow-down \nthat snowball, if not stop it because in a few more years the program \nwill be crushed by its weight.\n  Each year without structural reform makes the task that much harder, \nand the risk to balanced Federal budgets that much more significant.\n  And assigning the task to a bipartisan commission without first doing \nour best to solve Medicare's problems is a retreat not just from our \nresponsibility, but from opportunity as well. I think there's a fervent \ndesire among my colleagues to try to fix Medicare in the current \nCongress.\n  I think we gain little by assigning that job in the first instance to \na bi-partisan committee, only to have to try to make tough votes on \ntheir recommendations in 1998, an election year for those who need to \nbe reminded.\n  The path to reform is not easy. Fortunately, however, there are sign \nposts and trail markers along the way, offering meaningful models for \nchanges and reform.\n  I think we see these possibilities for a 21st century Medicare \nprogram in systems as diverse as the Federal Employee Health Benefits \nProgram, which serves many Members of this body, to the Medicaid \nProgram which now operates in my home state of Oregon under a special \nFederal waiver.\n  The Federal Employees Health Benefits Program offers its enrollees a \nportfolio of plans, each one with somewhat different services \nofferings. Consumers are helped to make appropriate, independent \nchoices because the managers of FEHBP pay attention to the details, \nincluding the way plans develop written explanations presenting what \nindividual policies will or won't do.\n  Further, those policies are then inspected and reviewed on \nperformance, and FEHBP beneficiaries are then given what amounts to \nreport card grades on many of the important care provisions so that \naverage consumers can sit down at their kitchen tables and make plan-\nagainst-plan comparisons when they choose their coverage.\n  Finally, FEHBP smart-shopper managers negotiate high-quality service \nat competitive rates for enrollees. These government managers work with \ntheir plans on a continuous basis to upgrade the quality and range of \nservices offered by the plans while keeping premium rates at lowest \npossible levels. At the same time, these managers work to diminish risk \nselection by the plans, so that older FEHBP members, or persons with \ndisabilities or chronic conditions aren't eliminated from coverage when \nthey want to enroll.\n  In recent years, average FEHBP plan premium increases have stayed \nbelow 3 percent per year, per enrollee, while the Medicare Program has \nballooned to average annual increases of almost 9 percent during the \nsame period.\n  Oregon's ground-breaking Medicaid plan also helps mark our way toward \nan improved national Medicare system.\n  In Oregon, we've expanded the traditional Medicaid Program to cover \nnot only the federally qualified participants but also tens of \nthousands of working poor Oregonians who can't afford private \ninsurance, but whose incomes would disqualify them for traditional \nMedicaid.\n  The result has been a tremendous reduction across the State in \nunreimbursed hospital charity care, more preventative medicine for \nyoungsters and young mothers, and a per capita Medicaid cost rate that \nis 10 percent below the national average.\n  More care.\n  Less cost.\n  Efficient, preventative services that keep children and adults out of \nthe hospital.\n  Managed care has played a dominant role in this success story, as it \nhas in Oregon's Medicare experience.\n  Oregon's Medicare-qualified seniors have the highest penetration rate \nin the Nation in coordinated care. In Portland, nearly 60 percent of \nthe Medicare beneficiaries are in managed care.\n  And in this, the State's highest reimbursed city for Medicare \nbeneficiaries, the per capita rate is still 60 to 80 dollars below the \nnational average for Medicare.\n  I suggest that we may be doing some things right, out West and in the \nFEHBP program. And sad to say, these good things we see happening in \nMedicaid and Medicare are almost in spite of\n\n[[Page S2816]]\n\na Federal regulatory structure that hamstrings Medicare and Medicaid in \nterms of increasing both efficiency and quality, and expanding \nenrollment to the uninsured and under-insured.\n  This is a problem that is recognized even within the bowels of the \nMedicare management structure.\n  Mr. President, I was heartened to see the comments of my good friend \nDr. Bruce Vladeck in the trade press last week. Specifically, Bruce \nacknowledged that there is a tremendous backlog of needed statutory \nchanges required to bring Medicare up-to-date.\n  Gail Wilensky of Project Hope, puts it even more succinctly:\n\n       In sum, the present structure of Medicare hardly makes it \n     surprising that it is facing financial problems. The elderly \n     have limited options in the health care plans available to \n     them. Medicare pays most of the costs for services it covers \n     and almost all of the elderly have coverage that is \n     supplemental to Medicare, either privately purchased Medigap \n     or Medicaid.\n       That means there is little reason for an elderly person to \n     seek out cost-effective physicians or hospitals, or to use \n     lower cost durable medical equipment, laboratories or \n     outpatient hospitals.\n\n  Dr. Wilensky goes on to say that there is little reason for \npractitioners to provide cost effective care ``if there is any medical \ngain to be had from providing services and some reason to fear legal \nrepercussions if they do less than they might have done and the patient \nhas an adverse outcome.'':\n  And because payments to capitated plans now follow payments for local \nfee-for-service Medicare, Medicare HMO's in many high-cost counties are \nextravagantly over-paid, while in low-pay counties plans and HMO \nenrollment languish because of under-reimbursement.\n  We throw money at fat health plans in big counties, while we starve \nthe system of both choice and access--and I would argue quite probably \nquality as well--in counties where the payments are below the national \naverage.\n  This current state-of-affairs is precisely antagonistic to our goal.\n  Let me postulate that it is nuts to reimburse Medicare HMO's in high-\ncost counties at the same level, more or less, of the highest-cost fee-\nfor-service practitioners in those counties. That fact alone is one of \nthe big reasons why, quite rightly, the administration has argued that \nwe have a general HMO over-payment problem.\n  But the administration's argument that every HMO should be cut, \nhowever, to cure that problem is like saying amputation is an \nappropriate treatment for bunions.\n  Holy Dr. Kildare. In any other economic model or sector, a \nproposition like our current average adjusted per capita cost [AAPCC] \nformula would seem nuts. But that's the way it works in our creaking, \ninefficient and decidedly consumer unfriendly Medicare system.\n  Clearly, we must provide incentives for beneficiaries to choose just \nthe cost-effective health care they need, and to demand that \nphysicians, hospitals and other providers limit practice to cost-\neffective medicine.\n  This can be done while preserving the Medicare guarantee of a basic, \ngood quality package of health services to every eligible senior, no \nmatter what their health status or income level.\n  Here are components of a new Medicare system that provides both \nchoice and quality, with cost efficiency:\n  First, radically reform the formula by which we determine how \nMedicare managed care programs are paid so that reimbursements are \ngeared to the actual costs of managed care among elderly populations in \na particular county, or region, rather than the local cost of fee-for-\nservice medicine.\n  At the same time, scale-back payment increases in our high-\nreimbursement counties, and accelerate payments in the low-\nreimbursement counties where, because payments have been too thin, \nbeneficiaries have only fee-for-service Medicare to choose from.\n  In other words, give millions of disenfranchised Medicare \nbeneficiaries a real choice.\n  Second, require Medicare managers organize open bidding between plans \nin high-pay counties where profit margins are exorbitantly high.\n  Make the plans that are currently, hugely over-paid bid against one \nanother, on price, for Medicare beneficiaries in those counties.\n  I believe such competitions should take place in every county where \nthe average adjusted per capita cost--the AAPCC--is 120 percent of the \nnational average.\n  In sum, make adjustments in the HMO payment formula that decrease \nreimbursements in counties that we know are substantially over-\ncompensated; increase payments in counties that are so under-\ncompensated as to discourage HMO entry and competition; and resist \nproposals to reduce all county payments, alike, from 95 percent to 90 \npercent of the local AAPCC rate--a crude tool that will hurt the cost-\nefficient counties much more than the ``fat'' counties.\n  Mr. President, I believe that accelerating the growth of good quality \nmanaged care, such as we have in Oregon, can be a major factor in \ncuring Medicare's financial ills. Changing this AAPCC formula in a way \nthat makes sense--in a fashion that does not kill our efforts to bring \nMedicare into vast areas of this country where no choice but fee-for-\nservice medicine exists for beneficiaries--must be a high priority \npiece of the solution.\n  Third, put our two fastest growing portions of Medicare--home health \ncare and skilled nursing facility care--on a financial management diet.\n  That regimen is called prospective payment, and it means that in much \nthe same way we control hospital costs we would create a schedule of \ndaily maximum service costs for different aspects of care in each of \nthese important areas.\n  In my bill, S. 386, the Medicare Modernization and Patient Protection \nAct, prospective payment provisions for home health and skilled nursing \nfacilities would, together, save approximately $20 billion over 5 \nyears, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Eventually, but quickly, I think we ought to impose these kinds of \nfinancial management tools on other aspects of fee-for-service \nMedicare.\n  I see no reason why, as a matter of global budgeting, that \npractitioners in this field ought not be held to the same kind of case \nmanagement that HMO's require as part of their plans.\n  One method might be to require all Medicare fee-for-service \npractitioners to join a Medicare-sponsored provider network, which has \nat its core a case management system that ensures all participating \nbeneficiaries get the care and quality they need, but that \npractitioners and other providers don't over-bill or overprescribe.\n  This kind of PPO management would bring case gate-keeping into fee-\nfor-service Medicare, ultimately producing reasonable price and cost \ncontrols in the system.\n  Fourth, require competitive bidding for durable medical equipment \npurchases and eliminate what Dr. Vladeck has termed the ``current silly \ninherent reasonableness'' process.\n  I know many of my colleagues may not have looked hard at this bit of \nMedicare arcana. But let me say that this is all about getting medical \nequipment paid for by the program at the lowest possible cost as \ndetermined by the market.\n  At the same time, we need to know more about what procedures and \nservices work, and which don't, so that we can save money for the \nprogram and ensure that beneficiaries are getting optimum care.\n  The Health Care Financing Administration must be required to collect, \nanalyze, and act on more of the available data, in this regard, and \nthat admonition needs to be part of comprehensive Medicare reform.\n  Fifth, require HCFA to do local service-provider report cards for \nbeneficiaries. This sort of qualitative analysis should extend both to \nHMO's and their practitioners, and to local fee-for-service doctors and \nother providers.\n  This needed reform would include authorizing the program to demand \nand collect all relevant data from Medicare participants.\n  Sixth, the program must move much more aggressively in establishing \nspecial plans and services for the sickest, frailest enrollees; these \nare the Medicare beneficiaries who are usually qualified for both \nhealth and income reasons to receive benefits from Medicaid as well.\n  These enrollees are the fastest growing group of Medicare \nbeneficiaries, and the most expensive with costs to both programs \namounting to about $100 billion per year.\n\n[[Page S2817]]\n\n  Lack of systems to deal with the huge comprehensive care problems \nthese folks face has resulted in the worst possible scenario; much \nmoney is wasted while many folks don't receive the type or quality of \ncare they need.\n  Fortunately, there are a number of highly specialized programs called \nsocial HMO's or PACE programs, that provide coordinated care--using \nboth Medicare and Medicaid bucks--for populations of these \nbeneficiaries in less than two dozen communities. One of those \nprograms, ElderCare at Providence Hospital in Portland, is up and \nrunning in my hometown, and it is serving these frail elderly at well \nbelow the national average cost for the so-called dual-eligibles.\n  Why don't we have more? HCFA currently requires each of these \nprograms to apply on a waiver basis every time an individual community \nwants to start a social HMO or PACE program. This is expensive and time \nconsuming, and it limits the reach of a very good, cost-effective \nsystem.\n  And again, something that takes about 5 minutes to start up in the \nprivate sector, takes about 5 years through the Federal Government.\n  For this group we must create greater access for highly specialized, \ndual-eligible programs by giving organizers clear and certain and \nuniform rules of entry through the Medicare Program; eliminate the so-\ncalled 50-50 rule, requiring 50 percent non-Medicare enrollment for any \nHMO serving Medicare beneficiaries, based on enhanced performance and \nquality standards; develop tougher restrictions on adverse risk \nselection making it harder for plans to deny enrollment to sicker, \nfrailer beneficiaries; and set up a so-called outlier fund within \nMedicare, a special pool of cash fueled by reimbursement withholds from \noverpaid HMO's, to appropriately compensate plans that demonstrate they \nare serving sicker, more costly beneficiaries.\n  Seventh, reform our Medicare supplemental insurance laws--the Medigap \nregulations--to guarantee that every Medicare beneficiary can enroll in \na Medigap program at any time. I believe this change is crucial to \nencouraging more seniors to try HMO's, knowing that if they decide they \nmust return to fee-for-service medicine they will be able to get back \ninto Medigap coverage.\n  About a dozen States, including my home State of Oregon, already \nrequire guaranteed-issue. The Medigap market has not been destroyed in \nthose States. There must be a universal Federal standard protecting \nbeneficiaries.\n  Eighth, ensure better treatment and more appropriate treatment for \nMedicare beneficiaries by capturing the service and efficiency offered \nby telecommunications technology.\n  An important aspect of this is expanding the terms and conditions \nunder which Medicare will pay for services via the fiber-optic \nlifeline, and working with both the Federal Government and the States \nto knock down anticompetitive licensure practices and restrictions that \nhamper the ability of physicians and other practitioners to practice \nvia this new technology.\n  I can tell my colleagues that Oregon, like much of the west, is \nlooking hard at telemedicine as a way of getting better quality \nmedicine to folks who live way out in the country; and there are lots \nof places falling under that definition, west of the Mississippi.\n  Medicare needs to help in that effort, not build walls against 21st-\ncentury medicine.\n  Ninth, Medicare must unleash the quality and efficiency promised by a \nrapidly growing cadre of alternative health care providers.\n  The program can save money and deliver to beneficiaries better, more \ntargeted services by identifying and incorporating appropriate \nassignments for nurse practitioners, PA's, druggists, chiropractors, \nand other licensed professionals within the health care network.\n  Mr. President, these nine items are not the whole solution to \nmodernizing Medicare. But I do believe that together, they represent an \nappropriate jumping off position for real Medicare reform that can be \naccomplished in this Congress.\n  I know colleagues from both sides of the aisle will be talking about \ntheir own ideas in the weeks and months to come. I urge them, I urge \nall of us, to move these issues through the congressional process \nbeginning this year rather than expect a bipartisan commission to cure \nMedicare's problems for us.\n  Mr. President, tomorrow, I will go on to talk about other fundamental \nprinciples of Medicare reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my State has been hit by a massive \ndisaster over this last weekend. North Dakota has been hit with the \nstrongest storm in over 50 years. This is a storm of staggering \nproportions. Mr. President, North Dakota this last weekend got hit by a \ncombination of an ice storm and blizzard that is unprecedented in the \nlast 50 years.\n  In North Dakota, we are used to harsh winters, but, frankly, we have \nnever seen anything quite like this one. This most recent storm not \nonly involved ice, it involved 70-mile-an-hour winds. That combination \nhas knocked down power poles all across the eastern part of our State. \nAs of yesterday, we had 80,000 people still without power in the State \nof North Dakota, many of them with no power since Saturday morning. The \ntemperatures have been 40 degrees below zero wind chill since the heat \nwent out.\n  Mr. President, we have story after story of people who are huddled in \nhomes around stoves trying to keep warm. My scheduling director, who is \nfrom the small town of Warsaw, ND, has talked to her mother, who is \nover 80 years old. She has had no heat since Saturday.\n  Mr. President, this is a disaster of truly staggering proportions. In \nthis storm, there were whiteout conditions for 10 hours straight--10 \nhours straight--where the snow was so heavy and the wind so strong, you \nliterally could not see 5 inches in front of your vehicle. As I have \nindicated, all of this led to, first of all, a massive snowfall. In \nsome parts of our State, it was as much as 24 inches. In much of the \nState, it was 17 and 18 inches. That is on top of record snowfall that \nwe had already received. This is a headline from before this most \nrecent disaster: ``106 Inches of Snow and Rising.'' This is the Fargo \nForum newspaper, the biggest newspaper in the State of North Dakota, \nand this was before the most recent disaster. Now we can put another 17 \ninches on top of that in the Fargo area. This was a record at 106 \ninches.\n  Mr. President, we have extreme hardship now across the State of North \nDakota--no power, extremely cold temperatures, and facing us is the \nworst flooding in 150 years. The National Weather Service has now told \nus that we can anticipate the worst flooding in 150 years. That is on \nthe heels of the most powerful winter storm in 50 years. It makes you \nwonder precisely what is happening with these weather patterns.\n  We have had an entire community ask to be moved to an emergency \nshelter--1,500 people. In one of the small towns in North Dakota, they \nasked to have the whole town put in an emergency shelter because there \nis no heat and has not been any heat since Saturday. We had a local \nrancher call in to the radio station, and he said, ``My entire herd is \nout because the fences went down with this incredible ice storm and \nthese extraordinary winds.'' He asked people who were listening to the \nradio, ``If you see my herd roaming around, give me a call.'' I had \nanother rancher call in from a town out in the western part of North \nDakota, and he had a hundred cows and he had a calve crop coming in. \nUnderstand, this is the part of the season when you are calving. The \ncalves are being born and being born in these disastrous conditions. \nThey had a hundred cows, and they had a calve crop coming in, and they \nbelieve all of them are dead. They brought 10 into their own home--10 \ncalves into their home to try to save them. All of them died. What was \nhappening was, as the calves were being born, the wind is so strong, \nthe snow is being forced up into their nostrils and the cows were \nsuffocating. Now, if they didn't suffocate, they froze to death. Now, \nthat is the extraordinarily brutal conditions that we are facing.\n\n[[Page S2818]]\n\n  Mr. President, we had a disaster supplemental sent up by the White \nHouse before we had this 2-week break. I hope very much that the first \norder of business here will be that disaster supplemental. We ought to \nmove that legislation and move it now. There is assistance in that \nlegislation for some areas that have already been hard hit. There is \nfurther assistance for those that have been hard hit since that \ndisaster bill was sent up here.\n  So I would ask respectfully of the leadership to get that disaster \nsupplemental to the floor as quickly as possible. These are situations \nthat cannot wait. These people need help. They need it now. North \nDakota has been first in line to help out others when they faced \ndisasters, and we have been happy to do so.\n  Mr. President, we are now faced with a staggering disaster and we \nneed help. We are asking for it now.\n  Mr. President, I see there are other Senators wishing to speak. Will \nwe be able to continue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired, and it would \ntake unanimous consent for the Senate to continue.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for 1 minute more.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in addition to the disaster supplemental, \nI think we should also ask, ``Where is the budget?'' Because the budget \ncontains items that are going to be critically important to dealing \nwith these disasters as well. The budget was supposed to have come out \nof the Budget Committee by April 1. That deadline has been missed. The \nfull Senate is supposed to act by April 15. I hope we don't miss that \ndeadline as well, because this Congress is developing a reputation of \nfailing to act.\n  Mr. President, finally, there is a third matter. That is the chemical \nweapons treaty. We have a deadline of April 29. That is when it goes \ninto effect. Where is that piece of legislation?\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that there are three pieces of \nbusiness that we ought to do and do quickly.\n  The disaster supplemental ought to be first in line.\n  Second, the budget: We have a deadline of April 15.\n  Third, the chemical weapons treaty: We have a deadline of April 29.\n  All three of those ought to be taken up, taken up quickly, and passed \nso the people of this country know that this Congress is doing its \nbusiness.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Chair could interrupt the Senator, the \nSenator has an order to go into recess at 12:30. It would take \nunanimous consent for the Senate to extend that.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I ask unanimous consent to extend morning business, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2817-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2818-S2819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE DEVASTATION IN SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to \ncommend and recognize the strength and tenacity of the residents of my \nState of South Dakota, and also to further emphasize the importance of \nthis body in expediting the President's request for supplemental \nappropriations for disasters occurring in the Great Plains and other \nparts of our country.\n  I returned to Washington yesterday after spending 6 days touring the \ndevastation occurring in virtually every corner of my State. South \nDakotans are a hearty stock and during my years serving the citizens of \nSouth Dakota I have repeatedly witnessed South Dakotans' ability to \novercome any obstacle Mother Nature has given us. However, I don't \nbelieve I have ever seen South Dakotans rise to the occasion in quite \nthe manner they are doing right now under extraordinary circumstances.\n  I traveled to South Dakota last week expecting to see widespread \nresidual damage from the severe winter weather the State experienced \nover the past several months and subsequent high water from the ongoing \nsnowpack melt. Relentless sub-zero temperatures and continual snowfall \nin January forced South Dakota Governor William Janklow to request a \nmajor disaster declaration from President Clinton to ensure roads could \nremain clear for emergency services and basic travel and access to \nlivestock. President Clinton responded positively to the Governor's \nrequest and granted the declaration which gave the State additional \ntools to help meet its basic transportation needs.\n  Farmers and ranchers began facing hard times last fall with normally \navailable grazing and unharvested row crops being buried with snow. The \nsubsequent extreme cold increased the nutritional requirements of \nlivestock and depleted winter feed supplies. This already tough \nsituation became a crisis when the early January blizzards literally \nkilled livestock and put most producers' livestock at risk because of \naccess to feed being cut off. No one yet knows how many livestock were \nkilled, but estimates top at least 100,000. In addition, many livestock \nsuffered frostbite and were significantly weakened.\n  During this time, ordinary activities became extremely and \nincreasingly difficult because of the excess snow. Wintertime expenses \nlikely tripled as just getting livestock feed became a Herculean task. \nThe continued stress on livestock, especially cattle, meant that the \nmost important time of the year for ranchers--calving season--was \napproached with trepidation if not outright fear. Nutritional stress \nduring late gestation makes for weak and dead calves.\n  I toured the State during this winter storm disaster and was struck \nby the dramatic impact, particularly in the northeastern region of the \nState, of the winter weather. Snowdrifts as high as buildings, roads \nwith only one lane cleared with snow piled high on either side, homes \nwithout heat for days in the bitter cold, tens of thousands of dead \nlivestock, schools closed for a week at a time, and the depletion of \nour indigenous wildlife populations were commonplace. I vividly \nremember watching a cow climb to the top of a snowdrift as high as the \nroof of the barn so that he could eat the shingles from the roof. And, \nI also remember the positive, stubborn attitude of the residents of \nSouth Dakota in the face of this disaster. South Dakotans knew that \nwhat they were facing was tough, but they also knew that they were \ntougher.\n  As if surviving the severe winter cold of December, January, and \nFebruary was not challenge enough, residents and State and local \nofficials knew they could not rest from fighting the forces of Mother \nNature. Once all of the roads were cleared, emergency services were no \nlonger threatened, and it appeared that the worst of the winter weather \nwas over, focus turned to the next challenge: potential flooding \nproblems the State could experience once the snowpack began to melt.\n  Governor William Janklow provided exceptional leadership with his \ncomprehensive and aggressive efforts to get every community as ready as \nit could possibly be for the impending floods. Governor Janklow set up \na state task force to monitor the flows of the rivers and to work with \nlocal governments in their preparations. State and local governments \nworked with the Corps of Engineers and the National Weather Service to \npredict precipitation and runoff levels, identify areas where \nadditional flood protection measures should be undertaken, and design \nand implement additional flood control measures. The efforts made by \ncommunities were considerable. For example:\n  In Sioux Falls, the largest city in South Dakota, the Big Sioux River \nflood protection system was temporarily bolstered to hold up to 41,000 \ncubic feet of water per second. It was designed in the 1950's and \n1960's to hold 24,000 cubic feet--5,600 in the main river channel in \nwestern Sioux Falls and 18,400 in the diversion channel in the \nnortheast corner of the city. Sioux Falls also aggressively sandbagged \nand used over 60,000 sandbags in its efforts.\n  The small community of Davis filled and placed over 8,000 sandbags. \nResidents of the town of Hecla, population 400, built two dikes at the \nwest and north ends of town to hold back the James River. In Aberdeen, \nthe city built a levee about 2 feet high around the northern edge of \nthe city in just 6 days.\n\n[[Page S2819]]\n\n  These are just a few examples of the mitigation efforts undertaken by \ncommunities all over South Dakota. Because of these efforts, from all \nreports, South Dakota communities could not have been better prepared \nfor the anticipated flooding. I traveled to South Dakota early last \nweek expecting to see high water fairly well controlled by these \nmitigation efforts with some areas faring worse than others.\n  Unfortunately, the situation was worse than I anticipated because \nMother Nature, as only she can do, had changed the rules of the game \nand given the residents of the State of South Dakota more water than \ninitially anticipated and additional severe winter weather. The \ndevastation I witnessed and subsequent destruction in the short time \nsince my touring ended is heart-rending in its thoroughness and in its \nindiscriminate taking of property and possessions.\n  Let me give just a few examples of the ways in which our communities \nhave pulled together:\n  In a relatively small community near Huron, 150 students, volunteers, \nand State inmates joined together to save the James Valley Christian \nSchool from the waters of the James River. Their efforts were \nabsolutely inspiring. These individuals labored for days to stem the \nrushing James River with a sandbagged dike and sandbags all over the \narea to protect the school. Unfortunately, the James Valley Christian \nSchool lost its fight just days after I toured it. It now sits in 6 \nfeet of water.\n  I visited the farm of Gary and Diane Foster near Bruce, SD, where 30 \nhead of cattle were calving on a small island surrounded by flood \nwater. I will not soon forget this tragic sight.\n  It was evident that our farmers will once again face a financially \ndevastating problem in regard to springtime planting. Flooded fields \nprevent any field preparation, let alone planting. And there probably \nis not enough time for drying before it will simply become too late to \nplant this years' crops. In 1995, another very wet year, less than 40 \npercent of my State's crops were planted on time.\n  The current flooding means that we probably will not even match \n1995's slow performance. This is going to deal a tough blow to the \nagricultural economy of my State--and, in the end, it will deal a blow \nto consumers and businesses on Main Street.\n  I was amazed by the reality that many South Dakotans who normally \ntravel 10-15 miles to work, now have to drive 50-90 miles to work to \navoid washed out or water covered roads, which often times are our \nmajor highways. The Sioux Falls Argus Leader reported that Janice \nMellema, a nurse who lives west of Platte but works at the Gregory \nCounty Hospital, is forced to leave her home at 3:30 in the morning to \narrive at work by 6. She now has a 90-mile commute.\n  Some 100 people in north central South Dakota have already spent 30 \ndays in a motel after they were evacuated from their homes because of \nrising water. This last weekend 5,000 people in Watertown, SD, have had \nto leave their homes.\n  Essential services in many communities such as wastewater treatment \nplants are threatened. Many communities' systems have been overwhelmed \nand have been forced to release untreated water.\n  Vital infrastructure has been dramatically impacted. During my tour, \nwe drove on roads covered with water and saw many, many county roads \ncompletely washed away by a deluge of water. In McCook County every \nroad that goes into the county from both the east to the west and from \nthe north to the south are closed at some point.\n  Just as South Dakotans were accepting and successfully fighting the \nincreased flows of water, Mother Nature hit the State with yet another \nblizzard over the weekend. Some areas received 34 inches of snow \naccompanied by 60-mile-per-hour winds. This winter storm resulted in \nsub-zero wind chill temperatures and zero visibility in much of the \nState for an extended period of time. A 100-mile stretch of Interstate \n90 was closed and many communities were forced to prohibit all travel. \nI was stranded in Wall, SD for over 24 hours because of this winter \nstorm.\n  This winter storm would have been a lot to handle as an isolated \nincident but coupled with the flooding already experienced all over the \nState, the impact of the winter weather has been unprecedented. The \nadded precipitation and severe weather has led to unparalleled \ndevastation.\n  Last weekend's blizzard is truly salt in the wound for producers in \nmy State. Our producers are in the middle of calving season now and \ntrying to prepare for springtime field preparations. The blast of cold \nand more snow on top of already treacherous conditions will surely mean \nthat the number of dead livestock will continue to rise. This may well \nput many producers over the edge financially--after all, they only get \none chance per year to successfully complete calving season.\n\n  This storm severely impacted the city of Watertown, causing the \nsituation to escalate from a 100-year flood event to a 500-year flood \nevent. Earlier this week, Mayor Brenda Barger, who I must commend for \nher effective leadership during this crisis, poignantly observed that, \n``It's a humbling thing when you see people out sandbagging in 60-mile-\nper-hour winds, in a blizzard, knee-deep in water.'' I think her \nstatement sums up a lot of what everyone has felt over the last few \nweeks and, in particular, the last few days. Everyone banded together \nto save and minimize damage to both public and private property \nregardless of the weather conditions.\n  In a State that covers 80,000 square miles, it is both rare and \nunfortunate to have a situation where regions across the entire State \nare so disastrously affected by severe weather. The widespread nature \nof this disaster has devastated the agribusiness economy of our entire \nState and assistance in the coming months is absolutely critical to \nensuring the future existence of many small businesses in South Dakota. \nThe combined impact of the weather disasters over the last 5 months on \nagriculture is the gravest threat South Dakota farmers and ranchers \nhave faced from nature in probably 100 years. Additionally, the damage \ndone by the prolonged flooding has jeopardized the long-term viability \nof parts of South Dakota's infrastructure. Prior to the extensive \ndamage done from this year's severe weather to South Dakota's roads, \nthe State of South Dakota had an excess of $500 million in backlog \nneeds on its State Highway System alone. And, the damage to personal \nproperty is as yet uncalculated in monetary or sentimental value.\n  Our State has been fortunate enough to receive an outstanding \nresponse from President Clinton and FEMA in the past. I am grateful \nthat, once again, the President has responded expeditiously with much \nneeded assistance for South Dakota. Yesterday, the President made a \nmajor disaster declaration for the entire State which will supplement \nthe efforts of the State and local governments during this difficult \ntime.\n  As I mentioned previously, the spirit of South Dakotans, even in this \nincredibly difficult time, never ceases to amaze me and this weekend's \ntrip reemphasized that impression in my mind. I am committed to doing \neverything I can do to assist the State and communities as much as \npossible to ensure South Dakotans can get back to living their normal \nlives at the earliest possible time. I look forward to continuing to \nwork with Senator Daschle, Representative Thune, Governor Janklow, and \nlocal communities in the coming weeks and months as we clean up from \nthis disaster.

Among those that are opposing this legislation are the \nPhysicians for Social Responsibility, Clean Water Action, the Students \nEnvironmental Action Coalition of the University of Northern Iowa, Eco-\nAction of Penn State University, Southwest Research and Information \nCenter, Snake River Alliance, Alliance for Survival, San Luis Obispo \nMothers for Peace, Los Alamos Study Group, Desert Citizens Against \nPollution. These are only a few, Mr. President, of the organizations \nthat oppose this legislation. There is not a single environmental group \nin the United States of America that supports this legislation.\n  We heard yesterday and we have heard time and time again, Mr. \nPresident, that the State of Nevada had nuclear testing, therefore, why \ndo we not have open-armed acceptance of storage of nuclear waste? I \nsay, Mr. President, some have said that since the Nevada desert has \nalready been degraded from nuclear weapons testing, it is a logical \nplace to store nuclear waste.\n  Somehow, this logic seems to contradict the old saying that two \nwrongs do not make a right. The suggestion assumes that these two \nactivities have something in common. The only thing they have in common \nis posing danger to Nevada citizens and its environment.\n  We have just recently finished 50 years of the most dangerous period \nin America's history. During this period of time, the Soviet Union and \nthe United States had tens of thousands of nuclear warheads pointed \nagainst each other.\n  Mr. President, as I said, just a few years ago, tens of thousands of \nnuclear warheads were pointed toward the Soviet Union and toward the \nUnited States. This dangerous era was ended successfully, I believe, \nMr. President, in large part, because of what was done at the Nevada \ntest site. That is, we tested the new weapons, the safety and \nreliability of those that were in existence. This, Mr. President, was a \ntime of national crisis. All were called upon to do what they must in \norder to protect our country's security. The urgency of this national \nmission required things to be done in ways that, under less stressing \nconditions, would never have been permitted.\n  Well, just like the promises made by advocates for waste storage in \nNevada, that was then and this is now. Then was a period of national \ncrisis and danger. Now is one of peace and prosperity. Now is a time \nwhen we can surely do things right. There is no danger presently that \nwould drive us to endanger our environment or our public by reckless \nand ill-conceived actions.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. The bill clerk \nproceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, with respect to disposal of high-level \nnuclear waste, this Nation is today at a crossroads. The job and the \nresponsibility of addressing the disposal of spent nuclear fuel from \nour Nation's powerplants--is an obligation of this body. The time for \nfixing the problem is now.\n  There has been a lot of progress made. We have selected a permanent \nrepository at Yucca Mountain. That is already done. It is underway. We \nhave expended about $6 billion, and that 5-mile exploratory tunnel will \nsoon be completed. This is a positive commitment by the Congress to \nproceed with a permanent repository. We can build on this process.\n  This bill, Senate bill 104, continues the site characterization \nactivities for a permanent repository. Make no mistake about it. But \nthis is an ongoing process. In the meantime, we have an obligation to \ntake this waste next year, in 1998. Well, this Senator from Alaska and \nthe majority of my committee are of the opinion that a contract is a \nbinding commitment.\n\n  The Federal Government, 16 years ago, entered into a contract with \nthe nuclear industry to take this waste in 1998. We have no place to \nput this waste because Yucca Mountain isn't completed. We face \npenalties; we face litigation. It is estimated that the damages \nassociated with the inability to fulfill the contractual commitment \nwill run somewhere between $40 billion and $80 billion. That is an \nadditional load on the taxpayers of this country. We need a temporary \nstorage facility or we will continue to be storing this waste across \nthe Nation for decades to come.\n  Where is the waste? Well, let's look at this chart. We have \ncommercial reactors represented on the chart. We have shut down \nreactors with spent fuel on sites represented on the chart. We have 110 \nof the commercial reactors, 110 reactors in about 41 States. We have 10 \nshut down reactors, represented on the chart. We have one existing site \nfor spent commercial nuclear fuel storage on the chart, is in the State \nof Illinois. Non-DOE research reactors--we have 38 shown on the chart. \nWe have naval reactor fuel up in Idaho, up in Washington, and in \nGeorgia. There are 10 of those sites. Department of Energy-owned spent \nnuclear fuel sites, about 12, are indicated on the chart.\n  So there is where we are. We have this stuff scattered all over the \nUnited States. We can choose now whether the Nation needs these 80 \nsites, or just 1--1 in the arid remote Nevada test site, where we \nexploded a series of nuclear bombs during the cold war, a site that has \nbeen determined to be safe. It is a remote location. It has been well \nmonitored by an experienced work force and a security force as well.\n  Now, if Yucca is licensed for a permanent repository, it will simply \nbe a very easy task to move the spent fuel to the permanent repository \nfrom the interim facility this bill would authorize. Now, the problem \nis that Yucca isn't going to be ready until the year 2015. Some \nsuggest, well, what happens if Yucca is not licensed or is found to be \nunsuitable? Will we need a centralized interim site anyway so that we \nwill be way ahead of the game? The answer is, yes, regardless of what \nhappens at Yucca, this is a step we should take and take now.\n  Critics have claimed that we can't store waste safely, that we don't \nhave the technology. Nature itself suggests that a geologic repository, \nwhich this bill supports, is the best long-term answer. Let me refer \nagain to a natural geological nuclear waste repository that has been in \nexistence for a long time. Such a repository is in Gabon, in Africa. \nThere, approximately 1.8 billion years ago, at a place called Oklo, \nscientists have proven that naturally occurring, highly enriched \nuranium began a spontaneous nuclear reaction producing almost a ton of \nplutonium, as well as all of the other fission byproducts that occur in \nspent fuel from modern nuclear power plants. That is the history. That \nis a fact. It actually happened, under the watch of Mother Nature. Now, \nMr. President, when it happened, it happened just a few feet beneath \nthe surface. No geologists studied the site before the waste was \n``stored'' there. There was no engineering barriers around the so-\ncalled spent fuel. However, scientists have proven that the plutonium \nand the other fission products did not migrate away from that site. \nThere is nothing unique, Mr. President, about the geology of Oklo. This \n``experiment'' shows that radioactive waste can be successfully \ncontained within a geologic repository. Mother Nature did it 1.8 \nbillion years ago. Now we are talking about the science, the \ntechnology, and the application of mankind in the process. Well, it \ncertainly seems to be taking equally as long.\n  When I said that we had designated Yucca as a permanent repository \nand that we spent some $6 billion in the process, and will probably \nexpend as much as $30 billion, it is important to recognize what comes \nnext. First, it has to be deemed viable. That means the scientific \ninformation gathered by 1998 will show that nothing is there that would \ndisqualify Yucca Mountain for a permanent repository. That is done next \nyear, in 1998. What are the odds on that? They tell us about 90 \npercent.\n\n  The second factor is the suitability. Yucca Mountain must be \nsuitable. It must be a suitable site for a permanent repository under \nthe guidelines issued by the Department of Energy. When is\n\n[[Page S2822]]\n\nthat supposed to be completed? In the year 2001. What are the odds on \nthat? They tell us about 80 percent. Then, of course, it has to be \nlicensed, licensed by the NRC, who issues the license for a permanent \nrepository. Well, for the date of that we can only rely on the former \nSecretary of Energy O'Leary, who indicated that would be about the year \n2015.\n  Talking about this waste brings us to the reality that we are going \nto have to transport it. You simply can't leave it at these sites. So \nlet's talk a little bit about the transportation issue, because this is \non the minds of many Members. This map accurately shows, from 1979 to \n1995, the movement and transportation routes of 2,400 individual \nshipments of waste around the country. The interesting thing, Mr. \nPresident, is that they go through every single State of the 48, with \nthe exception of South Dakota and Florida. All the States are \nrepresented here. That is the harsh reality. We have been moving this \nwaste for 16 years. Why hasn't it been on the front pages of the \npapers? Because it has been a nonevent. It has moved safely. It has \nmoved from reactors. It has moved from Navy facilities and from Army \nfacilities, and it has been on railroads and on highways, and it has \nbeen under the auspices of the Department of Energy, and it has been \nsafe.\n  We have heard in this debate, primarily from my good friends from \nNevada, that somehow this waste is a new threat that America has never \nfaced before. That is just poppycock. Emotional statements have been \nmade time and time again, suggesting that somehow the health and safety \nof 50 million Americans will be threatened. And there have been \nreferences to the unfortunate Chernobyl accident. That accident, as \neverybody knows, involved a graphite reactor without a containment \nbuilding. Electricians were in there doing an operation they weren't \nsupposed to be doing. They didn't have the training. They bypassed the \nsafety procedures, took the reactor critical, and the results were very \nunfortunate. But it was human error, Mr. President. The graphite \nreactors are not the type that we have in the United States. Yet, this \neffort to try to address an obligation to our Nation's waste has been \nreferred to as a ``mobile Chernobyl.''\n  Here is what we have been moving, Mr. President. Again, do we want to \nmove it to one site in the Nevada desert now, as we wait for the \ndevelopment of our permanent repository? Or do we want to leave it for \nanother 15, 16, or 17 years, actually, in the 80 sites in 41 States? No \nfatality, injury, or environmental damage has ever occurred in the \nUnited States because of radioactive cargo movement. That is just a \nfact. We have taken steps to ensure that the risk is as negligible as \npossible.\n  Some of our friends would imply that if this bill doesn't pass, then \nnuclear waste won't be shipped on our Nation's roads. Well, that is \nsimply not true, Mr. President. Let's take a look at the routes used--\nthe routes used for 15 years, again, for the thousands of fuel \nshipments. Some say they didn't know the fuel shipments took place. \nAgain, as I have said, that is because they are uneventful. Trucks \ncarrying the casks have been in accidents, but the casks that contain \nthe nuclear material have performed as designed. They have not broken \nopen. The nuclear disasters that the Senators from Nevada have referred \nto, Mr. President, simply haven't happened.\n  Now, we have heard claims that the number of shipments that would \noccur under Senate bill 104 is an unprecedented amount. Well, that is \nsimply not true. We have our storage in our reactors in the cells \nadjacent to the reactors and the pools, and those are filling up. We \nneed to relieve that congestion, and that is the whole purpose of the \ninterim retrievable storage. We currently have about 30,000 metric tons \nof spent fuel in this country. But the French alone have shipped that \namount of spent fuel all over Europe--for that matter, all over the \nworld. This is not just history. It is happening today. It is happening \nall over the world.\n\n  The Department of Energy, as a matter of fact, is transporting spent \nnuclear fuel all over the country and all over the world as we speak. \nHere it is in the country. Let's take a look at a chart of the world. \nHere we have it, Mr. President. There seems to be a double standard \nhere when the Department of Energy claims that it cannot possibly \nfulfill its obligation to the U.S. electric ratepayers to take spent \nfuel. Why is it doing so in foreign countries? Well, here they are. In \nEurope, there is Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, \nAustralia, throughout South America, and Peru and Canada. We are taking \nthis now under agreements that have been made. Where is it going? It is \ngoing to the Savannah River in South Carolina. This chart shows the \nactual times of delivery from 1996 to 2009. These are the countries to \nwhich we have committed taking their waste. So it is a double standard, \nMr. President. Why are we doing it for foreign countries? We are not \ndoing it for our own nuclear industry.\n  You may ask why the taxpayers are paying for the Department of Energy \nto transport and store nuclear waste in foreign countries while \nAmerican ratepayers are left out. All the countries in color on this \nchart ship fuel to the United States for storage at the Department of \nEnergy facilities. It doesn't seem to be a mystery to some. But it is a \nmystery to me. Another mystery is why many of the same groups that most \nactively oppose resolving our domestic fuel storage problems were most \nsupportive of taking nuclear waste from foreign countries. Think about \nit. We are taking waste from Russia--military waste--because we deem \nthat lessens the proliferation threat. If they support taking nuclear \nwaste from overseas, can the safety of transportation be an issue? One \nwonders why it is now. How can it be safe for the Department of Energy \nto ship spent fuel halfway across the world but not across a few \nStates? They don't explain that very well, do they?\n  Actually, if you look closer, you see that the Department of Energy \ntransports nuclear waste across the United States. Let's take a look at \na map of the United States. It goes into Hanford. It goes into \nSavannah; Hanford in the State of Washington. This shows the American \nresearch reactors at our universities. They ship fuel for storage at \nDOE facilities. They are scattered all across the country. The various \nuniversities are Ohio State, MIT, the University of Virginia, and Oak \nRidge. We could go on and on. They are all across the country. That is \nwhy I contend that we have a double standard.\n  Why does the Department of Energy pay to transport and store nuclear \nwaste from foreign countries but won't do its own duty to the U.S. \npower reactors that have paid for the service? They have paid for the \nservice. The ratepayers that depend on nuclear energy paid $13 billion \nto the Federal Government. Where is the money? It has gone into the \ngeneral fund. It is not an escrow account. But there is a contract \nsigned for next year. The Department of Energy will say that they take \nforeign fuel to help with the nonproliferation. That is all well and \ngood. But spent nuclear fuel is spent nuclear fuel regardless of where \nit is. If transportation and storage is safe for some, why isn't it \nsafe for all?\n  I think this just proves the point that the obstacles to moving our \nNation's spent fuel are political. They are not technical. We have \nmoved it. We move it from our research reactors all over the country. \nWe move it from other countries in the world and bring it to the United \nStates to Savannah, and have been doing it for some time.\n  My bill, and the committee bill, S. 104 of Senator Craig and others, \nprovides the authority to coordinate a systematic safe transportation \nnetwork to move spent fuel to a storage facility under Senate bill 104. \nThe Department of Energy is required to use--``required''; it is not \noptional--to use NRC-certified transportation containers to transport \nfuel along special routes chosen by DOT radioactivity transport \nregulations and considerations set out in the bill.\n  Let's take a look at how that is shipped because I think it is \nimportant to recognize the care that goes into this. This is a truck \nthat is moving over the highways of the Nation probably today; moving \nsome kind of fuel in a cask probably to the Savannah River site in \nSouth Carolina. It is moving safely. It is moving in a special \ncontainer. These are probably spent fuel rods. They are radioactive. \nBut by the same token, care and engineering technology has gone into \nthis. I find it\n\n[[Page S2823]]\n\nsurprising to note that--and the comment was made in the debate that \nthe environmental groups don't support this legislation. I find it \nfurther perplexing that these groups on the one hand are opposed as we \nall are to the increase in greenhouse gases yet the only current \ntechnology available to reduce it dramatically is nuclear energy. Our \nuse of nuclear energy reduces more than 140 million metric tons of \ncarbon dioxide emissions each year, not to mention sulfur dioxide and \nvarious other pollutants. This is the contribution that nuclear energy \ncontributes to air quality in this country. Some suggest that the \nopposition by the environmental groups is simply to shut down the \nreactors because they do not believe in or don't approve of nuclear \nenergy or nuclear power.\n\n  But they don't want to recognize that about 22 percent of our \nNation's power is generated by nuclear reactors, and, if you reduce or \neliminate the nuclear power industry in this country, you will have to \nreplace it with something. It will probably be replaced with carbon \nfuels. And there is an emission concern there.\n  So I say to those that are opposed to this legislation that they have \nan obligation to come up with something that answers the question of \nwhat we do with our spent fuel. I think that is what this bill does.\n  Further safeguards have been taken in this legislation to provide \nthat transportation cannot occur until the Department of Energy has \nprovided specific technical assistance and funding to States affected \nby the transportation route, Indian tribes, and for emergency response \nplanning along the transportation routes. That isn't what is done now. \nBut that is what is required in the bill to make it that much safer. \nThe language builds on what is an already safe system for transporting \nspent fuel in this country. As I have said before, the public has never \nbeen exposed to radiation from spent fuel cargo even in accidents. \nBetween 1971 and 1989 the Department of Transportation tells us that \nthere were seven minor accidents involving trucks carrying waste: Flat \ntires, and various other things. But no radioactivity was released in \nany of the accidents. That is because transportation canisters are \ndesigned to maintain their integrity during severe accidents. They have \nbeen used for thousands of safe shipments over the years. As a matter \nof fact, they were designing casks at one time when they contemplated \nflying the fuel. It was suggested that the technology existed for casks \nto be designed for a 30,000-foot free fall. And I am told that they \ncould design it.\n  Nevertheless, the canisters that are depicted here in the picture, \nthe design approved by the NRC for spent fuel transport have \ndemonstrated a remarkable ability to withstand falls of 30-foot drops. \nAnd these are tests that were made into a national unyielding surface. \nThere was no penetration from a drop of 40 inches onto a steel spike; \nno penetration being engulfed in 1,475-degree temperature fire for 30 \nminutes; no penetration, submerged under 3 feet of water for 8 hours; \nno penetration.\n  So, despite what you may hear, engineers at the national labs tell us \nthat the test conditions that these casks are subjected to are much \nmore rigorous than any that they would face in real, live accidents.\n  These casks have been tested in some more rigorous ways. Probably it \nwould be interesting to watch because they have been run into by \nlocomotives, and crashed into walls at 70 miles an hour. If any of the \nSenators or the staff want to see the video of these tests we would be \nhappy to provide them with the tapes to view and to keep.\n  So I suggest that we face facts. The history of the nuclear waste \nshipments is that they are moving almost as we speak, continue to move, \nand will move tomorrow but they are not going to be carrying the waste \nthat they were contracted for. They will be carrying other wastes from \nother countries from research reactors from our universities. And it \nfails me to know why we are excluding the waste that we contracted for \n16-17 years ago to take next year, and we have no provision to take \nthat waste. That is what this bill is all about. S. 104 provides safe \ntransportation with a perfect record, and I think it makes it even \nsafer.\n  So as a consequence, that tells the story of the transportation \nsystem.\n  Let's look very briefly at what we are proposing. This is the \nlocation for the waste storage at the Nevada test sites that we have \nused for the previous 800 nuclear weapons tests. That is what it looks \nlike. It is a pretty barren area. You see some roads for access, and \nmounds where 800 nuclear weapons tests were made. Why was this area \npicked? Probably there are a lot of reasons. It is remote. That is \ncertainly one. The weather is pretty stable out there. You can observe \nthe testing very well. They had a trained work force. To some extent I \nsuppose there was some economic reasons. But it is not my State, and it \nis not appropriate that I evaluate the rationale that went into it. But \nthat is the site.\n\n  When we look at all other factors and recognize that nobody wants to \nstore waste, the fact that we have it in 40 to 41 States, and the fact \nthat we are going to have to move it regardless of whether it is being \nmoved to a temporary repository or eventually to a permanent one, the \ntransportation factor is a given.\n  So I hope that those that are concerned about transportation \nrecognize a couple of things: One, they may have waste in their State \nalready. It may be military waste. It may be naval waste. It may be \nwaste from some other activity associated with their university, or \nthey may have nuclear power. If you want it to stay there indefinitely \nwith no action, then that is the status quo. And that is where we have \nbeen. But if you want to move it out of your State, you have to move it \nsomeplace. The question is where do you move it?\n  We have determined that this is the permanent site for a nuclear \nrepository. When that was chosen, it was chosen over potential sites in \nthe 50 States. Why was it chosen? Because it was deemed to be, of all \nthe sites that were evaluated, the best site with the highest \nlikelihood of this being named the permanent repository when we get \nthrough with the process now underway. That is the process of \nviability, suitability, and licensing. Then it goes in there \npermanently under our policy. But the idea of moving now to accept this \narea for a temporary repository until we can complete Yucca Mountain is \nwhat this legislation is all about because it suggests that it would \nmove in those casks by transportation routes, either surface railroad \nor highway, in these casks out to a pad, out in the desert where it \nwould be monitored. And those casks would be held there so we can \nfulfill our contractual agreement as we recognized that the storage at \nour nuclear power generator sites are filled up. They would be moved \nout to this pad and be monitored until such time as the permanent \nrepository is completed.\n  On the chance that the permanent repository is not licensed and it \ndoesn't get through this viability, suitability, or licensing, this \nbill provides that we still have an obligation to address a resolve. \nThat would require the President then to find another site. We have \ngone through all the 50 States. If this one is not suitable for a \npermanent repository, it requires the President to find one. If he \ndoesn't find one, he comes back and designates that this be the site.\n  Now, some suggest there should be some other consideration. Maybe we \nshould do something like the base closing procedure, where we name a \ngroup of qualified people to determine a site. The problem we have with \nthis legislation is nobody wants to face the reality of making the \ndecision now. They want to put it off. The administration does not want \nto have it happen on their watch. They would just as soon have it \nhappen on another's watch. We could easily put this off to another \nCongress, but we are cheating the taxpayers because the liability for \nnonperformance of the contract is going to face us next year. The \nlonger we keep that waste in violation of the contractual terms, the \ngreater the liability to the taxpayer for nonperformance, because \nGovernment simply passes that liability on to you and me, and we pay \nfor it.\n  As I said, we have spent $6 billion here at Yucca. We are going to be \nspending about $30 billion by the time it is completed. We have been \ntransporting waste fuel around this country for 16 years. We sit, \ntoday, with 80 sites in 41 States and we are even having some Members \nsuggest that all they want from this legislation is the assurance that \nit will not be put in their\n\n[[Page S2824]]\n\nState. I suppose we could go back to a 6th grade mentality--and pursue \na series of amendments from virtually everybody, in all the 50 States \nwith the exception of one. I would hope that would not happen. I would \nhope we can recognize our obligation as parliamentarians and address \nthis with a resolve that suggests the way to move on this thing, and \nmove now, is as proposed under this legislation, which would provide, \nafter the viability is determined on Yucca Mountain as being a \npermanent site, which is anticipated sometime next year, to then allow \na temporary repository to occur in the Nevada desert at the Nevada test \nsite.\n  If somebody else has a better suggestion for a response to the \nobligation we have now, why, I am certainly willing to consider \namendments to the pending legislation.\n  Mr. President, recognizing the time element that we have, I ask how \nmuch time remains on the side of the proponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls 40 minutes \nand 50 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I yield to my \ncolleague at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I want to return to what I think is the \nfundamental flaw in this legislation, and that is that it is unneeded, \nunwise, and unsafe. When you ask who wants this legislation, the only \none that is really pushing it, the driving force, is the nuclear \nutilities. That is where this all comes from. Every environmental \norganization in the country has expressed its opposition. The \nscientific community--the Congress established the Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board. I will repeat for the benefit of my colleagues, \nin 1989 a commission was part of the review process. They said there \nwas no safety advantage to interim storage. In 1996, we have a report \nfrom the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board that said there is no \nurgent technical need for centralized storage of commercial spent fuel. \nThere is no safety factor to consider. And the same technical review \nboard, constituted with new members in 1997, has offered testimony to \nthe effect that it would be a very unwise decision because it would \ninterfere with the permanent siting process.\n  That was testimony that was given on February 5. So, if we are asking \nabout science and the scientific community, they have expressed \nthemselves. They said this is not a good idea. If you are asking about \nthe environmental community, where they are coming from, they are \nsaying it is not a good idea.\n  Yesterday, I spent a few moments talking about the specifics of the \nbill. Let me just very briefly retrace some of those issues for us. In \neffect, what this legislation does is to gut a process that was a \nbipartisan piece of legislation, the National Environmental Policy Act \nof 1969. If you look at page 47, and you go through a number of the \nspecific provisions there--and we will debate this, I suspect, at \ngreater length during the course of the week--but the act virtually \nemasculates the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act. It \nsays, yes, there will be an environmental impact statement, but the \nstatement may not consider the need for interim storage, the time of \ninitial availability, any alternatives to spent fuel storage, any \nalternatives to the site of the facility, any alternatives to the \ndesign, the environmental impact of the storage beyond the initial term \nof the license, which is 20 years. This makes an absolute mockery of \nany kind of profession that this follows NEPA, the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, of 1969.\n\n  There are other provisions as well that refer to the preemption of \nall Federal environmental laws. That is section 501. We have talked \nabout that extensively during the course of the debate. There are \nstandards which are compromised in this provision. For example, there \nis a statutory provision that occurs on page 56 that indicates, rather \nthan the Environmental Protection Agency having the ability, \nindependent and unfettered, to make a judgment as to what the correct \nstandard would be in terms of radioactive emission exposure, it sets a \n100 millirem standard by statute and requires the EPA to affirmatively \nprove that the overall system performance standard would constitute an \nunreasonable risk to health and safety.\n  We did not do that anyplace else in terms of the WIPP facility which \nwas debated last year. The two able Senators from New Mexico made \nforceful statements that they believed, because the WIPP facility was \ngoing to be operational in their State, they had the expectation that \nEPA would establish the highest possible standards to protect the \nhealth and safety of New Mexicans. Who among us could disagree with \nthat? But that is not the standard for us here in Nevada. The EPA is \nconstrained and limited, in terms of what it can do, and here is an \nexample of 100 millirems of radiation, S. 104. There is safe drinking \nwater, other low-level-waste facilities--the WIPP facility, which I \njust mentioned, has a standard of 15 millirems during the course of a \nyear. So this thing is absolutely so phony in terms of any kind of \nprotection for health and safety, it ought to be something of concern \nto any legislator, irrespective of where the final destination may be.\n  Let me say, the National Academy of Sciences--these are scientists, \nnot people selected by the Governor of Nevada or the Nevada \ncongressional delegation--go through a whole list of things they \nrecommend. They recommend a risk-based standard rather than a 100 \nmillirem standard. They have recommended the protective standard be \ndefined by a critical group: a small, relatively homogeneous group be \nrepresentative of those expected to receive the highest doses. That is \nnot included.\n  They maintain that, in terms of the length of time, because nuclear \nwaste is lethal for thousands and thousands of years, there should be \nno cutoff period of time, that there must be an ability to protect for \nthousands of years. What does S. 104 provide? That you can only \nconsider the first 1,000 years. I suppose, whether you are an advocate \nfor term limits or not, we would all agree that 1,000 years is not \ngoing to affect anybody in this Chamber. But, I mean for something that \nis deadly for 10,000 years and beyond, that is simply irresponsible to \nput those kinds of handcuffs on.\n  Human intrusion--all of the scientific community acknowledges there \nis no scientific basis for assuming there would be no human intrusion \nduring these thousands and thousands of years. The statute we are \ndealing with, S. 104, directs just the contrary, to make an assumption \nthat there is to be no human intrusion.\n  The National Academy of Sciences said that these raise complicated \npolicy issues. There ought to be opportunity for wide-ranging input \nfrom all interested parties. These are set by statute, under S. 104--no \npublic comment.\n  So, I must say that in terms of science, in terms of fairness, in \nterms of health and public safety, this piece of legislation is a \ndisaster not only for my State but for America.\n\n  I want to speak for just a moment about the transportation issue and \nsome of the film footage that has appeared. First, I think it is \nimportant for us to understand that, although Nevada, under this \nlegislation, is the ultimate repository on an interim basis, there are \nsome 43 States, 51 million Americans who live within a mile of each of \nthese major corridors. The red depicts the highways, the blue depicts \nthe rail.\n  You are going to have, wherever you may be looking on this map here, \nyou are going to have roughly 16,000 shipments that would pass along \nthese corridors--16,000. It has been suggested that the Department of \nEnergy is experienced, but I think to put this in some context, Mr. \nDreyfus, who was the head of the Radioactive Waste Management Office, \nan individual well known to my colleagues, having testified before the \nEnergy Committee on a number of times, says this: ``Material like \nthis,'' referring to nuclear waste, ``has been moving around for a long \ntime. So that is not a technical challenge,'' he says. ``But compared \nto the kind of campaign what we are talking about, what the industry \nhas been doing up to now is trivial. We are talking about a magnitude \nof many times greater. We are talking about 16,000 shipments.''\n\n[[Page S2825]]\n\n  Since 1975, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission reported shipments that \nare sent by rail or by truck averaged approximately 900 miles or less. \nWe are talking about thousands of miles. As the occupant of the Chair \nknows, our States are in the West and far removed from most of these \nreactor sites. So, I think it is important to make that point.\n  Let me add a couple of other things, if I may here. First of all, the \ncasks that have been shown have no relevance to this debate--none. The \ncasks that would be used for shipping have not been designed. They are \nnot in existence. The casks that are used in the film prepared by the \nNuclear Energy Institute refer to a previous generation of smaller \ncasks. Those are not what is contemplated. Those are not what is \ncontemplated. We are talking about a new generation of casks, casks \nthat do not meet standards which we believe every such cask should \nmeet.\n  For example, it requires a 30-minute exposure to a fire at 1,475 \ndegrees. However, diesel fuel burns at an average of 1,800 degrees and \ncan reach 3,200 degrees. So the 30-minute proposed standard for these \nyet-to-be-designed and produced casks does not address real world \naccidents, where train wrecks can burn for hours, if not for days. None \nof the tests would require that kind of protection.\n  The NRC has estimated that 6 out of every 1,000 rail accidents could \ncause fundamental damage that will cause the cask to fail. Given the \n16,000 shipments that are contemplated, that comes to 96 accidents \nwhere the NRC-approved standard would fail. I submit that is not great \ncomfort to those millions of Americans who are going to be along the \nroute.\n  The NRC claims the cask design will prevent radioactive leakage in \nsevere accidents. But the cask design has never--repeat, never--been \ntested in lifelike situations. In one computer simulation, the NRC \nchose four real-life severe transportation accidents and applied these \nconditions to a cask meeting NRC specs.\n  In one of those real-life accidents, which involved a 1982 train \nderailment and fire in Livingston, LA--this was an accident that \noccurred and a fire that resulted--the NRC publicly acknowledged that \nthe high temperatures would cause an NRC-approved cask to fail. In \ntheir words, ``the radiological hazard would exceed compliance values \nby up to a factor of four.''\n  This is not some theoretical accident, a hypothetical. This is an \naccident that occurred in Livingston, LA, in 1982, and the NRC said the \nstandards they propose would not have protected a cask under their \nproposed design from releasing radioactivity. That is not much comfort, \nthat is not much assurance for those who are going to be along the \nhighways and railways.\n  Let me address an issue that I think has not received the kind of \nattention that it should, and that is, this bill is a bailout for the \nnuclear power industry. Dating back to the time of the inception of the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act, it was always agreed that the utilities \nthemselves should pay for the storage and ultimate disposition of high-\nlevel nuclear waste, and the mechanism established was to establish a \nnuclear waste trust fund in which ratepayers would pay at the rate of 1 \nmill for each kilowatt hour generated into this trust fund. That is the \ncurrent way.\n  Here is what this bill does. Rather than have the ratepayers pay for \nthe ultimate cost, this bill very cleverly transfers the liability and \nresponsibility to the American taxpayer. The year 2033 is the last \nyear, under currently licensed nuclear reactors, that there will be \nreactors in operation. Currently, under General Accounting Office \nactuarial projections, the fund is from $4 billion to $8 billion \nunderfunded in terms of what will be required, because as each reactor \ngoes off line, it no longer contributes to the fund. The last reactor \ngoes off line in the year 2033, and it is required that the \nexpenditures, in terms of dealing with that waste, continue until the \nyear 2071. So years after the last mill is deposited into the nuclear \nwaste trust fund, expenses will continue. As I have indicated, right \nnow the General Accounting Office says this fund is $4 billion to $8 \nbillion underfunded.\n  It is contended that the ratepayers have not gotten what they \nbargained for. That is certainly not true now, and the surplus that is \nin the account is designed to take care of those years from 2033 to \n2071, where nothing will come into the fund by way of a mill-tax levy \nbecause there will be no power generated from those reactors.\n  Here is a very, very clever way of shifting the liability to the \nAmerican taxpayer. This bill, in its present form, caps the amount of \ncontribution, even though the current fund is underfunded by $4 billion \nto $8 billion at 1 mill per kilowatt hour, and after the year 2003, it \nsays that the only mill tax that can be collected would be the amount \nnecessary to pay for the appropriation from the fund that year, \nproviding no revenue for the outyears.\n  So this is corporate welfare, this is corporate pork, this is a new \nentitlement program which will cost the American taxpayers literally \nbillions and billions of dollars in the outyears.\n  Everybody acknowledges that the 1998 deadline that was put into the \nact in 1982 cannot be met. I would say parenthetically, that was not a \nscientific date that was put in. Indeed, there was resistance in 1982 \nbecause it was felt that that time line was too short. This was a \ndeadline that was pushed by our friends, once again, from the nuclear \nutilities. So it is unfair to blame the Department of Energy and the \nscientific community for 1998. This was a deadline pushed by the \nutilities.\n  I believe that there is equity and fairness to be provided to the \nratepayers, because after 1998, they will not have permanent storage \navailable. In each of the Congresses in which I have served, we have \noffered legislation that would entitle the utilities to an offset; that \nis, to the extent that the storage would not be available in 1998 and \nthey would incur additional expense, as they will, that should be an \noffset or a reduction in the contribution that they pay into the \nnuclear waste fund so that the utility ratepayers do not pay twice. I \nthink that is fair. I think there is a reasonable argument to be made \nthere, and the administration believes that.\n\n  As recently as this past month, there were discussions to provide \ncompensation to the utilities because permanent storage will not be \navailable after 1998, and it was rejected by the utilities. They do not \ncare a wit about that. That is not what they are interested in. They \nare interested in getting the taxpayer to bail them out for the money \nthat will take beyond the year 2033, to the year 2071, to, in effect, \ntake care of the expenses of the nuclear waste that they generated--\nthat they generated--that they have made profits on over all these many \nyears. So there is not an argument of equity we are addressing here, \nbecause not a single provision in S. 104 addresses the question of \nequity.\n  We have a piece of legislation which we have introduced, again, this \nCongress which we have previously introduced, which says, ``Look, after \n1998, yes, you don't get the permanent storage that was contemplated, \nwe understand that.'' There is no conceivable way that could occur. If \nthis bill was passed tomorrow and signed into law, the 1998 deadline \ncould not be met for at least probably to the year 2001.\n  The administration has offered to provide compensation to reimburse \nutilities for the additional costs incurred, and our legislation would \nspecifically do so. So this has not one thing to do with ratepayers \nbeing charged twice. They are given an opportunity for relief, if they \nwant it, in the legislation that my senior colleague from Nevada and I \nhave introduced. So let's put that to rest.\n  The lawsuit. The lawsuit changes nothing. The lawsuit was finalized \nlast year before we concluded our date on 1936, the predecessor to S. \n104, and the lawsuit simply provides that there is a legal obligation \non the part of the Department to take the waste at some point down the \nline. There is a legal obligation. It in no way suggests that the waste \nwould be physically removed by 1998, and it could not.\n  So when you look at the contract, each of the utilities under the \n1982 act entered into a contract with the Department of Energy, and \nthat contract simply says that in case there is an avoidable delay, the \nutility is entitled to an offset in terms of what is being paid into \nthe nuclear waste fund by the amount of additional expense they incur. \nThat is the remedy, that is fair, that is the law.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer is suggesting that my time has \nabout run\n\n[[Page S2826]]\n\nout. I reserve the remainder of the time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield myself 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, let me respond to a number of \nthings brought up by my friend, the manager of this bill.\n  First of all, he is right about nuclear power. It produces a lot of \nelectricity in the United States. But everyone recognizes those days \nare numbered. The average life expectancy of nuclear power in the \nUnited States is 15 years. After that it is going to be gone.\n  As I indicated yesterday, it might be 25 years with one of the \nreactors and it may 5 years with another. But nuclear power is all \nthrough in this country. It simply is too dangerous, and everyone knows \nthat.\n  I will also speak to the question of what to do with spent fuel. That \nquestion has been raised. Senator Bryan and I continually answer the \nquestion. It is very easy. We should leave it where it is--capsulated \nin the spent fuel rods kept in dry cask containers.\n  As Senator Bryan mentioned today and I mentioned yesterday, there \nwould be no fire that would damage the dry cask storage containers as \nwould happen in a diesel truck or train. There would be no accident \nthat would occur driving at speeds that would rupture the casks. It is \nsafe and it is cheap. That is what should be done with nuclear waste \nfor the foreseeable future.\n  I will also state, Mr. President, that the question still has never \nbeen answered: What about the environmental groups? Hundreds of them \noppose this legislation--not two or three, not 20 or a couple score, \nbut hundreds that are now a part of the record.\n  No question has ever been answered as to why these environmental \ngroups oppose the legislation. They oppose the legislation because it \nis dangerous for the environment. It would be different if there was an \nequal balance, half of them supported it and half of them did not. \nEvery one of them--it is exclusive--all environmental groups oppose \nthis legislation.\n  Let me also say, Mr. President, one of the things being lost in this \ndebate is the fact that as we speak hundreds of millions of dollars are \nbeing spent in characterizing the repository at Yucca Mountain to \ndetermine if in fact that site is going to be scientifically safe for \nstorage of nuclear waste. I repeat, this past year hundreds of millions \nof dollars have been spent. Next year the same--hundreds of millions of \ndollars will be spent characterizing that site.\n  Let us not lose sight of the fact that this legislation is a way to \navoid the permanent repository. The very powerful, greedy nuclear \nindustry that is promulgated by the utilities, basically what they want \nto do is short-circuit the present system. They do not want to take \ntheir chances at Yucca Mountain in having a safe, scientifically \ncharacterized site. They want to circumvent the system. They want to do \naway with environmental laws. They want to void the present law that \nsays you cannot have temporary storage in the same State where a \npermanent site is being considered.\n  Why have we not heard anything about Yucca Mountain? That used to be \nthe big debate. Because the nuclear industry wants to avoid Yucca \nMountain. They want to do it the cheap way.\n  We have heard raised continually the fact that Nevada used to be a \nplace where they set off bombs, atmospheric tests and underground \ntests, and more than 900, almost 1,000 of those tests have been \ndetonated.\n  As I stated, the State of Nevada has sacrificed significantly for \nthat. We did it because there were hundreds, thousands, tens of \nthousands of nuclear warheads pointed at the State of Nevada and the \nUnited States. Conversely, the United States of America pointed their \nweapons at the Soviet Union. The cold war has terminated. I repeat, \nthis ended a dangerous era. It was a time of national crisis. We were \nall called upon to do what was necessary to protect this country. The \nState of Nevada did its share. We did what was right at a time of \ncrisis.\n\n  The time has come now, though, to understand that that was then and \nthis is now. There is presently no danger that would drive us to \nendanger our environment or public by reckless and ill-conceived \nactions. That is what this legislation is.\n  There is no nuclear waste crisis that any objective and competent \nstudy has been able to uncover. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard has testified to the lack of urgency and crisis with respect to \nmoving spent nuclear fuel from its generation sites. The chairman of \nthe board, under the direction of this Congress, testified last year, \nand now the new chairman this year, that ``There is no urgent, \ntechnical or safety reason to move spent fuel to a centralized storage \nfacility.'' So there is no emergency.\n  Moreover, existing contamination from early nuclear tests is not at \nall comparable to the potential contamination from premature and \nreckless storage of spent nuclear fuel in Nevada.\n  Mr. President, one transportation container of spent nuclear fuel \ncontains about the same amount of radioactive waste as 200 nuclear \ntests. One transportation container that will travel through the State \nof Colorado and many other States in this country contains the same \namount of radioactive waste as from 200 nuclear tests.\n  We are contemplating more than 15,000 shipments of spent nuclear \nfuel. Some of these shipments will have two containers. So more than \n3,000 times the amount of contamination from the nuclear testing \nprogram--3,000 times as much would be stored in the repository.\n  Measured another way, each nuclear explosion generates 125 pounds of \nradioactive material per megaton of yield. The average yield of tests \nconducted in Nevada is much less than the maximum yield permitted under \nthe limited test ban treaty. Assuming the average yield to be about 85 \nkilotons, the total testing program in Nevada would have generated only \nabout 5 tons of radioactive waste.\n  They are trying to move, with this cheap legislation, 70,000 tons of \nnuclear waste to Nevada. So anyone who compares the nuclear tests in \nNevada, which build up 5 tons of radioactive waste, are either \nexaggerating, deceiving the American public, or do not know what they \nare talking about.\n  And anyone who wants can make their choice of the three. The fact is, \nscientifically, we have 5 tons of radioactive waste compared to 70,000 \ntons that they are going to try to haul along the railways and highways \nof this Nation.\n  Is it any wonder, Mr. President, that entities--cities, \nmunicipalities, counties--throughout this country have passed \nresolutions saying: Do not bring it through our cities.\n  Complete and enduring isolation of this highly radioactive material \nis necessary if we are to avoid many times the danger and damage caused \nby the nuclear testing program.\n  Mr. President, there has also been a lot of debate on this floor \nabout onsite storage of spent nuclear fuel: It is going to break the \ncountry. It is going to break the power generating companies.\n  Well, let me just say this. This is, for lack of a better \ndescription, a scare tactic. It has no foundation in fact. Those who \nare propounding this have dismissed any thought of risk to the \nenvironment or to public health and safety, and any mention of such \nrisk is waved away as scare tactics.\n  The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board--remember we keep referring \nto\n\n[[Page S2827]]\n\nthis because it is a scientific body that we have deemed legislatively \nto tell us what to do with nuclear waste--the Nuclear Waste Technical \nReview Board agrees that new transportation containers deserve full-\nscale testing to assure that these are as durable as those designed, \ntested, and procured many, many years ago.\n\n  That has not been done. The Technical Review Board agrees that we are \nnot ready to undertake this massive program of nuclear waste shipments. \nThat is why they have said, do not ship them. The scientific body, I \nrepeat, this Congress has designated to tell us how to deal with \nnuclear waste, has told us, do not ship it.\n  The board agrees that a lot of planning is necessary and that it is \ncrucial for emergency response teams all along the planned routes to be \nprovided with equipment and training for managing the accidents that \nwill happen, even with the best of planning.\n  The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board goes further. They agree \nwith the Senators from Nevada that it is absolutely critical that the \npromise of objective characterization that we have been given in years \ngone by be completed before any nuclear waste is shipped to Nevada. The \nboard agrees that the 105th Congress should honor those promises made \nin earlier legislation.\n  The board agrees that serious uncertainties remain with respect to \nYucca Mountain's suitability. The board's chairman testified to these \nconcerns during the S. 104 hearings.\n  But let us go forward with Yucca Mountain. Let us not short circuit \nthe system and have this legislation which is being promulgated and \npropounded and pushed by the very powerful nuclear utilities in this \ncountry.\n  The board agrees about these uncertainties. The board agrees that \nthis process must proceed objectively without a hint of prejudice of \neven the appearance of a premature decision. Without this promise of \nhigh quality, objective assessment, the American people will never \nbelieve that permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel can be done \nsafely.\n  So, Mr. President, we are not using scare tactics. We are merely \nstanding up for the public health and safety of our country's \nenvironment and for protecting the public confidence in the final \ndisposition of spent nuclear fuel.\n  Instead of doing their job, the nuclear power industry, this \npowerful, disingenuous industry, and its lobby are busy using scare \ntactics to try to saddle the American taxpayer with the costs of \nmanaging the consequences of all of its profits.\n  These profits are, for lack of a better description, Mr. President, \nobscene. The nuclear power industry is required to report its costs and \nrevenues annually. All utilities must do this because they represent a \nvirtual monopoly. The so-called retained earnings of power utilities, \nwith at least 20-percent nuclear generation, average about 17 percent \nof total revenue.\n  Mr. President, this chart which I have here--these are in thousands \nof dollars, so this is a billion. Commonwealth Edison, $1.083 billion \nnet profit. This is not gross profits; net profit, 17.25 percent. Not \nbad.\n  You can pick any one of them you want. Virginia Electrical, $731 \nmillion net profit, 17.54 percent.\n  Look at it. 20.5 percent, 18.9 percent. The average, Mr. President, \nas I have indicated, have profits of more than 17 percent.\n  I handled a case once. I sued Safeway Stores. The jury said I was \nentitled to punitive damages. I can remember going back trying to get \ndiscovery, getting information from Safeway Stores. I was astounded. \nSafeway Stores, with the tremendous volume they had, had made less than \n2-percent profit. It was 1 percent-plus.\n  Our utilities who are crying, ``We're starving to death,'' are making \nrevenues of $1 billion, 17.25 percent profit, an average of over 17 \npercent. Safeway Stores are making less than 2 percent, but our \nutilities, struggling as they are, are averaging 17 percent. These are \nonly the nuclear utilities, because they are doing better than the \nrest.\n  So the so-called retained earnings of power utilities with at least \n20 percent of the power they generate by nuclear energy averages about \n17 percent. The simple interpretation of these numbers is that once the \nindustry pays its operating costs and its capital mortgage obligations \nits profit is about 17 percent from all the revenues collected from the \ncustomers. Not bad.\n  A reduction of this obscene profit by just 1 percentage point, \nreducing the average profit from 17 to 16 percent, would completely \ncover the ratepayers' fees that are collected to pay for managing the \nwaste, that was generated to the benefit of both the ratepayers and the \nindustry.\n  So, Mr. President, these pious complaints from the nuclear industry \nand from the sponsors of S. 104 that the ratepayers are being gouged, \nare actually accurate. The problem is the gouger is the industry, not \nthe Government. They, the industry, are the gouger. They are the \ngougers.\n  So for their next scare, their next fright, S. 104 advocates in the \nindustry have developed their own views on how much more the storage \ncosts of the nuclear waste would be until this permanent repository is \noperational. This is a dandy. Here is what they come up with here. They \nare saying that they will have to pay $80 billion, that is what it will \ncost the taxpayer. They might as well pick a figure of $400 billion. It \nhas as much relevance. They could have picked $80 dollars with as much \nrelevance. They do not know what they are talking about. It is \nridiculous.\n  Sponsors of S. 104 have argued that only passage of this bill will \nrelieve every American family of a $1,300 bill, payable to the nuclear \npower industry. If that is not scare tactics, I do not know what is. \nThe actual incremental cost, until a permanent repository is \noperational, is clearly not that much, it is not even close. The cost \nis negligible compared to their profits.\n  The Department of Energy has done a study that predicts $8 million as \nthe average fixed cost for onsite storage facility. They estimated the \noperational costs of onsite storage to be about $750,000 per year for \noperating reactors, and as much as $3 million for shut-down reactors.\n  Here is a monopoly that is gouging an obscene profit from customers \nat a 17-percent rate, claiming it should be awarded damages of $80 \nbillion when the actual costs are less than $2 billion. How is that? \nThe industry and their congressional supporters want the taxpayer to \nadd to the industry's already obscene profits by awarding them billions \nof dollars that they did not earn, do not deserve, and did not spend. I \nam here to tell everyone within the sound of my voice that the nuclear \nindustry will not get away with this nuclear extortion. That is what it \nis.\n  I wish words could describe my appreciation for the President of the \nUnited States saying he will veto this legislation. Mr. President, the \nConstitution of this country was not drafted to protect the majority. \nThe Constitution of the United States was drawn to protect the \nminority. There is no better example of that, there is no better \nexample of how this Constitution works than this legislation. Last \nyear, 37 brave Democrats and Republicans said, ``We think this is bad \nlegislation.'' They were following the constitutional dictates that \nsaid if there are enough votes to sustain a veto, that legislation is \nhistory. It was history last year. It will be this year. We are wasting \nthe taxpayers' time because the Constitution protects the minority. \nThat is what we are doing here.\n  Now, there has already been a day in court which affirmed that the \ncontract between DOE and the generators of this waste calls for DOE to \ndeal with this spent nuclear fuel beginning in 1998. The court \nspecifically avoided discussion of a remedy, should DOE not honor the \nterms of the contract, since a deadline has not been reached. Moreover, \nthe standard contract clearly contains language for remedies for \nfailures to meet its terms. They are conditional. It is likely, should \na court get involved in determining the remedies--which will probably \nnever happen--the case will focus on conditions leading to the breach. \nThey are very clear if it is the fault of DOE, they pick up the cost. \nWe know that. But the deadline has not been passed yet. It is unlikely \nany court will rule on breach of contract remedy prior to contract \nviolation.\n\n  DOE has made a good-faith effort to involve the industry in \ndeveloping the solution to the real problems that no repository exists \nprior to 1998. That good-faith gesture has been rejected\n\n[[Page S2828]]\n\nand rejected and rejected by the industry and the sponsors of S. 104 to \njustify their efforts to rip off the taxpayers, to justify their \nthreats to seek billions of dollars in compensation for a $2 billion \nincremental cost.\n  The industry does not want a resolution of this permanent repository \ndilemma. If one were found, they would not be able to unload all future \ncosts to the taxpayer. Remember, Mr. President, this boils down to the \nfact that you can store nuclear waste onsite, as I indicated, for \n$750,000 at an operational site. So the costs are negligible, but they \nare not willing to do that.\n  They would be pleased to see S. 104 succeed since they know an \ninterim storage facility in Nevada would become the permanent resting \nspot for all the waste. In this instance, ``interim,'' by the \ndictionary of those pushing S. 104, means forever. That needs to stop.\n  Again, I congratulate publicly the President of the United States for \nstanding by something that is right. We know politically there are big \nutilities that are telling the President, Oh, do not do this. The \nPresident is standing for principle, and the people of this country \nshould admire and respect that because this is going to prevent nuclear \ngarbage from being hauled through the streets, highways, and railways \nof this country. I hope the President gets his due deserve for doing \nthe right thing.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the cloture \nvote scheduled for 5:15 this afternoon, subject to the clearance from \nthe ranking member of the Energy Committee, be contemplated to be \nvitiated, and further Senate action begin on Senate bill 104 for \nconsideration at 1 o'clock on Wednesday, April 9.\n  I ask the Chair to withhold because I am just advised that there is \none clarification needed.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If you are waiting for a clarification, I am more than \nhappy to go ahead and speak and allow interruption at anytime necessary \nto clarify.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to withdraw, if there is no objection, the \nunanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I think the essence of what the chairman has proposed is \nagreeable to the Senators from Nevada, and I think implicit in what the \nchairman said is we will actually go on the bill at 1 o'clock tomorrow.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is the intent of the unanimous-consent agreement.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I just wanted to clarify. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will withhold the unanimous consent \npending a clarification from the ranking member of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee.\n  I yield to my friend from Idaho, the cosponsor of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, thank you. I thank my chairman for \nyielding, and I am pleased to hear the news that we can move to this \nbill without cloture, starting tomorrow. It appears that agreement is \nvery close at hand.\n  In fact, I understand it is fine now, so I yield back to the \nchairman.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I renew my request at this time. I ask \nunanimous consent the cloture vote scheduled at 5:15 today be vitiated, \nand further the Senate begin consideration of Senate bill 104 at 1 p.m. \non Wednesday, April 9.\n  The leader advises me, for the information of all Senators, there \nwill be no rollcall votes during the balance of today's session of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield back to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the unanimous consent that our chairman has \njust put before the Senate and has been accepted is good news. It is \ngood news that we can move immediately to consideration of S. 104 \nstarting tomorrow afternoon.\n  I think it also portends what we all know here, that S. 104 has a \nsubstantial majority support in this Senate and the Senators from \nNevada recognize, and we appreciate their recognition of the fact, that \nthis is an issue that is of national scope. While I understand and \nappreciate their strong defense of Nevada, I also can recognize the \nneed to speak nationally about a national problem and the \nresponsiveness of States, like yours and like mine, who wish to find \nsafe, sound, environmentally recognized storage locations for both \nhigh-level waste and nuclear spent fuel, to seek that location in the \nYucca Mountain facility that is currently under investigation.\n  What I wish to do this afternoon is address several points that have \nbeen raised by my colleagues from Nevada, some of them yesterday, and \nsome of them today. Before I do that, however, I want to turn briefly \nto the subject of underground nuclear weapons testing. Yesterday, I \naddressed this body and discussed in general terms the Nevada test \nsite. I referred to a photo which I have here again behind me which is \nthe Nevada test site. I asked my assembled colleagues to consider \nwhether an interim storage site for spent nuclear fuel and waste could \nreally have a detrimental impact on this land. Every one of the \npockmarks in the landscape is a product of underground explosions of \nnuclear devices. This is the most exploded area on the face of the \nEarth, maybe other than where the late Soviet Union once did its \nunderground testing, once it had stopped its atmospheric testing.\n  What I am suggesting is that this is not a pristine environment. It \nis a place where it is reasonable and responsible, if the kinds of \ngeologic testing that are now going on confirm the fact that we can \nbuild an underground deep geologic repository near this location, then \nwe can put an interim storage facility here it would ultimately serve \nas a receiving and conditioning facility for transferring the waste to \nthe deep underground geologic storage.\n  Weapons explosions have gone on here for decades. As I listened to my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Nevada yesterday, I got the sense \nthat he is dead set against any nuclear materials in his State of \nNevada. All I have to do is remind the Senators of Nevada, this is \nNevada. This is where, for decades, our nuclear testing has gone on, on \nFederal properties, in that State. Is it not reasonable to assume that \nthe Senate ought to have the right to look at and make consideration of \nthis facility as an interim site?\n  I recall, however, that last year my colleague from Nevada did \nsupport the restart of underground nuclear testing at this very site. \nNow, Mr. President, I do not mention this to be critical to any Member \nwho supported the testing program--the kind of program which is vital \nto both States and to our national interests. Defense missions are \nimportant, and we have to recognize and balance the issues. When I say \nthat, of course, I defend the right of my colleagues to defend their \ninterest. But it is time we look at national interests in the context \nand in the balance. Let us talk about what underground nuclear tests \ninvolve.\n  These pockmarks, as you see here, represent the drilling of a deep \nhole and the exploding of a nuclear device within that. These \nexplosions leave all of these same nuclear components--the same ones \nthat we talked about as being contained in the spent fuel and the high-\nlevel waste that we want to dispose of in an underground storage \nfacility near the test site. I suggest, Mr. President, the kind of \nstorage we are talking about is going to be quantum safer, quantum \nsafer, than the kind of explosive activities that went on this terrain \nduring the past decades. Nuclear testing was allowed at this site for \ndecades. To our knowledge it has not caused serious concerns for the \nwater table, or the types of standards we are requiring for a geologic \nrepository at Yucca Mountain.\n  Now, I ask my colleagues to consider this. I want to quote from my \nformer colleague, the Senator from Louisiana, Bennett Johnston, when we \ndebated this matter last session. This is Senator Bennett Johnston \nspeaking. ``If it is safe to conduct hundreds of nuclear tests, it is \nmuch more safe to store * * * nuclear waste under Yucca Mountain in \ncontainers which themselves pose quite a barrier to any \ncontamination.''\n  Now, I wish to address several comments that I heard yesterday, \nbecause I believe some clarification, or even correction, is necessary. \nWe heard from\n\n[[Page S2829]]\n\nour Nevada colleagues that the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board has \nsaid that an interim storage facility is simply not needed. For the \nbenefit of my colleagues who were not present at the committee hearing \non February 5, I am compelled to quote directly from the Chairman of \nthe Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, Dr. Cohon, in his testimony \nbefore the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Under the heading of \n``Key Conclusions,'' Dr. Cohon said: ``A centralized storage facility \nwill be needed.''\n  Let me repeat that. Dr. Cohon, Chairman of the Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board, said: ``A centralized storage facility will be \nneeded. Planning for it should begin immediately.''\n  However, he did go on to state: ``There are no compelling technical \nor safety reasons to move spent fuel to a centralized storage facility \nfor the next few years.''\n  ``Technical or safety reasons * * *.''\n  Mr. President, you will notice that Dr. Cohon is silent on the other \nreasons--contractual obligations, lawsuits, failure to implement the \n1998 deadline of the current waste act, financial liabilities.\n  Furthermore, as we all know and the DOE has acknowledged, it will \ntake more than a few years to license and construct an interim storage \nfacility. Even if we were to begin today, right now, immediately, it is \nstill going to take time to make it happen and to make it happen \nthrough all of the Federal laws and with an environmentally safe, \nsound, and acceptable design.\n  Dr. Cohon testified that steps leading to centralized storage \n``should begin immediately.'' That is exactly what Dr. Cohon was \nspeaking of. S. 104 directs that the steps leading to that interim \nstorage be initiated.\n  Let me quote from the board's second key conclusion on the interim \nstorage: ``Significant advantages can be derived from siting a storage \nfacility adjacent to the repository.''\n  That is what the board has said. That is exactly what S. 104 does. \nFor some reason, it is very difficult, if not absolutely incorrect, to \nportray that S. 104 is somewhere out of step with the current Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act or with the board's finding--this board of technical \nand professional people who had been brought together for the purpose \nof establishing the findings necessary to build a permanent repository.\n  Dr. Cohon goes on to recommend that an interim storage facility be \nlocated at the Nevada Test Site only after site viability is \ndetermined.\n  Mr. President, let me dismiss another allegation from our opponents--\nthat S. 104 short-circuits the viability process. It flat doesn't \nhappen, and the bill doesn't proceed in that manner. S. 104 sites an \ninterim storage facility at the Nevada Test Site after site viability \nis complete--not before viability, not instead of viability, but after \nviability. That is what the language of the proposed law says.\n  I am growing weary of a variety of charges that relate to S. 104 \nshort-circuiting the science of the waste program. That is the argument \nthat has been placed by my opponents, that somehow the scientific \nprogress gets short-circuited. That is unfounded. It is done to create \nfear among those who have not studied the issue thoroughly. It is \nalways important on issues like nuclear waste and high-level nuclear \nradioactive materials that science be a major player. Therefore, it is \nalways easy to wave the flag of ``no science'' and say it is an unsafe \naction or we should not be doing that. That simply is not the case \nhere; it has never been the case. The scientists have been at the \nforefront of all of these actions, and they have led the development of \nthe whole process to the point of where we are.\n  This brings me to another area that has been the subject of \nmisinformation. My guess is that it is just going to be the subject of \nmisinformation throughout the debate--the issue of transportation. \nDuring my remarks yesterday, I went through, in some detail, the tests \nthat are required to be performed before the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission will license the containers that are used to transport spent \nnuclear fuel over highways or railways. What I would like to do is \nrepeat that this has never been an issue, and it isn't an issue now. \nThat isn't to say it isn't a political issue; it is a political issue, \nbut it cannot be argued on scientific grounds, on engineering grounds \nand, most important, after the 2,500 loads of nuclear material that \nhave traveled across this country over the last several decades, it \ncannot even be argued after the fact that somehow there was an accident \nthat resulted in human injury as a result of radiation. There were \naccidents, but the containers and the material were totally safe.\n\n  We did hear an allegation yesterday that it is so dangerous to \ntransport these materials that we have never successfully licensed a \nshipping vessel for transportation of spent fuel. The fact is, not only \nhave spent fuel shipping containers been successfully tested and \nlicensed, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission currently has over 20 \ndifferent types of shipping containers--not 20 different containers, \nbut 20 different types of shipping containers--that it has successfully \nlicensed. Let me repeat that. It has successfully licensed them for use \nover highways or railways. These are containers that have passed all of \nthe tremendously rigorous tests that I outlined for you yesterday, such \nas the drop test, the puncture test, the fire test, the water immersion \ntest; all of them have been licensed under those standards.\n  This brings me to another erroneous charge that I wish to dismiss. It \nis the charge that these testing requirements are not adequate to meet \nreal-life accidents. Oh, my goodness. I can't imagine that even could \nbe suggested. You don't drop a metal container 50 feet onto a hard, \nimmovable concrete slab and have that container bounce and stay whole \ntime after time and even suggest that the test itself wasn't real life. \nIt is extraordinary. It is well beyond the norm.\n  We have heard that the fire test requires a temperature of only 1,475 \ndegrees Fahrenheit and that gasoline fires can burn hotter than this. \nWell, we need to look at all of the parameters of the fire test to see \nif it is tough enough for real-life accident conditions.\n  In response to the gasoline concern, Lawrence Livermore National \nLaboratory was asked to investigate if the fire temperature required \nfor testing was hot enough. They concluded that when you look at all of \nthe fire parameters, not just temperature, but duration, insulation, \nhow the container is positioned in the flame, look at all of these \nfactors in combination, actual fires would not exceed in overall \nseverity the fire test that the shipping containers must go through. \nNow, this is one of the best scientific labs in the world. This is the \nbest test that you can create anywhere to check the integrity of the \ncontainer. After doing so, they said that the container was adequate to \nmeet the standards and the risks involved.\n  The overall point is that these issues and allegations have been \ninvestigated, tested, studied, and, in every case, they have been \nultimately debunked. Again, my argument, my premise is that this debate \nhas nothing to do with science, nothing to do with geology, to date, \nnothing to do with engineering facts. Those have all been established \nfor decades. Those facts are unrefutable. It has everything to do with \npolitics.\n  There are enough studies and papers on these issues to fill technical \nlibraries at every national laboratory across the country, including \nthe Idaho National Laboratory. It is time to move beyond the hyperbole \nand scare tactics.\n  S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997, will allow the \nGovernment to fulfill the contractual obligation it assumed, under the \nlaw passed by this body in 1982. The deadline for action on this \nobligation is just 9 months away.\n  S. 104 will resolve the question of what to do with spent nuclear \nfuel and high-level radioactive waste in a timely manner.\n  So I urge my colleagues, as we begin this debate tomorrow on S. 104, \nto recognize that there are facts and there are fictions, and, most \nimportant, as is quite typical on this floor, there are politics. The \npolitics of this issue is, you don't want it to happen in your \nbackyard, even if it's now in your backyard. You don't want it to be \nmoved across the country, although we have moved it for years with no \nhuman risk from radiation ever having happened. We have the greatest \nrecord in the world for transportation. We have built the best science \nthat national engineering can allow. So what is the problem?\n\n[[Page S2830]]\n\n  Well, the problem is if you can argue the issue long enough and if \nyou can drag your feet long enough, you can bring an industry that \nprovides 20 percent of the electrical power of this country to its \nknees, because it is the logic of those who substantially oppose the \nnuclear industry that if you don't responsibly deal with the waste \ncreated by that industry, ultimately the American public will no longer \ntolerate the generation of that waste and the industry itself has to be \nshut down.\n  What we are trying to do now is not deal with what I have just said, \nbut deal with the waste we have already created. We have, for four \ndecades in this country, created waste, whether it be defense waste, \nGovernment waste, or whether it is commercial spent fuel coming from \ncommercial reactors that generate 20 percent of the electrical output \nof this country. It is only responsible that we deal with the waste we \nhave, making sure, as other Congresses have concluded, that it is in a \nsingle, safe, deep geologic repository where we can rest assured of the \nkinds of environmental integrity and safety the American public \nexpects.\n  That is really what S. 104 is all about--Federal obligation, Federal \nresponsibility, liability to taxpayers, sound environmental activity, \nand wanting to find that single safe repository to which all of the \nwaste from 41 States and over 80 locations can go.\n  I think it is important that we move ahead in a timely fashion. I am \npleased we can move to the debate tomorrow. I hope that we can deal \nwith the necessary amendments that would come up and that by the end of \nthe week, we can move to final passage on this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the cloture vote on \nS. 104. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997 is a crucial piece of \nlegislation that deserves the support of both sides of Capitol Hill and \nthe administration. It is responsible legislation, necessary \nlegislation, and legislation that when enacted will provide the utmost \nsafety for our constituents.\n  S. 104 provides for the safe transport of nuclear waste from numerous \nsites around the Nation to one safe, central location in Yucca \nMountain. The Department of Energy must, by November 30, 1998, be \naccepting waste on an interim basis at the facility. By December 31, \n2002, the DOE would be required to apply for authorization to construct \na permanent repository at the site.\n  To put this in context we should examine the alternative to this \nlegislation. Absent this legislation, or action by the courts, costs \nwill continue to be accrued on our constituents. For example, storage \nof used nuclear fuel at an operating nuclear reactor can cost $34 to \n$50 million. More importantly from Colorado's perspective it is \nestimated that keeping spent fuel on site where the reactor has shut \ndown can cost $46 to $64 million. While Colorado currently has no \noperating nuclear reactors, they do have one commercial facility that \nhas a shut down nuclear reactor, Ft. St. Vrain. Currently, the costs of \nstorage at Ft. St. Vrain are being paid by DOE, if DOE is forced to \npick up similar costs around the Nation, it will be a hefty bill that \nI'm not sure they can afford. Colorado also is home to Rocky Flats, a \nfacility that formerly made nuclear triggers. That facility also has \nwaste that will ultimately end up at Yucca Mountain.\n  What other alternatives are there? If the court is forced to decide \nthe issue and they require the Federal Government to pay the cost of \nonsite storage, American taxpayers would pay $7.7 billion over the cost \nof one central temporary storage facility. Furthermore, additional \ncosts from inaction could range from $40 to $80 billion. Where would \nthis money come from?\n  Additionally, if this legislation isn't passed, the next opportunity \nColoradans will have for removal of this material will be in 2015. I \nfind this unacceptable currently, Colorado has waste stored near \nmillions of people on the Front Range. It is a hazard that we should \nfix, and this legislation is part of fixing that problem.\n  Both of these sites have waste that will ultimately be shipped to \nYucca Mountain. From Ft. St. Vrain there is about 16 metric tons of \nspent nuclear fuel and from Rocky Flats there is contaminated plutonium \nthat, once it is vitrified, will be sent to Yucca Mountain. My State \nneeds this legislation, and has paid for this legislation, since the \ninception of the waste fee Colorado has paid roughly $300,000 to the \nNuclear Waste Management Program. We expect the Federal Government to \nhonor its commitment.\n  Congress has the obligation to support this legislation with or \nwithout support from the administration. We have an obligation to act \nresponsibly, even if the administration won't. Once again I thank Mr. \nCraig and Mr. Murkowski for their leadership.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, debate is winding down today. I know we \nwill have an opportunity to debate this issue throughout the next few \ndays. I thought it might be helpful to clarify a statement made by the \nSenator from Idaho with respect to the canister issue.\n  The Senator from Nevada has not said that there are not canisters \nthat have been approved, licensed, and used. There are indeed such \ncanisters. The difference is the kind of canisters that are \ncontemplated in the shipments that will be involved in sending some \n75,000 metric tons of nuclear waste to a site in Nevada that have not \nyet been designed and have not yet been produced. So all of the film \nfootage that the Nuclear Energy Institute and its supporters have used \nis footage with respect to canisters that would not be used in the kind \nof massive shipments that are contemplated here.\n  What is contemplated here is a canister by rail that would \naccommodate 20 to 24 fuel assemblies. That would be the equivalent \nweight of about 125 tons; it is a rail cask. And each truck cask would \nweigh at least 25 tons. So the standards are out there, but they have \nnot yet been designed and built.\n  There was a reference, at least lately, that the concerns expressed \nby the Senators from Nevada with respect to the standards that have \nbeen proposed for the new enlarged canister are standards that are more \nthan adequate to meet the task, and, indeed, that there may be some \nscare tactics on our part in referencing those.\n  Let me just simply indicate that the Livingston, LA, fire--I want to \nbe very clear on this--involved a 1982 train derailment. That is a \nfact. The circumstances of that accident are not theoretical or \nhypothetical. They are real. The Nuclear Regulation Commission itself--\nnot a group of Nevada legislators or the scientists that have been \nengaged by Nevada to argue the case here but the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission itself--applied the conditions in the aftermath of the \nLivingston, LA, fire to the standards that are to be used in this new \nenlarged cask configuration and acknowledged that the high temperatures \nin that fire--not a theoretical fire--would cause an NRC-approved cask \nto fail. In their words, ``The radiological hazard would exceed \ncompliance values by up to a factor of four.'' But the thing that needs \nto be emphasized--this is not some theoretical, unrealistic, utterly \nfantastic, farfetched, bizarre set of circumstances that have been \nconjured up. This relates to a real-life accident in 1982. In that \naccident, with the fire temperatures that were engendered as a \nconsequence of that derailment applied to the standards which the NRC \nis proposing for this new canister configuration that would accommodate \n20 to 24 fuel assemblies, it would fail. A radiological hazard would be \ncreated. That is a statement not by the Senator from Nevada but a \nstatement by the NRC.\n  Let me make one additional point, if I may, with respect to the \ntransportation issue. As an indication that we are not yet even ready \nto transport this volume of waste, I think the proponents of S. 104 \nwould have us believe that if through some, in my judgment, \nirresponsible, reckless act on the part of the Congress to enact this \nlegislation, if this were enacted today, indeed, if the storage \nfacility were opened today, then immediately a mass migration of \nnuclear waste would occur from the repository sites currently; namely, \nat the nuclear reactors where they are located and where this flow of \nshipments began.\n\n[[Page S2831]]\n\n  I think it is important to try to give some balance because this is \nnot a panacea even if you buy into this corporate welfare program that \nthe nuclear power utilities would have us embrace. I think the words of \nDr. Jared Cohon, who is the chairman of the Nuclear Waste Technical \nReview Board--again, a body created by this Congress, not by some \nNevada oversight group--points out:\n\n       Developing a storage facility requires more than a siting \n     decision. It also requires the development of a \n     transportation system and developing a transportation \n     infrastructure, including the transportation cap, and \n     enhanced safety capabilities along the routes necessary to \n     move significant amounts of waste will likely take years \n     longer than would be needed to develop a centralized storage \n     facility.\n\n  I need to make that point again. I mean, the thrust of this debate--\nand you will hear much more from our colleagues who are saying that \nsomehow it is a panacea of S. 104, if enacted and signed into law, that \nimmediately the waste will be removed from the reactor sites. That is \nsimply not true. Even if theoretically a site could be opened in the \nnext year or 18 months--and absolutely no one believes that--siting \ninterim storage would require at least 3 or 4 years.\n  But assume for the sake of argument that the site was available, what \nDr. Cohon is telling us is that because we do not have the casks \ncurrently in existence--the standards, yes, but not the casks--that it \nwould take us a while to develop the transportation system that would \nbe required; that it will require a few years to get that done.\n  So all of this talk about the casks that have been depicted on film \nand all of the discussion about the casks being dropped from 30 feet, \n50 feet, 60 feet, or 100 feet, are totally irrelevant. We are talking \nabout casks that will not be used for this purpose. We are talking \nabout a new configuration cask that has not yet been developed, and I \nthink that point needs to be emphasized.\n\n  Let me make one other point, if I may, with respect to the notion \nthat somehow because Nevada, responding to a patriotic call during the \nheight of the cold war in 1951, agreed to allow nuclear testing at the \nNevada test site--I was in the eighth grade the year the nuclear \ntesting began in Nevada. I have to tell you that it was a different age \nand a different time than it is today. We were all pretty naive about \nwhat that was about. Were we excited? Yes. We all thought it was a \ngreat thing. We were on the cutting edge in technology. In those days \nthe nuclear power lobby convinced America that everything would be \nnuclear, that we would have little reactors in our back yards and \nplanes would be powered by nuclear fuel; locomotives; and, indeed, as \nwas often said, the nuclear power will be so cheap that it can't be \nmeasured. That goes back 46 years ago.\n  In my hometown of Las Vegas, businesses changed their names to atomic \ngroceries, atomic this and that. There was an atomic hairdoo. Yes. \nNevadans sensed that they were being asked to respond to a patriotic \ncall of the Federal Government to respond to a confrontation that we \nhad with a superpower, the Soviet Union. That frightened all of us. I \nhope that my friends would not suggest that because we responded to \nthat, that there is somehow implicit a duty to accept civilian reactor \nwastes generated on site, a decision made by local utilities and local \ncustomers, and that that somehow be sent to us in Nevada.\n  I might just say parenthetically with respect to that rather naive \nworld in which we lived in 1951, today every American pays as part of \nhis or her tax dollars to the people who are downwind from those \nnuclear detonations that we were assured at the time that they were \nabsolutely safe--``Don't worry about it. It is the most exciting thing \nin the world.'' We invited members of the fourth estate, the Department \nof Energy. Then it was called the Atomic Energy Commission. There was a \nlittle place. They built bleachers for them called News Nob. Come on up \nand see for yourselves. This is science. This is exciting stuff, folks.\n  We sent thousands of our military personnel to a place called Camp \nDesert Rock, and we dug trenches out there and showed them what the \nexposure would be like to atmospheric radiation.\n  Mr. President, if any responsible scientist suggested that that was \nabsolutely safe today, I mean he or she would be hounded out of any \nkind of scientific academy that exists. We all know now that is \ndangerous stuff. It is very hazardous, and a lot of people downwind \npaid with their lives, and paid through genetic damage which they have \nexperienced and suffered from cancers. As a consequence, each of us as \ntaxpayers in America today compensate those victims.\n  Let me make a distinction, if I may. It has been suggested that \nsomehow because the test sites were used for this purpose, it is an \nabsolutely logical, inescapable conclusion that it should be the \nrepository for this interim site. That is fallacious reasoning.\n  First of all, we are talking about two entirely different kinds of \nradioactivity. Remember what we are talking about here with high-level \nnuclear waste--stuff that by its very definition is deadly for \nthousands and thousands of years. Nobody quarrels with that in the \ndebate--thousands and thousands of years. We all recall that in the \naftermath of dropping two atomic bombs on Japan at the end of World War \nII--one at Hiroshima and one at Nagasaki--that those two cities did not \nremain isolated for decades or even a score of years. They were rebuilt \nimmediately. The reason is that it is a different type of radiation. \nThere is no question that there is a radiation hazard in the blinding \nseconds of the detonation. We have all seen that. But it is not the \nkind of residual radiation that requires isolation and protection for \nthousands of years.\n  Let me make a couple of points. I know the distinguished chairman of \nthe Energy Committee has taken the floor. I can assure him I will be \njust a couple of minutes.\n\n  Here is the difference. Trinity was the first successful atomic \ndetonation in the history of the world at Alamogordo in the New Mexico \ndesert on July 16, 1945. That is the first one. That is when we knew we \nhad a bomb that would work. In order to equate the radioactive \nequivalent of what is referred to as the fission product inventory that \nwould be stored in Nevada as a result of all of these 75,000 to 85,000 \nmetric tons, it would require the equivalent of 2.3 million nuclear \ndetonations--let me repeat that again: 2.3 million detonations--of the \nTrinity-sized atomic bomb to create the equivalent of what is proposed \nto be stored at the Nevada test site.\n  Placed in another context, because Nevada did agree to host the \ntesting programs, based upon the average yearly testing rate during the \nperiod that the Nuclear Weapons Program was operational at the Nevada \ntest site that was approximately 20 nuclear weapons detonations per \nyear, in order to equate to the fission product equivalent of what is \nbeing proposed to be shipped here, it required that rate of testing, \nnamely 20 nuclear weapons tests a year, for a period of from 10,000 to \n100,000 years. So we are not talking about some finite distinction. We \nare talking about something that is of a totally different magnitude, a \ntotally different character.\n  I say to my friends who tried to equate the nuclear testing program \nduring the days of the cold war with storage of high-level nuclear \nwaste from civilian reactors, you are talking about apples and oranges \nin a literal sense. So we are not talking about the same thing. We are \ntalking about waste that by its very nature is deadly for thousands and \nthousands of years. No one disagrees with that. We are talking about \nnuclear detonations which have a totally different type of radioactive \nfootprint and which would require the equivalent of 2.3 million Trinity \ndetonations to get the same equivalency being discussed, or a testing \nprotocol that would call for 20 nuclear detonations a year that would \nhave to last from between 10,000 and 100,000 years to equal what is \nbeing proposed to be sent to Nevada.\n  I just think those two points need to be made.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, the parliamentary procedure relative to \ntime on this, in view of the fact that the vote has been vitiated, \nsuggests that we are still bound by our time agreement.\n\n[[Page S2832]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may consume as much time as he \nwishes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. If the distinguished Senator would yield for a question, I \ndo not intend to offer any more comments today. I don't know of anybody \non our side of the aisle who will.\n  I withhold the comment. I am informed that Senator Bumpers may take \nthe floor at 5 o'clock. I am not sure whether he will be speaking on \nthis issue, or not. He may very well be. But as long as we can \naccommodate him, I say to the distinguished chairman that it is not my \npurpose to hold either the chairman or any other person to a time limit \nthis evening.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as I understand it, we will be on the \nbill beginning at 1 o'clock tomorrow. So I assume any Member can come \nover and speak on this or as if in morning business. With that \ninterpretation, I am going to proceed for a few minutes more. Then that \nwill be my conclusion, at least for today, relative to the topic at \nhand.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that we have reached an agreement to \nproceed to the bill, and, as a consequence, starting tomorrow at 1 \no'clock, we will have to continue our debate. Many Members on our side \nhave indicated an interest in coming over and being heard.\n  There are a couple of points I want to make at this time that I think \nbear a little examination. The other side has indicated that his \nlegislation, S. 104, is unneeded, that it is unwise, that it is unsafe. \nI just cannot accept that.\n  First of all, to suggest it is unneeded disregards the obligation we \nhave in a contractual commitment to take this waste in 1998. What good \nis a Government contract, for Heaven's sakes, if there is no intention, \nno desire to fulfill that contract?\n  Mr. President, 16 years have passed. It is clear that the waste will \nnot be taken in 1998 as promised. Yet, the Federal Government has taken \nfrom the ratepayers some $13 billion. And who has it been paid to? It \nhas been paid to the Federal Government. And what has the Federal \nGovernment done with it? They have not held it in escrow. They have not \nheld it in abeyance out there, ready to meet their obligation to take \nthe waste in 1998. They put it in the general fund. Under the crazy \nbookkeeping procedures we have around here, it is going to take a \nsignificant appropriation to address this obligation. So, when the \nother side suggests that it is unneeded, I think we have to look a \nlittle bit deeper at the significance of a contractual commitment.\n  (Mr. HUTCHINSON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. There has been a lot of criticism of the nuclear \nindustry out there. What has the nuclear industry done? They provided a \nreliable source of power. They are the second largest supplier of power \ngeneration next to coal, 22 percent of our Nation's power. They are a \ndedicated group, highly technical people for the most part, dedicated \nto providing a reliable, safe source of energy for this country, for 22 \npercent of our dependents. They entered into a contractual agreement \nback in 1982. And where have we been since 1982? We have been here. We \nhave been talking about it. We have been discussing, Yes, we have an \nobligation, but it is not due. It is due now, Mr. President. It is due \nnext year. And we are not ready.\n  So what are they supposed to do? The other side would suggest, do not \ndo anything now. Put it off. Wait until some time in the future when we \nhave a permanent repository. How much time do we have to wait? Where is \nthe future? The Secretary of Energy says this repository is not going \nto be ready, a permanent one at Yucca Mountain, until the year 2015. \nWhat, do we have to wait another 18 years? That is what the other side \nwould have you believe.\n  What are the damages associated with the inability of the Government \nto fulfill its contractual commitment? There is full exposure, full \nemployment for the lawyers. What we have around here is too much \nspeculation. What we need are some facts. And the facts are that we \nhave this stuff all over the country. The chart here shows where it is. \nWe have the stuff spread in 41 States at 80 sites. We are proposing to \naddress it and put it in one safe site. Where is that site? It is where \nwe have held nuclear tests, out in the desert, for 50 years. So, when \nthey say it is unneeded, I have to dispute that. First of all, it is \nneeded because we are in violation of a contractual commitment that the \nFederal Government entered into in good faith.\n  What did the court say about it? The court said the Government is \nliable. They said that last year. The Federal Government is liable to \ntake that waste. If we do not take it, there are going to be damages. \nHow much are the damages? Full employment for the lawyers, it is \nestimated at $59 billion.\n  Nevada is where we propose to put it. We are going to put it in \ntemporary casks, on the surface, until such time as Yucca Mountain's \npermanent repository is done. We are going to remove it from all these \nsites around the country and put it in one place. If that is \nirresponsible, and America's environmental community is opposed to it, \nthen they must be for this.\n\n  The other side makes an issue that no environmental group supports \nthis legislation. What do they support? You and I know what they \nsupport. They support doing away with the nuclear industry in this \ncountry. That is their objective. And what do they propose, to make up \nthat 21, 22 percent of our power generation? They do not want to \naddress that. They say, ``Wind power.'' Fine, I am for wind power. \nSolar? Fine, I am for solar. You just cannot generate sufficient \namounts with the technology we have. How about hydrogen? Let us go that \nroute? Great. But you have to be in the real world. They want air \nconditioning, they want the lights to go on. And the nuclear power \nindustry is contributing to this, almost 25 percent of our total \nenergy.\n  So, when they say it is unneeded, they are absolutely wrong. Do we \nwant to shut down those nuclear plants because they are running out of \nstorage space? They were licensed for so much space. You have seen \npictures of those pools. You have seen the spent rods being stored \nthere. That was not permanent storage. It was not designed for \npermanent storage. Everybody knows that. It was temporary, until such \ntime as the Government could fulfill its contract.\n  Did the environmental community and the folks who are down at the \nWhite House who are opposed to this legislation, who, I might add, have \nno position on this issue, do they want us to have blackouts on hot \nsummer days? What do they propose in the future, if we do not address \nthis problem of adequate storage on hand when our storage is filled in \nthose pools? Do we want to default on our Federal obligation? I have \nalready talked about that. And, remember, the courts have upheld the \nobligation of the Federal Government.\n  What kind of precedent are we setting in this country for those who \nobserve the way Government does business, to ignore the commitment to \nthe ratepayers who have contributed with the expectation that the waste \nwould be taken?\n  The comment was made by the other side that interim storage in Nevada \nwas unneeded and unsafe. Is it safe to continue to store this waste in \nthe pools that were designed to hold that waste for a temporary \ntimeframe?\n  One of the Senators from Nevada says that the 100 millirem standard \nis unsafe. Let us talk about that, because those kinds of speculative \narguments excite a lot of people. Again, it is speculation.\n  The current EPA radiation protection guidance is 500 millirem, 500. \nEPA is considering making it 100 millirem, to even be more protective. \nSo, the current EPA radiation protection guidance says 500, but we have \nit at 100 in our bill. Additionally, we provide EPA with the authority \nto proscribe a stricter standard if needed. As a consequence, to \nsuggest our bill is unsafe defies reality. We are promoting the public \nhealth and safety with a higher standard, if indeed it is needed.\n  We have heard it said that transportation is unsafe. We have shown \nthat nuclear fuel was safely transported across the country every \nsingle day of the year, year in and year out, 2,400 shipments for 16 \nyears, from 1979 to 1995, through every State in the Nation except \nSouth Dakota and Florida. It has been moving. Why has it been moving? \nIt has been moving from all these different sites. It has been moving \nfrom universities that have test reactors, research reactors. It has \nbeen moving\n\n[[Page S2833]]\n\nfrom military sites, from Navy sites. It has been moving, moving, \nmoving, and we have not had any accidents.\n  We talk about what kind of container is going to be involved. \nObviously, it is going to be a safe container, the same kind that has \nmoved this material in 2,400 shipments. So that is a bogus argument, to \nsay it is unsafe. We have shown that casks cannot be breached with real \nworld accidents. We have shown there has never been an accident \ninvolving the release of radiation. Of course, in Europe, in Asia, they \nmove this stuff all over, all over the world. So, if you want to buy \nfear tactics, this is probably a good environment to buy them in \nbecause there are lots of them around here.\n  A further statement was made relative to our bill being unwise. I \nhave trouble with that. If it was wise enough, sometime ago, for us to \ndecide that it made sense to develop a permanent repository in Nevada, \nat a cost of some $30 billion, which is not a sure thing, then why is \nit unwise to spend between $1.5 to $2 billion to build an interim that \ncan handle the problem until the permanent is ready. If Yucca is not \ndetermined to be suitable, then we will have a place for the waste \nuntil another site is selected if we pass this bill. Either way, we \nwill need an interim site. So this is a very wise, thoughtful approach.\n  Much has been made in this debate about the Nuclear Waste Technical \nReview Board, and what they have said. What the board has told us is \nthat central storage is needed if Yucca comes on line, and that central \nstorage is needed if it does not come on line. There may be \ndisagreements about timing, but the end result is the same. We need \ninterim storage, regardless of what happens with Yucca Mountain. We \nneed it either way, Mr. President. Is it unwise to leave waste? Where \nare we going to leave the waste, with the status quo? That is what the \nother side proposes.\n\n  Is it wise to leave waste at 80 sites in 41 States in pools that were \nnot designed for long-term storage and to leave it there? How long? \nUntil Yucca's done, 2015 or longer. One State, Connecticut, has guards \nand fences around the pools of nuclear waste in one of our Senator's \nneighborhoods, a Senator in this body.\n  So when they say it is unneeded, unwise, unsafe, I suggest they look \nat reality and recognize there is, indeed, every reason to believe that \nit is safe to take it out of 80 sites in 41 States that we have safely \ntransported across this country for over 16 years, and it is certainly \nneeded because the pools are full and many of these reactors will not \nbe able to be relicensed for additional storage, because they do not \nhave any. They will have to shut down.\n  So I encourage the administration and the environmental community, if \nyou do not like this bill, then come up with an answer. I encourage the \nenvironmental community to recognize that as they address the \nlegitimate concerns we all have over greenhouse gases, increased carbon \nemissions, where do we look for relief?\n  We just had a significant portion of the French Parliament here. They \nwere acknowledged. We had a 2-minute recess. They told me in the back \nthey wished us well with our effort to bury our waste. In France, they \ndo not allow you to bury your waste because it is valuable, because \nthey have embarked on a technology called reprocessing where, through a \nMAX fuel process, they recover the waste associated with those rods \nthat are stored in the pools and they recover the energy in a plutonium \nform and put it back in the reactor with enriched uranium. Who is \naddressing the proliferation threat? They are burning theirs. We are \nproposing to put ours underground. In the meantime we are like \nostriches running around saying, ``We can't do this, we can't do \nthat.''\n  What are the Japanese doing? The Japanese have taken the French \ntechnology which, incidentally, we developed initially when we had \nproposed to reprocess. We cannot reprocess because we have a policy \nagainst reprocessing. But the Japanese have expanded on an effort to be \ntotally independent of imported energy in Japan. What does that do to \ntheir industrial economy? It makes it pretty secure. They are going to \ndepend on nuclear energy. If there is any country that has had an \nexperience with nuclear energy that is more sensitive, I do not know \nwhat it could be other than Japan.\n  The Japanese are committed to a $20 billion to $24 billion project. I \nwas up there last December. They are building a refueling, \nreprocessing, state-of-the-art facility. Do you know what they are \ndoing now? They are sending their waste from their nuclear reactors \nover to France, the French are reprocessing, and the waste goes back \nvitrified. But they are going to do it themselves in Japan. They are \ngoing to recover the plutonium, put it back in the reactors and reduce \nthe proliferation threat, because plutonium has value.\n  I am not here arguing the case for that. I am simply stating what is \nhappening in the real world with state of the art. France is 70 percent \ndependent on nuclear power. We cannot even figure out what to do with \nour waste. The last nuclear plant was built in this country in 1979, \n1980. That is where we are. Nobody in his right mind would try and \nbuild one today, because the permitting process would simply make it \nunfeasible, if there is such a word, certainly noneconomic from the \nstandpoint of generating a return.\n  I can stand here on the floor of the Senate and predict that within \n10 years, we will be going to Japan and we will be going to France for \nthe advanced technology associated with disposal of high-level waste. \nWhat this administration has done is to allow in nuclear waste from \nother countries, but it will not address its obligation to the nuclear \npower industry to take its waste that it has collected the money for \nthe last 16 years, $13 billion.\n  So I hope some of the folks down at the White House reflect a little \nbit on the obligations that we have made commitments and the reality \nthat we have not performed. It is easy to criticize the nuclear \nindustry with regard to nuclear waste, but let's be realistic and let's \nrecognize, again, that they have performed their obligation. Now they \nare asking the Federal Government to perform theirs.\n\n  I want to conclude my debate today with a little reference on a \nportion of the statement that was made regarding the Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board and the points made in that debate on the other \nside.\n  My distinguished friends and colleagues from Nevada have in their \nstatements, I think, misinterpreted or perhaps misunderstood some of \nthe conclusions associated with the Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard. There has been an assertion that the Nuclear Waste Technical \nReview Board--which, as has been stated, is a panel of scientists \nappointed to review the Department of Energy's nuclear waste program--\nopposes the construction of an interim storage facility. The suggestion \nis they oppose it. This simply is not true, Mr. President.\n  Following a February hearing on S. 104, I asked the chairman of the \nboard the following question, and this is from the record:\n\n       Those who oppose S. 104 have used the board's report as \n     evidence that ``technical and scientific experts'' believe \n     that a centralized temporary storage facility will not be \n     needed. Is this the conclusion the board intended people to \n     draw?\n\n  The chairman responded:\n\n       On the contrary, the board believes that a centralized \n     storage facility will be needed----\n\n  Will be needed, Mr. President----\n\n     and the generic planning should begin immediately. \n     Significant advantages can be derived from siting a storage \n     facility adjacent to a repository.\n\n  OK, adjacent to Yucca Mountain is what S. 104 proposes. The board did \nstate, however:\n\n       However, there are no compelling technical or safety \n     reasons to move spent fuel to a centralized facility for the \n     next few years.\n\n  I think we have here some questions of timing. ``The next few \nyears,'' the last time I checked, few meant two. In order to be able to \nmove spent fuel in a few years--well, we started this process, and we \nhave been, what, 16 to 17 years now trying to move this process along. \nWe entered into a contract with the nuclear power industry to take it \n16 years ago. Here we are today, 1 year away from a mandatory \nobligation to perform under a contract in 1998, and when is this one \ngoing to be ready? 2015. So we have 17, 18 years.\n  The other side said we should not start now, or they interpret the \nboard's interpretation to mean there is no compelling or safety reason \nto move\n\n[[Page S2834]]\n\nspent fuel to a centralized storage facility in the next few years. If \nwe started today in this process, which is what I hope we will do as \nsoon as the Senate supports passage of this bill, we will not be able \nto start on this facility until we are into the year 2000. We all know \nthat. So it is a question of timing.\n  It is only natural that the board begin this process. This is a \ntechnical body. They probably have no concept of the lead time \nlegislation must have before it can become law and can result in \nplanned action. Again, 17 years on this process already.\n  So as we move to the bill, I am willing to offer an amendment that \nwould provide a new schedule for siting construction of the interim \nfacility, recognizing 2 years is not going to do it. This is to take \ninto account the passage of time since introduction of the original \nlegislation. Mr. President, even before this amendment, in response to \nwritten questions, the chairman stated something else:\n\n       The difference in timing between the board's \n     recommendations and the approach set forth in S. 104 are not \n     substantial.\n\n  I think it is fair to say that my friends from Nevada have placed a \ngood deal of faith in the board's judgment, but I would like to point \nout some of the board's statements that they won't tell you about. At \nthe February hearing, Chairman Cohon stated that:\n\n       The board believes that the risks associated with \n     transporting spent fuel are very low--\n\n  Very low----\n\n     and are likely to remain very low even when the number of \n     shipments increases.\n\n  I hope that satisfies my friends from Nevada.\n  While my colleagues have asserted that nuclear waste can stay just \nwhere it is, and that is the position they have taken, the board has \nstated:\n\n       The board believes that one or more centralized spent fuel \n     storage facilities will be needed somewhere if Yucca Mountain \n     proves to be unsuitable for development as a repository.\n\n  Where is somewhere, Mr. President? Somewhere is out here at the \nNevada site that was used previously for more than 800 nuclear weapons \ntests over 50 years. That is somewhere. It has to go somewhere. Nobody \nwants it. This is someplace, contrary to the claims we heard today that \nthe Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board does believe that temporarily \ncentralized storage of nuclear waste is needed and transportation of \nspent fuel is safe.\n  The last issue I would like to refute is a question of, well, why not \nwait until 1998? The administration says it objects to siting a \ntemporary storage facility before 1998 when the viability assessment \nfor Yucca Mountain will be completed. There have been those who asked, \n``Why can't we just wait for 1998 and pass the legislation then?'' I \nthink I have addressed that, but to anybody who has watched this \nprocess, the obvious answer is, it is going to take a few years, more \nthan a few years. It has taken over 2 years since the first \nintroduction of this legislation, and we are still debating on the \nSenate floor.\n  S. 104 takes into account the viability assessment. It provides a \nprocedure for choosing an alternative site if it is negative, and S. \n104 gives the Department of Energy the authority it needs to begin the \nyear or so of nonsite-specific work necessary to build an interim \nstorage facility. Anyone who believes that the viability assessment \nwill make passing legislation easier is out of touch with reality. The \nreality is that no one wants nuclear waste stored in their State, \nwhether it be Arkansas or Alaska or Nevada. But we have to put it \nsomewhere.\n\n  And this was good enough for 800 nuclear weapons tests over 50 years \nout in the Nevada desert where they have an experienced work force. \nThey have security. They have the know-how. And it was selected as the \nbest site for a permanent repository. We have expended $6 billion in a \nprocess that ultimately is going to take an expenditure probably of $30 \nbillion to finish it.\n  At the committee hearing on Senate bill 104 in February, all four \nmembers of the Nevada delegation stated that no level of scientific \nproof would basically lessen their opposition to this project. I \ncommend them for that; they are doing what they have to do for their \nState. If it was not Nevada, it would be some other State here.\n  But we have an obligation to put it somewhere. And that is the bottom \nline of this whole debate. When we go round and round and round, nobody \nwants it. We will not reprocess it like Japan, like France, and take \nadvantage of advanced technology to counter proliferation threats. We \ncannot get the environmental community to responsively address \nreprocessing. So we are hell-bent to bury it--as long as we do not bury \nit anywhere.\n  The ultimate reality is that the Federal Government has an obligation \nto start taking this waste next year. The obligation is to move nuclear \nwaste, not to start thinking about how you might take waste in the \nfuture.\n  So, again, I would urge my colleagues to recognize that we have \nreached a crossroads. The job of fixing this program is ours. The time \nfor fixing it is now. We have it at 80 sites in 41 States, and no one \ncan convince me that is the best procedure to just leave it there.\n  We have made progress at Yucca. The 5-mile exploratory tunnel is soon \ngoing to be complete. And we can build on this progress. This bill \ncontinues the site characterization activities for that permanent \nrepository. And do not believe anything else. But we cannot put all our \neggs in the Yucca basket. We need this storage facility, this temporary \nfacility now. Otherwise, Mr. President, what we are going to be doing--\nmake no mistake about it; I want every Member to so note--we are going \nto be leaving it right where it is: in your State. If you are one of \nthe 41 States, leave it right where it is for another generation to \ncome along and debate it, talk about it.\n  In the meantime, we are leaving it in storage that was not designed \nfor long-term storage. We can choose whether the Nation needs 80 \ninterim storage sites or just one at the Nevada site where we exploded \nnuclear bombs during the cold war. It is safe. It is remote. It is \nmonitored.\n  If Yucca is licensed, which I think it will be, it will be an easy \ntask to move the material to the repository. And if Yucca is not \nlicensed or found to be unsuitable, we will need a centralized interim \nsite anyway. So we will be ahead of the game regardless of what happens \nat Yucca.\n  Mr. President, this is a step we should take. The time is now. And \nany attempt to escape this obligation would be unwise. It would be \nunsafe to fail to address the problem. And what is unneeded is further \ndelay.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the courtesy of recognizing me and \nwish you a good day and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I came to the U.S. Senate in 1975. At \nthat time, the nuclear debate was raging full blast. ``Shall we or \nshall we not build more nuclear-electrical-generating plants?'' I just \nfinished 4 years as Governor of my State. And we had built two nuclear \nplants up on the Arkansas River. I believe the total cost of both of \nthose plants was $400 million. It was represented to me at the time, as \nGovernor, that that would be by far the cheapest power we would ever \nknow anything about.\n  But after I came to the Senate and began to investigate the \nfeasibility and the advisability of taking this country down \nthe nuclear path, I quickly came to the conclusion that I would resist \nany additional nuclear plants. There was another highlight on the front \nburner called the Clinch River breeder reactor to be built on the \nClinch River down in Tennessee.\n\n  I remember in 1981, the Republicans took over this place, and Howard \nBaker, the Senator from Tennessee, and one of the finest men ever to \nserve in this body, became majority leader. I was trying to keep any \nadditional nuclear plants from being licensed--and it was not a tough \nchore. A lot of people had made up their minds at that point that the \nnuclear option was not a good one. I fought for about 4 years to kill \nthe Clinch River breeder.\n  But I was up against the majority leader. And as everybody here \nknows, as the old revenuer said, when they announced United States \nversus Jones, he turned to his lawyer and said, ``Them don't sound like \nvery fair odds to me.'' And it was not very fair odds to go up against \nthe majority leader on the Clinch River breeder, which was going to be \nbuilt in his beloved Tennessee.\n  Howard Baker could always just pull out that one extra vote he \nneeded. The\n\n[[Page S2835]]\n\nvote was always close, but when you are majority leader, you know, you \ncan just call somebody over and say, ``I need your vote,'' and you \nusually get it.\n  Finally, one year I was ahead by about six or seven votes as the \nvotes were being cast, and I think Senator Baker decided that he was \ndone for, and he turned everybody loose that had committed to him who \ndid not really like the idea of the Clinch River breeder reactor and \nwere only voting for it to accommodate him. He turned them loose, and I \nthink we won that day by about 70 to 30. Happily, that was the end of \nthe Clinch River breeder.\n  I had a group of people from France in my office this afternoon, some \npoliticians and some deeply involved in the electrical industry. They \nwanted to talk about the new concept of restructuring the electricity \nindustry in this country to go to retail competition. They are doing \nthis in France. They are doing it in Germany and doing it all over \nWestern Europe. And they wanted to talk to me about my bill.\n  One of them said, ``Senator, we understand that you are the Senator \nwho killed the breeder reactor.''\n  ``Mais oui.''\n  He said, ``If you had it to do over again, would you do it again?''\n  ``You bet.''\n  France is heavily dependent on breeder reactors. But they are also in \nthe business of reprocessing and using MOX to generate power, and so \non. I guess I am digressing a little bit to say about the breeder \nreactor, it is dead, dead; and I am glad it is dead.\n  The reason I did not like the breeder reactor is the same reason I \ndid not like nuclear power, period. It is wonderful. It is the cleanest \npower you can have. You see that nice, clear white smoke coming out of \nthose smokestacks in Russellville, AR. And you know there is nothing \npolluting about that plant.\n  But if you look inside, if you look inside the plant and you see \nthose fuel rods, you have to ask yourself, since these things are going \nto be radioactive for thousands of years, how do you dispose of them? \nThat is the reason I turned against nuclear power. I could not figure \nout a way on Earth that we were going to environmentally, acceptably \ndispose of those fuel rods.\n  So now, Mr. President, we are here today debating that very \nproposition and 35,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel created by the \nelectrical generating companies of this country and thousands of tons \nmore by the Pentagon. It has to be disposed of. And we have been \nlaboring with the question of how we are going to do it. As we lawyers \nsay, ``Since the memory of man runneth not.'' We are doing our very \nbest to keep faith with the people of this country and dispose of it in \na way that they will be able to sleep at night.\n  Let me tell you one other thing. If we dispose of it the way the \nSenator from Alaska proposes right now, we may be transporting that \nstuff all over the country two or three times. And, you know, I live in \na little town of 2,500 people, Charleston, AR. You are being addressed \nright now almost entirely by the South Franklin County Bar Association. \nI was about the only lawyer in town--it is so little. But if I were a \nlawyer in Charleston, I would be very apprehensive about all that \nnuclear power coming from Russellville, AR, right up Highway 22. And \nthe Presiding Officer knows exactly the location I am talking about. \nComing right up Highway 22 through Charleston, AR, headed for Yucca \nMountain.\n  So, what did we do? In 1982, we passed a bill called the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act. A good bill. We said to the electrical industry in \nthis country, the nuclear electrical industry, that you pay a fee to \nthe U.S. Government every year. We will use your money to find and \ndevelop a permanent repository for this nuclear fuel.\n  We passed the bill. The deal was cut. We started collecting the fees. \nBoth sides operating in ultimate good faith. No shenanigans. You pay us \na fee every year and we will use it to find a site. We found a site \ncalled Yucca Mountain in the home State of my good friend, the junior \nSenator from Nevada.\n  I am on the same side of the Senator from Nevada. And if it were \nArkansas instead of Nevada that they were putting it in, I would be \nlike him sitting in my seat on this floor 24 hours a day trying to keep \nfaith with my constituents and saying, what have we done to deserve \n35,000 tons of nuclear waste dumped in our backyard? And I am sad about \nthat. It is one of those things. Somebody has to do it.\n  So we find Yucca Mountain and everybody says this is the best \npossible site--not the perfect site, may not be the site ultimately \nchosen--but it is the site we are choosing to start spending this fee \nthe utilities are paying us.\n  So, what have we done since 1982? We have dug a 5-mile hole, a tunnel \nin Yucca Mountain in anticipation of it ultimately being decided that \nit is by far the best place to locate this spent fuel. We have spent \n$4.8 billion on that 5-mile hole. And we are going to spend a lot more \nbefore it is perfected.\n  But, Mr. President, the reason we stand here today debating this bill \nis this. We said to the utility industry, we will take your fuel--we \nbeing the U.S. Government, the Energy Department--we will take this \n35,000 tons of spent fuel and we will start taking it in about January \n1998. That is coming up. It will be here before you know it.\n  Now, the utilities have been operating in good faith, too. They have \nbeen paying their fees in anticipation of getting rid of this stuff \nwhich they are storing onsite at their nuclear plants.\n  Again, the Presiding Officer, I know, has been to those two nuclear \nsites in Arkansas.\n  Some of it is lying out in dry casks. Some of it is in water. But it \nis stored on site. We have 110 nuclear generating plants in this \ncountry and 76 storage sites. For example, we only have one storage \nsite in Russellville, but two generators. That is not uncommon in this \ncountry.\n  So we have the 110 nuclear generating plants generating more and more \nspent fuel and storing it at a considerable cost to them. There is no \ndenying this is very expensive to the utilities. So they say: A deal is \na deal. In 1982 we said we would start paying you, and you said January \n1998 you would start taking the fuel off our hands and we could quit \nbuilding all the facilities and storing it.\n  It is kind of ominous. Most Senators, I suppose, have been to the \nnuclear plants and looked at those things. You look at the pool of \nwater, it has a very strange color, and the nuclear rods are in that \nwater. I have never seen a real dry cask they put it in. My legislative \ndirector has a small mock-up model of a cask they put it in. What they \nwill be doing, if all goes through according to S. 104, they will take \nthat fuel out of water and put in the steel casks. The casks are big, \nthey are expensive. They will put those fuel rods inside those casks, \nthose that are not already there, and they will start transporting them \nfrom all over the United States to Nevada. You lucky dog. They will be \ntransporting them to Nevada in those casks.\n  What the Senator from Alaska says, ``We will pour a gigantic concrete \nslab and we will carry that stuff out there to Yucca Mountain.'' Not \ninside the mountain. This is somewhere around Yucca Mountain. I do not \nknow where. We have the 5-mile tunnel built. We have a little more \nboring to do. But we will pour the concrete slab, transport the fuel \nout there, and just leave it out there in the open.\n  Now, this sounds simple, but it is a pretty expensive undertaking. \nWhat it means is if S. 104 passes and the President vetoes it and we \noverride his veto, it will cost about $4 billion over the next 5 years \ninstead of the $2 billion we are planning to spend on the permanent \nrepository.\n  Mr. President, I tell you something interesting that has nothing to \ndo with the debate. If, in August of next year--bear in mind there will \nbe a determination made next August on whether or not Yucca Mountain is \nsuitable. Incidentally, the reason we are here today is because the \ndates are at cross purposes. We have to start taking the fuel in \nJanuary, but we do not know whether Yucca Mountain will be determined \nto be suitable until August of next year. So we are required to start \ntaking the stuff 8 months before we know whether Yucca Mountain will be \nthe ultimate repository. Now, if it is, if next August we find it \nsuitable, there are still a lot of licensing procedures to go through, \nbut basically we are in fat city. Everybody will be happy because Yucca \nMountain has been determined to be suitable, and we will take all this \nwaste that S. 104 wants to take out and\n\n[[Page S2836]]\n\nput on a concrete slab. In the year 2010 we will start taking it and \nputting it in that hole, that tunnel in the mountain, and we will seal \nthat sucker up. You think about it. We will put 84,000 tons of spent \nnuclear fuel in this tunnel in Yucca Mountain and seal that thing. No \nguards and no monitors walking up and down hallways, putting a Geiger \ncounter on it and see what the radiation is that is coming out of it. \nWe will seal it up forever.\n  Now, before I get to the end of this tale, let me go back a moment \nand say this stuff is going to be in Yucca Mountain for thousands and \nthousands of years. And you know why? Because that is how long it is \nradioactive. You know what we are debating here today? Ten years. We \nare saying we cannot wait 10 years to make sensible decisions that \naffect the lives of every man, woman, and child in America. We have to \ndo it right now because the utility industry is unhappy. They want us \nto take it now and transport it to Yucca Mountain and get it out of \ntheir back door. If they would have listened to me 20 years ago, they \nwould not have a problem because they would not have all that waste. I \nwas not that powerful then. I am not that powerful now either.\n\n  But think about this: We are talking about planting 84,000 tons of \nspent nuclear fuel in Yucca Mountain, to be reposed for thousands and \nthousands of years, and S. 104 says we cannot wait 10 years to find \nout. We cannot wait until August of next year to determine whether or \nnot Yucca Mountain is a suitable repository. This is a monumental \ndecision. We are not talking about the Kentucky Derby. We are talking \nabout thousands of tons of lethal spent fuel and how we will dispose of \nit safely so the American people can sleep at night.\n  I share the concern of the Senator from Alaska about disposing of \nthis stuff. I am not trying to drag my feet. Everybody knows we have to \ndispose of this stuff. We are talking about what is the best way to do \nit. What is in the national interest? What is sensible? What is the \nsafest way to do it?\n  It is tragic that the Energy Department has to renege on its \nagreement, but it cannot help it. It was not their fault. It really was \nnot anybody's fault that we did not get this all done by 1998. But the \nEnergy Department says certainly if it is found suitable, we believe we \ncan start taking this stuff by the year 2010 and doing it properly and \nin a way that everybody will find to be suitable and satisfying.\n  So what happens under this bill? If Yucca Mountain is found to be \nunsuitable next August, you have to go ahead and build this thing \nanyway, this interim storage site, unless the President of the United \nStates finds an alternative site and Congress approves that alternative \nsite all within 2 years. If anybody believes you can do that, hold up \nyour hand. That is an absolutely impossible condition in S. 104. The \nPresident cannot find another site and get Congress to approve that \nsite within 2 years. We have been working on Yucca Mountain forever, \nand now we are in a posture of finally concluding a happy end to this \nsituation. But even if Yucca Mountain is found to be unsuitable, S. 104 \nof the Senator from Alaska will still require that every pound of \nnuclear waste in this country be transported to Yucca Mountain, even \nthough that is not going to be the permanent repository site.\n  So what happens then? We find another permanent repository site. We \nwill load it all up and bring it back through Charleston, AR, once \nagain. That will make the citizens happy. They already had the \ndaylights scared out of them bringing the fuel through their hometowns \nonce. Now they will get it again. So why take it in the first place? \nWhy not at least give the administration and the utility industry an \nopportunity to work out some kind of an arrangement whereby we will pay \nthem--they are suing us now, and frankly they have a good lawsuit. I do \nnot deny that. They have a good lawsuit. We agreed to take it in 1998, \nand we cannot do it. So we will have to pay.\n  So my question is why not pay them to leave it where it is for a few \nmonths until we can make a decision about the suitability of Yucca \nMountain and proceed the way we have been proceeding?\n  Now, Mr. President, let me just close by making something of a \nconfession. It is tempting to me to support this proposition. I would \nnot vote for S. 104 under any circumstances, but the concept set out in \nS. 104 makes it very appealing and very attractive. As I say, I would \nnot vote for an interim storage site right now because we are coming up \non the time when we will know with some degree of certainty whether or \nnot Yucca Mountain will be the place. Can we not wait? America, this is \nthe central question. Can we not wait 10 years to determine that this \nis the safest place in the world and the best place in the world to \nstore this stuff for thousands of years? What is 10 years in the scheme \nof the thousands of years that this stuff will be stored there?\n  The options are not good either way. I do not blame the utilities for \nwanting to get rid of the stuff, but I do not blame us for not wanting \nto take it. It is folly in the extreme for us to take that stuff out \nthere and spend an extra $2 billion to put in a concrete slab when we \nknow, or will know next August almost to a reasonable degree of \ncertainty, a year from now we will know whether or not we will be able \nto use Yucca Mountain, and if we are, would it not be infinitely better \nto transport that fuel one time--not twice, not three times--one time, \nto put it in a site in which we will all feel comfortable?\n  Mr. President, I know there are plenty of votes in this place to pass \nthis bill. I know the President will veto it when it is presented to \nhim. We will see what happens after that. I am trying to call for a \ndegree of sanity and reasonableness and saying I would like to get rid \nof it, too. Nobody has any stronger desire to get rid of this nuclear \nwaste than I have.\n  The Senator from Nevada and I will probably be on opposite sides next \ntime. If Yucca Mountain is found to be suitable, you can bet I will \nvote to put it there. I have not supported the Senators from Nevada \nbecause I like them, because they are friends; I supported them because \nI thought they were right. I have supported the Energy Department and \nthe administration's position on this because I think they are right.\n  I am asking my colleagues, I know they are getting a lot of pressure \non them both from the industry and the party and different people, but \nI tell you something, when you start playing politics with this issue, \nI plead for my colleagues to remember, people may disagree with you, \nbut they like people who stand up for what they believe, even when it \nis not popular. People sometimes say to me, why do you guys not screw \nup your nerve and do something right, something courageous for a \nchange? I hear that all the time. Do you know what they mean by \ncourageous? Unpopular. If it is popular, it is not courageous.\n  Here is a bill that is very complicated, and the American people are \nnot homed in on it. The people here know what they are doing. I am \nasking, for Pete's sake, listen to this debate and do what they think \nis sensible, in the best interests of the country.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2826-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, as a newly inducted member of the downtown \nOptimist Club of Great Falls, MT, I take great pride in telling my \ncolleagues about the new Optimist International Child Safety Awareness \nProgram.\n  In recent months, there have been numerous reports of serious and \neven fatal injuries to children as a result of incorrect positioning or \nimproper restraint in vehicles. Often these injuries are preventable.\n  The Optimist International Child Safety Awareness Program operates \nunder the premise that adults must assume the responsibility to see \nthat their kids are safe while driving in a motor vehicle. The Optimist \nClub seeks to increase adult awareness of the hazards of incorrectly \npositioned children.

A bill to control crime by requiring mandatory victim \nrestitution; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 THE VICTIM RESTITUTION ENFORCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Victim \nRestitution Enforcement Act of 1997. I have long supported restitution \nfor crime victims, and have long been convinced that justice requires \nus to devise effective mechanisms through which victims can enforce \nrestitution orders and make criminals pay for their crimes.\n  I was very pleased when we enacted mandatory victim restitution \nlegislation last Congress as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective \nDeath Penalty Act of 1996. I supported that legislation and very much \nappreciated the efforts of my colleagues, particularly Senators Hatch, \nBiden, Nickles, Grassley, and McCain, to ensure that victim restitution \nprovisions were included in the antiterrorism legislation.\n  Those victim restitution provisions--brought together as the \nMandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996--will significantly advance \nthe cause of justice for victims in Federal criminal cases. The act \nrequires Federal courts, when sentencing criminal defendants, to order \nthese defendants to pay restitution to the victims of their crimes. It \nalso establishes a single set of procedures for the issuance of \nrestitution orders in Federal criminal cases to provide uniformity in \nthe Federal system. Inclusion of mandatory victim restitution \nprovisions in the Federal criminal code was long overdue, and I am \npleased that Congress was able to accomplish that last year.\n  However, much more remains to be done to ensure that victims can \nactually collect those restitution payments and to provide victims with \neffective means to pursue whatever restitution payments are owed to \nthem. Even if a defendant may not have the resources to pay off a \nrestitution order fully, victims should still be entitled to go after \nwhatever resources a defendant does have and to collect whatever they \ncan. We should not effectively tell victims that it is not worth going \nafter whatever payments they might get. That is what could happen under \nthe current system, in which victims have to rely on Government \nattorneys--who may be busy with many other matters--to pursue \nrestitution payments. Instead, we should give victims themselves the \ntools they need so that they can get what is rightfully theirs.\n  The victim restitution provisions enacted last Congress consolidated \nthe procedures for the collection of unpaid restitution with existing \nprocedures for the collection of unpaid fines. Unless more steps are \ntaken to make enforcement of restitution orders more effective for \nvictims, we risk allowing mandatory restitution to be mandatory in name \nonly, with criminals able to evade ever paying their restitution and \nvictims left without the ability to take action to enforce restitution \norders.\n  Last Congress, I introduced the Victim Restitution Enforcement Act of \n1995. Many components of my legislation were also included in the \nvictim restitution legislation enacted as part of the Antiterrorism and \nEffective Death Penalty Act. The legislation I introduce today is \nsimilar to the legislation I introduced last Congress as Senate bill \n1504, and is designed to build on what are now current provisions of \nlaw. All in all, I hope to ensure that restitution payments from \ncriminals to victims become a reality, and that victims have a greater \ndegree of control in going after criminals to obtain restitution \npayments.\n  Under my legislation, restitution orders would be enforceable as a \ncivil debt, payable immediately. Most restitution is now collected \nentirely through the criminal justice system. It is frequently paid as \ndirected by the probation officer, which means restitution payments \ncannot begin until the prisoner is released. This bill makes \nrestitution orders payable immediately, as a civil debt, speeding \nrecovery and impeding attempts by criminals to avoid repayment. This \nprovision will not impose criminal penalties on those unable to pay, \nbut will simply allow civil collection against those who have assets.\n  This will provide victims with new means of collecting restitution \npayments. If the debt is payable immediately, all normal civil \ncollection procedures, including the Federal Debt Collection Act, can \nbe used to collect the debt. The bill explicitly gives victims access \nto other civil procedures already in place for the collection of debts. \nThis lightens the burden of collecting debt on our Federal courts and \nprosecutors.\n  My bill further provides that Federal courts will continue to have \njurisdiction over criminal restitution judgments for 5 years, not \nincluding time that the defendant is incarcerated. The court is \npresently permitted to resentence or take several other actions against \na criminal who willfully refuses to make restitution payments; the \ncourt may do so until the termination of the term of parole. Courts \nshould have the ability to do more over a longer period of time, and to \nselect those means that are more likely to prove successful. Under my \nbill, during the extended period, Federal courts will be permitted, \nwhere the defendant knowingly fails to make restitution payments, to \nmodify the terms or conditions of a defendant's parole, extend the \ndefendant's probation or supervised release, hold the defendant in \ncontempt, increase the defendant's original sentence, or revoke \nprobation or supervised release.\n  My legislation will also give the courts power to impose presentence \nrestraints on defendants' uses of their assets in appropriate cases. \nThis will prevent well-heeled defendants from dissipating assets prior \nto sentencing. Without such provisions, mandatory victim restitution \nprovisions may well be useless in many cases. Even in those rare cases \nin which a defendant has the means to pay full restitution at once, if \nthe court has no capacity to prevent the defendant from spending ill-\ngotten gains or other assets prior to the sentencing phase, there may \nbe nothing left for the victim by the time the restitution order is \nentered.\n  The provisions permitting presentence restraints are similar to other \nprovisions that already exist in the law for private civil actions and \nasset forfeiture cases, and they provide adequate protections for \ndefendants. They require a court hearing, for example, and place the \nburden on the Government to show by a preponderance of the evidence \nthat presentence restraints are warranted.\n  In short, I want to make criminals pay and to give victims the tools \nwith which to make them pay. In enacting mandatory victim restitution \nlegislation last Congress, we demonstrated our willingness to make some \ncrimes subject to this process. I believe we must take additional steps \nto make those mandatorily issued orders easily enforceable.\n  This legislation is supported by the National Victim Center and by \nthe Michigan Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence. I ask \nunanimous consent to have placed in the Record letters of support from \nthose victims' rights organizations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my legislation, which will empower \nvictims to collect on the debts that they\n\n[[Page S2839]]\n\nare owed by criminals and which will improve the enforceability of \nrestitution orders.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be placed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 518\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: The National Victim Center would like \n     to express it strong support for your bill, the Victims \n     Restitution Enforcement Act of 1997. Restitution is one of \n     the most direct manifestations of justice that our criminal \n     justice system can provide: requiring the convicted offender \n     to pay for the harm caused by his criminal conduct. No other \n     aspect of our system has a greater impact on the lives of \n     crime victims, or on their satisfaction with the criminal \n     justice process.\n       The provisions of this bill would greatly facilitate the \n     ordering and collection of restitution for victims' of \n     federal offenses, and would serve as a mode for state \n     legislatures who are searching for a means to enhance their \n     own restitution efforts. Adoption of this bill would fully \n     implement the spirit of the Mandatory Victims' Restitution \n     Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-132, Sec. 201 et seq.). It would \n     provide courts the information necessary to issue meaningful \n     restitution orders, would create a raft of mechanisms to \n     enhance the enforcement of those orders.\n       Passage of the Victims Restitution Enforcement Act of 1997 \n     would send a strong signal to the American people that the \n     federal government will do everything in its power to provide \n     justice to our nation's crime victims. We urge your fellow \n     congress members to join in supporting this important \n     legislation.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                     David Beatty,\n     Acting Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                           Michigan Coalition,\n\n                                                    April 8, 1997.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: The Michigan Coalition Against \n     Domestic and Sexual Violence (MCADSV) fully supports the \n     Victim Restitution Enforcement Act that you introduce today. \n     Perpetrators of domestic violence and sexual assault exact a \n     devastating emotional toll on their victims, a price that \n     many survivors pay for a lifetime. Additionally, there are \n     often substantial financial costs borne by the victim. \n     Obvious expenses are those for property damage and medical \n     care. Often overlooked are the costs of counseling, lost work \n     time, child care, and expenses related to preparing for and \n     attending the trial.\n       While there is no legislative or other remedy to erase the \n     pain and terror experienced as a result of violent crime, we \n     can take greater measures to ensure that victims are not \n     forced to pay, out of their own pockets, for the actions of \n     criminals. This legislation is necessary both to empower \n     victims and require more perpetrators to pay for the \n     financial consequences of their crimes.\n       MCADSV greatly appreciates your advocacy efforts on behalf \n     of crime victims by sponsoring this important initiative.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                            Kathleen Hagenian,\n\n                                                         Director,\n                               Public Policy and Program Services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 520. A bill to terminate the F/A-18 E/F aircraft program; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n\n\n          TERMINATING THE F/A-18 E/F SUPER HORNET LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nterminate the U.S. Navy's F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet Program.\n  The basis for this legislation is contained in a 1996 General \nAccounting Office report entitled ``Navy Aviation: F/A-18 E/F Will \nProvide Marginal Operational Improvement at High Cost.'' In this \nreport, GAO studied the rationale and need for the F/A-18 E/F in order \nto determine whether continued development of the aircraft is the most \ncost-effective approach to modernizing the Navy's tactical aircraft \nfleet. GAO concluded that the marginal improvements of the F/A-18 E/F \nare far outweighed by the high cost of the program.\n  Mr. President, in our current fiscal climate, I have serious concerns \nabout authorizing funding for such a costly program, which according to \nGAO will deliver only marginal improvements over the current C/D \nversion of the F/A-18.\n  As GAO noted in its report, at a projected total program cost of \n$89.15 billion, the F/A-18 E/F Program is one of the most costly \naviation programs in the Department of Defense. The total program cost \nis comprised of $5.833 billion in development costs and $83.35 billion \nin procurement costs for 1,000 aircraft.\n  Mr. President, before I begin to describe GAO's findings in detail, I \nwould first like to discuss briefly the role of the F/A-18 aircraft in \nour Nation's overall naval aviation force structure. The Navy performs \nits carrier-based missions with a mix of fighter (air-to-air combat), \nstrike (air-to-ground combat), and strike/fighter (multicombat role) \naircraft. Currently, carrier based F-14 fighter aircraft perform air-\nto-air missions; A6E's perform air-to-ground missions; and F/A-18's \nperform both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions. The F/A-18 E/F \nSuper Hornet is the latest version of the Navy's carrier-based F/A-18 \nstrike/fighter plane.\n  Mr. President, the F/A-18 E/F is just one of three costly new fighter \nprograms the Department of Defense has on the drawing boards right now.\n  In addition to the F/A-18 E/F, there is the Air Force's F-22, which \nis intended to replace the A-10 and the venerable F-16 Falcon. The F-22 \nis also intended to either supplant or augment the Air Force's top \nfighter, the F-15. It will have stealth capabilities and will be able \nto survive in dense air-defense environments.\n  And of course, there is the Joint Strike Fighter, which I will \ndiscuss in greater detail in a few moments. The JSF is intended to \nperform virtually every type of mission that fighter aircraft perform \nin today's force structure, and is to be employed by the Navy, the Air \nForce, and Marine Corps in unprecedented fashion.\n  There are few who seriously believe that the Pentagon can afford to \nmaintain all three tactical fighter programs. The General Accounting \nOffice, the Congressional Budget Office and many others have maintained \nthat the\n\n[[Page S2842]]\n\nlikelihood that all three programs can be fully funded with the planned \nnumber of aircraft buys is virtually nil. In fact, many view the JSF as \nthe only modernization program that should be continued. Given our \nfiscal constraints and Federal budget deficit, can we afford to finance \nthree separate fighter programs with the caliber and costs of the F/A-\n18 E/F, the F-22, and the JSF?\n  The answer is unequivocally no. And that is why I am introducing \nlegislation to terminate any further development or procurement of the \nprogram that appears to be most questionable, the E/F upgrade.\n  The Navy has based the need for development and procurement of the F/\nA-18 E/F on existing or projected operational deficiencies of the F/A-\n18C/D in the following key areas: strike range, carrier recovery \npayload and survivability. In addition, the Navy notes limitations of \ncurrent C/D's with respect to avionics growth space and payload \ncapacity. In its report, GAO concludes that the operational \ndeficiencies in the C/D that the Navy cited in justifying the E/F \neither have not materialized as projected or such deficiencies can be \ncorrected with nonstructural changes to the current C/D and additional \nupgrades made which would further improve its capabilities.\n  One of the primary reasons the Navy cites in justifying the E/F is \nthe need for increased range and the C/D's inability to perform long-\nrange unrefueled missions against high-value targets. However, GAO \nconcludes that the Navy's F/A-18 strike range requirements can be met \nby either the F/A-18 E/F or F/A-18 C/D. Furthermore, it concludes that \nthe increased range of the E/F is achieved at the expense of its aerial \ncombat performance, and that even with increased range, both aircraft \nwill still require aerial refueling for low-altitude missions.\n  The F/A-18 E/F specification requirements call for the aircraft to \nhave a flight range of 390 nautical miles (nm) while performing low-\naltitude bombing missions. The F/A-18 E/F will achieve a strike range \nof 465 nm while performing low-altitude missions by carrying 2 external \n480 gallon fuel tanks. While current C/D's achieve a flight range of \n325 nm with 2-330 gallon fuel tanks while performing low-altitude \nmissions--65 nm below the specification requirement of the E/F--when \nthey are equipped with the 2-480 gallon external fuel tanks that are \nplanned to be used on the E/F, the C/D can achieve a strike range of \n393 nm on low-altitude missions.\n  Recent Navy range predictions show that the F/A-18 E/F is expected to \nhave a 683 nm strike range when flying a more fuel-efficient, \nsurvivable, and lethal high-altitude mission profile rather than the \nspecified low-altitude profile. Similarly, although F/A-18 E/F range \nwill be greater than the F/A-18 C/D, the C/D could achieve strike \nranges (566 nm with 3-330 gallon fuel tanks or 600 nm with 2-480 gallon \ntanks and 1-330 gallon tank) far greater than the target distances \nstipulated in the E/F's system specifications by flying the same high-\naltitude missions as the E/F. Additionally, according to GAO, the E/F's \nincreased strike range is achieved at the expense of the aircraft's \naerial combat performance as evidenced by its sustained turn rate, \nmaneuvering, and acceleration which impact its ability to maneuver in \neither offensive or defensive modes.\n\n  One claim the Navy has made in response to the GAO report is that the \nC/D cannot be outfitted with 480-gallon external fuel tanks. GAO \ndisputes this, citing contractor studies that concluded 480-gallon \ntanks can be carried on the C/D's inboard stations. GAO also points out \nthat the Canadians have flown the F/A-18 C with the larger external \nfuel tanks.\n  Mr. President, another significant reason the Navy cites in support \nof the continued development of the E/F is an anticipated deficiency in \nF/A-18C carrier recovery payload--the amount of fuel, weapons and \nexternal equipment that an aircraft can carry when returning from a \nmission and landing on a carrier.\n  However, the deficiency in carrier recovery payload which the Navy \nanticipated of the F/A-18C simply has not materialized. When initially \nprocured, F/A-18C's had a total carrier recovery payload of 6,300 \npounds. Because of the Navy's decision to increase the F/A-18C's \nmaximum allowable carrier landing weight and a lower aircraft operating \nweight resulting from technological improvements, the F/A-18C now has a \ncarrier recovery payload of 7,113 pounds.\n  F/A-18C's operating in support of Bosnian operations are now \nroutinely returning to carriers with operational loads of 7,166 pounds, \nwhich exceeds the Navy's stated carrier recovery payload capacity. This \nrecovery payload is substantially greater than the Navy projected it \nwould be and is even greater than when the F/A-18C was first introduced \nin 1988. In addition, GAO notes that while it is not necessary, \nupgrading F/A-18C's with stronger landing gear could allow them to \nrecover carrier payloads of more than 10,000 pounds--greater than that \nsought for the F/A-18 E/F (9,000 pounds).\n  While the Navy also cites a need to improve combat survivability in \njustifying the development of the F/A-18 E/F, the aircraft was not \ndeveloped to counter a particular military threat that could not be met \nwith existing or improved F/A-18 C/D's. Additional improvements have \nsubsequently been made or are planned for the F/A-18 C/D to enhance its \nsurvivability including improvements to reduce its radar detectability, \nwhile survivability improvements of the F/A-18 E/F are questionable. \nFor example, because the F/A-18 E/F will be carrying weapons and fuel \nexternally, the radar signature reduction improvements derived from the \nstructural design of the aircraft will be diminished and will only help \nthe aircraft penetrate slightly deeper than the F/A-18 C/D into an \nintegrated defensive system before being detected.\n  Mr. President, as we discuss survivability, it is relevant to \nhighlight the outstanding performance of the F/A-18 C/D in the gulf war \njust a few short years ago. By the Navy's own account, the C/D \nperformed extraordinarily well, dropping 18 million pounds of \nordinance, recording all Navy MiG kills, and, in the Navy's own words, \nexperiencing ``unprecedented survivability.''\n\n  In addition to noting the operational capability improvements in \njustifying the development of the F/A-18 E/F, the Navy also notes \nlimitations of current C/D's with respect to avionics growth space and \npayload capacity. The Navy predicted that by the mid-1990's the F/A-18 \nC/D would not have growth space to accommodate additional new weapons \nand systems under development. Specifically, the Navy predicted that by \nfiscal year 1996 C/D's would only have 0.2 cubic feet of space \navailable for future avionics growth; however, 5.3 cubic feet of \navailable space have been identified for future system growth. \nFurthermore, technological advancements such as miniaturization, \nmodularity and consolidation may result in additional growth space for \nfuture avionics.\n  The Navy also stated that the F/A-18 E/F will provide increased \npayload capacity as a result of two new outboard weapons stations; \nhowever, unless current problems concerning weapons release are \nresolved--air flow problems around the fuselage and weapons stations--\nthe types and amounts of weapons the E/F can carry will be restricted \nand the possible payload increase may be negated. Also, while the E/F \nwill provide a marginal increase in air-to-air capability by carrying \ntwo extra missiles, it will not increase its ability to carry the \nheavier, precision-guided, air-to-ground weapons that are capable of \nhitting fixed and mobile hard targets and the heavier stand-off weapons \nthat will be used to increase aircraft survivability.\n  Understanding that the F/A-18 E/F may not deliver as significant \noperational capability improvements as originally expected, I would now \nlike to focus on the cost of the F/A-18 E/F Program and possible \nalternatives to it. As previously mentioned, the total program cost of \nthe F/A-18 E/F is projected to be $89.15 billion. These program costs \nare based on the procurement assumption of 1,000 aircraft--660 by the \nNavy and 340 by the Marine Corps--at an annual production rate of 72 \naircraft per year. Mr. President, as the GAO report points out, these \nfigures are overstated. According to Marine Corps officials and the \nMarine Corps Aviation Master Plan, the Marine Corps does not intend to \nbuy any F/A-18 E/F's and, therefore, the projected 1,000 aircraft buy \nis overstated by 340 aircraft.\n\n[[Page S2843]]\n\n  Although the Pentagon contends that the Navy had intended to purchase \n1,000 aircraft all along, extensive documentation and testimony \ndemonstrates this not to be the case and the 1,000 figure was the \noriginal complete buy.\n  I would also note the importance of the Marine Corps opting out of \nthe E/F Program. Although the E/F was originally developed to service \ntwo branches with differing needs and requirements, the Marine Corps \nhas chosen instead to invest in the Joint Strike Fighter program and \nuse those aircraft to replace their AV-8B Harriers and F/A-18 C/D's.\n  Furthermore, the Congress has stated that an annual production rate \nof 72 E/F aircraft is probably not feasible due to funding limitations \nand directed the Navy to calculate costs based on more realistic \nproduction rates as 18, 36, and 54 aircraft per year. In fact, \naccording to the Congressional Research Service: ``* * * no naval \naircraft have been bought in such quantities in recent years, and it is \nunlikely that such annual buys will be funded in the 1990's, given \nexpected force reductions and lower inventory requirements and the \nabsence of consensus about future military threats.''\n\n  Using the Navy's overstated assumptions about the total number of \nplanes procured and an estimated annual production rate of 72 aircraft \nper year, the Navy calculates the unit recurring flyaway cost of the F/\nA-18 E/F--costs related to the production of the basic aircraft--at $44 \nmillion. However, using GAO's more realistic assumptions of the \nprocurement of 660 aircraft by the Navy, at a production rate of 36 \naircraft per year, the unit recurring flyaway cost of the E/F balloons \nto $53 million. This is compared to the $28 million unit recurring \nflyaway cost of the F/A-18 C/D based on a production rate of 36 \naircraft per year. Thus, GAO estimates that this cost difference in \nunit recurring flyaway would result in a savings of almost $17 billion \nif the Navy were to procure the F/A-18 C/D's rather than the E/F's.\n  Mr. President, this is certainly a significant amount of savings. Now \nI know that some of my colleagues will say that by halting production \nof the F/A-18 E/F and instead relying on the F/A-18 C/D, we will be \nmortgaging the future of our Naval aviation fleet. However, Mr. \nPresident, there is a far less costly program already being developed \nwhich may yield more significant returns in operational capability. \nThis program is the Joint Strike Fighter or JSF Program.\n  The JSF Program office is currently developing technology for a \nfamily of affordable next generation multirole strike fighter aircraft \nfor the Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy. The JSF is expected to be a \nstealthy strike aircraft built on a single production line with a high \ndegree of parts and cost commonality. The driving focus of the JSF is \naffordability achieved by triservice commonality. The Navy plans to \nprocure 300 JSF's with a projected initial operational capability \naround 2007.\n  Contractor concept exploration and demonstration studies indicate \nthat the JSF will have superior or comparable capabilities in all Navy \ntactical aircraft mission areas, especially range and survivability, at \nfar less cost than the F/A-18 E/F. The JSF is expected to be a stand \nalone, stealthy, first-day-of-the-war, survivable aircraft. Overall, \nthe JSF is expected to be more survivable and capable than any existing \nor planned tactical aircraft in strike and air-to-air missions, with \nthe possible exception of the F-22 in air-to-air missions. The Navy's \nJSF variant is also expected to have longer ranges than the F/A-18 E/F \nto attack high-value targets without using external tanks or tanking. \nUnlike the F/A-18 E/F which would carry all of its weapons externally, \nthe Navy's JSF will carry at least four weapons for both air-to-air and \nair-to-ground combat internally, thereby maximizing its stealthiness \nand increasing its survivability. Finally, the JSF would not require \njamming support from EA-6B aircraft as does the F/A-18 E/F in carrying \nout its mission in the face of integrated air defense systems.\n  While the JSF is expected to have superior operational capabilities, \nit is expected to be developed and procured at far less expense than \nthe F/A-18 E/F. In fact, the unit recurring flyaway cost of the Navy's \nJSF is estimated to range from $31-38 million depending on which \ncontractor design is chosen for the aircraft, as compared to GAO's $53 \nmillion estimate for the F/A-18 E/F. Additional cost benefits of the \nJSF would result from having common aircraft spare parts, simplified \ntechnical specifications, and reduced support equipment variations, as \nwell as reductions in aircrew and maintenance training requirements.\n  Mr. President, given the enormous cost and marginal improvement in \noperational capabilities the F/A-18 E/F would provide, it seems that \nthe justification for the E/F is not as evident as once thought. \nOperational deficiencies in the C/D aircraft either have not \nmaterialized or can be corrected with nonstructural changes to the \nplane. As a result, proceeding with the E/F program may not be the most \ncost-effective approach to modernizing the Navy's tactical aircraft \nfleet. In the short term, the Navy can continue to procure the F/A-18 \nC/D aircraft, while upgrading it to improve further its operational \ncapabilities. For the long term, the Navy can look toward the next \ngeneration strike fighter, the JSF, which will provide more operational \ncapability at far less cost than the E/F.\n  Mr. President, succinctly put, the Navy needs an aircraft that will \nbridge between the current force and the new, superior JSF which will \nbe operational around 2007. The question is whether the F/A-18 C/D can \nserve that function, as it has demonstrated its ability to exceed \npredicted capacity or whether we should proceed with an expensive, new \nplane for a marginal level of improvement. The $17 billion difference \nin projected costs does not appear to provide a significant return on \nour investment. In times of severe fiscal constraints and a need to \nlook at all areas of the budget to identify more cost-effective \napproaches, the F/A-18 E/F is a project in need of reevaluation.\n  Last year, I offered an amendment to the fiscal year 1997 \nauthorization bill for the Department of Defense that required the \nPentagon to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the F/A-18 E/F Program, \nand to report their findings to the Congress by March 30, 1997. This \nstudy was to include a review of the E/F program, an analysis and \nestimate of the production costs of the program for the total number of \naircraft expected to be procured at several different production rates \nand a comparison of the costs and benefits of this program with the \ncosts and benefits of the C/D Program. That analysis has not been \nforwarded to the Congress as of this date.\n  In addition to this report, the Quadrennial Defense Review [QDR], \nresponsible for evaluating all weapon system programs, is also \nscheduled to be completed in the near future.\n  Unfortunately, I was enormously disappointed when the Secretary of \nDefense, rather than waiting for these reports to be completed and \npublicly released, announced on March 28 his decision to move forward \nwith the E/F Program and procure 62 new F/A-18 E/F fighter planes at an \ninitial cost of $48 million each.\n  I would have hoped that the Secretary, who I have tremendous respect \nand admiration for, would have waited until the mandated reports had \nbeen provided to Congress and until the results of the QDR--which could \nhave a significant impact on the Pentagon's tactical aircraft \nmodernization plans--had been made public. Instead, this perplexing \ndecision to proceed with the procurement of 62 of these expensive \nplanes precludes the Congress from offering any input on the \nDepartment's policy based on a review of the required reports. I am \npuzzled as to why the new Secretary did not await these reports before \nannouncing this decision.\n  The 1996 GAO report concluded that we could achieve almost $17 \nbillion in cost savings if the Navy elected to procure additional C/D \nversions of the F/A-18 rather than the costlier E/F model. Mr. \nPresident, by all accounts the F/A-18 C/D is a top quality aircraft \nthat has served the Navy well over the last decade, and could be \nmodified to meet every capacity the E/F is intended to fulfill over the \ncourse of the next decade at a substantially lower cost.\n  Therefore, considering the Department of Defense has clearly \noverextended itself in terms of supporting\n\n[[Page S2844]]\n\nthree major multirole fighter programs, and given that the most \npromising tactical aviation program appears to be the triservice joint \nstrike fighter which will likely outperform the F/A-18 E/F at a \nsubstantially lower cost, it is clear that we must discontinue the E/F \nProgram before the American taxpayer is asked to fund yet another \nmultibillion dollar duplicative program.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 520\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TERMINATION OF THE F/A-18E/F AIRCRAFT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Termination of Program.--The Secretary of Defense shall \n     terminate the F/A-18E/F aircraft program.\n       (b) Payment of Termination Costs.--Funds available for \n     procurement and for research, development, test, and \n     evaluation that are available on or after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act for obligation for the F/A-18E/F \n     aircraft program may be obligated for that program only for \n     payment of the costs associated with the termination of the \n     program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. \n        Hagel, and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 521. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose \ncivil and criminal penalties for the unauthorized access of tax returns \nand tax return information by Federal employees and other persons, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the coverdell TAXPAYER PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to offer legislation that \nwill end one of the most pernicious offenses forced upon honest \ntaxpayers. I am talking about file snooping. Others may call it \nbrowsing or scanning. Whatever the name, it is just plain wrong, and it \nought to be stopped. That is why today I am introducing the Taxpayer \nPrivacy Protection Act.\n  Too often, the Internal Revenue Service acts as a bully, enforcing \nthe Tax Code through fear and intimidation. Even worse, legal loopholes \nhave allowed certain IRS employees to violate the privacy of innocent \ncitizens without punishment. Some of the most troubling abuses \ncommitted by employees of the IRS against innocent Americans include \nthe practices of file snooping.\n  Recently in the Wall Street Journal, we learned of the case of Mr. \nRichard W. Czubinski of Boston, MA. He is a member of the Ku Klux Klan \nwho used his IRS job to search the tax returns of political opponents \nand people he suspected of being Government informers. He was \nprosecuted and convicted by a jury, but his conviction was overturned \nin the Federal Court of Appeals. In making its decision, the appellate \npanel found Mr. Czubinski's browsing to be reprehensible, but also \nfound no crime had been committed because prosecutors could not prove \nhe had used the information or disclosed it.\n  In addition, a few years back, I was shocked to learn that in my home \ncity of Atlanta, nearly 370 employees of the local IRS office were \ncaught accessing the tax returns and return information of friends, \nneighbors, and celebrities without proper authorization.\n  Mr. President, the Taxpayer Privacy Protection Act would make it a \ncrime to engage in file snooping, punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 \nand/or 1 year imprisonment. Further, a convicted offender would have to \nreimburse all costs of prosecution and face dismissal.\n  My legislation also requires notification of taxpayers who suffer \nthis abuse. Unfortunately, what should seem to be a simple matter of \ndecency must be required of the IRS. In response to suggestions \ntaxpayers be notified when their privacy has been invaded by file \nsnoopers, IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson stated, ``I'm not sure \nthere would be serious value to that in terms of protecting the \ntaxpayers' rights.'' With all respect, such sentiment is typical of a \nWashington status quo mentality that is out-of-touch with the rest of \nAmerica.\n  Finally, my proposal would provide taxpayers who have been victims of \nfile snooping with the option of seeking civil action. Quite simply, it \nis the decent thing to do.\n  Taxpayer privacy is one of the most sacred trusts we place in the \nIRS. Unfortunately, this agency has not lived up to this trust. With \npassage of the Taxpayer Privacy Protection Act, honest, hardworking \ntaxpayers can be assured their full privacy will be protected every \nApril 15. They deserve no less.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GLENN:\n  S. 523. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prevent \nthe unauthorized inspection of tax returns or tax return information; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    irs systems security legislation\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, the date of April 15 is indelibly etched in \nthe minds of most Americans. For it is on or by that day that honest, \nhard-working citizens voluntarily share their most personal and \nsensitive financial information with their Government.\n  All Americans should have unbridled faith that their tax returns will \nremain absolutely confidential and zealously safeguarded. That is the \nfoundation of our taxpaying system. If this trust is breached, then the \nbonds that tie citizens with their Government may break, with \ndisastrous consequences for us all.\n  In 1993 and 1994, as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nI held hearings which first exposed that vulnerability. We found out \nthat hundreds of IRS employees had been investigated for what I term \n``computer voyeurism'', where they call up returns of friends, enemies, \ncelebrities, relatives, or neighbors just to snoop and satisfy their \nown prurient interests. Even worse, in some cases, IRS employees either \naltered their own returns to get refunds, or conspired with other \ntaxpayer friends to change their returns and get a kickback from those \nrefunds.\n  My investigation revealed serious flaws in the IRS' ability to \nmonitor, prevent, and detect browsing.\n  In response, the IRS Commissioner pledged a zero tolerance policy to \nprotect taxpayer privacy and vigorously discipline those who abuse this \ntrust. The Commissioner also implemented a new system called EARL--\nElectronic Audit Research Log--to help identify inappropriate and \nunauthorized access to taxpayer information stored in the IRS' main \ncomputer system.\n  That primary system, IDRS--Integrated Data Retrieval System--handles \nmore than 100 million transactions per month and is used by over 55,000 \nIRS employees. At least one-third of those employees are authorized to \ninput adjustments to tax account records.\n  I had asked the General Accounting Office [GAO] to review the \nprogress made by the IRS in reducing computer security risks and in \ncurbing browsing. Earlier this year, GAO produced that report. However, \nbecause some of the specific details could jeopardize IRS security, \nthat report was designated for ``Limited Official Use'' with restricted \naccess.\n  Due to my involvement in this important issue, and because I believe \nthe public has a right to know, I requested that GAO issue a redacted \nversion of the report suitable for public release. I would like to \nthank GAO for their hard work in this matter and also the IRS for their \ncooperation in making this possible.\n  The findings of GAO's report are disturbing. Even more important, \ntheir findings are reaffirmed by the IRS in a comprehensive internal \nreport of their own compiled last fall.\n  Before I get to the specifics, I just want to say a couple of things.\n  Point One. The vast majority of IRS employees are dedicated and \ncommitted to their jobs, and labor in extremely difficult conditions \nwith very outmoded systems. Unfortunately, in this day and age, they \nmust also fear for their own personal safety.\n  Some 99.9 percent of them would never engage in such snooping or \nfraud. It is not as if every American has reason to believe that his or \nher privacy and tax return information has been compromised. But even \njust a single incidence of this behavior is one too many and cannot be \ntolerated.\n  Just last year, in Tennessee, a jury acquitted a former IRS employee \nwho had been charged with 70 counts of improperly peeking at the tax \nreturns of celebrities such as Elizabeth Taylor, Dolly Parton, Wynonna \nJudd, Michael\n\n[[Page S2845]]\n\nJordan, Lucille Ball, Tom Cruise, President Clinton, and Elvis Presley.\n  More recently, just a few weeks ago, a Federal appeals court in \nBoston reversed the conviction of a former employee who had been found \nguilty of several counts of wire and computer fraud by improperly \naccessing the IRS taxpayer database. It was reported that he had \nbrowsed through several files, including those of a local politician \nwho had beaten him in an election, and a woman he once had dated. The \nGovernment had alleged this worker was a member of a white-supremacist \ngroup and was collecting data on people he thought could be Government \ninformers.\n  In both of these cases, because of a loophole in the law, no criminal \npenalties could be meted out. The reason? No disclosures had been made \nto third parties.\n  I doubt these kinds of decisions give great comfort to honest, law-\nabiding citizens. That is why today I am reintroducing my legislation--\nthe Taxpayer Privacy Protection Act--to close this gap and ensure that \nany unauthorized access or inspection of return information, in \nwhatever form, is punishable as a criminal offense and that employees \nso convicted are fired immediately.\n  I know that the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee is \ninterested in passing such a bill as are several of my Senate \ncolleagues including Senator Coverdell. I commend everyone for their \ninterest and looking forward to making this bill--finally--a reality.\n  Let's pass this by April 15 and send a signal across the land that \nthose who violate the privacy of tax paying Americans will be fined, \nwill be fired, and will be jailed. The public rightfully expects no \nless.\n  Point Two. The IRS has recognized this serious issue and has \nundertaken some responsive actions. Warnings of possible prosecution \nfor unauthorized use of the system appear whenever employees log onto \nthe taxpayer account database. They have installed automated detection \nprograms in some of their systems to monitor employee use and alert \nmanagers to possible misuse. And, the IRS has just created a new Office \nof Systems Standards and Evaluations to centralize and enforce IRS \nstandards and policies for all major security programs. I have \nconfidence that this Office, if given the proper resources, will be a \npositive force in this effort.\n  The problem, however, is that these efforts, while well-intentioned, \nhave come too late and fall far short of the commitment, management, \nand determination sorely needed to confront this matter head-on.\n  The sad fact is that with 1 week to go until tax returns are due, one \nthing is clear: the IRS has flunked its own audit and has let down the \nAmerican people.\n  The agency promised zero tolerance for browsing. Today's information \nsuggests that they have failed to live up to that pledge--1,515 new \ncases of browsing have been identified since our last report. Of those \nonly 27 have resulted in employees being fired. I don't know what kind \nof new math they may be using, but that doesn't sound like zero \ntolerance to me.\n  GAO even found that the 1,515 figure may drastically underestimate \nactual incidents because--and I quote--the agency's ``ability to detect \nbrowsing is limited''.\n  Overall, GAO found that IRS' approach to computer security is not \neffective. Serious weaknesses persist in security controls intended to \nsafeguard IRS computer systems, data, and facilities and expose tax \nprocessing operations to the risk of disruption and taxpayer data to \nthe risk of unauthorized use, modification, and destruction. Further, \nalthough IRS has taken some action to detect and prevent browsing, the \nfact remains that the IRS has no effective means for measuring the \nextent of the browsing problem, the damage being done by browsing, or \nthe progress being made to deter browsing.\n  This finding is candidly confirmed in IRS' own internal report:\n\n     progress in developing efficient prevention and detection \n     programs has been painfully slow. The program has suffered \n     from a lack of overall consistent, strong leadership and \n     oversight.\n\n  Quite distressing to me is the finding, as stated in the IRS' own \nreport, that employees, when confronted, indicate that they browsed \nbecause they do not believe it is wrong and that there will be little \nor no consequence to them if they are caught.\n  Before summarizing the major findings, I also want to point out \nanother facet of this report. That is, the effectiveness of controls \nused to safeguard IRS systems, facilities, and taxpayer data. GAO found \nserious weaknesses in these efforts, especially in the areas of \nphysical and logical security.\n  For example, the facilities visited by GAO could not account for \nabout 6,400 units of magnetic storage media, such as tapes and \ncartridges, which might contain taxpayer data. Further, they found that \nprintouts containing taxpayer data were left unprotected and unattended \nin open areas of two facilities where they could be compromised.\n  I really don't want to say much more on this portion of the report \nthan I have already. Except that these matters, and the others referred \nto by GAO, must be dealt with swiftly and effectively.\n  I have summarized GAO's findings in a handout. Where appropriate, I \nhave also included references from IRS' own recent internal report on \ntheir browsing deterrence and detection program. As I mentioned \nearlier, that report--[Electronic Audit Research Log (EARL) Executive \nSteering Committee Report, Sept. 30, 1996]--and I commend the IRS for \nits candid and frank evaluations in it--affirms most of GAO's findings, \nconclusions, and recommendations.\n  I will briefly highlight the major findings in these attachments:\n\n\n      the irs system designed to detect browsing [earl] is limited\n\n  GAO found that the system used to monitor and detect browsing is \nineffective because it can't distinguish between legitimate work \nactivity and illegal browsing.\n  Moreover, EARL only monitors the main taxpayer database. There are \nseveral other systems used by employees to create, access, or modify \ndata which, apparently, go unsupervised. This is something I have asked \nthe GAO to look into further.\n  According to GAO:\n\n     because IRS does not monitor the activities of all employees \n     authorized to access taxpayer data . . . IRS has no assurance \n     that these employees are not browsing taxpayer data and no \n     analytical basis on which to estimate the extent of the \n     browsing problem or any damage being done.\n\n  In fact, according to the IRS' EARL report:\n\n       The current system of reports does not provide accurate and \n     meaningful data about what the abuse detection programs are \n     producing, the quality of the outputs, the efficiency of our \n     abuse detection research efforts, or the level of functional \n     management follow through and discipline. This impedes our \n     ability to respond to critics and congressional oversight \n     inquiries about our abuse detection efforts.\n\n  IRS Progress in Reducing and Disciplining Browsing Cases is Unclear\n\n  The systems used by the IRS cannot report on the total number of \nunauthorized browsing incidents. Nor do they contain sufficient \ninformation to determine, for each case investigated, how many taxpayer \naccounts were inappropriately accessed or how many times each account \nwas accessed.\n  Consequently, for known incidents of browsing, IRS cannot efficiently \ndetermine how many and how often taxpayers' accounts were \ninappropriately accessed. Without such information, IRS cannot measure \nwhether it is making progress from year to year in reducing browsing.\n  Internal IRS figures show a fluctuation in the number of browsing \ncases closed in the last few years: 521 cases in fiscal year 1991; 787 \nin fiscal year 1992; 522 in fiscal year 1993; 646 in fiscal year 1994, \nand; 869 in fiscal year 1995.\n  More distressing, however, is the fact that in spite of the \nCommissioner's announced zero tolerance policy, the percentages of \ncases resulting in discipline has remained constant from year to year, \naveraging 29 percent.\n  IRS itself reported that almost one-third of the cases detected were \nsituations where an employee accessed their own account, which, \naccording to the report, is ``generally attributable to trainee \nerror''.\n  Their answer creates simply more questions, however. Why are \nemployees accessing their own accounts? Is this a wise policy?\n\n\n           Penalties for Browsing are Inconsistent Across IRS\n\n  Despite IRS policy to ensure that browsing penalties are handled \nconsistently across the agency, it appears\n\n[[Page S2846]]\n\nthat there are disparities in how similar cases are decided among \ndifferent offices.\n  For instance, the number of browsing cases resulting in employees \nbeing terminated in the last year surveyed ranged from 0 percent at one \nfacility to a high of only 7 percent at another.\n  The percentage of browsing cases resulting in employee counseling \nranged from 0 percent at one facility to 77 percent at another.\n  Even more incredible to me--and quite distressing--is the extremely \nlow percentage of employees caught browsing each year who are fired for \ntheir offense, according to the IRS' own figures. Would you believe \nthat, for all of the browsing cases detected and closed each year, the \nhighest number of employees fired in 1 year has been 12. Between fiscal \nyear 1991 and fiscal year 1995, only 43 employees were fired after \nbrowsing investigations. That is generally 1 percent of the total \nnumber of cases brought each year. Even if you include the category of \nresignation and retirement, the highest percentage of employees \nterminated through separation or resignation/retirement in any 1 year \nhas been 6 percent.\n  I could go on and on, but I think you get the idea.\n  Taxpayer privacy is being jeapordized and the IRS is not doing enough \nto address it.\n  A new law to make browsing a crime will be an important tool and I \nhave worked with the IRS and the Justice Department in crafting my \nlegislation.\n  I will also be looking forward to Thursday's hearing of the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee when the IRS will be testifying and this \nissue is likely to come up.\n  In closing, I do not want to be standing up here again next year \ntalking about browsing. Although the computer age makes guarding \ntaxpayer privacy more difficult and complex, the fact remains: the IRS \ncan and must do better. The American people expect and demand nothing \nless.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 524. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nremove the requirement of an x ray as a condition of coverage of \nchiropractic services under the Medicare Program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                          MEDICARE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nmakes a commonsense change to Medicare's outdated policy regarding \nchiropractic care. Specifically, my bill would eliminate the \nrequirement that beneficiaries get an x ray before they are authorized \nto be reimbursed for chiropractic services under Medicare. This \nlegislation accomplishes two important goals. First, it removes \noutdated vestiges of still pronounced discrimination against \nchiropractic practitioners in the Medicare Program. Second, this bill \nmakes chiropractic services more accessible and affordable for \nbeneficiaries. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nmeasure, which is the Senate companion to legislation introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives on March 4, 1997 by Representative Phil Crane.\n  Existing Medicare law strictly limits reimbursement for chiropractic \nservices to manual manipulation of the spine and only to correct a \nsubluxation. However, before beneficiaries can be reimbursed for \nchiropractic care, Medicare requires that the patient get an x ray to \nconfirm the need for these services. Beneficiaries must either pay for \nthe x ray out of their own pockets, a cost that many cannot afford, or \npass through the ``gateway'' controlled by other medical providers, \nwhose x rays, typically far more expensive, are reimbursable under the \nprogram.\n  While x rays are often a useful diagnostic tool to verify a medical \ncondition, most medical professionals and health analysts agree that \nthere is no clinical justification for a blanket requirement that \nMedicare beneficiaries verify the need for chiropactic care through an \nx ray. Medicare's statutory x ray requirement results in unnecessary \npatient exposure to x rays and simply cannot be justified as an across-\nthe-board requirement.\n  Representatives of the Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA] \nwho have closely studied this issue reached the same conclusion that I \ndid and recommended to the President that this provision be included in \nhis Medicare reform plan. I am pleased that the President did include \nin his fiscal year 1998 balanced budget proposal a provision calling \nfor the elimination of the x ray requirement for chiropractic care. I \nam cautiously optimistic that bipartisan support from within the \nCongress and the administration will help facilitate passage of this \nmodest, but important, measure.\n  I grew up in a community where chiropractors perform a valuable \nservice by providing an alternative to allopathic medicine. The nearly \n200 chiropractors in South Dakota serve the State well. In rural States \nlike mine, chiropractors are often an essential source of health care \ndelivery. Sometimes they are the only health providers in the \ncommunity. In rural States across the country, the chiropractic \nprofession plays an integral role in the health care system.\n  But the issue is even larger than one of correcting inequities in the \nlaw and recognizing the contributions of chiropractors alone. We are \nconstantly searching for ways to give more Americans greater access to \nquality health care, and to facilitate that availability of care in the \nmost cost-effective manner. One proven way to make progress toward \nthose goals is to exploit the talent and dedication represented in the \ndiversity of practitioners increasingly involved in the delivery of \nhealth care services in the United States. Competition among different \nkinds of providers and access to less expensive forms of care have to \nbe emphasized if we are to control escalating health care costs. Yet \nthis competition is virtually impossible when programs like Medicare \nput up barriers to beneficiaries receiving care from a group of \nlicensed professionals like chiropractors.\n  As health care cost increases continue to threaten both the quality \nand economic stability of our national health care delivery system, the \ncost savings potential of chiropractic care should be fully explored. \nThe bill I am introducing today will help provide access to quality \ncare at a reasonable cost. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \nsupport this measure to ensure Medicare patients have appropriate \naccess to the benefits of chiropractic care.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 524\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1. REMOVAL OF REQUIREMENT FOR X-RAY AS A CONDITION OF \n                   COVERAGE OF CHIROPRACTIC SERVICES UNDER THE \n                   MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1861(r)(5) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(r)(5)) is amended by striking \n     ``demonstrated by X-ray to exist''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to services furnished on or after January 1, \n     1998.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bennett, \n        Mr. Daschle, Ms. Collins, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Smith of Oregon, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Campbell, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 525. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \naccess to health care insurance coverage for children; to the Committee \non Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n              Child Health Insurance and Lower Deficit Act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today, Senator Kennedy, I, and a number of \nothers, are introducing the Hatch-Kennedy child health insurance and \nlower deficit bill, or the CHILD Act, S. 525. We will also introduce a \ncompanion measure, S. 526, which contains a tobacco excise tax increase \nto pay for the program established in the CHILD bill.\n  The CHILD bill has been negotiated over a long period of time in \nintensive and sometimes heated negotiations. As anybody can understand, \nit is difficult to get the two sides together on matters like this. So \nwe have worked very, very hard to try and bring both sides together.\n\n[[Page S2847]]\n\n  It is no secret that Senator Kennedy and I have worked together in \nthe past. And, we have fought each other in the past. But today is a \ntime of unity, for I believe we have written a bill that really makes \nsense, a bill that will work and that will help one of the most \nvulnerable segments of our society, children without health insurance.\n  Of the 40 million people who are uninsured in this country, 10 \nmillion of them are children. Of those 10 million, about 3 million do \nqualify for Medicaid, but are not enrolled.\n  While it has its problems, Medicaid is an excellent program overall, \na program that does assist the poorest of the poor children and \nfamilies. But those above the Medicaid eligibility poverty levels, \ncomprise about 7 million children, most of whom are often called the \nnear poor, or the working poor.\n  Mr. President, as a recent study has made abundantly clear, about one \nout of three children in this country lacks health insurance. It is a \npathetic situation.\n  As my colleagues are aware, Senator Kennedy and Senator Kerry \nintroduced a bill last year which addressed the child health insurance \nproblem from a considerably different perspective than the bill we are \nfinally going to introduce today.\n  I think it is important to point out the differences for the \nedification of my colleagues.\n  The bill we will file today is a bill that is a straight block grant \nto the States. The States have flexibility to determine their own \neligibility standards with minimal Federal requirements.\n  The proposal is not an entitlement program. It is a fully funded \nprogram. It is a 5-year authorization.\n  The mechanism for funding the CHILD program authorization is an \nincrease in the tobacco excise tax, amounting to 43 cents per package \nfor cigarettes and proportionate increases on other tobacco products. \nSome have analogized this to a user fee on those who use tobacco \nproducts.\n  We think this excise tax is justified. In 1955, a package of \ncigarettes cost about 23 cents. Of that amount, 8 cents consisted of a \nFederal excise tax on the cigarettes.\n  Today, a package of cigarettes costs almost $2, at least $1.82 in \nmost States, but we have only a 24-cent Federal excise tax on the \nutilization of those cigarettes.\n  We think this provision is also justified from a public health \nperspective.\n  Smoking is the largest preventable cause of premature death in the \nUnited States.\n  Thirty percent of all cancer patients develop their diseases from \nsmoking. Almost all lung cancer comes from smoking. And much of the \ncardiovascular disease that we have in our society comes from smoking--\nincluding passive smoking as well.\n  It should be no secret to my colleagues that it was a difficult \ndecision for me to submit a bill which will increase taxes, but after \nconsiderable study I concluded in this case it is a just and a right \nthing to do.\n  And if we increase the cigarette tax by 43 cents, we will still be \nbelow the percentage the excise tax was back in 1955 when a package of \ncigarettes cost 23 cents and the excise tax was 8 cents of that.\n  It is important to note that two-thirds of the revenue raised from \nthis bill over the next 5 years will be used for the new child health \ninsurance. The States will be able to negotiate with private health \ninsurance companies to provide coverage, and they will be able to \nutilize the community health centers which are giving low-cost but \nhigh-quality health care in America today.\n\n  I am one of the strongest advocate for community health centers, and, \nI must say, they have done a superlative job of delivering health care \nin general in our society.\n  In Utah, we have what is known as the Caring Foundation. For every \ndollar we raise in charity, Blue Cross/Blue Shield matches that dollar \nwith $1, making $2 for child health insurance. I believe that can be \nduplicated across this country in the best interest of children and \nfamilies.\n  When someone inquires about why I am sponsoring the CHILD Act, my \nthoughts turn to scores of constituents who have brought their concerns \nabout the cost and availability of health insurance to my attention.\n  It is heart rending to me when I have uninsured families come into my \noffice--many of whom are young and who have children. These families \nare frantic; they don't know where to turn when a child gets sick.\n  Two young women from Provo in my home State came in to visit me \nrecently. Both had six children. They both work part time. Their \nhusbands work full time, but neither family makes more than $20,000 a \nyear. They are hard-working people. They are the working people of our \nsociety who are the poorest of the poor not on Medicaid, who cannot \nafford health insurance and, frankly, who do not know where to turn.\n  I think that it behooves us to solve this problem for them, and the \nbest way to do it is with a straight block grant to the States.\n  The grant approach has a lot of benefits. There should be minimal new \nbureaucracy, because the IRS already collects excise taxes on \ncigarettes. There should be minimal bureaucracy because HHS will \ndistribute the funds based on a simple formula reflecting the number of \nuninsured in a State.\n  We provide a safeguard so there is no incentive for businesses to \ndrop the lower paid people off their health insurance. In this bill, if \na company wishes to drop any employee from the company health plan, \nthen they will have to drop all their employees, from the top \nexecutives on down.\n  We are trying to help those who cannot help themselves, which I think \nis the most conservative thing we can do in this society. We are not \ntrying to help those who can help themselves but refuse to. People who \ncan help themselves ought to help themselves.\n  What I am saying, Mr. President, is that it is time. It is time for \nthis Congress to get down to business.\n  Mr. President, it is time.\n  It is time for us to get down to business.\n  It is time for the Congress to focus on how to make a great country \ngreater on how to set aside partisan differences and help the people we \nwere elected to help.\n  It is time to focus on what truly needs to be done in this country \nnot on deadlock or gridlock or shutdown.\n  It is time to wake up and realize that--in this great land of \nincredible riches and abundance--in the greatest country of the world--\nthere are still children being left behind.\n  Who cannot be disturbed, even frightened, by the statistics?\n  Drug use among our young people is dramatically on the rise. In its \nninth annual survey of students in grades 6-12, the National Parents' \nResource Institute for Drug Education [PRIDE] reported that annual use \nof most drugs was at the highest level since the survey began 10 years \nago. Record use was reported for cigarettes, marijuana, cocaine, \nuppers, downers, inhalants, and hallucinogens.\n  Serious questions have been raised about our children's ability to \nlearn. Our children rank pitifully behind other countries in \neducational scores. One survey of international test scores for math \nand science, found Americans to rank dead last and South Koreans \nranking the best. And, who could not be disturbed by this? A 1991 \nNational Assessment of Education Progress survey, revealed that only 5 \npercent of high school seniors demonstrated enough understanding of \ngeometry and algebra to be prepared for college-level math.\n  Violence is rapidly becoming a way of life for today's children. Over \nthe past decade, the rate of homicide committed by teenagers aged 14-17 \nhas more than doubled, increasing 172 percent from 1985 to 1994. In \nfact, 35 percent of all violent crime is committed by offenders less \nthan 20 years of age.\n  And here's another astounding fact. Two years ago, a survey of 1,000 \nteachers showed that 11 percent had been assaulted in school. Teachers \nhave been robbed, vandalized, slashed by razors, physically assaulted, \nshot, and set on fire in the schools. What kind of learning environment \nis that for our children?\n  And, let's look at child health. How many Senators are aware that \nalmost one out of three children have no health insurance?\n  Ten million children have no health insurance at all. That is more \nchildren than the entire populations of Maine,\n\n[[Page S2848]]\n\nRhode Island, Alaska, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Montana, Nebraska, \nSouth Dakota, and Vermont--10 States--combined.\n  Did anyone know this? Over 500,000 American infants are uninsured, \ninfants who need such critical services as immunizations to grow up \nhealthy.\n  Mr. President, these are astounding statistics. Terrifying predictors \nof our world as we head into the 21st century.\n  And I, for one, am going to put my foot down. I will do everything I \ncan to reverse this trend.\n  I challenge each Senator in this body to work with me on what must be \nthe top agenda item for the 105th Congress: Making this world a better \nplace for our children.\n  I will make this a top priority in the Judiciary Committee.\n  We will look at such issues as the Federal Gang Violence Act, \nviolence in the schools, and, importantly, a strong national antidrug \nabuse strategy.\n  Already the committee has approved--only to suffer the most narrow of \ndefeats on the floor--the Balanced Budget Act, passage of which is \nperhaps the most important legacy we can leave for our children, each \nof whom is born saddled with $20,000 in debt.\n  And I hope other committees will be working as well.\n  For no effort to improve this world for our children can be complete \nwithout measures to improve their ability to grow up healthy.\n  That is why I have united with my good friend and sometimes \nadversary, Senator Kennedy, to draft the bill we are introducing today: \nthe Child Health Insurance and Lower Deficit Act. We call it the CHILD \nbill. The CHILD bill will be accompanied by additional legislation we \nalso introduce today which provides the funding offset for the CHILD \nProgram through an increase in the tobacco excise tax.\n\n  Introduction today of S. 525, and the companion bill to increase the \ntobacco excise tax, completes 3 months of intense negotiations between \nmyself and Senator Kennedy.\n  Our discussions were sometimes heated, sometimes acrimonious, but \nalways well intentioned. They have resulted in a bill, the adoption of \nwhich I think will make this country a better place.\n  And so, today, Senator Kennedy and I have found a solid center--we \nhave compromised from the left and from the right. We are doing this to \nhelp the 10 million children in the United States who are without \nhealth insurance. We are doing it because it is the right thing to do.\n  The child health insurance and services bill Senator Kennedy and I \nwill introduce today is targeted to the near poor, primarily working \nfamilies, who are not covered by existing Government programs. Two-\nthirds of the uninsured children come from low-income working families \nwith annual incomes of $25,000 or less; 86 percent are from families \nwhere at least one parent is employed.\n  I think any honest examination of this would show that these \nstatistics are deplorable. Children are our most precious natural \nresource. If we had a vote on that today, it would pass 100 to 0. And \nif you agree on that, the next step is simple. I can't think of a more \nappropriate role for the Federal Government than helping the most \nvulnerable in our society. It has become a cliche, but children are our \nfuture.\n  Already I have taken criticism for this bill and for uniting with a \nDemocrat to sponsor the CHILD Act. It is true that Senator Kennedy and \nI represent the most divergent philosophies in the U.S. Congress. It is \nfor that very reason we are proposing S. 525 today. United, we can \nprovide the basis for a consensus position we hope all our colleagues \nwill endorse.\n  It is true that Senator Kennedy and I do not often agree on public \npolicy. I can't even count the number of times I have stood on this \nfloor to oppose--even filibuster--legislation he has sponsored. But \nwith respect to health care--when it comes to helping people--we both \nhave a strong commitment to doing the right thing regardless of \npolitics. And this legislation is the right thing to do.\n  Joining Senator Kennedy and me today in cosponsorship of the CHILD \nbill, S. 525, are 19 Senators, for a total of 21. Those Senators are: \nSnowe, Kerry, Jeffords, Dodd, Stevens, Rockefeller, Bennett, Daschle, \nCollins, Wellstone, Smith (OR), Bingaman, Campbell, Murray, Reed, \nBoxer, Lautenberg, Durbin, and Reid.\n  Joining us in cosponsorship of the tobacco tax bill, S. 525, are \nSenators Bennett, Bingaman, Boxer, Dodd, Durbin, Jeffords, Kerry, \nLautenberg, Murray, Reed, Reid, Rockefeller, Snowe, and Wellstone.\n  What are the major features of the CHILD bill?\n  Our proposal sets up a voluntary State grant program--I repeat, \nvoluntary State grant program. The funds will be used by States to \nsubsidize the cost, or part of the cost, of private health insurance \nfor needy children. States will also be able to use Community and \nMigrant Health Centers to provide services directly to children.\n  We hope our program will be a catalyst to improve health care for \nkids. It is a Federal/State/private partnership. Any State that wishes \nto participate must contribute to the program. States may require \nindividuals or their employers to contribute as well.\n  We have designed an approach which we believe is fiscally \nresponsible. The bill authorizes program expenditures for each of 5 \nyears, and it is fully financed with a 43-cent increase in tobacco \nexcise taxes. Two-thirds of the revenues will be used for program \nservices, and one-third for deficit reduction.\n  In drafting S. 525, we have worked very hard to make certain that no \nlarge, new bureaucracy will be needed to implement the CHILD Program. \nThe idea of a huge new Federal involvement in health care frightens \nmost Americans, as was so amply evidenced by the resounding defeat of \nthe Clinton health care bill in 1994.\n  I was one of the loudest objectors to that legislation as a member of \nboth the Finance and Labor Committees at the time it was considered. I \nwant to assure my colleagues that we are not replicating that exercise \nhere today.\n  HHS will disburse the grant money according to existing Medicaid \nformulas and the number of uninsured children in the State. The \nTreasury Department already collects an excise tax.\n  The States will set eligibility levels, which presumably they could \ndo very easily based on their experiences with Medicaid and other State \nprograms to help the poor and near poor. The States will use their \ncurrent Medicaid benefits packages to negotiate contracts for insurance \ncoverage. These are not complex calculations. They should be easily \nachievable.\n  We also worked very hard to allay any concerns that we were \nestablishing a new entitlement program.\n  We are not.\n  The bill does not establish any individual entitlement to benefits. \nIt is a 5-year authorization which is fully funded. It is not like \nMedicare where we guarantee we will pay for the services of every \neligible beneficiary. It is not like Medicaid where we pay an open-\nended amount, which is appropriated annually.\n  What we are really talking about doing with this bill is finding \ncost-effective ways to get quality health care services to children. \nOur bill recognizes and strengthens the important role that community, \nmigrant and homeless centers play in caring for the Nation's uninsured \nchildren and their families. Community and rural health centers already \nexist. We are not creating them or remaking them in this bill.\n  They are located in medically underserved communities where many \nuninsured children live. Over 940 health centers in every State serve \none out of six low-income American children, over 4.5 million children. \nThey are currently the family doctor for one out of seven uninsured \nchildren, totaling 1.3 million children. Last year, health center \nprofessionals delivered one of every 10 babies born in the United \nStates, and one out of every five low income babies. They are experts \nin providing quality, comprehensive primary and preventive care to \nuninsured children--the very type of care we are trying to get to \nchildren with this bill.\n  Our bill permits these children to continue to choose health centers \nas their primary care provider and to make the choice of a health \ncenter available to other uninsured children. In each area currently \nserved by a health center, a direct service option will be available to \nchildren who are served by a health center. Families choosing the \ndirect service option will\n\n[[Page S2849]]\n\nget the same comprehensive Medicaid package of services as do those who \nopt for a children's policy. Under the direct service option, children \nwill receive their primary and preventive care at the health center \nthey select and will receive specialty and inpatient care through \nnetworks of providers certified by the State or through a wrap-around \ninsurance policy.\n  We believe that the direct service option will be as cost effective \nas an insurance policy and may even be less expensive. Several studies \nwhich compared the total annual cost of health care for Medicaid \npatients served by health centers--including primary and specialty care \nand inpatient care--to the total annual cost of care for Medicaid \npatients served by other types of providers--including health \nmaintenance organizations and private physicians--found that health \ncenter care was the least expensive.\n  The reason? Health centers prevent illness because of the primary and \npreventive care they provide. Based on these studies, the cost of all \ncare--primary, specialty, and inpatient--under the direct service \noption is expected to be lower than the cost for a child cared for by \nanother type of provider.\n\n  As the chief sponsor of the balanced budget amendment, I could not \nsupport the creation of any new entitlement program.\n  Indeed, I believe this proposal is fully consistent with the BBA. \nFirst, our bill is fully financed by the proposed tobacco products tax. \nSecond, for every $2 of program cost the Hatch-Kennedy bill dedicates \n$1 to deficit reduction.\n  When all is said and done, this bill would help to bring the budget \nin balance--which I believe will be nearly as essential to children in \nthe long-run as necessary health care is in the short-run.\n  Let me underscore that the net cost to the Federal Government of the \nCHILD Act is zero, because it is fully funded. In fact, the bill \nliterally saves money, because it provides at least $10 billion in \nfunds for deficit reduction over the next 5 years.\n  We cap Federal expenditures at $20 billion over 5 years for services, \nwith $10 billion for deficit reduction. Over the 5-year period, the \nratio of services to deficit reduction will be 2 to 1.\n  For services, we will provide the following amounts: 1998: $3 \nbillion, 1999: $3 billion, 2000: $4 billion, 2001: $5 billion, 2002: $5 \nbillion.\n  For deficit reduction, we provide the following amounts: 1998: $3 \nbillion, 1999: $3 billion, 2000: $2 billion, 2001: $1 billion, and \n2002: $1 billion.\n  Let me make perfectly clear that the size of this program is capped \neach year. In fact, if not enough revenue is generated, then the size \nof the program will be lowered accordingly.\n  Let me take a moment to address other potential concerns about this \nbill.\n  Many have asked why we need a new program. Indeed, we have the \nMedicaid Program, which helps the poorest of the poor. Even so, there \nare 10 million children without coverage. In fact, 3 million uninsured \nchildren are eligible for Medicaid, but are not enrolled.\n  There is no program for the remaining 7 million children, most of \nwhom come from near poor families. Those families are faced with two \nvery unattractive options: a choice between dropping out of the labor \nforce in order to get Medicaid eligibility, or keeping their jobs with \nno health care coverage at all.\n  It might be logical to assume that Medicaid would provide the basis \nfor a program to increase child health coverage. And we did examine \nthat idea. But, Medicaid is an open-ended entitlement--and an expensive \none at that. Both the States and the Federal Government are seriously \nconcerned about the runaway costs of Medicaid.\n  In contrast, our capped program is not an entitlement. It is a \ntargeted approach which allows States considerable flexibility in \ndesign and administration.\n  Others have suggested that we use a tax-based approach. I would be \nwilling to consider a tax credit approach, if we could design one that \nreally works. But I foresee two problems in developing such an \napproach.\n  The first is that a tax credit could really amount to an open-ended \nentitlement, whereas the size of our program is capped each year. The \nsecond is that poor and near-poor families, who we are trying to help \nwith this bill, simply cannot afford to buy insurance coverage during \nthe year, and wait until the next April to get the money back.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I want to respond to two other \nconcerns.\n  First, I must emphasize that S. 525 is not the Kerry-Kennedy bill \nfrom last year, S. 2186. It is a new proposal that Senator Kennedy and \nI wrote together. Senator Kennedy and I have both moved considerable \ndistances to write this compromise legislation.\n\n  This bill is not an open-ended, permanent entitlement; it is a capped \n5-year program, run by the States and, as such, is very similar to a \nproposal former House Republican Leader Bob Michel authored in 1995.\n  Second is the assertion that this bill is part of the Clinton agenda \non health care. If helping the needy is crime, then I plead guilty. But \nI hope I have convinced those here today that there is a big difference \nbetween Clintoncare and the Hatch-Kennedy bill.\n  Indeed, I am aware that some believe there is a hidden Clinton agenda \nto enact health care reform piece by piece, starting with kids care.\n  I think that is a red herring. This argument suggests to me that we \nshould never do anything worthwhile because of the possibility that it \nmay evolve into something bad. I agree that we do not want the huge \nClinton health care mandate proposed and debated during the 103d \nCongress. But, this bill is not that bill--it is not even a look-alike \nbill.\n  I have tried to design a Reaganesque block grant tailored to meet a \nspecific problem with a wide degree of flexibility for the States. \nUnlike the Clinton program, the CHILD Act is focused. It is fully \nfinanced; it does not establish a new Federal bureaucracy; and it does \nnot create any new entitlements. There are no price controls and no \nregional alliances and no global budgets.\n  Another difference is that we are trying to make this a bipartisan \napproach right from the beginning. We have the wisdom of that national \ndebate 2 years ago and are far wiser for it.\n  Let me next turn to the issue of the tobacco tax as a source of \nrevenue for the Children's Health Insurance and Lower Deficit Act. \nThere can be no doubt that smoking and tobacco use is a major public \nhealth problem. By any measure, it is also costly.\n  Smoking is our Nation's No. 1 preventable health threat. There are \nabout 48 million Americans who smoke. About 2 million Americans use \nother tobacco products like chewing tobacco.\n  Consider these facts.\n  Tobacco kills an estimated 419,000 Americans each year.\n  An additional 2.5 million more people throughout the world die from \nsmoking each year.\n  Smoking accounts for about 1 in 5 deaths in the United States.\n  Tobacco accounts for more deaths than homicide, car and airplane \naccidents, alcohol, heroin, crack, and AIDS--combined. In fact, \ncigarettes are also a major cause of fire fatalities in the United \nStates. In 1990, cigarettes were responsible for about one-quarter of \nall deaths associated with residential fires; this represented over \n1,000 deaths.\n  Each day nearly 3,000 young Americans become regular smokers. \nEventually, 1,000 will die early from tobacco-related diseases.\n  Unfortunately, cigarette smoking is on the rise among the young: \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], the \nnumber of high school students reporting that they smoked in the last \nmonth rose about one-third between 1991 and 1995, from 27.5 percent in \n1991 to 34.8 percent in 1995.\n  Among black high school age males the jump in smoking was even more \nalarming, doubling from 14 percent in 1991 to 28 in 1995.\n  About 8 in 10 smokers begin to use tobacco before age 18 and about \none-half of all smokers started at age 14 or earlier.\n  In 1964, Surgeon General Luther Terry reported that smoking causes \nlung cancer in men.\n  In 1988, the Surgeon General C. Everett Koop reported that smoking \nwas an addictive behavior--the same as for heroin or cocaine.\n  Each year, the estimated 1 million youngsters who become smokers add\n\n[[Page S2850]]\n\nabout $9 to $10 billion to the Nation's health care costs over their \nlifetimes.\n  According to a 1994 CDC report, tobacco cost an estimated $50 billion \nin direct health care costs in 1993. Of this total, CDC estimated that \n$26.9 billion went for hospital expenditures, $15.5 billion for \nphysician expenditures, $4.9 billion for nursing home expenditures, \n$1.8 billion for prescription drugs, and $900 million for home health \ncare expenditures.\n\n  The 1994 CDC report notes: ``The findings in this report indicate \nthat cigarette smoking accounts for a substantial and preventable \nportion of all medical-care costs in the United States.''\n  According to CDC projections, in 1993 approximately 24 billion \npackages of cigarettes were sold in the United States and for each of \nthese packages about $2.06 was spent on medical care attributable to \nsmoking. Of this $2.06 per pack estimated societal medical care cost, \nCDC estimated that $0.89 was paid through public sources.\n  The CDC study estimated that there was a twofold increase in \nestimated direct medical care costs attributable to smoking between \n1987 and 1993.\n  Extrapolating the 1987 survey data reported by CDC, it can be \nestimated that, in 1993, about $10 billion in Medicare costs and $5 \nbillion in Medicaid costs were attributable to smoking.\n  It has been estimated that smoking cost $4.75 billion to other \nFederal health care programs, $1.6 billion to other State health \nprograms, and over $16.7 billion in higher premiums paid to private \nhealth insurance companies.\n  In addition to the direct cost of about $50 billion annually, experts \nagree that a similar amount of costs are borne by society through lost \nproductivity--that is, the foregone earnings of those dying \nprematurely.\n  Researchers at the University of California at San Francisco, Drs. \nWendy Max and Dorothy Rice, estimate that the 1993 mortality costs due \nto smoking were $47 billion.\n  Overall, smoking costs society over $100 billion annually. This is \nsimply too high a price to pay.\n  It is estimated by the Joint Tax Committee that a 43 cent per pack \nincrease in the cigarette tax, coupled with proportionate tax increases \nfor other tobacco products, would yield about $6 billion in new \nrevenues.\n  Another point that I want to make today is that the tobacco tax \nsimply has not kept up with inflation. As a matter of fact, the \nrelative component of the price of cigarettes devoted toward taxes has \nslipped over the last three decades and, even with the increase we \npropose today, will actually be lower proportionately once this bill is \nenacted than it was in 1964 when Surgeon General Luther Terry reported \nthat smoking causes cancer.\n  In 1964, the average total price of a pack of cigarettes was about \n30.5 cents per pack. Of this total, 8 cents went to pay the Federal tax \nand another 8.5 cents per pack were levied in State cigarette and sales \ntax. In sum, in 1964, about 50.5 percent of the cost of a pack of \ncigarettes went to taxes.\n  Currently, the average price per pack of cigarettes is about $1.94. \nOf this total, 24 cents represents the Federal tax and an additional \n31.7 cents per pack is levied by the States together with an additional \n9.3 cents per pack in sales taxes. All in all, the share of the per \npack price of cigarettes devoted to taxes has dropped to about 33.5 \npercent today from the 1964 level of 50.5 percent.\n  If the CHILD Act were signed into law and the new 43 cents per pack \ntax were added, and if this new tax were passed on directly to the \nconsumer to increase the per pack price to $2.37 per pack, the share of \nthe total price devoted to taxes--45.6 percent--would still be lower \nthan it was in 1964.\n  Even when this new tax is factored in, the United States would still \nhave a relatively modest tax component built into the price of \ncigarettes compared with other industrialized countries. For example, \nin Canada 64 percent of the price of cigarettes is devoted to taxes. In \nGreat Britain, the comparable figure is 82 percent.\n  As a conservative, I am generally opposed to tax increases. I firmly \nbelieve that the Federal Government should spend less, and the American \npeople should keep more of the money that is earned in our economy.\n\n  As a conservative, I believe in a balanced budget. That is why I \nspent the better part of February managing the floor debate for the \nbalanced-budget amendment. That is why I worked hard to convince \nSenator Kennedy to earmark one-third of the revenues raised by the \nproposed increase in the cigarette tax for deficit reduction.\n  Yet, the statistics about tobacco use and cost that I cited above, I \nbelieve, make the case that tobacco products are imposing external \ncosts onto society that are not adequately reflected in the price of \nthese inherently dangerous products. Simply stated, the producers and \nconsumers of tobacco products are not paying the full costs of this \nproduct.\n  When I balance the opportunity that we have in terms of helping to \nprovide health insurance and services to children, coupled with a \nsignificant deficit reduction component, against my natural aversion to \nraising taxes, I come down in favor of this financing mechanism with \nthis tobacco tax--or, as I call it, a user fee. I believe that both the \npublic health and economics reasons are unique and compelling.\n  I believe that when my colleagues in Congress have the opportunity to \nfully consider these issues that they will agree with the cosponsors of \nthis legislation and support the CHILD Act.\n  In closing, Mr. President, let me state my intention to work with all \ninterested parties to improve this bill as it moves through the \nlegislative process.\n  Indeed, as I have stated, there are some provisions contained within \nthis bill that I believe could be improved through a thorough public \ndiscussion.\n  In particular, I would like to hear from the Governors about how this \nbill meets their needs with respect to the uninsured population.\n  I am aware that they may have a few concerns about the bill, such as \nusing the Medicaid benefits package as the model for the private \ninsurance contracts.\n  Senator Kennedy and I inserted that provision in the bill for two \nreasons. We knew that the Governors would be familiar with it and, most \nimportantly, it would obviate the need at either the Federal or State \nlevels to undertake the onerous task of creating a benefits package.\n  Our Utah Governor, Mike Leavitt, has stated on more than one occasion \nthat he believes the Medicaid benefit package is too ``rich;'' in other \nwords, a more efficient package would be less costly and still provide \nneeded care. I look forward to working with him and the leaders of \nother States to address this issue.\n  Another issue of critical concern is the interrelationship of this \nprogram with the employer community. We were very careful to design a \nprogram that would complement existing employer efforts to insure their \nemployees without a costly Federal mandate. On the other hand, though, \nwe wanted to make sure that there was no incentive for employers to \n``dump'' employees into the new program in order to relieve themselves \nof a benefit cost.\n  That is why we inserted a provision that states that any employer who \nmakes health insurance contributions for an employee cannot vary such \ncontributions based on an individual's eligibility under the CHILD Act. \nThe only way an employer could put a currently insured employee into \nthe CHILD program would be to eliminate coverage for all employees in \nthe company plan. We think this is highly unlikely to happen.\n  Again, let me state that we were very sensitive to the concerns about \na mandate on employers, and we look forward to a very careful \nexamination of this issue as the legislation progresses.\n  Let me also discuss for a moment the issue that Senator Lott has \nalready mentioned, that of making certain that the 3 million children \nwho are currently eligible for Medicaid, but not participating, become \nenrolled. While our bill does not address that issue, it is something \nwe need to do. I hope to work with Senator Jeffords and Senator DeWine \nwho have indicated in interest to me in working to make certain that \nthose who are eligible for Medicaid can participate.\n  But let me hasten to add that only 3 million out of the 10 million \nuninsured children are eligible for Medicaid. So, Senator Lott's idea--\nwhich is a good one--would still leave 70 percent of the problem \nuntouched.\n  Mr. President, in closing I want to reiterate my commitment to \nworking\n\n[[Page S2851]]\n\nwith Senator Kennedy and all 98 of my other colleagues to enact a bill \nthis year which will improve child health insurance coverage in the \nUnited States.\n  It is time, and I hope the majority of this body will agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous unanimous-consent request, \nthe 15 minutes allocated to the Senator from Utah has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will my friend yield me 30 seconds?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Sure.\n  Mr. HATCH. I want to compliment my friend for the remaining 30 \nseconds. I wish I could spend more time.\n  Development of these bills has not been an easy thing for him to do, \nor for me. But I am convinced we have drafted a program that will work.\n  I have to suggest that if Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch--who have \nsuch widespread differences of philosophy--can unite to propose a \nprogram like this, then anybody can get together. Despite our \nphilosophical differences, which are wide, we both have a great deal of \nfriendship and caring for each other. We are working as hard as we can \nto do what is right here.\n  I want to thank my colleague for his great work in this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Hatch for his \nleadership on this important issue affecting our Nation's children.\n  Those of us in the Senate have noted that Senator Hatch was \ninstrumental a number of years ago, working with Senator Dodd and \nmyself, on the child care block grant program, which still is in \nexistence. It has been evaluated as an extremely effective program for \nproviding child care for the working poor.\n  A number of years ago we also worked closely together in the summer \njobs initiative that included continuing education programs.\n  In the area of children, I think Senator Hatch and I as well as many \nothers understand that this is neither a Democratic issue nor a \nRepublican issue. Nor is it a North or South issue. It is an American \nfamily issue.\n  For every American family children come first, as well they should. \nThey are our greatest asset and they represent our Nation's future. \nWhen we invest in our children, we are investing in America's future. \nThat is why this effort is of such importance and why Senator Hatch and \nI are now working closely together to make sure that this legislation \nbecomes law.\n  Mr. President, it is reasonable to ask, why now? Why children?\n  The fact of the matter is 3,000 children every single day lose their \nhealth insurance. Nine out of ten of those who are losing their health \ninsurance in this country are children.\n  The number of uninsured children is growing. It will rise to 5 \nmillion by the year 2000, making it increasingly urgent that we address \nthe fact that more and more children are becoming uninsured.\n  We are talking about the sons and daughters of working families--\nfamilies that are working 52 weeks of the year, 40 hours a week, trying \nto make ends meet and play by the rules. One of the things they are \nunable to do is provide health care coverage for their children.\n  Their children require this coverage, which is why Senator Hatch and \nI and many others want to make health insurance accessible and \naffordable for all of America's children. We know the number of \nchildren who have ear infections and never see a primary care doctor. \nWe know the number of children who are in school at this very hour and \nhave difficulty seeing the blackboard or reading a book and are \nhumiliated in their classroom because they have not had their eyes \ntested.\n  This crisis is occuring all over the country. It is happening in \nurban areas and in rural communities. But we can do something about it, \nand that is why the legislation is of such importance.\n  Ten million children are uninsured. Their parents are working hard \ntrying to make ends meet, and the one thing they cannot afford are the \npremiums to provide health care coverage for their children.\n  As Senator Hatch has pointed out, our legislation will build on \nexisting programs in the States, and the States by and large are \noverwhelmingly using the voucher system. I know there are those who \nfavor a tax credit program, but it has been tried and did not work in \nthe past.\n  We are also building on the private sector because the insurance that \nwill be provided and distributed is going to be as a result of \ncompetition in the States.\n  Finally, we are paying for the program with a 43-cents-per-pack \nincrease in the Federal tobacco tax.\n  Some say, isn't this unfair and unjustified? We say that tobacco \ncosts the Nation $50 billion a year in direct medical costs--$50 \nbillion a year. By adding 43 cents on a pack of cigarettes, we will \nhave even less than the proportion of tax--Federal, State, and sales \ntax--for a pack of cigarettes than we had in the early 1960's.\n  When we look at where we are in comparison to where other countries \naround the world--our cigarette taxes are well below every other \nindustrial country in the world. With our 43-cents-per-pack increase in \nthe Federal cigarette tax, it will still be among the lowest of all \nindustrial nations.\n  Mr. President, we strongly support this increase in the cigarette tax \nbecause it can do more to stop children from smoking than any other \naction we could possibly undertake. This will have a dramatic impact on \nreducing addiction among teenagers, who have less income than adults to \nspend on cigarettes. That is when the smoking really starts and where \nthe child becomes addicted.\n  We say that not only because that has been the history of pricing \nover the period of the last 30 years, but it is there in the documents \nand statements of the tobacco companies as we have seen in the Liggett \nstory recently.\n  Mr. President, this is legislation which the American people support. \nIt makes sense from a health point of view. It makes sense from their \nfamily point of view. It makes sense for the future in terms of having \nchildren who are going to have good quality health care. It makes sense \nbecause it will save the lives of over 800,000 children who would \notherwise have died from a smoking-caused illness. And it will also \nprovide a modest reduction in terms of the deficit.\n  This is a win-win-win for the American people. It should be a \nbipartisan effort. I want to commend Senator Hatch for his leadership \nand I thank all of our Democratic colleagues for joining in our \nefforts.\n  I am honored to join Senator Hatch in introducing the Child Health \nInsurance and Lower Deficit Act of 1997, which will be a major step \ntoward making health insurance accessible and affordable for all of \nAmerica's children. I am hopeful that the legislation we are \nintroducing today will be approved by this Congress, and signed by \nPresident Clinton. It shows that Democrats and Republicans can work \ntogether to solve this national problem.\n  One of the most urgent needs of children is health insurance \ncoverage. Insurance is the best possible ticket to adequate health \ncare--and every child deserves such care.\n  Today, however, more than 10 million children have no health \ninsurance--1 child in every 7--and the number has been increasing in \nrecent years. Every day, 3,000 more children lose their private health \ninsurance. If the total continues to rise at the current rate, 13 \nmillion children will have no insurance coverage by the year 2000.\n  Almost 90 percent of these uninsured children are members of working \nfamilies. Two-thirds are in two-parent families. Most of these families \nhave incomes above the Medicaid eligibility line, but well below the \nincome level it takes to afford private health insurance today.\n  The children's health care crisis begins at the beginning--with \ninadequate prenatal care. Some 17 industrial countries have lower \ninfant mortality rates than the United States. Every day, 636 infants \nare born to mothers in this country who did not have proper prenatal \ncare; 56 die before they are 1 month old. And 110 die before the age of \n1. Many more grow up with permanent disabilities that could have been \navoided with prenatal care. Uninsured pregnant mothers have sicker \nbabies, and these babies are at greater risk--low birth weight, \nmiscarriage, and infant mortality.\n  Too many young children are not receiving the preventive medical care \nthey need. Uninsured children are twice as likely to go without medical \ncare for conditions such as asthma,\n\n[[Page S2852]]\n\nsore throats, ear infections, and injuries. One child in four is not \nreceiving basic childhood vaccines on a timely basis. Periodic physical \nexaminations are out of reach for millions of children, even though \nsuch exams can identify and correct conditions before they cause a \nlifetime of pain and disability.\n  Preventive care is the key to a healthy childhood, and it also is a \ncost-effective investment for society. Every dollar invested in \nchildhood immunizations saves $10 in later hospital and other treatment \ncosts.\n  Some say there is no health care crisis for children. But I reply, \ntell that to the hard-working parents who cannot afford coverage for \ntheir families or whose employers won't provide it.\n  Tell it to the hospital emergency room physicians who are often the \nonly family doctor these children know, and who have to treat them for \nheart-breaking conditions that could have been prevented or easily \ncured with timely care.\n  Tell it to school teachers struggling to teach children too sick to \nlearn. Tell it to children's advocates across the country, who see \nchildren every day with health care needs neglected for too long. \nBetween 30 and 40 percent of children in the child protective system \nsuffer from significant health problems.\n  For all these reasons and many more--10 million more--the children's \nhealth care crisis is real, and the time to address it is now. Every \nchild deserves a healthy start in life. No family should have to fear \nthat the loss of a job, or an employer's decision to drop coverage or \nhike the insurance premium will leave their children without health \ncare.\n  The current neglect is all the more unconscionable, because children \nand adolescents are so inexpensive to cover. That is why we can and \nmust cover them this year--in this Congress. The cost is affordable--\nand the benefits for children are undeniable.\n  The legislation that Senator Hatch and I are introducing will make \nhealth insurance coverage more affordable for every working family with \nuninsured children. It does so without imposing new Government \nmandates. It encourages family responsibility, by offering parents the \nhelp they need to purchase affordable health insurance for their \nchildren.\n  Under our plan, $20 billion over the next 5 years will be available \nto expand health insurance coverage for children, and $10 billion will \nbe available for deficit reduction. I share Senator Hatch's commitment \nto balancing the Federal budget by the year 2002. As our plan today \nsuggests, we believe we can do it, and do it fairly.\n  When fully phased in, our legislation will provide direct financial \nassistance to approximately 5 million children annually. Every family \nwith an uninsured child will have access to more affordable coverage. \nCombined with efforts to enroll more eligible children in Medicaid, \nthis plan is a giant step toward the day when every American child has \nhealth insurance coverage. This bill is the most important single step \nthe Congress can take this year to provide a better life for every \nAmerican child.\n  States choosing to participate in the program will contract with \nprivate insurers to provide child-only private coverage. These \nsubsidies will be available to help eligible families purchase coverage \nfor their children, or participate in employment-based health plans. \nCoverage will be available for every child, including children in \nfamilies not eligible for financial assistance. The program also allows \nStates to allocate up to 5 percent of total program costs to provide \npreventive care and primary care to pregnant women. Participating \nStates must contribute to the cost of the program, and must maintain \ntheir current levels of Medicaid coverage for children.\n  The basic principles of this proposal are neither novel nor untested. \nFourteen States already have similar programs for children. In \nMassachusetts, an existing program was expanded last year, so that \nfamilies up to 400 percent of the poverty level are now eligible for \nfinancial assistance to buy insurance. In 17 additional States, Blue \nCross/Blue Shield offers children's-only coverage, with subsidies for \nlow-income families. These State initiatives provide a solid base on \nwhich to build an effective Federal-State-private partnership to get \nthe job done for all children.\n  Senator Hatch and I propose to pay for this program of children's \nhealth insurance and deficit reduction with an increase of 43 cents a \npack in the Federal cigarette tax, from its current level of 24 cents. \nIt makes sense to finance the coverage this way, because of the higher \ncosts for health care and premature deaths caused by smoking.\n  Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the United \nStates. It kills more than 400,000 Americans a year. It costs the \nNation $50 billion a year in direct health costs, and another $50 \nbillion in lost productivity. A cigarette pack sold for $1.80 costs the \nNation $3.90 cents in smoking-related expenses.\n  Even with our proposed increase, cigarette taxes as a percent of the \nproduct price will still be lower than they were in 1965 and will be \nfar below the levels in almost every other industrialized country.\n  A higher cigarette tax will have the added benefit of reducing \nsmoking among teenagers. If we do nothing to reduce such smoking, 5 \nmillion deaths from smoking-related diseases will occur over the \nlifetime of the current generation of children.\n  Raising tobacco taxes to finance health insurance for children has \nthe support of an overwhelming 73 percent of the public. If the tobacco \ntax is raised, an even higher 87 percent support using the revenue to \nexpand health services for children.\n  I look forward to early action by Congress on this issue. Every day \nwe delay means more children fail to get the healthy start in life they \nneed. When we fail our children, we also fail our country and its \nfuture.\n  I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Connecticut, Senator \nDodd.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me thank my colleague from Massachusetts \nfor yielding.\n  Let me begin these brief remarks by commending him and, of course, \nour good friend and colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, who is the lead \nsponsor of this legislation, for his efforts here, along with our \ncolleague from Massachusetts who historically, of course, has taken the \nleadership role over the last number of decades on health-care-related \nissues.\n  Our colleague from Utah and I have had the pleasure and privilege of \nworking together on major legislation. When he says, if you have a bill \nwith Orrin Hatch's name on it, there is a good chance it is going to \nbecome law, I can testify to that, having worked with him on the act \nfor better child care. Today millions of people have accidental health \ncare and decent child care because of his efforts. So I commend, Mr. \nPresident, both of our colleagues.\n  I offered the first child health care package almost 4 years ago to \ndeal with children's health. As both of our colleagues have pointed \nout, Mr. President, we have about 10 to 10.5 million children in the \ncountry who do not have any health care at all. In my State of \nConnecticut, about 110,000 children are without any health care \ncoverage at all.\n  What makes this so ironic in many ways, Mr. President--as we have \ngone through a debate on welfare reform fairly recently--is that 88 \npercent of the parents of these children without health care are \nworking. The assumption I think a lot of people must have is that \nchildren without health care are the children of parents who are living \non public assistance. Nothing could be further from the truth. If you \nare on public assistance, you get health care, you get Medicaid. If you \nare out of work on welfare, you get Medicaid. If you are in jail, you \nget health care in this country. But God help you if you are a working \nfamily out there working at the lower income levels trying to provide \nfor your family when we have a seen a dramatic increase in the \nreduction of private health care coverage.\n  Mr. President, I asked for a General Accounting Office study a number \nof months ago, the results of which came back about a few weeks ago on \nwhat has happened to private health insurance for working families. We \nhave seen about a 4.5 to 5 percent increase nationwide in the number of \nfamilies who have dropped or been dropped from private health \ninsurance. In 1993, 29\n\n[[Page S2853]]\n\nmillion families lost their health care coverage in this country. And \nthe premium costs went up. Small employers decided to drop it \naltogether.\n  So we have watched a tremendous increase in the number of families, \nworking families, with children without any kind of health care \ncoverage at all.\n  Many of our State laws, Mr. President, require, under law, that you \ninsure your automobile. Many of our State laws, if not all of them, \nrequire that if you have a home mortgage, there be insurance on your \nhouse. All that we are suggesting here today is that if you have a \nchild, there ought to be health care coverage or insurance for that \nchild.\n  If it is mandatory that your home be insured, if it is mandatory your \ncar be insured, if you are out of work and on public assistance you get \nhealth care, if you are in prison you get health care, what our \ncolleagues from Massachusetts and Utah, and those of us who are \nsupporting them, are suggesting, is that if you are a working family in \nthis country, your children--your children--also ought to have a safety \nnet for health care. So this proposal does just that.\n  Mr. President, I will just conclude with a story. We had a press \nconference announcing this GAO study a few days ago. I brought with me \na woman from Connecticut. Both she and her husband work. Her husband is \nin construction. She works for a nonprofit organization in the State of \nConnecticut. They have two children. Their oldest boy has a serious \nmental health problem. It is a serious mental health illness with a \ncost of over $1,000 a month, on average, for medication. They have run \nout of support from the State program. There is not going to be any \nmore. They were left with this choice--until someone stepped in and \nmade an exception in their case--but left with this choice: Either they \ncould quit their jobs and go on public assistance and get health care \nfor that child, that is one option, or the other was to take their \nchild and turn him over to the State, give up custody and let him \nbecome a ward of the State, so that then the child could get health \ncare coverage.\n\n  We hear people talking of family values and families staying together \nall the time. But somehow, in this situation, this family wants \ndesperately to keep custody of their child, and they keep working and \nthey get no help whatever. There is something fundamentally erroneous \nabout the situation that presently exists that if you work and want to \nkeep your children, you run the risk of losing the health care, whereas \nif you go on public assistance or give up the custody of your child, \nyou can get health care coverage.\n  Mr. President, the suggestion of both of our colleagues is to fill in \nthis gap that exists for these 10\\1/2\\ million children today that are \nwithout any health care coverage. The numbers are growing, by the way. \nThis is not a number that is declining, but is a number that is \ngrowing.\n  They have come up with a funding scheme that I think most people will \nsupport in this country. It is controversial. Obviously, some will \nobject to how this is paid for. I think it is a very sound idea to come \nup with this funding scheme and also to allocate some of the resources \nfor deficit reduction.\n  Again, Mr. President, if we can insure our cars by law, our homes by \nlaw, if you are on welfare or in prison and you get health care \ncoverage, at the very least, we ought to do the same for America's \nchildren. This legislation allows us to do that. I commend both of our \ncolleagues and look forward to adoption of the law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with my colleague, \nSenator Kennedy, with Senator Hatch, and others, in introducing today \nlegislation to provide health care to the 10 million children in the \nUnited States who today do not have that care.\n  Last year, Senator Kennedy and I joined together with other Senators \nto introduce legislation to similarly provide health care to these \nchildren. Since the time that we introduced legislation a year ago, \nover 750,000 children under the age of 18 have lost health insurance. \nOne child loses health insurance every 35 seconds in the United States. \nWe are the only industrial country on the face of this planet that does \nnot insure our children, or that does not insure, even, many of our \nadults.\n  What is extraordinary about this situation is that we are not talking \nabout the poorest of our poor in America. The poorest of the poor get \nhelp. They have health insurance. They get Medicaid. The fact is that \nwe are talking about 10 million children who are the children of \nworking Americans, fully three-fifths of whom work full-time jobs, and \n90 percent of whom are working at some job or another.\n  I visited recently at the Children's Hospital in Boston and I \nlistened to the story of two parents who are working, both of whom are \njust not earning enough money in their full-time jobs to be able to pay \nthe premiums for the expensive insurance that their sick child needs.\n  The fact is that over one-half of all the children in the United \nStates who have asthma never see a doctor. One-third of all the \nchildren in the United States who have an ear problem never see a \ndoctor. Similarly, for eye problems: As we have learned from medical \nexperts, those problems, often undiagnosed, become chronic ailments and \nmany times become lifetime impairments. We then pick up the cost of \nthose impairments with special education needs, and at the back end of \noften substance abuse or other kinds of highly intensive, labor-\nintensive interventions which we could have avoided early on.\n  Just take the case of neonatal/prenatal care. It costs $1,000 for a \nyear of covering a pregnant woman with early nutrition, early \nintervention, for pregnancy. But if a child is born underweight as a \nconsequence of the lack of that kind of intervention, it costs $1,100 a \nday.\n  I have talked to teachers in schools who have told me the stories of \nyoung students who come into the school; they are in the classroom and \nthey are disruptive, not because they want to be disruptive, but \nbecause they have a problem. In one particular case, a teacher told me \nof a child who chronically disrupted the entire class. They could not \nfigure it out. They finally got the child to a clinic because the child \nhad not been examined by a doctor, and they found the child had a \nchronic earache problem as a consequence of an infection. Antibiotics \nwere given, the infection was cleared up, and the child became a full \nparticipant in the classroom.\n  Mr. President, there are countless stories like these. I want to \ncongratulate Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch for working together in \nhelping to come up with a scheme to fund this, that clearly addresses \nother health needs of the country. When we consider the costs of our \nvarious wings of hospitals that are dedicated to pulmonary disease, to \nemphysema, to cancer as a consequence of smoking, we are spending \nbillions upon billions of dollars, far in excess of the cost of this \nkind of program, to provide preventive care at the early outset.\n  So this is really an investment, not an expenditure. This will repay \nitself many times over. We know that the health care expenditure in \nearly prevention will save anywhere from $3.40 to $16 by virtue of $1 \ninvested.\n  Mr. President, it is time in America for us for catch up to the rest \nof the industrialized world and provide insurance to the young children \nof this Nation who desperately need it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Wellstone and Mr. Kennedy):\n\n  S. 527. A bill to prescribe labels for packages and advertising for \ntobacco products, to provide for the disclosure of certain information \nrelating to tobacco products, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n               TOBACCO DISCLOSURE AND WARNING ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill we \nare calling the Tobacco Disclosure and Warning Act of 1997. Frankly, I \nhope we are going to be able to look back at this day and say this was \na great day for America's children, that this was a great day for the \nfuture well-being of coming generations.\n  I am joined by my Senate colleague from Illinois, Senator Dick \nDurbin,\n\n[[Page S2854]]\n\nwho worked with me in the past on establishing a ban on smoking in \nairplanes, he was a Member of the House before, and Senator Harkin from \nIowa, and Senator Wellstone from Minnesota. They joined me this morning \nin declaring that we are interested this day in the health of our \nchildren. We want to warn them that a habit that they could be \ninduced--if I may use the term more crudely, seduced--into, if they \njoin in the tobacco addiction group, that they may be jeopardizing \ntheir health very seriously.\n  Our bill will force tobacco companies to tell the truth, finally, to \nthe American people. As witnessed by the Liggett & Myers' settlement, \nwhich wiped away the secrecy and deception perpetrated by the industry, \ntruth is one of the few items in short supply in the tobacco industry. \nThis bill will require tobacco manufacturers to disclose the \ningredients of their product to the public.\n  Actually, it is a modest step. Of the hundreds of products on sale in \nAmerica that go into the human body, tobacco products are the only \nones--the only ones--for which manufacturers do not have to disclose \nthe ingredients. Take a company like Coca-Cola, one of the world's \ngreat companies. They have a proud tradition of keeping their formula \nsecret. They have to list Coke's ingredients on every can.\n  There is a major difference, of course, between Coca-Cola and \ncigarettes. Coca-Cola does not kill anybody and cigarettes kill 400,000 \npeople a year--more than 400,000. That is one out of every three new \nusers that the industry is trying to recruit. That is according to the \nCenters for Disease Control.\n  Manufacturers of every food product and every over-the-counter drug \ndisclose their contents. Cigarette manufacturers do not. Can we wonder \nwhy? Yet, of any consumable product for sale in the United States, it \nis by far among the most deadly.\n  When you think about the materials that are in cigarettes, \ncarcinogens--43. Should not America know that when you inhale you are \ngoing to get some arsenic, going to get some benzine, materials that \nare very dangerous to health?\n  Lead, we fight all over the place to take lead out of gasoline, take \nlead out of paint. But we sell it to the kids. That is what the tobacco \nindustry wants to do. Cadmium, nickel--you would not let your child go \nnear these things, yet everyday this industry, these companies, get tax \ndeductions to advertise their addictive, health-damaging product--maybe \nlethal.\n  Our bill also is going to replace the warnings. We ask, A, they list \nthe ingredients. B, we ask also that health warnings on the side of a \ncigarette package be significant, with larger warnings on the front and \nback that are simple and direct, saying: ``Cigarettes kill. Smoking can \nkill you. Cigarettes are addictive. Cigarettes cause heart attacks and \nstroke.''\n  It is pretty simple. But maybe, just maybe, then we will be able to \nstop the industry from targeting its recruits for the day. Mr. \nPresident, 3,000 children, young people, a day, are attracted and start \nsmoking. And then they cannot quit.\n\n  These kinds of warnings exist all around the world. Cigarettes kill \none out of every three, again, I repeat, of its users. Over 400,000 \nAmericans every year die from smoking and lots more get sick: \nEmphysema, heart attacks, cannot conduct their normal activity, cannot \nassociate with their families, cannot show the kids how to hit a ball, \nrun a base or go skating or skiing. We should disclose information on \nthe ingredients of cigarettes to the public and provide it with \nrealistic warnings about the health risks that cigarettes cause. It may \nseem that most smokers know a single cigarette may have hundreds of \ndangerous ingredients, but I doubt it. When a smoker lights a \ncigarette, some of these ingredients burn to create other chemicals, \nand some of these are carcinogenic.\n  A Surgeon General's report in 1989 reported that cigarettes contain \n43 carcinogens. The list is here, over 43. I did not know it until \nrecently. But the public certainly has a right to know. Do most smokers \nrealize that one of these chemicals is arsenic? I do not think so. Our \nbill would disclose that, as well as the other chemical carcinogens in \ncigarettes.\n  With all these known dangers about smoking, we should not hide health \nwarning labels in small type on the side of a cigarette pack. Other \ncountries, countries like Canada, Australia, Thailand, put large labels \non the front of each pack and they put it, of course, in their native \nlanguage. The United States should provide equal protection to \nconsumers. The warnings should be stark, brutal if necessary, and \neasily seen. When cigarettes get in the hands of kids, and 3,000 of \nthem take up smoking every day, they ought to be looking at something \nthat says: Smoking can kill you. Smoking is addictive. Smoking harms \nathletic performance.\n  That is a lot more graphic and descriptive than the small print that \nappears today. We should have no beating around the bush because this \nbush kills you. With large and honest warnings, more children will get \nthe message and perhaps some will put down that pack rather than \nlighting it up.\n  Mr. President, the 105th Congress should enact this legislation. It \nshould not be a partisan issue. In the coming weeks I expect this bill \nwill attract cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. The public has a \nright to know. They have a right to know the truth. Unless Congress \nforces the industry's hand, it will never fully disclose to customers \nwhat it puts in its product, what it puts in their products.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 527\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tobacco Disclosure and \n     Warning Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Tobacco products are the largest preventable cause of \n     illness and premature death, responsible for one of every 5 \n     deaths in the United States.\n       (2) Tobacco is a uniquely harmful product in that it is the \n     only product which kills when used as intended.\n       (3) Cigarettes and spit tobacco products are powerfully \n     addictive because they contain nicotine which is a poisonous, \n     addictive drug.\n       (4) Tobacco-related addiction is a pediatric disease. The \n     vast majority of new smokers are teenagers or younger and \n     children are beginning to smoke today at a younger age than \n     ever before.\n       (5) The United States health care system spends an \n     estimated $50 billion a year to treat diseases caused by \n     tobacco use. In addition, the United States economy loses $50 \n     billion a year from lost productivity due to tobacco-related \n     illnesses and premature death.\n       (6) The nicotine in tobacco products is responsible for the \n     addiction of up to one half of all children who experiment \n     with tobacco.\n       (7) More than 3,000 children begin smoking each day. An \n     estimated 1,000 of them will die from a tobacco-related \n     illness.\n       (8) Tobacco manufacturers manipulate the levels and \n     presence of the drug nicotine in their products with the \n     intent to cause and sustain addiction in consumers.\n       (9) In 1997 the tobacco industry will spend over $5 billion \n     on advertising and promotion to attract new users, retain \n     current users, increase current consumption, and generate \n     favorable long-term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.\n       (10) The Federal Government has a substantial interest in \n     ensuring that those who do not use tobacco products are not \n     encouraged to use them and those who use tobacco products are \n     discouraged from continuing their use.\n       (11) A failure to provide adequate and complete health \n     warnings and labeling information to fully inform consumers \n     about the risks and dangers of tobacco use is misleading.\n       (12) Health warnings on cigarette packages have not been \n     updated since 1984 and do not fully reflect current \n     scientific knowledge on the adverse health effects of tobacco \n     use.\n       (13) The display format of tobacco health warnings can be \n     more effective as a vehicle for promoting public knowledge of \n     the health risks.\n       (14) Health warnings are most effective when directed at \n     those people who are tempted to try smoking, who are \n     experimenting with smoking, or who are considering a decision \n     to quit smoking.\n       (15) Health warnings will be most effective when they are \n     present each time the opportunity to use a tobacco product \n     occurs and each time tobacco products are promoted and \n     advertised.\n       (16) Changes in warning format and revisions in the text of \n     health warnings further the Federal government's commitment \n     to reduce tobacco-related disease and are a low cost means of \n     enhancing the effectiveness of other tobacco reduction \n     programs.\n\n[[Page S2855]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, the University of Kentucky's \nbasketball program has a rich and storied legacy; more wins than any \nteam in college basketball history, six NCAA titles, more appearances \nin the NCAA tournament than any other program, and 38 Southeastern \nConference titles. But, those statistics only begin to tell the tale. \nEven with all these successes, the 1996-97 edition of the Wildcats will \ncarry a special place in the hearts of Kentucky fans. For the real \nstory behind the UK basketball team is the love affair the fans have \nwith the Big Blue's program.\n  It was not so long ago, Mr. President, that even one loss was enough \nto launch some in the Commonwealth into a fit of pique. So accustomed \nto winning, some Wildcat fanatics had grown unable to accept an \noccasional setback. Even worse, many had forgotten how to enjoy the \nhard-earned victories that talented Kentucky teams continually \nproduced.\n  Today there is a new attitude in the bluegrass, Mr. President. An \nattitude which exults in victories and championships without believing \nthe end of the world is near if their beloved Cats happen to come up \nshort. An attitude derived from the players and coaches themselves. An \nattitude borne of hard work and the satisfaction brought by the \nunparalleled success that hard work has produced.\n  Never has this been more true than with this year's Kentucky squad. \nWith the odds stacked against the team all year long, the fans were \nable to revel in a 35-5 season, a Southeastern Conference tournament \ntitle and a national runnerup trophy. Not bad for a squad that lost \nfour players to the NBA draft, two starters to injury and returned only \none starter from the previous year's national championship team. At \ntimes this year, many would agree that the MVP of the team was trainer \n``Fast'' Eddie Jamiel.\n  These young men, Coach Rick Pitino, and Athletic Director C.M. Newton \ndeserve special recognition for reminding us all that how you play the \ngame is as important as the final result. Not once during a roller-\ncoaster season did any player or coach complain about the difficulty of \nthe challenges at hand. Excuses are for losers, and there are no losers \nassociated with this Wildcat team of overachievers.\n  The Fabulous Five, the Fiddlin' Five, Rupp's Runts, the \nUnforgettables, the Untouchables, and now the Unbelievables. Other \nKentucky teams had more talent but never has a Wildcat group worked as \nhard. This team had tremendous pride due to the fact that ``KENTUCKY'' \nwas stitched in bold blue letters across their chests. They took that \npride and used it to achieve more than any fan or so-called expert \ncould have hoped for.

Mr President, one of this Nation's most pressing \nnational security concerns is the ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. The case for this treaty is compelling. The CWC treaty was \nnegotiated by Presidents Reagan and Bush, two Republican \nadministrations. It is now being moved to ratification by a Democratic \nadministration. CWC is supported whole heartedly and overwhelmingly by \nthe American people. According to a poll, 84 percent of all Americans \nsupport this convention. It also has the unconditional support of the \nU.S. chemical industry and the U.S. military as represented by Gen. \nNorman Schwarzkopf, General Shalikashvili, and Admiral Zumwalt among \nothers. It is endorsed by veterans groups; religious organizations; the \nintelligence community; peace groups; societies for physicians, \nscientists, and engineers; and military organizations. It has already \nbeen ratified by 68 countries around the world including China, India, \nJapan, many of the former Soviet Republics and Warsaw Pact countries as \nwell as our major West European allies. The fact of the matter is, the \ntreaty is both effective and reasonable. It makes sense militarily and \neconomically.\n  Despite this unprecedented support from such diverse groups, the \nConvention has been languishing, awaiting a Senate vote since 1993. \nVery simply put, and to quote from an editorial in the Chicago Tribune: \n``This Treaty Ought To Be Ratified.'' This Tribune editorial goes on to \nstate, ``In the annals of 20th century warfare, hardly a weapon short \nof nuclear explosives has produced such loathing and terror as those \nclassified as chemical weapons.'' When you are considering outlawing \nthe development, production, transfer, acquisition, and use of chemical \nweapons, partisanship and obstructionism should not be an issue.\n  There are many misstatements and much propaganda against the CWC. The \ntruth is that there is a heavy price to pay if we are not an original \nsignatory: The United States will have no place on the executive \ncouncil; Americans won't be able to serve as inspectors; American \nchemical companies will lose significant business to overseas \ncompetitors because of mandatory trade sanctions; and U.S. credibility \nand influence will be undermined. We'll be in the same category as \nother nonsignatories such as Libya, Iran, and Syria.\n  On the other hand, the ratification of CWC will make it less likely \nthat our troops will ever again encounter chemical weapons in the \nbattlefield; less likely that chemical weapons will fall into the hands \nof terrorists; and less likely that rogue states will have access to \nchemical weapons. Unfortunately, CWC is not the panacea to remove all \nthreat of chemical weapons, but it is a first important step.\n  I urge my Senate colleagues to take up the debate on the Chemical \nWeapons Convention on the Senate floor so that this treaty can be \nratified. I also ask that three editorials from Illinois newspapers \nsupporting CWC be printed in the Record.\n  The editorials follow:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Sept. 27, 1995]\n\n                   The Helms Choke-Hold on Diplomacy\n\n       That the president of these United States must seek the \n     advice and win the consent of the Senate in making treaties \n     and appointing ambassadors is so integral to the American \n     system of checks and balances that it is written into the \n     Constitution.\n       The framers of that document certainly were no strangers to \n     the baser side of domestic politics, so a certain amount of \n     horse-trading in the conduct of foreign policy--which is the \n     province of the president--was to be tolerated and even \n     encouraged. Today, however, the pugnacious senator from North \n     Carolina, Jesse Helms, has turned advice and consent into \n     stonewalling and deadlock.\n       As Senate Foreign Relations chairman, a post he assumed \n     with the Republican sweep of Congress, Helms has laid down \n     his gavel and refuses to convene business meetings of that \n     powerful committee.\n       Frozen by his fit of pique are ratification of a dozen \n     treaties and international agreements, including two landmark \n     pacts; Start 2, the treaty slashing U.S. and Russian nuclear \n     arsenals that was signed by former President George Bush, a \n     Republican; and the Chemical Weapons Convention, which \n     outlaws the manufacture and use of chemical weapons.\n       Among the 400 State Department appointments locked up by \n     Helms are 30 ambassadorial positions. Thus, the United States \n     is left without chief envoys to 15 percent of its embassies, \n     including those in several nations critically important to \n     American national security and a peaceful world order--China, \n     Lebanon, Pakistan, Panama, South Africa and Zaire.\n       What is Helms after? He wants to reorganize the State \n     Department by eliminating the independent agencies that \n     handle foreign aid, arms control and public information. \n     Helms says $3 billion can be saved over four years by letting \n     the State Department swallow up the Agency for International \n     Development (AID), the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency \n     (ACDA) and the U.S. Information Agency (USIA).\n       The majority of Helms' Senate colleagues, however, \n     disagree. As recently as last week, the Senate refused to \n     approve Helm's controversial reorganization plan, which was \n     attached to the foreign aid bill.\n\n[[Page S2859]]\n\n       President Clinton concedes there's fat to be trimmed from \n     the State Department budget but points out, for example, that \n     the AID budget has been trimmed by 20 percent since he took \n     office, part of a downward trend that has seen the overall \n     funding of foreign affairs drop by 47 percent since 1985.\n       This stonewalling by Helms is ill-considered, and extends \n     far beyond Congress' power of the purse. Helms should let the \n     treaties and appointments be voted in committee. Then, the \n     Senate as a whole and not just one senator--should be allowed \n     to consider what advice to give Clinton and whether to give \n     its consent on these important foreign policy matters.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n            [From the State Journal-Register, Feb. 11, 1997]\n\n            Obstructionism Blocking Chemical Weapons Accord\n\n       The Senate's delay in bringing the chemical weapons treaty \n     to a ratifying vote is inimical to national interests. This \n     treaty is strongly supported by every major national \n     constituency.\n       The treaty is an American brainchild, negotiated under \n     Presidents Reagan and Bush. President Clinton sent it to the \n     Senate for ratification in 1993. It has bipartisan Senate \n     support and is enthusiastically backed by the U.S. military, \n     which is destroying its chemical weapons stockpiles and wants \n     to see other nations do the same.\n       The problem is summed up in two words: Jesse Helms. This \n     relic from North Carolina who, through seniority, not \n     ability, has become chairman of the Foreign Relations \n     Committee, has persuaded Majority Leader Trent Lott to \n     withhold the treaty from a vote on the floor, where it would \n     easily pass.\n       In playing this power game, Helms serves neither nation, \n     Senate nor party.\n       He serves his own ego.\n       The practical effect of Helms' obstructionism is to damage \n     the U.S. chemical industry, a strong treaty supporter.\n       After the treaty takes effect April 29, participating \n     nations (160 have endorsed it so far) and prohibited from \n     dealing with nonparticipants in any of the chemicals banned \n     by the treaty, many of which have commercial as well as \n     military uses.\n       The U.S. chemical industry puts the cost to it of this \n     provision at $600 million in exports annually.\n       But Helms does more serious damage to America's reputation. \n     This is our treaty. Since the United States renounced \n     chemical weapons 15 years ago and began destroying \n     stockpiles, it has been persuading other nations to do the \n     same.\n       The Chemical Weapons Convention is the first treaty calling \n     not just for the reduction of a type of weaponry, but its \n     entire elimination.\n       The United States has had success convincing others to \n     follow our lead, but now it is the Senate's turn to act. \n     Instead, Helms has blocked a ratifying resolution introduced \n     by Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the man Helms ousted as \n     committee chairman four years ago in a particularly egregious \n     use of the seniority principle.\n       If Helms wants to thwart the Clinton administration and \n     does not care about the chemical industry, perhaps he should \n     listen to what the military is saying.\n       Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff, is supported by former military leaders Colin Powell, \n     Brent Scowcroft, Elmo Zumwalt and others in urging quick \n     ratification.\n       Disputing Helms' claim that the treaty somehow weakens the \n     United States, Zumwalt, former chief of naval operations, \n     says it ``is entirely about eliminating other people's \n     weapons, weapons that may someday be used against Americans.\n       That kind of sober warning should be enough to persuade \n     Helms to end his ego trip and let the treaty go forward.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Feb. 19, 1997]\n\n                    This Treaty Ought To Be ratified\n\n       In the annals of 20th Century warfare, hardly a weapon \n     short of nuclear explosives has produced such loathing and \n     terror as those classified as chemical weapons, more commonly \n     known as poison gas.\n       Considered the poor-man's A-bomb because of their ease of \n     manufacture and battlefield delivery, the use of chemicals \n     was considered so inhumane that even the Nazis declined their \n     deployment on the battlefield--if not in the extermination \n     camps.\n       So horrible was the thought of Iraq using chemical \n     artillery against U.S. forces in the Gulf War that Baghdad \n     had the clear impression that to do so might bring quick \n     nuclear retaliation.\n       Who besides the leaders of renegade nations would oppose a \n     treaty that would ban and destroy such heinous weapons of \n     war? How about a handful of senators who oppose the U.S. \n     ratification of the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention.\n       Jesse Helms, the powerful head of the Senate Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, and a few others oppose the treaty, \n     claiming that it cannot be effectively enforced nor can \n     violations of its provisions be verified. Proponents dispute \n     such claims. Helms has asked that instead of chemical arms, \n     Senate priorities first be focused upon other aims, like \n     legislation ensuring a comprehensive reform of the \n     ``antiquated'' Department of State and the United Nations.\n       In this there is a problem: if the Senate does not ratify \n     the pact by April 29, the day the convention becomes \n     international law, the sole remaining superpower will lose \n     out on the right to join teams to monitor suspect chemical \n     plants and guarantee the destruction of chemical arms \n     stockpiles. Another detriment would be denial to the U.S. of \n     access to information gathered by those chemical teams.\n       So far 161 countries have signed the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, and the legislatures of 68 countries--including \n     those of our major allies--have ratified the pact. Russia, \n     which has yet to ratify, is nevertheless committed to destroy \n     its chemical stockpile by the year 2005 and the United States \n     its own by 2004.\n       The list of those backing the treaty contains names hardly \n     associated with a soft line on national defense. On that list \n     are military giants like Colin Powell, Norman Schwarzkopf, \n     Brent Scowcroft and Adm. Elmo Zumwalt Jr., and civilians like \n     George Bush, Lawrence Eagleburger and James A. Baker III.\n       Our confidence on this issue is in them, not Jesse Helms. \n     The Senate should move quickly to ratify the treaty and join \n     the 21st Century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2858-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO THE MIDDLEBURY COLLEGE HOCKEY TEAM\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS.

COL. ARCHIBALD GALLOWAY II\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \nrise today to pay tribute to Lt. Col. Archie Galloway for his dedicated \nmilitary service to our country.\n  Colonel Galloway is retiring on May 31, 1997 from active service in \nthe U.S. Army after serving for nearly 29 years as an infantry officer \nand soldier. I came to know Colonel Galloway personally during his last \n3\\1/2\\ years of military service as a staff officer in the Army's \nSenate liaison office, as he arranged for and accompanied me on a \nnumber of key trips around the globe on critical national issues of \ndefense and foreign affairs.\n  Colonel Galloway was born in Baltimore, MD, on April 12, 1947. He \nenlisted in the Army in 1967 as a private and was later commissioned as \na second lieutenant in 1969 from Infantry Officer Candidate School at \nFort Benning, GA. Throughout his military career, he consistently \ndistinguished himself during times of peace and war, in both command \nand staff positions. He volunteered for duty in Vietnam as a Vietnamese \nranger adviser and was decorated with the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry \nwith Silver Star and the Bronze Star Medal. During Operation Just \nCause, he served as the chief of current operations in the joint task \nforce and earned at the end of his tour in the 7th Infantry Division \nthe Legion of Merit. His other notable military awards include the \nCombat Infantryman's Badge, Meritorious Service Medal with four Oak \nLeaf Clusters, Army Commendation Medal, Army General Staff \nIdentification Badge, Ranger, Airborne, and Air Assault Badges.\n  Colonel Galloway's professionalism and leadership as a military \nofficer have earned him the respect and admiration of his soldiers, \nfellow officers,\n\n[[Page S2860]]\n\nand Members of the U.S. Congress. He is known for his integrity, \ncompassion, and ability to inspire men and women from all walks of \nlife. It is these qualities that will assure his success as a new \nlegislative assistant for Senator Jeff Sessions.\n  I salute Arch Galloway for his distinguished military record and wish \nhim and his wonderful wife and great baker, the former Nancy Carol \nBrendel, many years of happiness and good health in his retirement. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2859-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SALUTE TO HAROLD HAZELIP\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Harold \nHazelip for an outstanding career. Hazelip has served as president of \nLipscomb University since 1986 with dedication and a proactive sense of \nleadership. This spring he will retire, and the students, faculty and \nstaff at Lipscomb University will miss him greatly. But as they look \nback on his years of service, they will find that the legacy he leaves \nbehind is a strong foundation for education and the community.\n  Since 1986, Lipscomb University has seen many changes. Enrollment has \nreached record highs at the university and at David Lipscomb Campus \nSchool for kindergarten through high school. Fundraising efforts are \nmore productive than at any time in the university's 104-year history \nand alumni are giving more back to their school.\n  When Harold Hazelip took the helm, Lipscomb University was called \nDavid Lipscomb College. Through hard work and a clear vision Hazelip \nhelped the school implement a masters degree program to become \naccredited as a university by the Southern Association of Colleges. In \naddition to a variety of new programs, Hazelip has also been able to \nrecruit some of the best professors from across the country. Today, 83 \npercent of Lipscomb's faculty hold terminal degrees in their field, an \nincrease from 63 percent when Hazelip started.\n  During Hazelip's tenure, admissions standards were strengthened and \nthe diversity of the student body increased. The campus grew, too, with \nthe addition of a new library, a recreational gymnasium, and a \ncampuswide fiber-optic network. Hazelip has eagerly combined \ntechnological innovation, student diversity, advanced education \nprograms, and new instructional facilities to steer Lipscomb University \ntoward a bright future.\n  The most exciting legacy that Hazelip leaves behind is the growth and \ncontinued interest in mission work and youth ministry at Lipscomb \nUniversity. This aspect of campus life is a true reflection of the \ndedication that Hazelip has for the university as well as his \ncommunity. Harold Hazelip truly encompasses the ideals of community \ninvolvement and leadership. In today's tumultuous world, it is \nreassuring to see these ideals passed along.\n  Mr. President, Harold Hazelip is not simply a university president, \nhe is also a writer, a minister, a Chamber of Commerce member, and a \nleader in education. His commitment to each of these titles is \nreflected in the successes he has helped the people around him achieve. \nHazelip's retirement from Lipscomb University challenges the university \ncommunity to uphold the standards that he set and to move beyond those \ncriterion to reach higher goals for the institution. Like any good \nteacher, Hazelip has given Lipscomb University the foundation to \nachieve success. It is now up to the university to build upon that \nfoundation. Harold Hazelip has set Lipscomb University on the fast \ntrack to success, and I am confident that Lipscomb's future is very \nbright as a result. I thank Harold Hazelip for his dedication to \neducation and his community, and I wish him well as he enters \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2860-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MR.

Mr. President, my home State of North Dakota has \nbeen making the national news lately because of the recordbreaking \nsnowfalls and flooding we have been suffering. This will surely be a \nwinter that North Dakotans will remember for a long time to come. \nHowever, we North Dakotans will also be able to look back on this \nwinter with fond memories because of the two national championships \ncaptured by the University of North Dakota in women's basketball and \nmen's hockey.\n  First of all, I want to pay special tribute to the 1997 National \nCollegiate Athletic Association's Division II women's national \nbasketball champions, the University of North Dakota Fighting Sioux. \nThis championship is made more special because it is the first ever for \nwomen's basketball at UND, and it keeps the national championship \ntrophy in North Dakota for the fifth straight year.\n  I am sure that this championship is made even sweeter for Head Coach \nGene Roebuck and his team because it comes after playing in the shadow \nof North Dakota State University's women's basketball team for the last \nseveral years. The fact is that two of the best division II basketball \nteams in the country year in and year out play right in the Red River \nValley of North Dakota, and it was just a matter of time before the UND \nwomen would get their share of the limelight.\n  To win the national championship, the UND women handily defeated the \nSouthern Indiana Lady Screaming Eagles 94-78 after closing out the game \non a 20-4 run. Winning the national championship was truly a team \neffort with six players scoring in double figures. The Fighting Sioux \nfinished the season 28-4, which ties the school record for most wins in \na season.\n  The outstanding team accomplishments were aided by some notable \nindividual accomplishments. Freshman point guard Jaime Pudenz was named \nthe most outstanding player of the tournament. Jaime was joined on the \nElite Eight All-Tournament team by senior Kelli Britz and sophomore \nJenny Crouse. Kelli also has the additional distinction of finishing \nher career at UND as the school's leader in the 3-point fieldgoals made \nand attempted and second all time in total points scored. Tiffany \nPudenz led the Fighting Sioux in scoring in the championship game with \n23 points.\n  But a basketball team needs hard work and contributions from all of \nits players if it is to reach the pinnacle of a national championship. \nThe Fighting Sioux certainly got that from senior Allison Derck, junior \nElisha Kabanuk, sophomores Casey Carroll and Kami Winger, and freshmen \nAnna Feit, Pernilla Jonsson, Elisabeth Melin, and Katie Richards.\n  Finally, I want to honor the coaches who have turned the Fighting \nSioux into one of the dominant forces in the North Central Conference \nand all of division II women's basketball. Coach Roebuck is one of the \nmost successful active coaches in basketball with a record of 246-50 \nover the last 10 seasons. He is assisted on the bench by Darcy Deutsch, \nChris Gardner, and Doug Reiten.\n  I've always known that North Dakota has some of the best people you \ncan find, and I'm told that the visitors to Grand Forks for the \nnational championship came away with the same impression. Now all of \nAmerica can understand that some of the finest people and finest \nwomen's basketball both come from the Red River Valley.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2860-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S2861]]\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO THE UND ICE HOCKEY TEAM\n\n   Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my home State of North Dakota has \nbeen making the national news lately because of the record-breaking \nsnowfalls and flooding we have been suffering. This will surely be a \nwinter that North Dakotans will remember for a long time to come. \nHowever, we North Dakotans will also be able to look back on this \nwinter with fond memories because of the two national championships \ncaptured by the University of North Dakota in women's basketball and \nmen's hockey.\n  I want to pay special tribute to the 1997 National Collegiate \nAthletic Association's Division I national hockey champions, the \nUniversity of North Dakota Fighting Sioux. This is the sixth national \nchampionship in the long and storied 50-year history of the UND hockey \nteam. In fact, only one other college, Michigan, has more national \nhockey titles to its credit than UND.\n  But perhaps this championship is among the most meaningful because of \nits improbability. Consistently throughout this season, the hockey \nprogram has defied the odds-makers with win after win. This team was \npredicted to finish no better than fifth in the Western Collegiate \nHockey Association at the beginning of the season, but I guess someone \nforgot to tell that to the team and its coaches for not only did they \nwin the WCHA but also the national championship. They closed out the \nseason with a 31-10-2 record, becoming just the sixth team in UND \nhistory to win at least 30 games.\n  To win the national championship, the Fighting Sioux fought back from \na 2 to 0 deficit after the first period to score five goals in the \nsecond period against Boston University. In the third period, the \nSioux's smothering defense took over and the Sioux won by a final score \nof 6 to 4.\n  The team's outstanding team accomplishments throughout the year were \naided by some notable individual accomplishments. Junior wing player \nMatt Henderson was named the tournament's most outstanding player. He \nwas joined on the all-tournament team by freshman goalie Aaron \nSchweitzer, junior defenseman Curtis Murphy, and the team's leading \nscorer, sophomore wing David Hoogsteen. Sophomore Jason Blake was 1 of \n10 finalists for college hockey's top individual player award, the \nHobey Baker Award.\n  But a team needs hard work and contributions from all of its players \nif it is to reach the pinnacle of a national championship. The Fighting \nSioux certainly got that from seniors Kevin Hoogsteen, Toby Kvalevog, \nDane Litke, and Mark Pivetz, junior Mitch Vig, sophomores Jesse Bull, \nAdam Calder, Ian Kallay, Jay Panzer, Tom Philion, Tyler Rice, Jeff \nUlmer, Aaron Vickar, and Brad Williamson, and freshmen Peter Armbrust, \nJoe Blake, Brad DeFauw, Tim O'Connell, and Jason Ulmer.\n  Finally, I want to honor the coaches who have led the Fighting Sioux \nto these levels. Head Coach Dean Blais was named ``WCHA Coach of the \nYear.'' He is assisted by Scott Sandelin and Mark Osiecki.\n  Since 13 of the team's 20 members are freshmen or sophomores this \nyear, I am sure we can all look forward to another excellent season. \nBut for now it is more than enough for North Dakotans to bask in the \nglow of winning yet another national championship in a 10-day period. \nAnd hopefully some of the warm feelings will help to melt the snow and \ndry up the floods.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2861-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF COLORADO SPRINGS GAZETTE\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, one of Colorado's most prominent \nnewspapers, the Colorado Springs Gazette, celebrated 125 years of \nservice to the Pikes Peak region on March 23, 1997.\n  Although known as the Colorado Springs Gazette-Telegraph since 1947, \nthe newspaper used its 125th birthday as an opportunity to return to \nits earlier roots as the Colorado Springs Gazette.\n  Colorado Springs is one of Colorado's most vibrant communities having \nexperienced tremendous growth in recent decades. It is home to some of \nour Nation's most important military facilities such as Fort Carson \nArmy Base, Falcon Air Force Base, the U.S. Air Force Academy and NORAD, \nU.S. Space Command, and the Air Force Space Command at Peterson Air \nForce Base. Most recently, several prominent family values advocacy \norganizations have located in Colorado Springs.\n  The founder of the newspaper, Gen. William Jackson Palmer, also is \nregarded as the founder of Colorado Springs. In fact, as the 125th \nanniversary edition of the Gazette pointed out, the city and the \nnewspaper literally grew up together.\n  The colorful history of Colorado Springs has been chronicled for 125 \nyears in the pages of the Colorado Springs Gazette and I join the State \nof Colorado in wishing its publisher, N. Christian Anderson III and the \nentire Gazette staff, congratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2861-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO THE BARRE-MONTPELIER TIMES ARGUS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe Barre-Montpelier Times Argus on it's 100 years of service to its \ncommunity. From its in-depth statewide political reporting, to its \ncommitment to local news, to its independent editorial page, the ``T. \nA.'' has played a significant role in central Vermont's history.\n  I salute the Times Argus for not only reaching this important \nmilestone, but for inviting the entire central Vermont community to \nparticipate in its 100th anniversary celebration. The paper has \nscheduled an open house and guided tour of its facility and is \nsponsoring numerous theatrical and sports events this summer. In \naddition, later this year the Times Argus will be printing a centennial \nedition and is soliciting contributions from its readers about the \nhistory and personal impact of the newspaper and the community it \ncovers. I know that I plan to take part in that endeavor.\n  While much in the newspaper industry has changed since the Times \nArgus was formed on March 16, 1897, the one constant has been the \nnewspaper's commitment to its readers and community. Again I \ncongratulate the Times Argus on 100 wonderful years of service and wish \nanother 100 years of continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2861-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2861-S2862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE DEATH OF CORRECTIONAL OFFICER SCOTT WILLIAMS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today in real sadness to \nreport to my colleagues about the senseless murder last Thursday of \nScott Williams, a decorated correctional officer at the Lompoc Federal \nPenitentiary.\n  Scott was just 29 years old when he was attacked savagely by an \ninmate with a makeshift knife. The stabbing occurred during a time of \nday when inmates walk freely through Lompoc's corridors. He is the only \nofficer killed in the line of duty in the prison's history. My heart \ngoes out to the family Scott Williams leaves behind--to his wife, \nKristy, and their two young daughters, Kaitlin and Kallie.\n  Scott was a model officer, much admired by his colleagues at Lompoc, \nwhere he had been employed for only 4 years. But in those 4 years this \nyoung man had been promoted once and had received six awards for \noutstanding service. Scott Williams was as admired for his \nprofessionalism and commitment to duty as he was for his kind manner.\n  Sadly, Scott's training and commitment were not enough to sustain him \nin the terrifying and deadly moments of the attack, for he was unarmed. \nFour other officers--Mark Stephenson, Marcos Marquez, Scott Ledham, and \nScot Elliott--were injured as they rushed to his side and finally \nsubdued the attacker.\n  This tragic episode highlights the very real dangers that confront \ncorrectional officers across the country. And such incidents are on the \nrise throughout the Federal prison system. Nowhere is the record for \nattacks on guards worse than at Lompoc.\n  Few of us can appreciate the perils faced daily by our correctional \nofficers. The job is fraught with danger, and it takes a special person \nto come through each day with one's spirit and confidence intact. But \nScott Williams was such a man, and now his family and friends must go \non without him.\n  I grieve for the family that is no more: for the husband and wife who \ncan no longer dream of growing old together, for the young daughters \ndenied\n\n[[Page S2862]]\n\na lifetime of their father's love and affection. I grieve for the \npeople of Lompoc, and Los Alamos--Scott's hometown, still stunned and \nshocked by this murder in their midst.\n  I intend to initiate some inquiries concerning the appropriate way to \nprevent such acts of senseless savagery from happening in the future. \nAs a proper testament to the life of Officer Scott Williams, it is \nincumbent upon us to do no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2861-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TELEMARKETING FRAUD PREVENTION ACT\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the Telemarketing \nFraud Prevention Act of 1997. I am pleased to sponsor this bill, which \ndirects the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase penalties for those \nwho purposefully defraud vulnerable members of our society and those \nwho cross international borders to evade prosecution. I thank Senator \nReid for his sponsorship of this bill, and his leadership in combating \ntelemarketing fraud.\n  Current penalties for this crime are not tough enough to deter the \nproblem and they leave the victims without restitution. Penalties for \nbank, wire, radio, and television fraud are at least two-thirds higher \nthan the penalty for telemarketing fraud. Too often, telemarketing \nfraud felons receive a sentence of fewer than 5 years in prison. The \ntoughest penalty to date is 10 years. These are small penalties \nconsidering that many telemarketing fraud criminals have stolen the \nlife savings of retired senior citizens.\n  Mr. President, thousands of Americans lose billions of dollars a year \nfrom telemarketing fraud. According to Maryland Attorney General J. \nJoseph Curran, Jr., telemarketing fraud is probably the fastest growing \nillegal activity in this country. An Associated Press story reported \nthat top prosecutors in Arizona and 9 other States filed lawsuits or \ntook other legal action against more than 70 telemarketers nationwide 2 \nyears ago in an attempt to crack down on fraud that costs consumers \nmore than $40 billion a year.\n  Senior citizens appear to be the most vulnerable to chicanery of this \nkind. Fred Schulte, an investigating editor for the Fort Lauderdale \nSun-Sentinel and an expert on telemarketing fraud, has pointed out that \nsenior citizens are often too polite or too lonely not to listen to the \nvoice on the other end of the line. The risk of being taken advantage \nof, I believe, increases with age. According to Attorney General Reno, \nit is not uncommon for senior citizens to receive as many as five or \nmore high-pressure phone calls a day.\n  As one telemarketing con man who has worked all over the country put \nit: ``people are so lonely, so tired of life, they can't wait for the \nphone to ring. It's worth the $300 to $400 to them to think that they \ngot a friend. That's what you play on.'' Mr. President, malicious \ncriminal activity like this must be punished appropriately.\n  These criminals prey on the vulnerable of our society. In one case, \nNevada authorities arrested a Las Vegas telemarketer on a charge of \nattempted theft. The telemarketer was accused of trying to persuade a \n92-year-old Kansas man who had been fraudulently declared the winner of \n$100,000 to send $1,900 by Western Union in advance to collect his \nprize. Another example: a Maine company showed real telemarketing \ncreativity. For $250, the so-called Consumer Advocate Group offered to \nhelp consumers recover money lost to fraudulent telemarketers--but it \nprovided no services, according to Wisconsin Attorney General James \nDoyle, who sued the Maine firm plus four other telemarketers.\n  Mr. President, the Association of Attorneys General has supported \nsimilar consumer protection efforts in the past. As Minnesota Attorney \nGeneral Hubert H. Humphrey III put it last year: ``In the hands of a \ncon artist, a phone is an assault weapon.''\n\n  I would, at this time, like to highlight one specific provision of \nthe bill. Section 2 requires that an offender forfeit any real or \npersonal property derived from proceeds obtained as a result of the \noffense. The proceeds shall be used, as determined by the Attorney \nGeneral, for the national information hotline established under the \nViolent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. The proceeds of \nthe fraud will be returned to help the victims. I believe that it is \nimportant to pay attention to victims' rights in this area.\n  Last year, more than 400 individuals were arrested by law-enforcement \nofficials working on Operation Senior Sentinel. Retired law-enforcement \nofficers and volunteers, recruited by AARP, went undercover to record \nsales pitches from dishonest telemarketers. Volunteers from the 2-year-\nlong Operation Senior Sentinel discovered various telemarketing \nschemes. Some people were victimized by phony charities or investment \nschemes. Others were taken in by so-called premium promotions in which \npeople were guaranteed one of four or five valuable prizes but were \ninduced to buy an overpriced product in exchange for a cheap prize. One \nof the most vicious scams preyed on those who had already lost money. \nSome telemarketers charged a substantial fee to recover money for those \nwho had been victimized previously--and proceeded to renege on the \npromised assistance. By the time the dust settled, it took the Justice \nDepartment, the FBI, the FTC, a dozen U.S. attorneys and State \nattorneys general, the Postal Service, the IRS, and the Secret Service \nto arrest over 400 telemarketers in five States, including my home \nState of Arizona.\n  Clearly telemarketing fraud is on the rise. It is estimated that 8 \nout of 10 households are targets for telemarketing scams that bilk us \nof up to $40 billion annually. The telemarketing industry rakes in more \nthan $600 billion in annual sales. There are many seniors in my State \nand across the country who must be protected against this type of \nfraudulent activity. That is why I have sponsored this bill. The House \nof Representatives passed a bill similar to mine in the 104th Congress, \nwhich has been reintroduced during this Congress by Representative \nGoodlatte. It already has 47 cosponsors and the support of the 60 Plus \nAssociation and the National Consumers League. I urge my colleagues to \njoin us and cosponsor the Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2862-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MEASURE READ FOR THE FIRST TIME--S. 522\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 412, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 412) to approve a settlement agreement between \n     the Bureau of Reclamation and the Oroville-Tonasket \n     Irrigation District.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today, the Senate will take up and pass \nH.R. 412, legislation authorizes a settlement between the Bureau of \nReclamation and the Oroville-Tonasket Irrigation District in Washington \nState. Senator Murray and I introduced identical legislation on this \nsubject earlier this month.\n  The reason for the speedy passage of this legislation is directly \nrelated to the settlement entered into between the Bureau of \nReclamation and the irrigation district. This legislation will \nauthorize a carefully negotiated settlement between the BOR and the\n\n[[Page S2863]]\n\nOroville-Tonasket Irrigation District. When enacted, this legislation \nwill save the BOR, and therefore the Nation's taxpayers, money that \nwould otherwise be spent fighting with the irrigation district in \ncourt. The administration supports the legislation.\n  The reason for quick action on this legislation is the fact that the \nsettlement between the irrigation district and the BOR requires \nenactment of the legislation by April 15, 1997. If the legislation is \nnot enacted by that date, the irrigation district would have to refile \nits claim against the Government, and we'd be right back where we \nstarted--in court. As a result, Chairman Murkowski, and Senators \nBumpers and Kyl have carefully considered my request for quick action \nand have noted the unique circumstances surrounding this legislation. I \nwould like to thank Senators Murkowski, Bumper, and Kyl for working \nwith me to get this legislation passed quickly. This is truly a unique \nsituation, which calls for quick action.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill \nbe considered read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a recent gathering of millionaires \nand billionaires at an economic conference in Switzerland underscored \nthe importance of education in the global economy of the new \nmillennium. In this information age, they concluded, the distinction \nbetween the haves and have nots will be the distinction between the \nknows and know nots. As it is with individuals, so it is with nations.\n  We have documented the difference that education credentials make in \nthe average earnings of American workers. High school graduates make 46 \npercent more every year than those who do not graduate. College \ngraduates earn 155 percent more every year than those who do not \ncomplete high school. Over the course of a lifetime, the most educated \nAmericans will earn five times as much as the least educated.\n  Access to quality public education has been the cornerstone of the \nAmerican meritocracy, providing people with more talent than means with \nthe opportunity for economic success in most fields of endeavor. The \nrungs on the ladder of opportunity are crafted in the classroom.\n  To focus solely on the individual advantage of educational \nopportunity, however, is to miss the point of its importance to society \nas a whole. Education is a public good, not just a private benefit, and \nits relevance to the community transcends its importance to the person. \nIt directly correlates to almost every indicia of societal well-being. \nHealth status, support for the arts and cultural activities, and \nparticipation in our democratic institutions increase with educational \nattainment; while social instability, pathologies, and demand for \ntransfer payments increase in its absence. We all have a direct and \npersonal stake in the availability of educational opportunity for every \nchild.\n  The conference in Switzerland, however, touched on yet another aspect \nof the public value of education--its role in the development of a work \nforce prepared for the external changes technology has created. It has \nbeen argued the United States was able to beat the global competition \nin the industrial age because of the high quality of our work force. It \nis an open question whether we will continue to enjoy such advantage in \nthe information age. In this international competition, older \nindustrial societies will find themselves in direct competition with \nthe second-, third-, and even fourth-world societies that may have \nskipped industrialization altogether. We can choose either to compete \nwith cheap labor worldwide and guarantee a decline in living standards \nhere, or we can ensure that our work force has the high-skill, \nsophisticated productivity that will command a living wage in this \nglobal economy. It was very interesting to me that during the recent \ndebate about immigration, some of the most influential voices against \nrestricting legal immigration came from Silicon Valley and the high-\ntechnology business community: They argued there was a shortage of \nAmerican workers trained for their work, and they would be unable to \nmaintain their competitive position if limited in the option of \nimporting talent, so the need to educate our work force, as a society \nand a country, has never been more important.\n\n  And so we are faced with a challenge of more monumental proportions \nthan ever before. President Clinton recently referred to education as \ncentral to our national security. Yet, we still approach education \ngenerally, and education funding in particular, with the perspective of \nan age long past. Schools are still paid for primarily through the \nlocal property tax. Elementary and secondary education has long been \nalmost the exclusive preserve of State and local government, and there \nhas traditionally been a resistance to the National Government having \nanything to do with the circumstances in which Johnny learns to read.\n  Such a view misses the changes that have transformed the world and \nbrought us closer together. We have, now more than ever, a community \ninterest that calls for cooperation among and between all of the \ninstruments of our collective will. National, State,\n\n[[Page S2864]]\n\nand local governments all have a role to play in funding education. All \nmust do so if we are to respond to the imperative of educational \nopportunity and excellence in our own enlightened self interest.\n  Jonathan Kozol, in his important work ``Savage Inequalities,'' spoke \nto the effects of tying educational opportunity to property wealth. \nDisparities are created that fly in the face of America's promise of \nequality of opportunity. Moreover, the local property tax is a poor \nbasis for educational funding: It is inelastic; it is not progressive; \nit has no relation to the function being supported; and it ties the \nfate of Johnny's schools to Grandma's fixed income. State governments \nhave not corrected this funding anomaly. A recent report by the U.S. \nGeneral Accounting Office [GAO] quantifies the inequities of the \ncurrent mix of State and local tax support of schools and found not \nonly the disparity based on wealth that Kozol exposed, but an even \nfurther perversity: Those communities which had the least in terms of \nproperty wealth tried the hardest to support their schools by devoting \na greater portion of their income to education.\n\n  When one considers, in addition, that there is--again, according to \nthe GAO--at least $112 billion in deferred maintenance on the school \nbuildings alone, the magnitude of our education funding challenge \nbecomes clear. That $112 billion for infrastructure will simply address \nour crumbling school problem; it does not put the new technologies into \nthe classroom or train teachers to use them or pay for the increased \nphone bills for computer use.\n  What should be clear is that the answer is not either/or, but all. \nThere are appropriate roles for all of our governments, at the \nnational, State, and local levels. We should emphasize cooperation and \ncollaboration between them, with each taking the responsibility most \nappropriate to resources and capacity. I have suggested the National \nGovernment take up the rebuilding of our crumbling schools, not only \nbecause the price tag is so huge, and the problem widespread and \npervasive in city, suburban, and rural communities across the Nation, \nbut because it is something the National Government can do without \ninterfering with local decision making, such as which part of the \nschool to fix first.\n  In the meantime, we should all welcome the debate occurring at the \nState houses and city councils and boards of education all over \nAmerica. We should be proud that our President made education the \ncornerstone of his State of the Union Address. We should be optimistic \nthat our generation has the capacity to address and resolve the \nchallenges of our time, and that we can translate all of the tension \nand concern about this issue into reality-based solutions.\n  We must start, however, as the Earth Day slogan advises, by \n``Thinking Globally and Acting Locally.'' The answers will be plain and \nthe balance apparent when we consider the implications of this \nchallenge for our Nation's future. The chairman of the OECD, Jean-\nClaude Paye, once said: ``Leaders worried about their economies need to \nfocus on society's fraying fabric.''\n  Our attention to education funding reform is a first step in grasping \nthe challenge of our time, and as we restore our Nation's schools, the \npermanence of the American dream will become more secure.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/08/senate-section/article/S2863-6", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M.
