Mr. President, S. 10, the juvenile justice bill that \nwill shortly be before this Senate, is one of the best pieces of \nlegislation for law enforcement that I have seen in a number of years. \nI am absolutely convinced that it is the finest reform of criminal \njustice in at least 20 years.\n  This bill was crafted last term by Senator Hatch, who is a prime \nsponsor\n\n[[Page S5894]]\n\nof it and who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I have had the \ndual honors of serving as the chairman of the Juvenile Violence \nSubcommittee of the Judiciary Committee and also of working with him on \nthis legislation. We are very proud of the bill that has been produced. \nWe think it will do tremendous things for law enforcement. It is the \nkind of bill that does what it ought to do. It is not designed to get \nheadlines; it is designed to improve the system of criminal justice in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I served for 17 years, the better part of my \nprofessional career, as a prosecutor. It has been a particular honor \nfor me to be able to have the opportunity to participate in reforming \njuvenile justice in America, because I know from my firsthand personal \nexperience, gained as a U.S. attorney and as attorney general of \nAlabama, that this system is not working well.\n\n  I am pleased at this time to be able to recognize Senator John \nAshcroft of Missouri to speak on this issue. He is a former attorney \ngeneral of Missouri, and spent two terms, 8 years, as Governor of that \ngreat State. He is a student of juvenile crime and the crime issue in \ngeneral. He has spoken eloquently on it in our committee. He will be \nhaving hearings later this week in Missouri on this issue, and I will \nbe pleased to join with him at that time.\n  He has some remarks that he would like to share about this bill. At \nthis time, I am honored to recognize the Senator from Missouri, Mr. \nJohn Ashcroft.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  I, too, am eager to express my appreciation for the reminder and the \nsobering thoughts expressed by the Senator from Kentucky. Each of us \nhas a sense of loss whenever any of us suffers in our families the kind \nof challenge that comes when a father is deceased.\n  I remember very well my father coming to this Chamber to witness my \nswearing in as a Senator some 2\\1/2\\ years ago. My father was on his \n``last legs,'' and he died before he made it home. But he had the sense \nof knowing that I had come here to do and to support things in which \nboth he and I believed. I think that meant a lot to my father.\n  I know that at this time, the minority leader, Senator Daschle, is \nvery proud of his father and grateful for his father. I think he can \nhave some sense of assurance that his father was grateful for him and \nappreciated a son who would devote himself in the national interest to \ndoing what was, in his judgment, best for his country.\n  It is in that sense that each of us has the profound privilege of \nshaping public policy. Perhaps that is as great a privilege as any of \nus enjoys from the Creator, that He allows us literally to participate \nin creating the world in which we will live. We are all destined to \nlive in some tomorrows, and our children are destined to live in some \ntomorrows, and we have a chance to shape those tomorrows. I believe \nthat is what the process of developing plans involves; it is the \nprocess of developing legislation to try to build a framework in which \nour community respects the ability of individuals to reach the \npotential that God has placed within each of us.\n  So it is with that in mind that I think we are compelled to address a \nsignificant problem, which is a challenge to America and a threat to \nour future: The growing problem of violent juvenile crime.\n  It is not that we say that although there is a problem, there is \nnothing we can do about it. We believe that we can remediate this \nsituation. We believe that we can address this challenge, and we \nbelieve that we can be successful. We believe, however, that to do so \nwe are going to have to change some things, because the things that we \nhave been doing in the past were designed to address a different \ncategory of circumstances, a different character of culture. What we \nhave done in the past is not working today.\n  As a matter of fact, what we do will be instructive to the next \ngeneration. The way in which we view violent juvenile crime signals to \nthe next generation how we respect life, what we intend in terms of \norder and responsibility. If we take crime lightly, they will take \norder lightly, because an infraction of order by way of criminal \nactivity is something we don't care much about. If we take crime \nseriously and we impose serious consequences and we demand \nresponsibility, the next generation will say order is something to be \nvalued, because when it is interrupted, that order is restored as a \nmatter of serious concern.\n\n  The truth of the matter is, perhaps more important than anything we \ndo in any singular sense is the way in which we transmit values from \none generation to the next. More important than any other \nresponsibility of a culture is the transmission of values from one \ngeneration to the next. I think that as we have assembled our policy \nrelating to juvenile crime, we have been transmitting the wrong values, \nwe have been saying the wrong things, we have been doing the wrong \nthings, unfortunately, because we tended to say juvenile crime is the \nequivalent of acts of mischief, that it is to be disregarded like \nshooting paper wads or spitballs in the hall.\n  You remember the Charlie Brown rock-and-roll song of the fifties, \nalways doing those kinds of mischief things. We are not talking about \nmischief in juvenile crime; we are talking about assault and murder, \narmed robbery and rape. These are the parts of the criminal composite \nthat are escalating; they are not declining.\n  At the same time that we have been effective in helping to curb a \ngrowth rate in violent adult crime, we are equally alarmed by the \nevidence that we are not succeeding in reducing juvenile crime. One of \nthe reasons is that our approach to juveniles hasn't been an approach \nto them as criminals. It has been an approach based on some less-than-\naccurate understanding of what has really happened. We have thought of \nit as delinquency; we have thought of it as something less than crime.\n  If your wife is raped or if you are assaulted or if your child is \nmurdered, you get a sense that this is not delinquency, it is not \nmischief. It is crime. I think as we try to send the right signal, as \nwe try to make a commitment for the right kind of posture for our \nculture in the next generation, we need to say that violent crime \ncommitted by juveniles will be taken seriously.\n  That is one of the very important things that Senator Sessions has \nbeen able to make sure persists as a unifying thread of character \nthrough this S. 10 legislation--that violent crime is serious crime and \nit is not to be taken lightly because someone is less than 16 or less \nthan 17 or less than 18 years of age. A murder is a murder. It involves \na death. It involves a tragedy. A rape is the same. And this thread of \nseriousness is important.\n  So when we learn that violent crime arrests among juveniles in 1995 \nwere 12 percent higher than they were in 1991, we know that we have not \nwon the battle. And when we learn that they were 67 percent higher than \nthey were in 1986, we know that the challenge remains for us to do \nsomething.\n  When you see the raw data, when you see the statistics and the \ncarnage that happens to real families stacking up, you know that you \ncannot sit idly by. Although the most recent data may reflect some \nimprovement, the problem is really destined only to get worse given the \ndemographics. Those who tell us about the future say, given that the \nchildren who were born during the baby boom of the eighties will start \nto reach the potential ages for the commission of crimes, that we are \nin for real problems if we don't adjust the way we approach this \nproblem.\n  One of the areas that I think needs our attention most radically is \nthe area of juvenile crime records. Because we have thought of juvenile \ncriminal activity as being mischief or inconsequential, we have decided \nto keep any records of juvenile activities very, very closely guarded. \nAnd we have an anomalous situation where we have juveniles who are not \ntreated as criminals even though they have committed crimes like \nmurder, rape, armed robbery, armed assault.\n  They are sent into our classrooms, and yet the teacher in the \nclassroom has no capacity of knowing what the student has done. As a \nmatter of fact, frequently, with the mobility that exists in the \nAmerican culture now, people move from one State to another and they \ntake their children with them, or the children move from one\n\n[[Page S5895]]\n\nState to another, and their record exists only in one State.\n  They go into a school room, they go into a community, and the law \nenforcement community does not know about the heritage of criminal \nactivity, the history of the individual, the threatening nature, the \nviolent proclivities of an individual. They do not have such \ninformation because the juvenile records have not been available. \nJuvenile records have been sealed, and law enforcement officials and \nschool officials simply have not had access.\n  In the few States where they have had some access, that access is \nlimited to students who committed the criminal activity within the \nState. We all know about the interstate mobility of people in our \nculture. As a matter of fact, those individuals who get in trouble \nfrequently are the same individuals who are most active in crossing \nState lines. Our law enforcement officials need better access to \njuvenile records.\n  Our school officials need access. I talked to a teacher who said that \nindividuals were assigned to her classroom who were wearing electronic \nshackles. You know, that is the new technology where you put a bracelet \naround someone's foot. It is very durable plastic and cannot be cut off \neasily. It has a transmitter so law enforcement officials can know the \nwhereabouts of the person wearing the electronic shackle.\n  The teacher says that the students are capable of coming into the \nroom and the teacher cannot know what they have done. I would be very, \nvery reluctant as a teacher to see a student with an electronic shackle \non his or her ankle reflecting the likelihood that some kind of very \nserious offense had taken place and still not have any ability to know \nwhat that student had done.\n  The student comes from another State and has been assigned to a \njuvenile facility in your State but the record is sealed. You are \nsupposed to turn your back on such a student and write on the board, \nnot knowing whether the student is a rapist or a murderer. I find that \nto be a very serious challenge to the kind of atmosphere we need in the \nclassrooms. At least I think school officials have a special need.\n  I talked to a judge one time who was sentencing an individual for a \nvery, very serious crime and did not have access to the records of this \nindividual, who had lived in another State previous to the crime, and \nlater learned that the individual had been involved in previous \nhomicides.\n  I think judges, when they are issuing penalties, need to know what \nthe history of an individual is, what kind of criminal activity has \nfilled the past of that individual--not just the things that have \nhappened since the person turned 18--because some of these individuals, \ngiven the violent criminal nature that pervades some components of the \njuvenile community, have a rap sheet that would extend from here to \nCincinnati in terms of detailing violent activity that ought to be \nbefore the sentencing authority.\n  Juvenile records simply do not survive the juvenile's 18th birthday, \nand in many situations people start out with a clean slate. I think it \nis great to allow people to start over again in life. I think that is \nthe marvelous part of what America has meant through the years. We let \npeople get new starts in this country. But I think we have to protect \nourselves. We should not say to anybody, ``You can do anything you want \nup to the time you are 18, and then you get to wipe it all clean and \nyou'll be considered to be an Eagle Scout until your first offense, and \nthen, even then, the judge won't be able to find what's happened to \nyou.''\n\n  I really believe that inadequate records hamper law enforcement \nauthorities. According to Police Chief David G. Walchak, who is the \nimmediate past president of the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, law enforcement is in desperate need of access to juvenile \ncriminal records. The police chief said:\n\n       Current juvenile records (both arrest and adjudication) are \n     inconsistent across [State lines], and are usually \n     unavailable to the various programs' staff who work with \n     youthful offenders.\n\n  It seems to me that if we are going to try to work with young people \nto have them change what they have done, allowing the juvenile justice \nsystem to hide what they have done is not really a way for us to \nconfront the past and to change it. We cannot be clouding it and \nconcealing it if we want to change it. I think to make real change you \nhave to confront what has happened and move forward.\n  Chief Walchak also notes:\n\n       If we in [law enforcement] don't know who the youthful \n     offenders are, we can't appropriately intervene.\n\n  Part of our ability to prevent criminal behavior by the individuals \nis to have the ability to identify people who have had problems in the \npast. He has put it very clearly. Here is a police chief who wants to \ndo what is right. That is not just to punish crime, but to prevent it, \nto try to intervene to make sure we do not have these challenges over \nand over again. We have his hands tied because we have an outdated \napproach to juvenile records.\n  Well, Senate bill 10, which the Senator from Alabama has so \nappropriately noticed as a bill of monumental change and reconstruction \nin terms of our capacity to address these challenges, makes some \nserious reforms that will help us solve these problems.\n  The bill would provide incentive grants for States to fingerprint and \nphotograph juveniles who are arrested for or charged with violent \ncrimes and to send those fingerprints and photographs to the FBI and to \ncreate and maintain records of juvenile convictions and to share those \nwith criminal courts, law enforcement agencies, and school officials.\n  If we really want our schools to do well, we cannot have them \noperating in the dark as to who is populating the classroom.\n  For States to qualify for these funds, States would have to maintain \njuvenile records that are equivalent to adult records and to make those \nrecords available to the FBI, to law enforcement officers of any \njurisdiction, to school officials, and to courts for use in sentencing.\n  It is the kind of thing that I suppose the average American says, \n``That's common sense. I wonder why we haven't been doing that.'' We \nought to do it for people who are committing acts which are felonious \nin nature and which, if committed by an adult, would result in long-\nterm incarceration. At a minimum, we ought to allow schoolteachers to \nknow if individuals in their classrooms have been involved in that kind \nof activity.\n  The bill will also make records available across State lines. Given \nthe mobility of the American population, it does not make sense to \nthink we can compartmentalize our approach to individuals who are not \ngoing to be compartmentalized and should not be.\n  Senate bill 10 mandates that States send records to the FBI. It will \nenable State and Federal authorities to make assessments based on the \njuvenile's entire record. That is not only in the best interest of the \nculture and the best interest of the society, but, frankly, it is in \nthe best interest of an accused juvenile. It does not serve anyone's \ninterest to have a judgment rendered on the basis of inadequate data.\n  We do not make good decisions when we do not have the facts. And \ncourts cannot make good decisions when they do not have the facts. And \nschools cannot make good decisions when they do not have the facts. The \ntruth is, all we are asking is that the records be made available to \nindividuals so that they make better decisions, and we can do a better \njob of curtailing a problem that threatens us sorely. This bill would \nhelp get that done.\n\n  A Federal solution is critical. Only if all States participate can we \nensure that critical law enforcement and judicial decisions are based \non the entire record. This is a concept which has been agreed to for \ncenturies in America. In law enforcement, crime records have been \nshared because of the responsibility for public safety. They are \nclearly matters that are of interest to every State, and they are \nindeed matters which have long and traditionally been understood as \nmatters in which the States need to cooperate and coordinate.\n  The bill ensures that juvenile records do not disappear when \njuveniles turn 18. The truth of the matter is, law enforcement and \nother officials need to make sure that that information is still \navailable. The bill ensures that juvenile records are made available to \nthose who need them. Courts will be able to sentence criminals based on\n\n[[Page S5896]]\n\ntheir entire record, not just what has happened since their 18th \nbirthday.\n  Law enforcement officials will be able to monitor the behavior of \nindividuals in their community who are known to be violent and to have \ncriminal predilections. Teachers and other school officials will know \nwho they have in their classrooms.\n  To think that we have to do that to address this problem is a little \nbit of a shock to me. I would be much more at ease to say to \nschoolteachers, ``We're going to let you find out and know about the \nindividuals that populate your classrooms.'' I cannot imagine that they \nwould not want that.\n  Records sharing. This whole concept of helping us have an orderly \nculture where we send a clear message about the nature of criminal \nactivity and the fact that it is unacceptable and we will not tolerate \nit. It is not something that is a partisan issue. This is something \nthat compels all of us to unite, to send the right message to the young \npeople of America that we take crime seriously because we view their \npersonal integrity and safety as a serious matter and that we will not \ntreat them lightly if they are involved in rape, murder, armed robbery, \narmed assault, major drug trafficking, or other felonious activity, \nbecause we care about their future and care about the future of the \ncountry in which they live.\n  I look forward to the debate on this measure, to continuing with this \nmeasure in committee to make sure that we shape the bill properly as it \ncomes to the floor of the U.S. Senate. I look forward to a time when \nthe President of the United States will sign into law this kind of \nbill, which would help us send a message about the kind of tomorrow \nthat we have the privilege and prerogative of shaping by developing \npublic policy that respects not only the future of juveniles but also \nthe present of individuals who have been victimized as a result of \njuvenile crime and violence, which is far too prevalent in our society.\n  I commend the Senator from Alabama for his excellent work in this \nrespect. I look forward to working with him and welcoming him to the \nState of Missouri this weekend where we will be conducting hearings \nregarding the serious challenges with youth violence which we all face.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I want to express my appreciation for the exceptional \nremarks made by the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft. He has \ntalked to us as one who has authority. He has spoken from his heart. He \nhas spoken the truth. He has identified a problem in criminal justice, \nand he is absolutely correct. If you had 5,000 law enforcement officers \nand prosecutors in here and they were listening to that, they would \nsay, ``Yes, that is correct. He is telling the truth.''\n\n  We do not do a favor to young offenders or to the justice system or \nto judges or to probation officers or to mothers and fathers, if we do \nnot allow the full truth of people's criminal backgrounds to be known. \nAll over America, police officers--many may not know this--are denied \nthe right to maintain fingerprints and photographs of young offenders. \nThis information cannot be held anywhere outside of the juvenile court \nbecause of the secrecy laws.\n  This bill does not mandate the elimination of secrecy laws. This bill \ndoes not eliminate that great tradition that we adhere to of trying to \ngive young offenders a chance to get their lives back in order and to \nlive life without a criminal record held over their heads. But it does \nsay that records ought to be made available to the criminal justice \nsystem. When a young offender at age 17 commits armed robbery, and is \nlater arrested in another State at age 19, that police chief, that \nprosecutor, or the judge who sentences him for his acts in the second \nState, needs to know what kind of prior criminal history he has.\n  The National Crime Information Center houses confidential criminal \nrecords solely for law enforcement purposes. I think it is a needed \ntool and a tremendous step forward.\n  The Director of the FBI appeared before the Judiciary Committee just \n2 weeks ago. I asked him this very question. He said: ``Yes, law \nenforcement needs that information. Yes, the FBI will receive it if \nit's sent to us from the States. We need it, and we do not need any \nadditional money to process it.''\n  Now, some have said it will cost huge sums of money for the States to \nimplement this. That is, in my opinion, clearly incorrect. We have had \nthis claim studied by a professional group. Their results show that $50 \nmillion is more than enough to handle implementation, and this bill has \n$50 million in it for this purpose.\n  I doubt it will cost that much. In many areas of our Nation, it costs \nvery little for a local juvenile court to simply report an arrest or \nconviction and send it off to the FBI. There is almost no cost \nwhatsoever. Some of the cities may want to have computer terminals and \ndedicated personnel. The money this bill provides will be more than \nadequate.\n  Previous funding for juvenile justice in America was $170 million. \nUnder this bill, it would go to $700 million, a more than threefold \nincrease in expenditures because we want to do something about the \ncrime problem.\n  Adult crime has been dropping for the last half-dozen years. We have \nmade some real progress in that regard. One of the main reasons for \nthat decrease is that we have doubled and tripled prison space for \nrepeat adult offenders. Prison does work to reduce crime, but we have \nnot done anything in the realm of juvenile crime to compensate for the \ndramatic increases that are occurring.\n  According to the Department of Justice's own study, juvenile crime \nwill double by the year 2010. We need to begin to deal with that. It \nhas already doubled in the last 10 years. Juveniles are committing \nserious crimes, as the Senator from Missouri said, including robbery, \nmurders, rapes. Those are the kind of crimes we must crack down on.\n  One thing that is important for us, as U.S. Senators to understand, \nis that juvenile justice has historically been and will remain a \nprovince of the States. Mr. President, 99.99 percent of juvenile crime \ncases are tried in State courts. We need to improve the ability of \nFederal courts to prosecute certain selected juvenile crime cases. This \nbill will do that. Still, juvenile crime cases will remain the province \nof the States. So if we want to improve juvenile justice, Mr. \nPresident, we need to help these States improve their system. That is \nwhat this bill does.\n  Now, what is the problem with the Federal system? As a U.S. attorney \nfor 12 years, I know the problem. If you wanted to prosecute a young \noffender in Federal court, an offender who appropriately should be \nprosecuted in Federal court, a number of things have to occur for this \nto happen. First, you have to get approval from the U.S. Department of \nJustice. Second, you have to seek certification of that young offender \nas an adult to be tried in the Federal system. Before you can do that, \nthe offender has the right to appeal. Often when that appeal takes \nplace it goes to the circuit courts of the United States and a year or \nmore may go by before the case ever comes up for trial. As a practical \nmatter, it is virtually impossible to effectively prosecute routine or \neven significant juvenile cases in Federal court. We have shut the door \nto Federal court.\n  I do not believe that the Federal courts should take over juvenile \nprosecutions throughout America, but they ought to be able to prosecute \ncertain cases that are appropriate to be prosecuted in Federal court. \nWe need to reform that system. This bill does it. It removes the appeal \nprocess. It would allow a U.S. attorney, in many circumstances, to make \nthe decision on his own as to whether or not to prosecute and bring \nthat case to trial, just like any other criminal case. So we are going \nto have some very good improvements in that regard in the Federal \nsystem.\n  In addition, Senator Hatch and Senator Feinstein have worked hard on \na proposal to crack down on the violent gang activity that is \ndisturbing so many areas of this country. In fact, gang activity occurs \nin every State in America. This bill includes very good, very tough, \nFederal antigang legislation that will help us break up these organized \nactivities and will help us put an end to that kind of dangerous gang \nactivity. We are pleased this bill will do that.\n  The Senator from Missouri mentioned a very important thing and that\n\n[[Page S5897]]\n\nis the question of intervention. Professionals in counseling talk about \nit frequently. By intervention they mean that a person who is on a bad \nroad, who is heading down the road to destruction, who is making \nserious mistakes either in term of drugs, alcohol, or criminality, \nneeds something to happen to intervene in that process or that person \nwill end up being destroyed by that problem.\n\n  That is what this bill attempts to do, both by recordkeeping, so we \ncan identify whether or not this is a repeat offender so that the judge \nand the prosecutor will know that when they deal with sentencing, and \nalso through drug testing. We know that in the District of Columbia, \nwhere drug testing of every arrestee is done today, 66 percent of the \npersons tested test positive for some sort of drug in their system. \nThat is a significant statistic. Do not think, Mr. President, that this \nis only true of Washington. There are cities all over America that have \nbeen involved in testing programs like this, typically to determine the \nconnection between drugs and crime, and their results consistently show \nthat from 60 percent to 70 percent of their arrestees for criminal \nactivity test positive for drugs in their system.\n  When a young offender appears before a juvenile judge, that judge \nneeds to know, if he wants to help that child--by crafting a penalty or \na sanction that will help change his lifestyle--whether or not that \nperson is drug free or whether he is using drugs.\n  This bill will mandate that the States test every offender upon \narrest, and it provides more than enough money to pay for that mandate. \nWe are not doing an unfunded mandate. The bill provides more than \nenough money to pay for that provision. To me, drug testing is an \nessential aspect of any criminal justice system. When a young person is \narrested, the judge needs to know, his probation officer needs to know, \nhis parents need to know, whether or not drugs are a contributing \nfactor to that young person's criminal activity.\n  Eric Holder, who just appeared before the Judiciary Committee as the \nnominee for Deputy Attorney General of the United States, a position \nwhich is second in command at the U.S. Department of Justice, was a \nformer Federal judge in the District of Columbia and is the current \nU.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. I asked him about drug \ntesting, specifically whether he thought it was a good idea. He said, \n``Absolutely. We did it regularly in Washington, DC. As a judge, that \nis the kind of information I had to have to make the right kind of \ndecisions about whether offenders should be released, how they should \nbe treated, and what kind of punishment they should have.''\n  Mr. President, drug testing is not designed to set up a situation \nwhere juvenile offenders would be prosecuted again for another crime. \nThat is not the purpose. It does not sustain a prosecution for a crime. \nBut what it does do is provide the judge, the probation officer, the \nprosecutor, and the family, with the knowledge that the young person \nhas a problem with drugs. To me, any effective juvenile justice system \nthat does not have regular drug testing as a part of it is an \nineffective system. It fails to meet the basic requirements of what a \nlegitimate criminal justice system is. We are trying to reach out all \nover America by supplying funds to help the States and the localities \nhave the kind of resources they need to do drug testing and improve the \ncurrent system.\n  Some have raised the question that this is a violation of civil \nrights; that you cannot make an arrestee be tested. Well, they are \nbeing tested all over America already upon arrest. They have been \ntested in the District of Columbia every day for over 20 years. Jay \nCarver, who just resigned from that program, had led it for 20 years. \nHe knows how that program works and he supports it. It is not a civil \nrights violation. When a person is arrested for a crime, a judge has \nthe discretion to determine whether or not to release that individual \nfrom custody. If the judge has the power to keep a person's very \nliberty, to deny him his right to walk out of court and be a free \nperson, he certainly has the right to say you can be released from \ncustody on probation or on bail but you have to maintain certain curfew \nhours and you have to submit to drug testing. That is a far less \nintrusive intervention in that person's life. Also, we find the cost of \nthose tests are $5 to $6 for initial drug screening. We believe that is \na very inexpensive way to deal with this.\n\n  Again, as I view the drug testing program, it is a diagnostic tool. \nIt is a tool to help identify the real problem that a child might be \nfacing and to help the justice system and the parents develop a \nstrategy to deal with that.\n  There are a number of other parts of this bill that we think are \nextremely important and will help to actually reduce juvenile crime in \nAmerica. Those things include removing unnecessary and burdensome \nmandates that law enforcement tells me cause young offenders to be \nreleased routinely for offenses they should never be released for. They \ntell me over and over that the young offenders are laughing at them \nbecause of their inability to carry out sanctions.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to take this opportunity to recognize \nthe distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici. He has had \na very strong interest in juvenile justice. He has submitted \nlegislation on that that has been made a part of this legislation. I am \ndelighted he is here.\n  I am prepared to yield any time he desires to share his thoughts on \nthis important subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, how much time do you have?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. We have until the end of the hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair observes that the Senator has 23 \nminutes and 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will try to use less than 10 minutes.\n  First of all, Mr. President, let me commend the Judiciary Committee, \nand in particular, the subcommittee chaired by the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama, Senator Sessions.\n  Frankly, I am of the opinion that it takes us too long to address \nissues that are obviously important to the American people. That is why \nI urge we not let this year pass without passing a major Federal reform \nof our Nation's juvenile justice system.\n  The Federal juvenile justice system is a very small part of the \noverall justice system, but it does have a very big impact on how \nthings are going out in the States, and in many instances needs reform \nso it does not stand in the way of the difficult job that our cities \nand States have in this new evolving era of juvenile crime. I am sure \nsome of the talks on the floor of the Senate today have indicated some \nof the areas we must reform. I will leave that to those who are on the \ncommittee. Those are patent. They are clear. But they will be highly \ncontroversial.\n  Nonetheless, we should do something to make sure that our laws are \nnot in the way of cities, counties, and States--reasonable, rational \nefforts to control this major, major criminal epidemic.\n  Having said that, I believe we also ought to take a lead role in \nsuggesting to our States that if they want some Federal help, then they \nmust modernize their juvenile justice systems.\n  It is very strange in America, that we have had for many, many years \nan adult system of justice, a penal system, probation, and the like. \nWhat is new to America is that more and more of the crime is being \ncommitted by young people from 13 to 18 years of age. The proportions \nare exponential in terms of growth of juvenile crime of a serious \nnature.\n  I am not talking about when we were growing up, maybe shoplifting or \ntruancy, which is probably 90 percent of what the police were concerned \nabout with kids. Now it is murder, it is gangs, it is thievery, it is \ndrive-by shootings, it is all kinds of violent criminal acts that are \nscaring the adult population for two reasons. They are fearful for \ntheir own lives, and they also wonder what will happen to this \ngeneration of teenagers if that group committing these crimes grows and \ngrows. Where will we end up incarcerating them?\n  Mr. President and fellow Senators, there is no question the system is \nnot working. Go to your States and ask how many times must a teenager \ncommit a serious, serious crime before they are taken from society and \nput into some kind of penal system to try to keep them from committing \nmore\n\n[[Page S5898]]\n\ncrimes and try to help them. It is startling. In many jurisdictions \nthey commit as many as 10 to 15 serious crimes before anything is done \nto them. It is amazing how ancient, archaic, and broken down the \njuvenile justice system is. It didn't come into being and take a long, \nlong time to perfect itself. It was put together in little pieces and \npatchwork, where it actually, in many instances, just doesn't work.\n\n  Now, what we have tried to do--Senator John Ashcroft and I have \nintroduced a bill that does a lot of things. But after participating in \na series of hearings in New Mexico and talking to victims, it was \nabsolutely something that, as long as you are a Senator, you won't hear \nanything worse than hearing from the victim of teenage violence. I \nheard from a beautiful young girl who is a dancer, who for no reason \nwas just stabbed in the throat. She was doing nothing, not causing any \ncommotion at all. We heard about the trauma that beset that young woman \nand her family and the way the juvenile justice system treated her and \nthe family. It is as if the only thing that counted was the \naccommodation of the criminal, not the victim.\n  But what we would like to do is to set up a $500 million program that \nis essentially an incentive grant program. Part of it will go to the \nStates just to help them with juvenile justice, and the other part will \ngo to States who choose certain options to modernize their system and \nmake it work better. What we heard over and over again is that we wait \ntoo long before we do anything to correct the situation among \nteenagers.\n  Now, anybody that has been a parent--and I have, and I note the \noccupant of the chair has, my dear friend, because I hear about them \noften. If you let them get away with little things and more little \nthings and more little things, and you do nothing, when they do \nsomething a little worse, it is too late. If you wait long enough, \nwithout some corrective measures, you will find yourself engulfed in \nserious misbehavior. Kids learn by receiving some kind of punishment \nfor every misdeed and wrong act they do. Even if it is a tiny \npunishment, to know that they are not getting away with it and they \nmust shape up is obvious to everyone who has raised children. The \njustice system must do that also. No misdeed must go unattended, \nregardless of how small, even though the punishment would be small. We \ncall this graduated sanctions, and it is an important part of our bill.\n  We have set out in our bill, which we hope will be incorporated, a \nnumber of things like that. And many, many other important reforms that \nwe found out there in our hearings would have to be adopted by our \nStates if they desire to receive additional money to help them in this, \nwhat must be a war on teenage crime.\n  If we wait too much longer, we are going to, once again, be a joke as \nthe Federal Government. We are going to come along and society is hit \nwith this pending disaster. They are will wonder where the Federal \nGovernment was. Some Senators are going to come to the floor--I hope \nnot many--and say it is none of our business. The States ought to take \ncare of crime.\n  I will tell you, I have learned that there is no easy way to draw a \nline about what is our business as a Nation and what is a State's \nbusiness as a State. But we can all say that the one thing that is not \ngetting any better in America is juvenile crime. It is getting worse. \nAs statistics show, some of the adult crimes are coming down a bit. The \nSenator has been part of these hearings. But, juvenile crime continues \nto go up and up.\n  So I am very hopeful, and I challenge our leadership--I already know \nwhat our distinguished leader Trent Lott thinks about this. But I think \nat the first opportunity we have we ought to get this bill reported out \nand get it to the floor. The public would be very excited about a \ndebate on this issue. We debate many things they aren't interested in. \nBut they would be interested in this and in the philosophy, and perhaps \nthe difference in philosophy between the two parties on this, too.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding time and for arranging this \nmorning's discussion on this very, very important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the comments of \nthe Senator from New Mexico. People are angry. We need to do better. \nThere was a case in Alabama 2 years ago where three juveniles murdered \na man. Those 3 offenders had 7, 8 and 15 prior arrests each and yet \nthey were out on the streets murdering somebody. He is exactly correct. \nWe need a system of increased sanctions, and this bill calls for \ngraduated sanctions. That means increasing the punishment for each \noffense to send a message that juvenile offenders are not going to walk \nfree.\n\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to have Senator DeWine from Ohio here. \nHe is a former prosecutor, former Lieutenant Governor of the State of \nOhio, who has great knowledge in these law enforcement matters. He is a \nleader on the Judiciary Committee, a leader on our committee to reform \njuvenile justice. I am pleased to yield to him at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for the \ngreat work he has done as the subcommittee chairman. Let me also \ncompliment my colleague from New Mexico, as well as my colleague from \nMissouri, for the great work that they have done to call the attention \nof the Senate to an issue that is certainly on the minds of the \nAmerican people, and that is the issue of juvenile crime.\n  We always have the question, as my colleague from New Mexico has \npointed out, of what is the proper role of the Federal Government in \nwhat has historically been a matter that has been dealt with by the \nStates. I think there is a role. I think what is important, as we look \nat Senate bill 10, which is currently in the Judiciary Committee, \nawaiting markup--as we look at that draft, it's important for us, with \nthe finite amount of money that we do have to spend, that we spend that \nmoney wisely, and that we spend it with an understanding that the \ncriminal justice system, particularly the juvenile justice system, is \ninherently a local system. So what we need to do in Congress is to do \nthose things that matter, to do those things that maybe only the \nFederal Government can do to try to give assistance to the local \ncommunities. So we need to sit back, I think, and think about what that \nis, what can be our unique contribution.\n  I want to talk this morning about one particular area that we have \nbeen able to get in the draft of the bill, which the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Sessions, has been very much supportive of. It is \nan area that I have worked on for a number of years, going back to the \ntime when I was a county prosecutor, and that is the sorry state--if I \ncan use that term--of our criminal records system in this country. I \nhave worked long and hard to try to improve that system. It is an area \nwhere the Federal Government can be of assistance because the reality \nis that what happens in Ohio affects what happens in New Mexico and \nwhat happens in Alabama, as far as the keeping of criminal records. If \nOhio doesn't put our records in the system and someone from Ohio goes \nto New Mexico and commits a crime, then New Mexico is the loser because \nthe local law enforcement does not have that information. So this is an \narea where we have a national system, administered by the FBI--a \ncriminal records system for adults, administered by the FBI. But if we \ndon't get the local input and information, then it doesn't do any good.\n  That same principle applies to juveniles. The only difference is, \nhistorically, we have not shared records of juvenile offenders. We have \nproceeded under the assumption that a person who commits a crime in \nOhio before the age of 18 is a juvenile. Their records are sealed. They \nare not available to anyone. In fact, they may not even be available \noutside the county in which the individual committed the crime, or with \nthe individual in Ohio, where that person resides. That is where the \nrecords are kept.\n  I think we now understand that, with violent crime increasing among \n15-year-olds, 16-year-olds, 17-year-olds, even 13- and 14-year-olds, it \nmakes absolutely no sense and is very counterproductive and dangerous \nfor us to continue that old mindset that says we are going to protect \nthe record of this juvenile, even if this juvenile has committed \nmurder, even if this juvenile has committed rape, or a whole series of\n\n[[Page S5899]]\n\nwhat would be felonies if committed by an adult.\n\n  What this bill does is it says enough is enough. We have to change \nthe policy in this country that says we protect these records, and we \nhave to make these records available to law enforcement for legitimate \nlaw enforcement purposes--which means prosecutors, police, sheriff \ndepartments--so that when a 16-year-old commits a crime in Greene \nCounty, OH, and they show up a year later in New Mexico and commit \nanother crime, there is a national database, and that there has been \ninformation put in that database so the officials in New Mexico know \nthat this is not a first-time offender, that this person has a bad \ntrack record, and they have committed whatever they have committed in \nthe State of Ohio.\n  We live in a very mobile society. We live in a society where families \nare broken down, which means, tragically, young children move from \ncommunity to community. For our own self-protection, it is vitally \nimportant that this information follow that individual. This is what \nthis bill addresses. We will have the opportunity on the floor later to \ntalk in much greater detail about what this does.\n  I want to use a real life example, if I could, which I think \nillustrates the need for this type of tracking and for the money that \nthis bill provides for the local communities to have this kind of \ntracking.\n  Let me tell the story about ``Jack.'' That is not his real name. What \nhe did was very, very real. When Jack was 12 years old, he was arrested \nfor vandalizing a neighbor's house, wrecking the furniture and drowning \nthe neighbor's pet bird in the bathtub. When Jack was 14, he was \nburglarizing another apartment. The elderly man who owned the apartment \ncame home and found Jack there and confronted him. Jack and the elderly \nman struggled, as a result of which the elderly man broke his hip, and, \ntragically, this man then died a few days later of pneumonia. Jack was \nconvicted of involuntary manslaughter.\n  Let's go forward, Mr. President, 5 more years. Jack is now 19. He \nbreaks into a house and severely beats a 45-year-old woman who lives \nthere. Jack is arrested for this. It is his first adult crime because \nnow he is 19. A Cleveland judge has to sentence Jack, and because all \nhis juvenile offenses aren't available to the court, the judge is \ndealing with a person who he thinks is a first-time offender. Jack got \nprobation. This is a true story. Two months later, he burglarized \nanother home and killed the 81-year-old man who lived there. The judge \nhad to make a crucial decision in this particular case where we are \ntalking about Jack, a decision vitally affecting the public safety of \nthe judge's community. But he had to make that decision, which turned \nout to be a decision which cost someone their life; he had to make it \nin a state of legally enforced mandatory ignorance. It wasn't the \njudge's fault, it was the system's fault.\n  What we intend to do by this legislation is to help change that \nculture, change that system, so that a judge who is faced with making a \nlife-or-death decision will know whether or not this person is a first \noffender or whether, as in the case of Jack, he had a long record of \nnot just scrapes with the law but a long record of violence. If a judge \nknew that, the judge's decision would be very different than if he did \nnot know that fact.\n  I see that my time is about up. Again, I thank the Chair. I thank my \ncolleague from Alabama for the great work he has done on this piece of \nlegislation. I have taken a few minutes to talk about just one of the \naspects of the legislation. There are many other parts that have been \ndiscussed. I look forward to working with him and the other Members of \nthe Senate as we bring this bill to the floor this year, as we pass it, \nas we send it on to the President.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield a moment, I think it would be \ninstructive if he would share, from his personal experience as \nLieutenant Governor and working in this area, the importance of \nrecords. He, more than any Member of this body, has firsthand \nexperience in that area.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I will do this very briefly in the time we have. When I \nwas Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, I was in charge of the seven different \nagencies in our administration that had anything to do with law \nenforcement. One of the things that we tried to do is to improve our \ncriminal records. This was, as I said, a longstanding interest of mine \nthat went back to the time when I was a county prosecutor. When I first \nstarted looking at this as Lieutenant Governor, I was shocked by what I \nfound. What I found is that the accuracy of the adult criminal records \nsystem in Ohio left a lot to be desired, and that is a nice way of \nsaying it.\n  I was even further shocked when I found that Ohio was pretty typical. \nIt is pretty much the same as we find in most other States.\n  When I first started looking at it, I asked the question to our State \nemployees: How accurate are criminal records? I got something back \nlike, ``Well, we think they are about 40 percent accurate.'' Six months \nlater, after they really look into this, they found they were about 12 \npercent totally accurate.\n  What happens is, as people are arrested it goes into the system but \nyou don't get the final disposition going in. You don't get the \ninformation, if the person is convicted, or, in some cases, if the \nperson is acquitted. So you try to determine how totally accurate the \nrecords are.\n  What we find in most States is that clearly less than 50 percent of \nthe criminal records are accurate. That is the adult system. But what \nwe are dealing with here is the juvenile system. And in most States we \nare just barely beginning to establish the juvenile recordkeeping \nsystem.\n  The money in this bill will help the States establish that system, \nhelp put it online, and help make it accurate.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Ohio very much.\n  Mr. President, I believe our time has about expired. I ask unanimous \nconsent for 2 minutes to wrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Chair observes that the \nSenator from Alabama still has approximately 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Very good.\n  Mr. President, first I would again like to thank the Senator from \nOhio for his support and for his insight, certainly shared by the \nDirector of the FBI, on the importance of having a national crime \ninformation center for the criminal history of violent young offenders.\n  Mr. President, Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, is today in the Finance Committee markup--a very, very \nimportant meeting. He could not be with us. But we are both proud of \nthis bill. The Hatch-Sessions bill has the potential to really reduce \ncrime.\n  One of the things that has been talked about and that we have heard a \nlot about is prevention money. I will assert with absolute confidence \nthat the certainty of swift punishment is a necessary tool in the \nprevention of crime.\n  As other Senators have said, our juvenile justice system in this \nNation is broken. Ask your local police officer anywhere in this \nNation, and they will tell you that it is not working effectively. We \ncannot allow that to continue.\n  This legislation will mandate certain reforms. It will help fund \nother reforms. And it will do one thing that we have to do, and that is \nto increase bed space and detention space for violent juvenile \noffenders. We have not spent that kind of money in the past. We have \nincreased adult detention space three and fourfold, but we have not \nacted accordingly for young offenders.\n  This bill will provide matching money, which acts as the biggest \nsource of our money in this bill. And we will have a lot of money in \nthe bill that will help go towards prevention in a lot of different \nways.\n  But I want to make this point for all of America to understand. \nClearly this Congress and this Nation is involved already in \nprevention. This bill is designed to fix a broken juvenile justice \nsystem. We have to do that. And we cannot allow people to have 7, 8, 15 \ndifferent arrests and not be held accountable for that.\n  Let me show you this chart. The title of it is across the top: \n``Federal Programs for At-Risk or Delinquent Youth.''\n  These are juvenile prevention programs. There are 131 of these \nprograms\n\n[[Page S5900]]\n\nthat have been funded by this Government. We spend $170 million on \njuvenile crime. We already spend $4 billion on prevention programs \nthrough virtually every agency and department of Government.\n  Look at these things. The Department of Interior: Indian child \nwelfare groups; Department of Housing and Urban Development: The 4-H \ngroups, youth apprenticeships, youth sports programs: Department of \nLabor: Job training for homeless demonstration projects, summer youth \nemployment training, school to work opportunities, Youth Fair Chance; \nDepartment of Transportation: Youth-impaired driving techniques \nprojects; gang resistant education and training in the Department of \nthe Treasury.\n  So it is just on and on. One of the things Senator Thompson talks \nabout a lot is his belief that we have no idea about what works in \nterms of prevention. He is very frustrated by all of these programs \nwith no real belief in whether or not we know that they work.\n  So, in consultation with him--and Senator Hatch has agreed--we have \nadded to this bill a substantial sum of money for research to analyze \nthese programs to see which ones work.\n  We want to prevent crime, and we care about young offenders. But the \nmost crucial thing we are facing today is a situation like that of the \nyoung lady who Senator Domenici mentioned who was stabbed in the throat \nby a young violent offender, in which the juvenile justice system did \nnot work. Those offenders are not being properly processed, and when \napprehended are not properly punished.\n  This bill will mandate a series of graduated sanctions.

Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments concerning \nestate tax reform.\n  There are a number of things I support in the House tax bill. I am \npleased to see cuts in the capital gains tax, and I am pleased to see \ntax relief for families with children. However, I am very concerned \nwith the proposed adjustment of the estate tax. The estate tax has seen \na significant change since 1981, and the current $600,000 exemption has \nnever been adjusted for inflation. If it had been adjusted, it would be \nworth $840,000 today. The recommended adjustment in the House bill \nwould not even keep pace with inflation and would not ease the \nsubstantial economic burden placed on family businesses and farms.\n  The proposed Senate version is better but still needs improvement. It \nraises the exemption to $1 million to all estates by 2008 and would \nexempt an additional $1 million on family farm and business assets.\n  At the time of a person's death, their farm or business has already \nbeen subjected to Federal, State, and local tax. The estate tax is a \ndouble tax. The estate tax not only places a burden on assets that have \nalready been taxed but it does not discriminate between cash funds and \nthe nonliquid assets and property that make daily activities possible \nfor a family business or farm. These asset-rich, cash-poor businesses \ncan have their livelihood eliminated in order to pay a tax of up to 55 \npercent--up to 55 percent--of market value of the property left to \nthem. Ironically, the estate tax raises only 1 percent of the Federal \nGovernment's revenue but helps to prevent up to 75 percent of family \nbusinesses from being passed to a second generation. This practice \nthreatens the stability of our families and communities while \ninhibiting growth and economic development.\n  I strongly support estate tax relief. The current estate and gift tax \nsystem poses a great threat to family-owned businesses and farms. I am \na cosponsor of legislation to increase unified credit and to index it \nfor inflation. I am also a cosponsor of legislation to eliminate the \nestate tax entirely.\n  Repeal of the estate tax would benefit the economy. George Mason \nUniversity Professor Richard Wagner has stated that the elimination of \nthe estate tax would enhance the output of the country by $79.2 \nbillion--I repeat, by $79.2 billion--and would create up to 228,000 \njobs. Unfortunately, under the current system, the energy that could go \ninto greater productivity is expended by selling off businesses, \ndividing resources and preparing for the absorption of an estate by the \nGovernment.\n  The current system leads to the views of an Arizona citrus farmer who \nsaid of his family business, ``Instead of an inheritance, it's an \nalbatross.''\n  We must insist that no more American families lose their businesses \nbecause of the estate tax. We must assure that when a family is coping \nwith all the inevitable transition costs of passing a business from one \ngeneration to the next, the Federal Government is not there as an added \nburden. The working people of the United States deserve better.\n  Until we accomplish total repeal, I will be working to reduce the \nburden of this tax. I believe the exemption should be dramatically \nincreased and that the current 17 rates should be reduced to one low, \nflat rate. The estate tax should then be effectively abolished for \nfamily businesses and farms for as long as the assets remain in the \nfamily. No family business or farm should ever have to be liquidated \njust to pay the estate tax.\n  I look forward to working with the Senate Finance Committee to reform \nthis outdated and punitive tax system.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5900-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5900-S5901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to follow up on some comments that my \ncolleague from Colorado made. First, however, I should like to address \na subject briefly which has relevance to one of the bills we will be \ntaking up, if not today, then later this week, and that is the \nintelligence authorization bill.\n  This is a bill which should not have a great deal of controversy \nsurrounding it. It provides for the funding of the intelligence \nagencies of the United States and the substantive policy that governs \nour intelligence activities, but it is especially relevant and \npropitious, I think, that we take up that bill this week following the \nnews accounts of the arrest and incarceration of a man whose name is \nKanzi, ostensibly from Pakistan, who is the alleged perpetrator of a \nviolent crime against employees of the CIA a few years ago here in the \nWashington, DC, area.\n  The reason I bring this up now is to make two points. One, we \nfrequently hear the stories when things go wrong in law enforcement and \nin particular in operations involving our intelligence agencies. We try \nto learn from those lessons, but there have been bitter experiences \nwith which we have had to deal. What we do not hear so much about are \nthe many, many successes that go unreported, frequently because they \ninvolve law enforcement or intelligence activities that simply cannot\n\n[[Page S5901]]\n\nbe disclosed publicly. They involve classified material, sources, and \nmethods of collection of information which we simply cannot discuss or \nwe would be compromising those sources and methods.\n  So these stories are not told, and it is too bad because I think the \nAmerican people, in order to support our law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies, need to appreciate the work that they do and the \ndanger that they frequently face and the many times in which by their \nactions American lives are saved and yet we do not even know about it.\n  In this case, the details will have to come out later. We have been \nbriefed, and certainly there is a very fine story to be told here. But \nthe details will have to come out later. What we can say at this point \nis that this will be found to be yet another example of where American \nlaw enforcement officials played a key role in bringing to justice a \nterrorist, a person who at least allegedly has committed a heinous \ncrime and hopefully, as a result of that information coming out, we \nwill be supportive of agencies such as the FBI, such as the CIA, the \nDIA, and the other agencies, some of which we will be discussing in the \nintelligence authorization bill a little bit later.\n  The second point is that we will find, track down, take into our \njurisdiction, and prosecute terrorists. They can run, but they cannot \nhide. And they should note that we do not rest until we bring these \npeople to justice. If you look at the number of terrorist incidents \nover the last several years, in many, many cases we have found and we \nhave gained jurisdiction over and in some cases already prosecuted the \npeople who have perpetrated heinous crimes against society in general \nand frequently against Americans. We will continue to be successful in \ndoing that and in protecting American people if we are able to \nadequately fund and provide proper policies to guide our law \nenforcement agencies.\n  So when we take that bill up later, I hope that my colleagues will be \nsupportive and the American people will appreciate the continued \nnecessity of providing that kind of support. In the end it is what will \npreserve our democracy as well as peace around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5900-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TAX RELIEF FOR AMERICAN WORKING FAMILIES\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to briefly address the same subject my \ncolleague from Colorado addressed, and that is the proposition that \nAmericans are finally going to get some tax relief. The biggest tax \nrelief, as a matter of fact, in 16 years is about to be brought to the \nSenate floor for debate. It is uncertain yet precisely what some of the \ndetails are, but the Ways and Means Committee of the House of \nRepresentatives has put a plan on the table, the Finance Committee in \nthe Senate has put a plan on the table, and the members of that \ncommittee are working through the details of that bill.\n  We do know the general outline so far, and I think we can talk about \nthat and begin to lay the groundwork for debate in this Chamber on that \nhistoric tax cut for American working families. I think that is the \nfirst lesson to be learned here. I really deeply regret that some \npeople at the White House are already beginning to take political pot \nshots at this very worthwhile, bipartisan tax relief to be provided to \nAmerican families. It is the same old political rhetoric that it is a \ntax cut for the rich. That just does not fit this proposed tax cut. \nMost of the tax cuts are for average working families, and all of the \ntax cuts are good for the economy of this country. As a matter of fact, \nunder the proposal that the Senate Finance Committee began considering \nyesterday, three-fourths of all of the tax relief goes to families \nmaking less than $75,000 a year and that is not an atypical, two-parent \nworking family in America today. So with three-fourths of the benefits \ngoing to that income level, it is hardly to be characterized as a tax \ncut for the rich.\n  As a matter of fact, 83 percent of this proposed tax relief is in the \nform of relief to families with children, the $500 per child tax credit \nand the educational tax credit and other relief for families struggling \nto send their kids to school; 83 percent of the relief is of those two \ncomponents.\n  So let us not begin this important debate with some political \ndemagoguery about tax cuts for the rich, especially, Mr. President, \nsince the relief here, though historic, is quite modest in total \namount--less than 1 percent of the budget--because the negotiators, \nunder pressure from the White House to keep the tax cut small, agreed \nto a net of only $85 billion in tax cuts over a 5-year period.\n  Now, the Republican plan that was introduced at the beginning of this \nyear provided for $188 billion in relief and, frankly, that was not \nenough for many of us who felt it should have gone further, but at \nleast it was enough to provide meaningful relief in terms of the $500 \nper child tax credit, meaningful IRA relief, some capital gains relief, \nestate tax relief, and education relief. These are critical to the \nAmerican economy and to American families.\n  The $85 billion that is available to accommodate these five areas is \nnot going to provide adequate relief in any of them but at least it \nwill provide a start. I am a little disappointed in those who are \nalready attacking it as if it is too much for us to afford. It was \nnegotiated and agreed to by the White House. Therefore, I hope that we \nwill get some support because here in this body there is already \nbipartisan support for it. It involves, as I said, a phased-in $500-\nper-child tax credit for families with kids. It involves two different \nkinds of IRA tax relief. There is the $2,000 homemaker IRA relief for \nfamilies which do not have a pension for the homemaker. My wife always \nwondered why she could not fund an IRA the same way that I could fund \nan IRA. She worked just as hard as I did, even though she did not have \na wage-paying job. And we also have a backloaded IRA relief provided in \nthis package, so even in families where there is a pension, that \ndoesn't preclude them from the spouse having an IRA and being able to \nsave for future years.\n\n  We also provide capital gains tax relief, not as much as we would \nlike, but it ought to be enough to at least stimulate key parts of our \neconomy so we can continue to grow and provide jobs for all Americans \nfamilies. And, as I mentioned before, the educational component of this \nas well rounds out the relief.\n  The one area where we did not get very much relief is in the death \ntax that my colleague from Colorado talked about. I think the answer \nthere is simply this is not enough. Phasing in an exemption up to $1 \nmillion over an 11-year period is totally inadequate. But I think what \nthis will do is simply sharpen our interest in continuing to engage in \nthat debate and ensure that there will be greater relief from the death \ntax in future years. Obviously, it simply cannot all be accommodated \nwithin the $85 billion that was agreed to.\n  So I think as we begin this debate we should do so on a positive \nnote, on a constructive note, determining how we can work together to \nprovide meaningful tax relief to American families. If we do that, we \nwill succeed in helping the very people who need help in our society by \nensuring continued economic growth and by making good on our promise to \nthe American people for historic tax relief, the first in 16 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. Byrd addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in 1964, a tall, bright-eyed, 27-year-old \nHarvard graduate arrived in West Virginia as a VISTA volunteer, eager \nto take on the ills of poverty, eager to change the world, starting \nwith the small, rural town of Emmons, WV.\n  But things did not quite turn out for the young man exactly the way \nthat he expected them to. As John D. ``Jay'' Rockefeller, IV, quickly \ndiscovered, just as untold others have, there is something about West \nVirginia that gets into the blood and stirs the utmost depths of the \nsoul. One West Virginia newspaper in February of last year quoted him \nspeaking about those early days in Emmons. In that speech Jay \nRockefeller reflected ``In the end, I was the one who was transformed \nby the experience--completely transformed.'' Subsequently, Rockefeller \ndecided to move to West Virginia to live, rear a family, and build an \nimpressive career of public service that\n\n[[Page S5902]]\n\ncontinues to benefit West Virginians today.\n  Mr. President, today marks the 60th birthday of my colleague, Senator \nJay Rockefeller, and I take this opportunity to recognize this \nmilestone for my friend and ally, an outstanding Senator, and a \ndistinguished West Virginian.\n  You can, perhaps, imagine the eyebrows that were raised initially by \nWest Virginians, or some of them, when the young, energetic, wealthy \nRockefeller moved from New York to the foothills of their State.\n  He took a lot of ribbing early on--and I can tell you that it was not \nall good natured. Many did not see the match as one of perfect bliss. \nAt best it might have been described as the near equivalent of a James \nCarville-Mary Matalin union. But Jay Rockefeller endured with \ndetermination.\n  After serving a 2-year term in the West Virginia House of Delegates, \nRockefeller served 4 years as Secretary of State. Then, after a 3-year \nsabbatical from politics during which he served as the President of \nWest Virginia Wesleyan College in Buckhannon, he ran for and won the \nWest Virginia Governor's seat--not the kind of comfortable, overstuffed \nchair one might expect a Rockefeller to occupy in West Virginia.\n  Some in West Virginia have said that the sure way to end a political \ncareer in our State is to become Governor. I have referred to it, from \ntime to time, as a good jumping off place--not a place from which I \nwould particularly like to jump. It may well be our State's most \nunforgiving job. But Jay Rockefeller weathered the rough shoals of \ngubernatorial service in West Virginia and, in 1984, went on to win a \nU.S. Senate seat. That says a lot about his resolve, his vision and his \ndetermination.\n  Since his arrival in the Senate, I have watched Jay emerge as a \nstrong leader focusing on the needs and concerns that affect West \nVirginia and the Nation. He looks beyond the borders of West Virginia. \nThrough his work to improve the quality of life in West Virginia, Jay \nhas also won over many of those who were at first skeptical at the idea \nof a Rockefeller moving into mountaineer country.\n  Jay won his people over with hard work. He has focused his efforts on \naiding veterans and championed health care issues. Like so many others \nwho throughout the years have been cured by the healing waters of West \nVirginia's mountain springs, Jay Rockefeller has become an enthusiastic \nsalesman for West Virginia, boasting of its admirable, unequaled \nattributes to any potential convert and even drawing them in from far-\nflung locations around the globe. The long arms of Jay Rockefeller have \nreached even across the Pacific to Japan to help draw business \ninterests to the mountains and valleys of Appalachia. He can speak \nJapanese. He can write Japanese. He has studied the Japanese language.\n  I am glad that Jay made that life-changing decision to go to Emmons \nthree decades ago. Since that time he has made great strides toward \nimproving the quality of life for my people in my State, which he has \nproudly made his adopted home, as I have adopted West Virginia, my \nhome, having been born in North Carolina almost 80 years ago. Today, on \nhis 60th birthday, Senator Rockefeller's efforts to encourage \ndevelopment and prosperity all across West Virginia are well known. I \nsalute his efforts. And Erma and I wish Jay and his wife, Sharon, \ncontinued success and happiness for many years to come.\n  A poet whose name I do not recall said it perhaps best, and I shall \nuse the lines of that poet in saying happy birthday to Jay Rockefeller:\n\n     Count your garden by the flowers,\n     Never by the leaves that fall;\n     Count your days by the sunny hours,\n     Not remembering clouds at all.\n     Count your nights by stars, not shadows,\n     Count your life by smiles, not tears;\n     And on this beautiful June morning, Jay,\n     Count your age by friends, not years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5901-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, with sadness, I rise today to pay \ntribute to a remarkable member of the U.S. Senate, the senior Senator \nfrom Arkansas, Dale Bumpers. Senator Bumpers has announced his \nretirement after more than 25 years in public service, including the \nlast 22 years in the U.S. Senate. When Dale Bumpers leaves the Senate \nat the end of next year to return to his family and his beloved \nArkansas, I will miss his leadership and his friendship tremendously.\n  There has rarely been a Senator in this body with the courage of his \nconvictions like Dale Bumpers. During his time here, he has stood up \nvaliantly for the causes he believes in. He has been an advocate for \nhis home State and has fought against a number of Government projects \nthat he felt were wasteful or inefficient. His object has always been \nto protect the people of Arkansas and the American taxpayer. We have \nnot always agreed with each other on the merits of every project. But I \nhave always been able to count on Senator Bumpers' integrity, his \nhonesty, and his good humor.\n  When Senator Bumpers retires, I think my colleagues will agree that \nthe back of the Senate Chamber will never be the same. In an \ninstitution known for its orators, Senator Bumpers is among the most \naccomplished of them. His passion for public debate, and his commitment \nto justice have been obvious to all Senators when Dale Bumpers takes \nthe floor of the Senate. He speaks with eloquence and with feeling, \nwhether the issue is protecting our environment or cutting corporate \nwelfare.\n  Throughout his career in public service, Senator Bumpers has remained \ntrue to his constituents by being a strong advocate for his home State \nof Arkansas. He knows that a Senator's ultimate responsibility is to \nthe people of his State. As a result of his advocacy and his honesty, \nArkansas voters have returned him to Washington three times with \nlandslide re-election victories. I have no doubt that the voters of \nArkansas would have made it a fourth re-election landslide if he \nwished.\n  Senator Bumpers' insights into the issues and problems we address in \nthe Senate, and in his Environment and Public Works Committee have made \nhim a valuable and trusted Member of this body. Our leadership, the \nSenate, and most of all the State of Arkansas have greatly benefited \nfrom his service.\n  I believe that I speak for all of my colleagues when I say that the \ndeparture of Senator Bumpers will leave a void in this institution. As \nhe approaches retirement, I want to thank Dale Bumpers for his service \nto his country and congratulate him for his extraordinary career. I \nwish him excellent health and happiness in retirement, and I will truly \nmiss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5902-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5902-S5903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          U.S. FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION FOR WEEK ENDING JUNE 13\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I will have a unanimous-consent request \nmomentarily with regard to calling up Calendar No. 84, S. 924, the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. We have been in communication \nwith the Democratic leadership and Senators on both sides about our \ndesire to call up this legislation. We do have some concerns on both \nsides about some provisions that are in or not in it. But I want to \nwithhold on making that request just for one moment.\n  I had, also, as a second consideration, hoped that we could get up \nthe intelligence authorization bill this afternoon. We are asking the \nArmed Services Committee to continue to work on that and consider that \nas something we would like to try to do this week if at all possible. \nBut we are still working to get that cleared.\n  We will ask consent later on this afternoon to go to S. 923, which \nwould deny veterans benefits to persons convicted of Federal capital \noffenses. I believe we can get that done this afternoon. Senator \nSpecter has been working on that. I understand there are Senators on \nthe other side of the aisle having some input. I believe we can get \nsomething worked out on that this afternoon. It is something certainly \nwe should do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5903-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--S. 924\n\n  Mr. LOTT. With that, Mr. President, I do ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate now turn to the consideration of Calendar No. 84, S. 924, \nthe DOD authorization bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. I regret we have had this objection to proceeding on this \nvery important legislation, the Defense authorization bill.\n  The Armed Services Committee in the Senate has worked very hard on \nthis legislation. It is urgently needed to this extent: Until we can \nget the authorization bill through the complete process, it makes it \ndifficult for the defense appropriations subcommittee to do its work. \nSo timing is important.\n  We would like to get this authorization bill done at the earliest \npossible opportunity so it can get on into conference and so that the \ndefense appropriators will know what the authorization numbers are. It \nis important for our country.\n  It is my understanding that a major issue of contention is still \nbeing discussed with respect to the depots and bases that could be \naffected by it or will be affected by it in Texas, in Oklahoma, in \nCalifornia, in Utah, and Georgia. There are a lot of Senators on both \nsides of the aisle and on both sides of this issue that are very \nconcerned about how it was handled in the committee.\n  So I have urged those on both sides of the aisle to work together and \nsee if we cannot come up with something that is acceptable to both \nsides. It will not be easy. This is not a new issue. We went through \nthis in a way in the base closure rounds.\n  We had debate and amendments on it last year. So everybody knows the \narguments on both sides. I still believe that there is a way that we \ncan come to some compromise language that would allow us to go forward.\n  The Senators are exercising their right to object to waiving the 2-\nday rule or calling up the bill to go straight to debate and \namendments. But I hope that they will not do this for very long, \nbecause we have our work to do.\n  So I understand there is a meeting that will meet again, perhaps \ntoday, this afternoon at 5:30, on this issue. We had a preliminary \nmeeting on it in my office yesterday. I will be glad to work with both \nsides. I want a resolution to be found. But I am not inclined, as I \ndiscussed with the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, the acting \nminority leader, here--I want Senators to be able to exercise their \nrights, and I want to be helpful with that, but I also think at some \npoint, if you cannot work out something, if you do not work out \nsomething, then we will have to use the rules of the Senate to move \nthis very important legislation forward. But I would like everybody to \nget an opportunity first to work together, and you know we are losing \nsome time here. Every day that goes by that we do not take it up, it \nmeans that it already looks like it could be the week of July 7, 8, \nbefore we could actually get this legislation completed. I just wanted \nto make those points.\n  I understand Senators on the floor now would like to be heard on this \nissue. I would like to yield the floor so that they could make their \nstatements.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield just for a \nquestion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The acting minority leader.\n  Mr. FORD. Once the statements are made by those who have objected to \nbringing up the Department of Defense authorization bill, how long will \nthey go, and what kind of schedule would we have? How soon will we get \nto the so-called veterans bill?\n\n  Mr. LOTT. As soon as we can get the agreement worked out. I believe \nthey are working on it right now. We hope by the middle of the \nafternoon we will have something ready to go on that.\n  Mr. FORD. Put us in morning business?\n  Mr. LOTT. We will probably have morning business, but I do know also \nthere are Senators, a number of Senators, who probably want to speak on \nthis issue at hand. Maybe we will let them talk a little bit and they \nwill feel better and we will find a way to move this bill forward.\n  Mr. FORD. The leader knows and we all know at some point it will.\n  Mr. LOTT. Right.\n  Mr. FORD. It is the will that will move it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, my colleague from Connecticut asked if \nhe could take 3 minutes. I am happy to give him 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I particularly thank my friend and \ncolleague from Texas for her graciousness, and her graciousness will \nallow this Senator to find his way to his daughter's school to watch \nthe moving-up ceremony. I appreciate my good friend, the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am very pleased to hear that the \ndaughter of the Senator from Connecticut is having her moving-up \nceremony, because she is a special friend of mine and I think she is a \npotential future Senator from Connecticut. So I am glad that he is \ngoing to be able to make that important ceremony. He will give her my \nregards, I hope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5903-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5903-S5904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE CITY OF JERUSALEM\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, yesterday we passed the State \nDepartment Authorization Act by a vote of 90 to 5. Today there is \ncomment on the bill that we passed yesterday in the Washington Post \nregarding particularly the sections of that legislation that deal\n\n[[Page S5904]]\n\nwith the city of Jerusalem and the recognition of Jerusalem as the \nundivided capital of Israel.\n  In this article, the State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns is \nquoted as saying:\n\n       Our view is that Jerusalem is the most emotional and \n     complex issue that Israel and the Palestinians will have to \n     deal with in the permanent status negotiations. We do not \n     believe it is wise for the United States or any other outside \n     country to make an initiative on Jerusalem that in effect \n     prejudges that issue.\n\n  Then later on in the article, the writer of the article says:\n\n       The State Department regards Jerusalem as ``disputed \n     territory'' with its permanent status to be settled in \n     negotiations and has kept the U.S. embassy in Tel Aviv.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to respond very briefly to that and say that \nthe suggestions made by the State Department spokesman in my opinion \nare wrong. The commentary by the reporter does not recognize the fact \nthat in the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995--both Houses of Congress \npassed and it became law--is a provision that not only directed that \nour Embassy be placed in Jerusalem instead of Tel Aviv thereby doing \nwhat we have done in every other country but one in the world, which is \nto have our Embassy in the city in which the host country had \ndesignated as its capital. But, Mr. President, in that bill--that bill \nnow law--this Congress made very clear its intention that it is \nAmerican policy to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of \nIsrael. We, in fact by strong bipartisan majority, adopted a resolution \na short time ago on the 30th anniversary of the reunification of \nJerusalem restating that position.\n  So, Mr. President, this may be controversial. But trust is built up \namong parties, including those who are involved in the Middle East \nprocess, including Israel, the Palestinians, and other countries. Trust \nis built on honesty. And honest reflection of not just American policy \nbut American law as adopted by this Congress in 1995 is that Jerusalem \nis the undivided capital of Israel.\n  It is time, therefore I would say, to bring our policies in line with \nour law; that time for the statements such as those made by the State \nDepartment spokesman in my opinion respectfully has passed.\n  I appreciate very much again the graciousness of my friend from Texas \nfor allowing me to say this.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5903-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5904-S5918]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998--PUBLIC-PRIVATE \n                    COMPETITION OF DEPOT MAINTENANCE\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for \nstating his concerns here. I notice the distinguished committee \nchairman is also here.\n  I think it is very important that the rights of Members be upheld \nhere because there is a significant issue that is very important to the \nDepartment of Defense for the readiness of this country that is at \nissue in this bill. Heretofore, our side has not really had any ability \nto have an accommodation or to make sure that what the Department of \nDefense wants to do, what BRAC allowed them to do, in fact they will be \nable to do. Because in the bill that would be brought before us, it \nvitiates any public-private competition for depot maintenance work by \nthe Air Force. That is the effect of this bill.\n  To think that someone, for parochial interests, would put language in \na bill that would do away with what BRAC said to the Department of \nDefense was their option, which is to go out and spread the workload to \nother depots from the bases that are closed, or privatize in place, the \nDepartment of Defense should be able to make the decision based on the \nefficiency of taxpayer dollars and where we need the defense dollars to \ngo. The Department of Defense should be able to make that decision. \nThat is what BRAC said.\n  The Department of Defense made the decision. They said it would be \nmore efficient and save more money to privatize in place. They are \ndoing public-private competition to make sure that the price is better. \nYet the bill that would come before us says they cannot do any of that \nwork, privatize in place, until the depots get the work and are up to \n75 percent of their capacity. Well, that is impossible, because some of \nthose depots may not ever get to 75 percent capacity, nor does that \nhave anything to do with efficiency.\n  So, Mr. President, yes, we are standing on principle. We are standing \non the principle that the Department of Defense should be able to have \na public-private competition, to save taxpayer dollars and to put those \ndefense dollars into readiness. We can save millions of dollars for the \ntaxpayers and for the Department of Defense. And those millions of \ndollars, rather than being wasted, can be put into equipment that will \nkeep our troops safe and secure.\n  We are standing for the integrity of the BRAC process. We are \nstanding for the integrity of the Department of Defense and for their \nability to make their decisions without congressional mandates that \ncause the waste of millions of dollars for the taxpayers and for the \nyoung men and women who are putting their lives on the line to protect \nour freedom. That is what this issue is.\n  So, yes, Mr. President, we are objecting. We hope to find an \naccommodation. I will say that the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee wants to find an accommodation that will give the Department \nof Defense the flexibility they need, that will do right by the \ntaxpayers of this country, that will do right by the people who are in \nour Armed Services, and that will do right by the depots that are still \nleft in Oklahoma, Utah, and Georgia.\n  We want something that will be fair to everyone. And when we come to \nthat fair conclusion, then we will be happy to debate this bill and \nhopefully authorize a good defense bill. But, Mr. President, make no \nmistake, if there is not a defense authorization bill that can be \nworked out that can be fair, I hope that we will not go forward putting \nshackles on the Department of Defense and wasting taxpayer dollars.\n  I hope we will have the strength to resist that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the \nremarks of my colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, who I thought \nreally homed in on why this issue is so important. I am very pleased \nthe distinguished chairman of the committee is here because it gives us \nan opportunity to speak with him about why we are so frustrated about \nthis bill as it now stands.\n  Mr. President, it would be a historic moment if this bill were to \npass because it would, for the first time ever, overturn a BRAC \ndecision. Now, we all know that when the four base closure rounds went \nthrough Washington, DC, many of us were not happy with the process. \nMany of us felt the savings were overstated. Many of us felt this was \nnot the right way to go. But not one of us, until today, moved to \nundermine a BRAC decision.\n  By objecting to this bill, we are taking a stand, it seems to me, for \nthe integrity of the process. After all, this is the law of the land. \nThis is just the kind of unraveling we do not want to see happen, \nbecause if this effort succeeds to overturn BRAC, to stifle competition \nbetween the private sector and the public sector with respect to depot \nmaintenance, where will it end? Tomorrow, someone else will try another \nunraveling, and the day after, someone else will, and we will have \nchaos.\n  I want to say, Mr. President, there are two other reasons why this \nbill as drafted is so harmful. Not only does it unravel the Base \nClosure Commission's decisions of the past but it undermines a promise \nmade to the people in the Sacramento area and the people in Texas who \nwill be so adversely affected. There was an explicit promise by the \nPresident of the United States that privatization in place could take \nplace at McClellan Air Force Base. There was also a promise made by \nCongress that such privatization in place could move forward at \nMcClellan. After all, Congress passed the BRAC, so, therefore, we would \nbe breaking a deal, a sacred deal, really, made with these people who \nwere told that privatization in place could, in fact, occur.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I thought we were all really concerned here \nabout\n\n[[Page S5905]]\n\ntaxpayer dollars. We are doing everything we can to bring down this \ndeficit. I am so proud to be a part of the team that brought down the \ndeficit from $290 billion in 1993 to less than $70 billion now. We have \nagreed on a balanced budget deal to finish the job. This is great for \ntaxpayers. This is good for our country. It is good for our economy. So \nwhy would we now reverse course and to say that the private sector's \nability to compete with the public sector will be cut short?\n  It will be a bad deal for the taxpayers if we do not reach some kind \nof agreement here. I hope we do because if the bill as drafted becomes \nthe law of the land, it will force the Pentagon to waste money. This \nbill will essentially direct the Pentagon to waste money by preventing \nthe fair and open competition that is underway to win contracts for \ndepot maintenance work at Kelly and McClellan Air Force Bases.\n  So every way you look at it--from standing behind the law of the \nland, the BRAC process, to keeping our word to workers who trusted us \nwhen we said privatization in place can take place, to taxpayers who \nknow that it makes no sense to eliminate competition--if you look at \nall of these factors, Mr. President, I think what the Senators from \nTexas and the Senators from California are doing here is in the best \ninterests of the U.S. Senate, of the U.S. Congress, and, frankly, in \nthe best interests of the United States of America.\n  I am working with the senior Senator from California, Senator \nFeinstein, who you will hear from shortly, my colleagues from Texas, \nand hopefully all others who want to see this bill move forward. We \nhave no interest in preventing this bill from moving forward. We want \nto reach an accommodation here. I think there are ways we can do it.\n  We are so sure that competition is a good thing, we are so positive \nthat privatization in place will reap rewards for taxpayers, that we \nare willing--we are very willing--to agree to language that would \nensure that this could only occur if the taxpayers save money.\n\n  I am very hopeful that we can reach an agreement. Until then, we will \nfight for our rights as Senators to protect a promise made to the \npeople of our communities and a promise made to the taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank the Senator \nfrom California and the two Senators from Texas for joining me in this \ncoalition.\n  I certainly do object to the motion to proceed to the bill. I want to \nexplain why in some detail. These provisions that the Depot Caucus put \nin not only halts the public-private competitions for depot workload \ncurrently underway at both McClellan and Kelly Air Force Bases, but it \nessentially undermines any effort to do this work in the private sector \nin a more cost-effective way.\n  The option to privatize certain depot workloads was explicitly made \navailable by the BRAC Commission and was a part of the base closure \ndecision. Yes, let their be no doubt, these bases will be closed. We \nknow that. But an effort was guaranteed to be put underway to see if an \namount of this workload could, in fact, be privatized. In its report to \nthe President, the BRAC 95 Commission specifically recommended that the \ndepartment ``consolidate the remaining workloads to other DOD depots or \nto private-sector commercial activities as determined by the Defense \nDepot Maintenance Council.''\n  The President strongly supported the Commission's decision, \nspecifically reinforcing the option of privatization. In his letter to \nthe chairman of the BRAC 95 Commission, the President stated, ``I was \npleased to learn that * * * you confirmed that the Commission's \nrecommendations permit the Department of Defense to privatize the work \nloads of the McClellan and Kelly facilities in place or elsewhere in \ntheir respective communities. * * * In my communication with Congress, \nI have made clear that the Commission's agreement that the Secretary \nenjoys full authority and discretion to transfer workload from these \ntwo installations to the private sector, in place, locally or \notherwise, is an integral part of the overall BRAC 95 package it will \nbe considering.'' The President goes on to say, without ambiguity, \n``Moreover, should the Congress approve this package but then \nsubsequently take action in other legislation to restrict privatization \noptions at McClellan or Kelly, I will regard this as a breach of Public \nLaw 101-510 (the base closure law) in the same manner as if the \nCongress were to attempt to reverse by legislation any other material \ndirection of this or any other BRAC.''\n  I think that's pretty clear.\n  Let me say that I firmly believe if this bill goes forward with the \ndepot language in it, the President of the United States should veto \nthe bill. Not to veto the bill is to say that the BRAC decisions and \nthe decisions made surrounding the 1995 base closure decision are no \nlonger valid. Their integrity is clearly punctuated by this kind of \nspecial interest drive.\n  Let me go on to say that some have alleged that this privatization \nprocess is an attempt to keep McClellan and Kelly open. Let me disabuse \nmy colleagues of that. I want to be very clear. McClellan and Kelly \nwill both be closed in the year 2001. That decision has been made. The \nproperty and buildings at McClellan will be transferred by the Air \nForce to recipients in the local community according to the base reuse \nplan.\n  Two private companies, Boeing and a group led by AAI Corp. and one \nAir Force depot, Hill Air Force Depot in Utah, have each been awarded \n$750,000 in Air Force contracts to formulate their bids for the \nworkload package at McClellan. Final bids from these competitors for \nthis workload are due in September of this year. The contract is \nscheduled to be awarded in January 1998. This aspect of privatization \nis now underway, Mr. President, and essentially what we have in this \nbill is a special provision which would halt the contracts currently \nproceeding. It is to this that we strongly object.\n\n  The workload package, currently under development by the Air Force, \nwill be worth approximately $220 million and will affect only 2,300 \nMcClellan Air Force Base employees. McClellan ALC, Air Logistics \nCenter, employed over 8,000 people before the BRAC 1995 round, and \ncurrently employs less than 7,800 people. So you can see the workload \npackage we are talking about affects about one-third of the employees \nthat used to work at McClellan Air Logistics Center.\n  The Air Force's planned workload package at McClellan will include \nmaintenance and repair of the KC-135 refueler aircraft and A-10 close-\nair support aircraft. It will also include repair work and maintenance \non hydraulics systems, instruments and electronic components and \nelectronic accessories for numerous aircraft systems. Finally, the \nworkload package will include software support activities, parts repair \nand assembly for the KC-135 and A-10, and the packaging and movement of \nparts to military customers.\n  The public/private competition for this work can save taxpayer \ndollars. If the competition for this work is won by the private sector, \nhundreds of millions of dollars in savings could be realized by \navoiding the costs of new military construction, movement of the \nworkload, and retraining workers at Hill Air Force Base. Additional \nsavings can come from taking advantage of any potential efficiencies in \nprivate industry.\n  Let me make another point. Past Federal investments at McClellan \nshould not be ignored. Since 1987, the Department has spent $150 \nmillion on military construction projects at McClellan. Outright \nclosure of these facilities before the year 2001 means the U.S. \ntaxpayer not only forfeits this expenditure but also must pay for new \nmilitary construction at another Air Force base so this workload can be \nmoved. The Defense Department will have to spend hundreds of millions \nof dollars to duplicate the facilities now in operation at McClellan.\n  As the Defense Department phases out its operations at McClellan and \nKelly Air Force Bases, privatization provides a means to reduce \noverhead costs by bringing defense and commercial work together. If \nprivate industry wins the competition for this workload\n\n[[Page S5906]]\n\npackage, they will be able to add commercial products along with their \nDefense Department workload. This innovative approach will expand \nemployment opportunities at these closing facilities and increase \nsavings to the Department through decreased overhead costs and enhanced \nefficiency.\n  The Depot Caucus' language takes none of these potential savings into \naccount and violates every proven principle that competition reduces \ncosts. The Depot Caucus provision would sole-source billions of dollars \nof depot maintenance work to government facilities regardless of the \ncost or the impact this noncompetitive practice would have on DOD's \nmanagement plans and strategies. In addition, the Depot Caucus' \nunqualified opposition to privatization goes against a clear national \ntrend. The language ignores not only the lessons learned by industry, \nbut also the guidance of DOD's most respected advisory reports.\n  This spring's Quadrennial Defense Review stated that DOD should, \n``Conduct public-private competitions for depot maintenance work that \ndoes not contribute to core capability when other appropriate \noutsourcing criteria are met. In addition, [DOD] will partner in-house \nfacilities with industry to preserve depot-level skills and utilize \nexcess capacity. Savings will be achieved as a result of these \ncompetitions and the reductions in excess capacity.''\n  The May 1995 Commission on Roles and Missions [CORM] of the Armed \nForces strongly urged increasing privatization. CORM recommended ``that \nthe Department make the transition to a depot maintenance system \nrelying mostly on the private sector.''\n  In fact, the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure [BRAC] Commission \nReport strongly supported depot privatization, writing, ``The \nCommission believes reducing infrastructure by expanding privatization \nto * * * DOD industrial and commercial activities will reduce the cost \nof maintaining and operating a ready military force.''\n\n  The vast majority of private firms are also moving toward increased \nreliance on outsourcing to become more efficient and remain \ncompetitive. The DOD can learn and benefit from the private sector's \nexperience.\n  We have an opportunity to save money by allowing the competitions for \nworkload at McClellan AFB to go forward. If the bids made by private \nindustry are not financially feasible, then the contract will be \nawarded to the public bidder, Hill AFB. But, if a private bidder does \nwin, then we will have our first opportunity to reduce the cost of \ndepot maintenance activities through careful use of private enterprise.\n  The General Accounting Office's study of depot workload privatization \nnever considered the question of how much could be saved if this \nworkload was privatized. It only considered the costs of maintaining \nthat workload at Kelly and McClellan as compared to consolidating it \ninto the remaining air logistics centers. The privatization of this \nworkload will not be business as usual.\n  Finally, many of my colleagues are concerned that readiness will \nsuffer at the hands of greater outsourcing and privatization. DOD, \nhowever, has entrusted our military's readiness to private contractors \nfor years. Currently, several weapons systems, including the KC-10 \nrefueling aircraft, the F-117 stealth fighter, the B-1B bomber, and the \nsoftware maintenance for the B-2 bomber are completed by private \ncontractors.\n  I believe that the leadership of our armed services will continue to \nensure that any DOD depot maintenance workload that is outsourced will \nbe maintained appropriately, to DOD's own high standard. Allowing \nnoncore depot workload to privatize simply permits DOD to award work to \nthe most qualified, most reliable contractor, whether that contractor \nis a public facility or a private company.\n  In supporting the defense industrial base, DOD's policy calls for \ngreater reliance on the private sector for appropriate depot \nmaintenance workload. Outsourcing helps preserve private sector \ncapabilities and enhances DOD's ability to capture new technologies \nthat are constantly being developed in the private sector. By \nintroducing greater competition into the mix, outsourcing lowers the \ncost of depot-level maintenance activities.\n  I firmly believe that the Nation will always require a public sector \ndepot capability for certain mission-essential workloads and skills. \nUnfortunately, the depot language included in the DOD authorization \nbill will squander essential readiness and modernization funds. The \nDefense Department has defined public depot maintenance policy for the \n21st century. It is time that we move beyond the arbitrary laws \ndefining the policy of the past, and allow public/private competition \nto move us forward.\n  These are the points that I wanted to make today. But, let me \nemphasize, the Depot Caucus' amendment will eventually cost the \ntaxpayers much more money by duplicating existing facilities. In \naddition, the contractual process, including the request for proposals \nhas already begun and, at McClellan, two companies--Boeing, AAI Corp., \nand one Air Force depot, Hill Air Force Depot--have already been \nawarded $750,000 in Air Force contracts to formulate their bids for \nthis workload. Now the Congress is trying to step in and say, ``We are \ngoing to stop these competitions midstream.'' I think that makes no \nsense for the taxpayers and it makes no sense for the credibility of \nthe BRAC process.\n  I, for one, am delighted to join with my colleagues both in my own \nState and in Texas to work to see if we cannot come up with some \ncompromise. Absent that compromise, I firmly believe the President \nshould veto this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is indeed unfortunate that such a \ncritical piece of legislation for the authorization of the Department \nof Defense has been encumbered by a disagreement over the last Base \nClosure Commission findings.\n  If I might, Mr. President, give a broad overview as one of the \nSenators who was deeply involved in the last round of the BRAC, Base \nRealignment and Closure Commission. BRAC was designed because it is so \nterribly difficult for the issues of base closures and shutdowns to be \nhandled in this political environment. So a highly disciplined system \nwas envisioned--a commission that would independently review these core \nand critical issues and would come back to the legislature, and the \nlegislature would have to vote it up or down. No amendments could be \nmade.\n\n  In other words, the traditional legislative actions and prerogatives \nwere removed. You could only be for it or against it. In this \nparticular case, the Air Force had five bases throughout the country, \nand many experts thought there were too many and some had to be closed. \nOriginally, the Air Force wanted to keep all five of them open as the \nprocess began. But BRAC did not agree with them. BRAC thought that \nwould make five Air Force bases inefficient and, therefore, some had to \nbe closed and the work moved to the remaining Air Force bases to \nproduce an efficiency ratio.\n  After extensive discussions by BRAC and their commission, they came \nto the legislature and recommended the closure of Kelly Air Force Base \nin Texas, which is tough. If you ever lived in a community where one of \nthose closures occurred, it is tough. I understand and empathize with \nthe Senators from California and Texas. That is tough medicine. But \nthey called for the closure of Kelly in Texas and McClellan in \nCalifornia, leaving three Air Force logistics centers open--one in \nGeorgia, one in Oklahoma, one in Utah. The work would be moved to the \nremaining three, making those three efficient operations.\n  Mr. President, the administration and the President sullied BRAC, \nbecause they overrode the commission. In other words, the people had to \nlive by it, Congress had to live by it, but the administration didn't. \nWe were in an election year. Texas and California are very big and very \nimportant. So they instituted this concept of privatization. They \ntheoretically closed Kelly and McClellan, as has been alluded to by the \nSenator, but they left everything else there under the guise of \nprivatization. For example, the total number of employees at Kelly and \nMcClellan before the Base Closure Commission called for their closing \nwas 33,000 people. Today, the number of\n\n[[Page S5907]]\n\nemployees at these two installations is 31,000 employees. That is \naccording to the General Accounting Office. The General Accounting \nOffice has told us that this override has resulted in the failure to \nsave $400 million to $600 million.\n  The point that I want to make is that when the administration decided \nto intervene in the findings of the Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission, they reintroduced the very activity that we are engaged in \non the Senate floor today. They put it back into the political process. \nI can say this, Mr. President. There will never be another BRAC, as we \nknew it, because you can't have a discipline where the people had to \nstand up and fight for their installations, the people that work there. \nThe Congress had none of its authority. All of its prerogatives were \nremoved except to vote for or against it, and then the administration \nmay unilaterally alter it. That voids the discipline. So that process \nwill never occur again. It can't. If you are going to have something \nthat highly disciplined, it has to apply to the people of our country, \nthe citizens that are affected, to the members of the legislative body, \nand to the President of the United States. It can't just apply to two \nparts of the puzzle. With this exercise, you track it directly to the \nWhite House. When they decided to take the Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission and politicize it, that, if effect, eliminated BRAC as a \ndiscipline or policy that can ever be used by this Government again to \ndeal with these contentious questions. If it ever comes again, it will \nhave to be completely redone and redesigned so that it applies to the \nPresident and the administration as well as to the people in the \nCongress.\n  I understand the Senator from Texas. Once that policy was breached, \nshe has no choice but to defend the people of Texas and the workers in \nTexas. It is the same with the Senators from California. This was what \nBRAC was to have avoided--and it did, for all practical purposes, until \nthe last round.\n  Mr. President, it is unfortunate. It means that that system will \nnever be used again, from my point of view, until the administration \nand Department of Defense can certify that the recommendations of the \nlast round of BRAC have been carried out, that the three remaining \nlogistic bases have been shifted to work that was purported to go there \nto make them efficient. There is just not going to be another Base \nClosure Commission. The Department of Defense is going to have to \ndemonstrate that they got the job done from the last ones before they \ncome back and ask for new ones, and the Department of Defense and the \nadministration are going to have to rewrite the rules so that it \napplies to them as well as to the people in Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think we all know certain things are \ntrue and incontrovertible. One is that a base closing is a very \ndifficult thing to do politically and a very difficult thing to endure \nas a Member of the U.S. Senate or a Member of the other body, because \npeople look to us and they look to us and say, ``You are responsible \nfor saving what we have here.''\n\n  I am not eloquent enough to describe the anguish that people go \nthrough, that cities go through, that counties and the States go \nthrough during a BRAC process. They go out and they hire consultant \nafter consultant and they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars. They \ngo through all of this and, finally, the recommendations come down. We \nhave gone through that in 1991, 1993 and 1995, and it was necessary. It \nwas, I guess, the Army that came up with the initial idea that we try \nto eliminate excess capacity and infrastructure. But we haven't been \nable to do it because politically it can't be done. There is no better \nevidence of that than what is happening today.\n  They established a process that was to be totally free from political \ninterference. Seemingly, it worked for a while. I don't have the exact \nnumber of installations that have been closed down, but we all \nunderstand that we are going through a difficult time with our defense. \nWe all understand that we have a President of the United States who is \nnot strong on defense. He would like to have us think there is no \nthreat out there, that the cold war is over, so we can start reducing \ndown to the point where we cannot begin to defend America on two \nregional fronts. We all know that is true today.\n  The bottom line is that we had too much infrastructure. It was up \nhere. So we brought it down, in 1991, 1993 and 1995, to a level that is \ndown now and still a little bit above our force strength. As far as \nfuture BRACs are concerned, I contend that I don't want to get this \ninfrastructure down so artificially low so that when we rebuild, we \nwill not have the infrastructure to accommodate that. I agree with the \nSenator from Georgia, who says that we have to position ourselves so \nthat we know if we go through all of this anguish again, we will not \nhave political interference.\n  Anyway, I am going to tell you a story, Mr. President, and you may \nnot believe me. I think you know me well enough to know that I do tell \nthe truth. I was in a very tough election when I was in the other body, \nand I ran for the Senate in 1994. I ran against a guy who is young, \narticulate, and a very smart young man. He was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, a member of the other party. He was on the House \ndefense committee at that time, which was called the House Armed \nServices Committee, now called the House National Security Committee. \nHe said, ``Elect me and I will use political influence to make sure \nthat none of the bases are damaged in the BRAC processes.'' We have \nfive installations in the State of Oklahoma.\n  I made a public statement in the newspaper. I said, ``I will not use \npolitical influence because I know we have to do something about this \ninfrastructure. What I will do is I will stay out of it until the \nrecommendations are made, and when they are made, I will walk through \nfire to defend the recommendations of the BRAC committee, because the \nsystem has to work. We can't allow this to become a politicized \nsystem.''\n  So we did that pretty well. I have a list here of various States and \nSenators that cooperated when they came through in 1991, 1993, and 1995 \nand said they wanted to close certain bases. They said, well, it is \ngoing to hurt at home, hurt me politically, but we are going to have to \ndo it. They bit the bullet.\n  Now we are asked to make two exceptions. I agree with the Senator \nfrom Georgia when, certainly, the Senator from Texas is put in a very \nawkward situation by our President because, in August of 1996, right \nbefore the election, when President Clinton was campaigning out in \nCalifornia with a huge number of electoral votes, he said this to them \nand made a commitment that ``I will see to it that no jobs are lost in \nCalifornia and no jobs are lost in Texas, and we will privatize.'' He \ngrabbed that out of the air. So that commitment had to be--I don't \nthink there is anybody in America today that doesn't know that that was \na highly politically charged commitment and statement he made. He made \nthat statement. Then that puts everybody in the position that, wait a \nminute, if you have the President agreeing that we are not going to \nclose those installations, McClellan and Kelly, in California and \nTexas, what about you Senators, aren't you going to stand behind the \nPresident? You have that leverage.\n  That is where we are today. So we went through this process. I find \nmyself in the situation now that the recommendations have been made \nthat we are going to have to stand behind the recommendations.\n  I want to suggest to you, Mr. President, we have made some \ncompromises. Senator McCain from Arizona had some objections and \nconcerns in our committee. I am chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee. We went through this and \ndebated these issues for hours and hours on how to protect the \nintegrity of the BRAC system because it became a dollar decision. We \nwere going through the marking up of an authorization bill where we are \ntrying to rebuild our defenses and sustain a level that will adequately \nprotect America. We have considerations on modernization programs that \ncost money. We have barracks out there needing replacement. There are \nquality-of-life issues and modernization issues. These things are maybe \n$100,000\n\n[[Page S5908]]\n\nor maybe $1 million a lick. We have had to turn them down.\n  Now we have an opportunity to follow the recommendations of the BRAC \ncommittee and save the defense system approximately $468 million a \nyear. Now, if you carry that out to 5 years, you are talking about \n$2.34 billion. If you don't do that, where is the money going to come \nfrom? If they are successfully able to compete and end up with the jobs \nin Texas or California, or privatize in place, it is the same thing. We \ndon't want to confuse people. Those people advocating competition \nrealize that they want competition because they want to protect the \njobs there. I understand this. Just because it is dealing in semantics, \nprivatization in place, or competition, where they will be able to \nleave the jobs there, it doesn't make a difference. The bottom line, as \nthe Senator from Georgia said, is that we will still have five air \nlogistic centers. So it came out with the recommendations. GAO said \nthat if we don't do it, it is going to cost $2.34 billion over a 5-year \nperiod. That is money that has to, realistically, come out of the \ndefense system. I don't know where it is going to come from.\n  Mr. President, we had several hearings where we had the chiefs of \nservices. So I asked each of the four chiefs of services, ``Where are \nyou going to come up with this money?'' If we end up having to violate \nthe BRAC and it ends up costing us $2 billion, where are you going to \ncome up with the money? It can only come from four areas: \nModernization, quality of life, force strength, and readiness. So I \nasked each one. They said, ``We can't take it out of any of those \nbecause we are underfunded if all four areas.'' They said at one time \nthat it was going to cost another $2 billion in 1 year to bring us up \nto meeting the minimum of the expectations of the American people to \nprotect America on two regional fronts.\n\n  So we have the recommendations. They said, ``All right. If you have \nfive ALC's located in Georgia, Oklahoma, Utah, Texas, and California, \nwe will select two of those to close.'' And they used the criteria to \noperate more efficiently. And we could get into 2 or 3 hours of \ndiscussion on how this process works, and how they used the criteria in \nevaluating the effectiveness of various installations. They came up \nwith the conclusion that we are going to have to close two, and those \ntwo should be McClellan and Kelly in California and in Texas.\n  When you do that, you redistribute that so that workload goes on to \nthe remaining ALC's. Of course, that will increase the number of jobs \nin other States. I understand that. But, if you do not do that, you \nwill still be operating five ALC's at 50 percent capacity. The only \ndifference is they will be owned--two of them--by the private sector. \nYou still have the same problem that existed.\n  So, if you look at what the alternatives are and look at what we have \ngone through in the committee process, you will see that we have really \ngiven in a lot. I suggested to the Senator from Texas that it was the \nQDR--Quadrennial Review Defense--review that we went through, and the \nSecretary of Defense came in, and said, ``We think that we should \nchange 60-40 to 50-50.'' He made some other recommendations. He said, \n``We also need to have two more BRAC.'' It so happens that the Senator \nfrom Arizona, Senator McCain, said, ``I think we ought to change it to \n50-50.''\n  So we sat down, and worked it out. And we agreed to do that. So there \nhave been compromises during this process. We debated this. We went \nthrough the whole committee system. We came out, and finally said that \neven though as individuals it is going to be politically very difficult \nas it is, and every time you shut down a military installation--we have \ndone over 100 of them so far--it is always difficult to do. It is \ndifficult for the local House and Senate Members. But it has to be \ndone. So the committee voted unanimously to do that.\n  Some people have suggested that the GAO report is not accurate. We \nactually had the committee meeting where we had the GAO people there.\n  We said, ``We want you to be sure that we understand you correctly. \nYou are saying this is going to cost $468 million. Do you still stand \nby that today?''\n  They said, ``The data, as near as we can determine, indicates that \nthat is what the cost will be.''\n  I said, ``Have you considered everything; privatization in place?''\n  They said, ``Yes, we have considered that. That is part of the \nreport.''\n  So we have an extensive report right here by the GAO that comes up \nwith these conclusions. Some people have suggested that perhaps it was \nnot a part of that report. I will quote something from the report. \nAccording to GAO, ``The cost to operate the other depots at 50-percent \ncapacity will far exceed any projected savings through public-private \ncompetition, $468 million. This fact begs the question: What is the \nreal objective of public-private competition? The only feasible answer \nis to save jobs, and Texas and California are to appease the private \nsector appetite for new business. Neither is an acceptable answer.''\n  So we did this. We went through this thing. We looked at what the GAO \nwas recommending, and decided that we were going to have to do that.\n  This hearing that we had lasted about 3 hours. They said there is no \nquestion about the fact that we are going to have to do something to \nbuild the others up to a reasonable respectable capacity.\n  So that gets into the next issue. ``What is the respectable capacity \nof the remaining ALC's in order to have this logistics system function \nin a prudent manner in the United States?'' GAO said somewhere between \n75 and 85 percent.\n  You might ask. Why not get them up to 95 or 100 percent? The reason \nis very clear. If something should happen that we should have to go to \nwar, we are going to have to have that excess capacity to take care of \nthe needs to meet the new threat that is out there.\n  That sounds very reasonable. So we have left it there. It is not \nexactly the same in the House bill as the Senate bill. In the House \nbill it was 80 percent, and in the Senate bill it was 75 percent--75 \npercent because Senator McCain thought that 75 percent would be a \nbetter number.\n  So again, we caved in a little bit on that. So we are now talking \nabout what to do with this and whether or not we should allow this \nprocess to be violated for the first time.\n\n  I would just suggest to you that almost every State has had to \nundergo the closure of some type of installation. It would be very \ndifficult.\n  I saw Senator Sessions walking through here just a minute ago. For \nhim to go back to the State of Alabama and say that we now are going to \ngo ahead and make an exception, and they would say, ``Wait a minute. \nWhy wasn't the exception made in Alabama, in fact, where we really \nwanted to keep our bases open?''\n  So it is difficult when you lose jobs. We have had to bite the bullet \nand go through this. A majority of the Members of this U.S. Senate have \nhad to go through with that.\n  Mr. President, there has also been some discussion that perhaps they \nleft an option open. I know several people who for political reasons \nwould like to believe that there is another option that is out there, \nand they clearly said they had been closed out.\n  Let me read a couple of the things that I think are necessary for us \nto understand. If it had been the intent of the BRAC Commission to \nleave an option to privatize in place, they would have said there is an \noption to privatize in place. In the case of 1993 BRAC round in Newark, \nthe Newark Air Force Base, they said, ``The workload can either be \ncontracted out to one or more of several existing manufacturers, or \nprivatize in place.''\n  They said in the 1995 Naval Service Warfare Center in Louisville, \n``Transfer workload equipment and facilities to the private sector for \nlocal jurisdiction, as appropriate, if the private sector can \naccommodate the workload on-site.'' That is privatization in place on-\nsite. But what they clearly intended in this case was not to have \nprivatization in place--not to leave the jobs on site because they want \nto consolidate them.\n  Last, I want to mention that this should not be a jobs issue. This is \na national security issue. The whole reason, Mr. President, that we \ncame up initially on this 60-40, which was a ratio--it was arbitrary, \nand I am the first one to say that it is arbitrary and needs to be \nchanged at a date when we can correct the national security \nramifications of this issue. But until then\n\n[[Page S5909]]\n\nwe are trying to keep some type of a ratio in place that would allow \nthe public sector to be able to know that in case of war we are not \ngoing to be held hostage by one supplier.\n  That is the big issue. Should that be 60 percent? I was willing to go \n50 percent. But I think a better solution is to do what we did in this \nbill. We have a good bill. In this bill for the first time we have \ndefined what core is. Core is for those functions that are performed \nthat are necessary for us to defend America. That is a fairly simple \ndefinition. But that is it.\n  So, if we define core, then we say that we are going to have to do \nthe core work on site. That would solve the problem. We wouldn't be \ntalking about 60-40 or 50-50.\n  So I made a commitment to Senator McCain that, if we can go ahead and \ndrop the 50-50, let's give it a couple of years. Let's allow them to \nsee how this works with our new definition of core, and see if we can't \nsolve it that way and get away from this somewhat arbitrary type of a \nformula.\n  So the real issue here is twofold, I would say. One is we have \ninvolved a lot of money, and, if we do not do this, we are going to \nhave to come up with it somewhere. It is going to be a very costly \nprocess if we agree that we are going to violate the intent and the \nletter of the BRAC.\n  No. 2, this is even more important than just the money; that is, we \nare talking about defending America. We are talking about having a \ncapability in the public sector to be able to have air logistics \ncenters. That will keep our airplanes in the air, and will keep our \nsoldiers fighting in the event that war comes up.\n  People would like to say there is not that threat out there. I am not \ngoing to go into my normal speech that I make when we talk about this. \nI have to tell you. I look wistfully back to the days of the cold war \nwhen we had one other superpower, and our intelligence knew pretty well \nwhere they were. We knew what threat was out there, and we defined that \nthreat. We could predict how the Soviets were going to act. That is not \ntrue anymore. We have some 25 nations that have weapons of mass \ndestruction. We have a country that was just written about in \nyesterday's newspaper in the Washington Times that the Chinese now are \nselling more and more technology in systems to deliver those weapons of \nmass destruction to countries like Iran.\n  So we are faced not with just one single predictable superpower who \nposes a threat to us but also to many, many powers out there.\n  So as a member of the Armed Services Committee, as chairman of the \nReadiness Committee, I can say that the big issue here is we have a \ncountry to defend and as difficult as the process is, as difficult as \nit is to go through, as upset as I am with the President for \npoliticizing this in August 1996, nonetheless, we are going to have to \ntry to stay as close to the recommendations as possible. Because, if we \nviolate it just one time, I can tell you right now it is not only going \nto be the Senator from Georgia who said, ``If we do not go ahead and \ncarry out the recommendations of the 1995 round, I am going to oppose \nany future BRAC recommendations.'' I can assure you that I will do the \nsame thing. I imagine the majority of the Members of this Senate are \ngoing to come up with the position that if we do not carry out the \nrecommendations that were clearly identified in the 1995 round that we \nare not going to have any more base closure rounds.\n  So for the time being, I yield the floor, and will stay engaged here.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to talk about some of the \nissues that have been raised by my colleagues, because it seems that \nthere are some very important issues that need to be clarified. A lot \nhas been said about the integrity of the Base Closure Commission \nprocess. In fact, it is so important that everyone understand we are \nprotecting the integrity of the base closing process.\n  I want to read the language that comes straight out of the commission \nrecommendation:\n\n       The Commission finds the Secretary of Defense deviated \n     substantially from the force-structure plan and final \n     criteria 1, 4, and 5. Therefore, the Commission recommends \n     the following: realign Kelly Air Force Base including the Air \n     Logistics Center. Disestablish the Defense Distribution \n     Depot, San Antonio.\n\n  This is the important language:\n\n       Consolidate the workloads to other DoD depots or to private \n     sector commercial activities as determined by the Defense \n     Depot Maintenance Council.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield on that point.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is the BRAC recommendation.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield on that point.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would ask the Senator from Texas to read the next \nsentence in that report. If she does not have it, I have it. If she \ndoes, I would appreciate it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I think it is important we look at \nthis language. I have it right here:\n\n       Consolidate the workloads to other DoD depots or to private \n     sector commercial activities as determined by the Defense \n     Depot Maintenance Council.\n\n  The rest of it:\n\n       Move the required equipment and any required personnel to \n     the receiving locations. The airfield and all associated \n     support activities and facilities will be attached to \n     Lackland Air Force Base.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It is right there. The important part of this \nrecommendation from the BRAC Commission report is that the option is \ngiven to the Department of Defense through the Defense Depot Maintenace \nCouncil to move the workload to other depots, yes, or to privatize. The \noption is given because the Base Closure Commission understood that it \nwas important for the Defense Department to have the flexibility.\n  In fact, to augment that argument, I want to read a letter from the \nChairman of the Base Closure Commission. The letter says:\n\n       The Commission believes reducing infrastructure by \n     expanding privatization to other DoD industrial and \n     commercial activities will reduce the cost of maintaining and \n     operating a ready military force. Privatization of these \n     functions would reduce operating costs, eliminate excess \n     infrastructure and allow uniformed personnel to focus on \n     skills and activities directly related to their military \n     missions.\n\n  He goes on further to say:\n\n       It is my view and the view of the Commission's general \n     counsel that the commission's recommendation in the case of \n     both McClellan Air Force Base and Kelly Air Force Base \n     authorizes the transfer of any workload other than the common \n     use ground communication electronic workload to any other DOD \n     depot or to any private sector commercial activity, local or \n     otherwise, including privatization in place.\n\n  Signed Alan Dixon, Chairman, Base Closure Commission.\n  A letter signed by four other members of the Base Closure Commission, \nwhich would make a majority with the Chairman:\n\n       It was our clear intention to provide the Department of \n     Defense with sufficient flexibility to maintain readiness, \n     make optimum use of scarce resources and to exploit the \n     strength of the United States commercial sector where \n     possible, where doing so would provide the best economic \n     value to the Government. The department has access to all of \n     the relevant information and is in the best position to \n     decide which option best fits its needs.\n\n  They are saying clearly they do not expect the U.S. Congress to make \nthat decision. They think the Department of Defense is in the best \nposition to decide which option fits best. They go on to say:\n\n       The Commission felt that privatization was a key tool the \n     Department of Defense could employ to achieve significant \n     savings. As members of the 1995 Base Realignment and Closure \n     Commission, we support the department's efforts to remove \n     legislative restrictions which are arbitrary and undermine \n     effective depot maintenance management.\n\n  Signed Rebecca Cox, Benjamin Montoya, J.B. Davis, and Josue Robles. \nThat is in addition to the Chairman, Alan Dixon. It is very clear the \nintent of the Base Closure Commission, along with the actual wording, \nthat privatization must be an option for the Department of Defense to \nbe able to use the precious defense dollars for readiness of our \ncountry rather than wasting taxpayer dollars by artificially having \nmandates that 60 percent of all maintenance must be done in a public \ndepot. That is what we are arguing about today.\n\n  Now, the Senators have said that we have gone down to 50 percent from \n60 percent, and they say that is an accommodation. At 50 percent, you \nare still\n\n[[Page S5910]]\n\nmandating that there not be competition, that the Department of Defense \nnot have the flexibility to do the job it needs to do in the most \nefficient and best way, and to save those defense dollars for \nreadiness.\n  In fact, I will quote to you from the people who are responsible for \nour readiness and their view of this issue. Admiral William S. Owens, \nthe Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired, is talking \nabout the importance of the fixed-costs versus the variable costs:\n\n       The world's largest business--\n\n  The defense business, the Defense Department--\n\n     is 65 percent fixed costs and 35 percent variable costs.\n\n  The variable costs, the 35 percent, translate to the war-fighting \ncapability, but the money is in fixed costs.\n  So what they are trying to do, according to Admiral Owens, is reduce \nthose fixed costs.\n  So he says, in order to reduce fixed costs, he believes they must \nhave privatization. He says he would eliminate a particular percentage \nsplit and let the core work be decided by the services according to \ntheir needs.\n  Dr. John White, Deputy Secretary of Defense:\n\n       Privatization provides substantial savings. As we go \n     forward, we have a situation where we have to emphasize \n     modernization.\n\n  Dr. White is saying we need flexibility to run this Department so \nthat we can fight wars, and we need to save it where we can, and \nprivatization provides savings.\n  General Shalikashvili, our sitting Chief of the Joint Chiefs:\n\n       I believe we must get on with privatization outsourcing.\n\n  This is from March 6, 1996, testimony to the Defense Appropriations \nCommittee:\n\n       We need your support to make the hard choices and the \n     changes to make these initiatives work. I particularly ask \n     for your support where changes in law are required.\n\n  The changes in law he is asking for is to do away with 60-40 or 50-50 \nso that they can have the full ability to decide what is core workload, \nwhat can be done in the private sector and how they can save money so \nthat our money will go to, be able to go into the equipment that \nprotects those young men and women who are out in the field who have \ngiven their lives to protect our freedom.\n  In response to a question, General Fogleman, on March 14, 1996, said \nin answer to the question, how can the services close the $20 billion \nprocurement gap that they face in trying to cut costs, one word: \n``Privatization.''\n  General Viccellio, who was in charge of the depots, testified May 7, \n1997, he needs the flexibility to privatize. DOD, he says, doesn't want \nto privatize everything, but they want the flexibility where they know \nthey can do better.\n  So, Mr. President, not only are we keeping the integrity of BRAC, \nwhich states in their recommendations they are leaving the option to \nthe Department of Defense to move the workload to depots or to \nprivatize, not only is it in the writing of BRAC, but it is augmented \nby letters signed by a majority of the members of the Base Closure \nCommission, who very specifically say to restrict privatization options \nwould be wrong.\n  That is further augmented by the Vice Chief of the Joint Chiefs, by \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and by the Deputy Secretary of \nDefense. I did not read to you the testimony from the Secretary of \nDefense, both William Perry and Bill Cohen. They all say if we are \ngoing to do the job you are giving us to do, which is cut costs yet \nremain ready and do the best for our troops, we need the flexibility to \nprivatize. And yet the authorization bill that is tried to be brought \nup, which we are objecting to being brought up, continues to keep Kelly \nand McClellan from being able to bid in a public-private competition, \nto have the most efficient use of taxpayer dollars. They would prevent \nthe ability to have the competition, and instead say it does not matter \nif we waste taxpayer dollars; it does not matter if the Department of \nDefense has testified they do not want to do it; we are going to force \nthem to do this work in one of the depots.\n  Mr. President, it does not make sense. It does not make common sense. \nIt does not make money sense. And we are going to try to come to an \naccommodation so that the depots feel that they will not be threatened. \nI do not want them to be threatened. But I do want what is best for the \ntaxpayers. I do want the Department of Defense to make this decision \nbased on the facts and based on what is best for the Department of \nDefense, and I think they are in the best position to make this \ndecision. And that is what I am fighting for today.\n  It has been stated that the GAO report says you cannot have savings \nby doing the privatization in place, and I think it is most important \nthat we say for the record that the GAO has never taken into account \nbids in competition. They have told me that, and we must have the \nability for the Department of Defense to take the bids so that we will \nknow if we are going to be able to have the savings.\n  So, Mr. President, I am trying to stand today for the integrity of \nthe BRAC process. BRAC recommended privatization as an option. That has \nbeen thoroughly augmented by the majority of the members of the BRAC in \nletters since the closing of the BRAC. It has been augmented by every \nimportant military leader who has testified before the Armed Services \nCommittee or the Defense Appropriations Committee. There is unanimity \nin the Department of Defense that they need this flexibility in order \nto use the millions of dollars that they can save by doing this work \nprivately and put it in the readiness area.\n  I have to say I am somewhat amused to hear privatization used as if \nthis is un-American. Who makes the aircraft? Who makes the engines? I \nbelieve private companies make those. Why would we be against the same \nprivate companies that manufacture the engines, that manufacture the \naircraft, repairing them? I really do not understand that argument very \nwell.\n  I think the Department of Defense is in the best position to know if \nthey are, in fact, the best people to repair the engines that they \nbuilt or repair the aircraft that they built, and I think we should let \nthe experts make that decision. That is what we are fighting for today. \nWe are fighting for public-private competition, we are fighting for \nintegrity of the BRAC process. We are fighting for the experts to be \nable to make the decision of where those precious defense dollars would \ngo.\n  We are on the side of the right, and I hope we can work with those \nwho are trying to protect three depots--which I want to be protected as \nwell. But they don't have to be protected against competition. They \ndon't have to be protected in the name of artificial constraints on the \nDepartment of Defense to be able to make decisions. They should be \nprotected because the Department of Defense wants them to be there. I \nam ready to pass a law saying protect them. But I am not willing to \npass a law saying you cannot have public-private competition by the \nDepartment of Defense even if that is the decision that the Department \nof Defense makes, because they know best, they are the experts that we \nhave trusted to make these decisions, and we are trying to uphold the \nintegrity of that process.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have some comments to make in response \nto the very eloquent comments of the Senator from Texas, but first I \nask if she would answer one question that I have. I think it is \nprobably the most important question that could be asked, in these \nterms. We all understand. Although the Senator is not on the Armed \nServices Committee now as she was last year, she knows the significance \nof an authorization bill. I think we all agree that this, the defense \nauthorization bill, which the Senator presiding right now was a very \nimportant part of, is a very significant bill.\n  While she gives a compelling case--and I know it comes from the \nheart--on privatization, on changing what our interpretation of what \nthe BRAC recommendations are, would she be willing, in order to protect \nthe authorization bill, to go ahead, let's take the bill up in the form \nthat it is and offer an amendment to strike that provision that she \nfinds objectionable so we can then isolate that one problem and still \nhave an authorization bill, not hold the\n\n[[Page S5911]]\n\nentire authorization bill hostage, which I am sure she would agree \nwould not be in the best interests of the country? Would the Senator be \nwilling to do that?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me say this is the first time in \nthis entire process that anyone has tried to get a fair solution to \nthis issue. We were not able to do that last year in the armed services \nauthorization bill, and we certainly do not have a bill that would \nallow for good public policy before us today. It is not as if the \nDepartment of Defense would go without appropriation if there was not \nan authorization bill because, in fact, many departments of Government \ngo forward if there is no authorization as long as there is an \nappropriation. So there is no ongoing issue of the Department of \nDefense not having the ability to do its job and the money being there \nfor them to do it.\n  We are talking about a budget that starts on October 1 of this year, \nso we have time, and I think we need to take the time. I think we need \nto solve this problem in the best interests of the people of America, \nour armed services, our Department of Defense and all of the depots \nthat we would like to protect. I think we have time to do that and do \nit right. I do not think it is in the best interests of our country to \ngo forward with a bill that has such a flawed policy that will have \nsuch far-reaching implications and one in which I am not sure, because \nof parochial interests, we will be able to amend unless we are able to \nmake an agreement before we take the bill up for consideration.\n  What I am hoping is that before October 1 of this year, the members \nof the depot caucus will work with us in sincerity for something that \nthey think is fair, that we think is fair, that is fair to the \ntaxpayers, that is fair to the Department of Defense, and that we can \ngo and negotiate and stand for together. Because, if we can stand \ntogether on something that is right, we will win and it will be better \nfor America.\n  So, we have time. Let's do it right. I thank the Senator for the \nquestion.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Texas for that answer, but it is \nreally a shorter answer I was looking for. That is, would the Senator \nbe willing to take up her issue, that which she finds objectionable \nabout the defense authorization bill, and debate that thoroughly on the \nfloor--and if she is more persuasive or has a better case, then, of \ncourse, she would prevail on that--instead of blocking the entire \nauthorization bill? This is my concern. The Senate is different than \nthe other body that I served in for 8 years. Over there, you cannot do \nthat. But in the Senate I guess one person can just block a bill from \nbeing passed. I hope the Senator from Texas would consider offering her \nposition as an amendment to strike the language that was put in by the \ncommittee.\n\n  I will not ask for a response now, but I hope she would consider \ndoing that.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to respond, if the \nSenator from Oklahoma would allow me to?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Of course.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. This bill goes into effect on October 1, 1997. I \nwould like to see sincerity on the part of the Senator from Oklahoma to \nwork on this. Let's get a fair agreement so all of us can be together \non this floor fighting for what is right for America, what is right for \nthe Department of Defense, what is right for our young men and women \nwho are defending this country. We have time to do it right. Let us do \nit right. Because he is correct, in the Senate we do not treat people \nthe way they treat people in the House sometimes. In the House, they \nrun over people. Normally, we have not done that in the Senate. That is \nwhy the rights of the minority in the Senate are protected.\n  I think it is very important that we work together on this issue. I \nthink we have an incentive to do it. We have plenty of time, and when \nwe can come to a fair accommodation, I hope we can all work together on \na bill that is good policy for America and allows us to use the \nprecious defense dollars that we have for the readiness of our country \nand for the quality of life for our troops.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from Texas. She brings up a very good \npoint, and that is we are in the middle of a process now that is very \ncomplicated. First of all, we have our defense authorization bill. It \nis very, very significant that we get this passed because we have pay \nraises for those people who are serving right now in Bosnia and other \nplaces. We have military construction projects that, if we do not pass \nthis authorization bill, can be in jeopardy. This goes far beyond depot \nmaintenance. I just hope, instead of holding up the entire \nauthorization bill, that we could address this in a way where an \namendment could be crafted by the Senator from Texas that would take \nout the offensive language and then debate it openly, for hours and \nhours. Because these are critical decisions.\n  I have to respond to a few things that were said. First of all, the \nidea of privatization in place--no one is going to exceed my efforts \nfor the past 30 years for privatization in place. I can remember when I \nwas mayor of the city of Tulsa, I was privatizing everything that would \nnot move. I remember our trash system--we privatized it in place. Of \ncourse, people do not like change. I can remember they ended up dumping \nin my front yard. However, now it is the greatest system we could have \nhad--privatization in place.\n  There is a big difference between privatizing a trash system and \nprivatizing a core responsibility of the military. So here we are \ntrying to defend America and putting ourselves in a posture where, if \nwe follow all the way through with the privatization argument and \nprivatize everything in the military, then we would not have a core \ncapability within the public sector to defend America. That is clearly \nwhat this issue is all about.\n  I would also like to talk a little bit about the committee process \nthat we have gone through. The Senator from Texas talks about the \ncommittee perhaps not coming out with the right conclusions. We have \nbeen going through this every year. Certainly I, when I was in the \nother body, sat through this process. Am I happy with it? No. I would \nlike to have a better process. The committee process is a very \ndifficult one and it is one of compromise. We have compromised.\n  In this process our committee--first of all, in the Subcommittee on \nReadiness we discussed this issue, we aired it. It was not partisan. It \nwas not Republicans versus Democrats. It was how can we address the \nissue of having enough of the critical workload, core workload in the \npublic sector so we know if a war comes up we will not be in a hostage \nsituation by one supplier or one contractor who might be in a position \nto undercut the public sector a little bit at the present time. That is \nreally what it is about.\n  So we discussed this and we aired this in committee. I see now that \nSenator Thurmond, the chairman of the committee, is here in the \nChamber. I am just reminded that, back when it was very difficult for \nthe Senator from South Carolina to comply with it, they came along and \nclosed, in the 1993 BRAC round, the Charleston naval shipyard. He does \nnot have to answer this question, but I can tell you right now he was \nnot very happy about that. But he bit the bullet and said we have to \neliminate excess capacity.\n  I can say the Senator who is presiding right now, Senator Coats--Mr. \nPresident, you can remember when you had to close Fort Benjamin \nHarrison in Indiana. Was that fun? No, it was not fun. But you were \nvery strong at that point and said we have to protect the integrity of \nthis nonpoliticized process and close excess capacity. There is hardly \na Senator in here who did not have to bite the bullet. All of a sudden, \nwe are saying the system is not good and we are going to have to ignore \nthe BRAC process for facilities in two States. There are 50 States. \nThere are still 50 States. This is just two States we are talking \nabout. So we went from the subcommittee into the committee, and Senator \nThurmond will remember that we debated this hour after hour. We had \namendments that were offered that would strike the language that we put \nin, saying in order to protect the integrity of the BRAC system, we \nhave to close two of the ALC's and move that workload so others are \ngoing to have at least 75 percent capacity. The House said 80 percent, \nthe Senate said 75 percent, and we debated that. We had some votes that \nwere really close votes.\n\n[[Page S5912]]\n\n  If you remember, Mr. President, we debated these and had the votes, \nand then there were amendments that were offered, and in the final \nanalysis, we came out and said this bill is a good bill. This bill does \nthings we have been trying to do for a long time. We have been trying \nto define what is core. Always before we have had a very loose \ndefinition that the DOD has used, and that has been acceptable, and we \ntook their definition and put it into this bill so we will have a \ndefinition of what is core, what is necessary to be performed by the \npublic sector in order to protect us in times of war so we do not \nbecome dependent upon some outside contractor.\n  So we have that definition in there. We also have another compromise \nthat I made, and that is, one of the reasons--in a minute I am going to \ntalk about the bidding process--we can't have any kind of bidding on \nthis thing that is fair to the public sector is because they cannot do \nthe same things the private sector can do. So we put in a teaming \nprovision. That is to say that the public sector can do what the \nprivate sector can do. Let's take Tinker Air Force base in Oklahoma \nCity. If Tinker Air Force base wants to compete for some of the \nworkload that private contractors in Texas are currently trying to \nhold, they cannot subcontract out or have teaming arrangements with \nother subcontractors on work that they would like. In this bill, when \nwe pass this authorization bill, we put a provision in here that says, \nyes, they can go ahead and contract out. So, if they find the private \nsector can do one particular function or one product more efficiently \nthan the public sector can, then they can go ahead and do that and that \nwork will be counted as public work in any formula.\n  That is a great concession, and it is one I don't mind making, \nbecause in that situation, the private sector could do the work, but we \ncould not be held hostage because the public sector would control the \ncontracting out of that work. They want to do it. There is not an ALC \nin America that doesn't want to have the capability of contracting out \nsmall parcels that might be better done while they can still protect \nthe core condition or concern that is there.\n  We have things such as bundling in a package. I can tell you right \nnow that if they continue the way they are doing it right now in trying \nto induce competition for these core responsibilities, that they are \ngoing to win. You cannot compete when you are operating on a playing \nfield that isn't level.\n  Right now they can bundle it, and they have bundled these projects, \nfor example, in Texas, so that only those in Texas could come out \nrealistically and win this thing.\n  In our statutes, we have depreciation schedules, where the private \nsector can use a different schedule than the public sector. We have \nanother provision, which I don't disapprove of, which is one that I, as \nmayor of Tulsa, actually had the opportunity at one time to participate \nin, and that is when they decided that Air Force Plant No. 3 in Tulsa, \nOK, was no longer inventory that the Air Force wanted and wanted to \nhave to keep up, we went through this process, the process of divesting \nourselves of inventory we do not want: First, we let the Federal \nagencies look at it to see if they want it. If they want it, it is \ntaken up there. If not, it goes to the State, and if not there, it goes \nto the local communities and counties.\n  In the case of Air Force Plant No. 3, the city of Tulsa ended up with \nit. What can we do now? We can take that and, at no cost, offer it to a \ncontractor to go out there and compete. This is, I suggest, exactly \nwhat can happen and will happen if they are successful in what they \ncall competition down at Kelly for some of the ALC work. They would be \nable to pick up that base that is closed, that resource worth many, \nmany, many millions of dollars, give it, for all practical purposes, to \na contractor. That contractor can submit a bid and bid against any of \nthe remaining ALCs at no cost for overhead.\n  So here we are in Utah or Georgia or in Oklahoma saying we are going \nto have to pay for all of this overhead in our bid, we have to account \nfor that some way, and they get something free. No, we can't bid. I \ndon't care if we gave them a 20-percent advantage, there is no way we \ncould do that, and we shouldn't be talking about that anyway because \nthe issue here is national defense. Are we going to be capable, Mr. \nPresident, of defending America, of handling those core issues and \nconcerns within the public sector?\n  I have to share something, because the very eloquent Senator from \nTexas quoted a number of people, and I would like to suggest to you, \nMr. President, that of the eight members of the BRAC committee, only \none who came out for privatization in place as something that is \nreasonable. I would like to read to you what some of the other \nCommissioners said. This comes from Commissioner Steele. She said:\n\n       The Commission was, in general, supportive of privatization \n     of DOD industrial activities where appropriate. However, \n     privatization as a concept and forced privatization in place \n     of what is clearly excess depot capacity are two very \n     different issues.\n       In the specific case of Sacramento and San Antonio ALCs, \n     the Commission was very aware that we were recommending the \n     closure of two very large industrial activities. The \n     Commission's recommendation to consolidate these workloads, \n     other than common-use ground-communication and electronics \n     work, ``to other DOD depots or to private sector commercial \n     activities as determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance \n     Council. Move the required equipment * * * to the receiving \n     locations''--\n       ``To the receiving locations,'' that means a location other \n     than Kelly Air Force Base and other than McClellan out in \n     California, because you still don't resolve the problem, if \n     you merely privatize in place and end up with five, so to \n     say, ALCs all operating at 50-percent capacity.\n       Forced privatization in place of all of the workload is \n     contrary to the intent of Report language.\n\n  She says, further reading toward the end of the letter:\n\n       The Commission clearly did not intend to privatize in place \n     all of the workload from the 2 ALCs we voted to close, as \n     noted in our Findings, ``closure * * * permits significantly \n     improved utilization of the remaining depots and reduces DOD \n     operating costs.'' Where the Commission encourages \n     privatization in place, our Report addresses it directly * * \n     *\n\n  And she cites the page numbers.\n\n       Such was not the case with the ALCs.\n\n  Finally:\n\n       If any Commissioner had offered a motion--\n\n  Listen, Mr. President--\n\n       If any Commissioner had offered a motion to privatize in \n     place, as the President proposes, I am 100-percent certain \n     that such a motion would have been defeated handily.\n\n  This is Wendi Steele, a Commissioner who went through all the \nprocesses. I won't go through the whole letter from Commissioner Lee \nKling, but I will read the last paragraph of his letter. Now keep in \nmind, these are two of the eight Commissioners. We have letters from \nall but former Senator Dixon.\n  He says:\n\n       The Commission's review clearly documented significant \n     excess capacity in the five Air Force Air Logistic Centers. \n     Privatization in place of all of the workload of Sacramento \n     and San Antonio Air Logistic Centers could result in little \n     or no savings to the Air Force by the closures. Further, it \n     might result in privatizing excess capacity rather than \n     eliminating it and could also miss the opportunity to improve \n     the efficiency of other DOD depots by increasing their \n     utilization.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these letters from \nCommissioner Wendi Steele and Commissioner Kling printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          The Defense Base Closure\n\n\n                                   and Realignment Commission,\n\n                                Arlington, VA, September 21, 1995.\n     Hon. J.C. Watts, Jr.\n     U.S. House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Watts: Thank you for your letter of \n     September 15 and questions regarding the issue of \n     privatization in place for the workload of the Sacramento and \n     San Antonio Air Logistics Centers.\n       The Commission was, in general, supportive of privatization \n     of DoD industrial activities where appropriate. However, \n     privatization as a concept and forced privatization in place \n     of what is clearly excess depot capacity are two very \n     different issues.\n       In the specific cases of the Sacramento and San Antonio \n     ALCs, the Commission was very aware that we were recommending \n     the closure of two very large industrial activities. The \n     Commission's recommendation to consolidate these workloads, \n     other than common-use ground-communication and electronics \n     work, ``to other DoD depots or to private sector commercial \n     activities as determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance \n     Council. Move the required equipment . . . to the receiving \n     locations'' was intended to move that workload to the most \n     cost-effective and operationally sound location after\n\n[[Page S5913]]\n\n     closure of the ALCs and elimination of that capacity.\n       We felt that the Depot Maintenance Council, rather than the \n     Air Force. Would be in the best position to proceed in good \n     faith to maximize efficiencies by determining what portions \n     of that workload should be interserviced, moved to another \n     ALC or transferred to the private sector (not necessarily \n     ``in place''). Forced privatization in place of all of the \n     workload is contrary to the intent of our Report language.\n       The only instance I am aware of the Commission specifically \n     discussing the possibility of significant ALC privatization \n     in place, or a government owned/contractor operated facility \n     (GO/CO), was the C-5 work at Kellly (excluding engines). That \n     would assume it could be accomplished by a private contractor \n     at that location for less than the savings and efficiencies \n     which would be realized by moving it. By all of our measures, \n     it appeared that the long-term savings to DoD would be \n     substantial by moving that workload to another ALC, but we \n     did not want to pre-determine the outcome of a complete and \n     fair analysis by the Depot Maintenance Council, which the \n     President's proposal disallows.\n       Though the Commission did not direct the engine work to \n     move to another ALC, our Findings state, ``The Commission \n     urges the Air Force to consolidate engine maintenance \n     activity at Tinker to reduce excess capacity. The Commission \n     firmly believes that consolidation of engine activities will \n     result in lower costs and increased efficiencies.''\n       Privatization in place of all the workload of the 2 closing \n     ALCs would enhance our national security posture only when: \n     Moving the work to another DoD depot or to a private activity \n     would have unmanageable operational/readiness risk; the costs \n     to move the work would outweigh the long-term efficiencies \n     and savings which would be realized (capacity utilization, \n     reduction in overhead, etc.); or a truly unique capability or \n     strategically important redundancy would be lost or unable to \n     be cost-effectively replicated elsewhere in the public or \n     private sector.\n       It's important to remember that both DoD and the \n     Commission's review clearly documented significant excess \n     capacity in the 5 ALCs. Privatization in place of all of the \n     workload of Sacramento and San Antonio would result in \n     shifting excess capacity to what appears would be a \n     competitively protected segment of the private sector rather \n     than eliminating it, and further, would miss the opportunity \n     to improve the efficiency of the other DoD depots.\n       The Commission clearly did not intend to privatize in place \n     all of the workload from the 2 ALCs we voted to close, as \n     noted in our Findings, ``closure * * * permits significantly \n     improved utilization of the remaining depots and reduces DoD \n     operating costs.'' Where the Commission encouraged \n     privatization in place, our Report addresses it directly (see \n     pgs. 1-58 to 1-61). Such was not the case with the ALCs.\n       Moreover, not allowing the remaining ALCs--all of which \n     ranked higher in military value--to compete for the \n     additional workload, will cause them to become increasingly \n     less cost-competitive in the future. Even beyond common sense \n     issues of most effectively utilizing our limited defense \n     resources, I am at a loss to understand why it would be in \n     the Air Force's best interest to protect its lowest ranking \n     depots at the expense of its 3 superior installations.\n       As difficult as it was to vote for the closure of 2 \n     facilities of this size and quality, the Commission voted 6-2 \n     to do so because we felt that it was in the best interest of \n     the Air Force, DoD, and the American taxpayers. If any \n     Commissioner had offered a motion to privatize in place, as \n     the President proposes, I am 100% certain that such a motion \n     would have been defeated handily.\n       Representative Watts, I hope I have answered your \n     questions. Please feel free to contact me if I might be of \n     further service on this or any other matter.\n           Highest regards,\n                                                  Wendi L. Steele,\n     Commissioner.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                 S. Lee Kling,\n\n                                St. Louis, MO, September 29, 1995.\n     Hon. J.C. Watts, Jr.\n     Congress of the United States, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Watts: Thank you for your recent letter \n     concerning the issue of privatization in place for the \n     workload of the Sacramento and San Antonio Air Logistics \n     Centers. I certainly understand your interest in this \n     question.\n       As Chairman Dixon noted in his July 8 letter to Deputy \n     Secretary of Defense John White, the Commission was generally \n     very supportive of the concept of privatization of DoD \n     industrial and commercial activities. This is consistent with \n     the May, 1995 Report of the Commission on Roles and Missions \n     of the Armed Forces, which concluded that ``with proper \n     oversight, private contractors could provide essentially all \n     of the depot-level maintenance services now conducted in \n     government facilities within the United States.'' \n     Privatization is very beneficial in certain situations but \n     not all.\n       In specific cases of Sacramento and San Antonio Air \n     Logistics Centers, the Commission was very aware that we were \n     recommending the closure of two very large industrial \n     activities. The Commission's recommendation to consolidate \n     the workloads of these two Air Logistics Centers ``to other \n     DoD depots or to private sector commercial activities as \n     determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council'' was \n     intended to give the Air Force and the Secretary of Defense \n     the maximum flexibility to implement the closure of these two \n     Air Logistics Centers in a way that would eliminate excess \n     capacity without harming ongoing Air Force operations and \n     provide the greatest savings. With the exception of the \n     direction to move the common-use ground-communication \n     electronics workload currently performed at Sacramento Air \n     Logistics Center to Tobyhanna Army Depot, the Commission did \n     not direct any of the workload of McClellan or San Antonio \n     Air Force Bases to any specific DoD depot or to the private \n     sector. We felt that the Defense Department was in the best \n     position to make these judgments.\n       The Commission's review clearly documented significant \n     excess capacity in the five Air Force Air Logistics Centers. \n     Privatization in place of all of the workload of Sacramento \n     and San Antonio Logistics Centers could result in little or \n     no savings to the Air Force by the closures. Further, it \n     might result in privatizing excess capacity rather than \n     eliminating it and could also miss the opportunity to improve \n     the efficiency of other DoD depots by increasing their \n     utilization.\n       Thank you for your continuing interest in the base closure \n     process.\n           Kindest regards,\n                                                     S. Lee Kling.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, this is taken directly out of the BRAC \nlanguage. It is critical that we find ourselves in a situation where we \nare going to be able to actively interpret the intent of the BRAC \nCommissioners. Eight Commissioners, and they used the same criteria \neverywhere they went. They visited all the installations. They were in \nOklahoma. It was very tense. We have five installations in Oklahoma. \nThey went to all of them. These people worked for years to try to come \nup with conclusions, so I am going to read some of the conclusions they \nhave, and then I would like to yield to the Senator from Georgia, if it \nis his desire to be heard on this subject.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for one \nquestion?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, I will yield for a question, and then I do want to \nhold the floor so I can conclude my remarks.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes, I understand, and since I was willing to answer \nany questions you had, I think that is fair.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the Senator has read a letter from \none of the Base Closing Commissioners, Wendi Steele. And I just ask if \nthe Senator from Oklahoma will tell us where Wendi Steele worked just \nbefore she went on the Base Closing Commission?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Where did she work?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Maybe you can tell me. I know she lived in Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes, Wendi Steele was actually the defense \nlegislative assistant for Don Nickles. She is from Oklahoma. I don't \nknow if she lived in Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I think she is from Houston.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. But she worked for Don Nickles before becoming a \nmember of the Base Closing Commission.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Can I ask a question of the Senator from Texas? During \nthe time that we approved the appointments by the President of the \neight Commissioners, we went through long hearings. You, at the time, \nwere a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I believe, and I \nwas there, too. I ask, did you have any objection to the appointment of \nWendi Steele as one of the Commissioners during those hearings?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. As a matter of fact, I was very concerned about the \nappointment of a former staff member of a Senator from a State that was \ngoing to be in competition with our State on several bases. I was \nconcerned about it. I asked Ms. Steele at the time if she would be \nwilling to recuse herself, since she was on Senator Nickles' staff, \nfrom any of the decisions that would bear on a base that was in \ncompetition with Oklahoma, and she said no. I thought of objecting to \nher at the time. I decided that I would not object because I hoped that \nshe would be fair and open and honest.\n  I was concerned when, as a member of the Commission, she was doing \nthe routine tour that Commissioners do of Kelly Air Force Base and she, \nat the time, said to the commander of the base, ``This is a really nice \nfacility. I wonder what we will be able to do here when all of this is \nmoved to Tinker?''\n  Now, this was when she was just in the research phase taking the \nroutine\n\n[[Page S5914]]\n\ntrips that everyone takes, and she had made up her mind that this was \ngoing to be moved to Tinker.\n  So I just think when I read the letters from the five members of the \nBase Closing Commission that stated clearly that privatization is an \noption that they meant to leave open in these base decisions, I just \nwanted the Senator to know what the background was on the letter from \nWendi Steele.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me reclaim my time. Thank you very much, I say to \nSenator Hutchison.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I appreciate you calling that to our attention. I also, \nMr. President, call to your attention the Commissioner in question is a \nresident--was a resident, I assume is still a resident--of Houston, TX, \nand she had not been on the staff of Senator Nickles for some time.\n  I think when we went through this process of determining whether or \nnot anyone was prejudiced on that Commission, I asked every \nCommissioner questions. I asked them: ``Are you going to use the \ncriteria in an unprejudiced manner?'' And they all responded yes. There \nis not one person who objected to Wendi Steele.\n  I will also say, I also quoted extensively Lee Kling. I don't believe \nLee Kling was ever on Senator Nickles' staff.\n  I want to yield to the Senator from Georgia, but since it is so \ncritical we know what the intent was, not just by reading the reports \nfrom the Commissioners, let me just go ahead and read a few things that \nactually came from the BRAC commission report. These are quotes, Mr. \nPresident, if you will bear with me for just a moment.\n\n       . . . significant excess capacity and infrastructure in the \n     Air Force depot system requires closure of the San Antonio \n     ALC.\n\n  They addressed separately the question in California. But the point \nhere is, I keep hearing, don't worry about it, they are already closed. \nNo one is going to be naive enough to say by closing it, they didn't \nfully intend to stop the excess capacity from taking place in Texas and \nin California. It was assumed that that would take place.\n\n  Second:\n\n       . . . closure of the San Antonio ALC and related activities \n     in Kelly AFB, including the defense distribution depot and \n     information processing megacenter, permits significantly \n     improved utilization of the remaining depots and reduces DOD \n     operating costs.\n\n  Third, another direct quote from the BRAC committee:\n\n       The Commission found the cost to realign Kelly AFB to be \n     less than that estimated by the DOD and the annual savings to \n     be significantly greater than DOD's estimate.\n\n  I heard someone, I believe it was the Senator from California, just a \nshort while ago make a statement--maybe I am not attributing that to \nthe right person--saying that the GAO study did not take into \nconsideration relocation. The GAO study clearly did take into \nconsideration relocation.\n  Quoting further:\n\n       The Commission assumed that a depot closure and \n     consolidation of work would permit a personnel reduction--\n\n  Listen, Mr. President--\n\n     of 15 percent of selected ALC personnel and a 50 percent \n     reduction in management overhead personnel.\n\n  Further quoting:\n\n       The decision to close the San Antonio ALC is a difficult \n     one, but given the significant amount of excess depot \n     capacity and limited defense resources, closure is a \n     necessity . . . The San Antonio ALC closure will permit \n     improved utilization of the remaining ALCs and substantially \n     reduce DOD operating costs.\n\n  I could go on all day with these things. There is a lot of redundancy \nhere. But it clearly expresses to us what their decision was and what \nthey meant.\n\n  The Commission staff presented data indicating large annual savings \ncould be realized by consolidating engine maintenance activities at \nTinker Air Force Base, OK. Both Kelly and Tinker are operating at less \nthan 50 percent of their engine maintenance capacity. * * * The \nCommission urges the Air Force to consolidate engine maintenance \nactivity at Tinker to reduce excess capacity. The Commission firmly \nbelieves that consolidation of engine activities will result in lower \ncosts and increased efficiencies.\n  Again, Mr. President, there can be no doubt that even if you tried to \nisolate certain things that were said or maybe a rumor that was heard \ndown in Kelly Air Force Base, I do not think we should be talking about \nstatements that cannot be documented and rumors that someone said this \nor someone said something else.\n  If you just stop and realize, if you have five ALC's operating at 50-\npercent capacity, and you close two, and, as the bill calls for, you do \nnot privatize anything in place there until the remaining, more \nefficient--according to the BRAC process--certification of ALC's \nlocated in Oklahoma and Utah and in Georgia are operating at a minimum \nof 75-percent capacity, I do not care if it is 65 percent, but the \nbottom line is anyone who has any business background knows that you \ncannot operate at 50-percent capacity and do so efficiently.\n  I do not think we need to attack the integrity of the independent \ncommissioners. I feel that people like Wendie Steele and Lee Kling and \nthe rest of them have spent time, their valuable time--sure there is \ncompensation, but there are very few people who would be willing to \ntake 2 years out of their lives to do nothing but evaluate the \noperation of literally hundreds of military installations.\n  Now, I have a lot more things to talk about. I would like to yield to \nthe Senator from Georgia. You know, I commented several times, as he \nsat in there with us in the Senate Armed Services Committee, that this \nnot a partisan thing. This is about defending America.\n  So I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CLELAND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma yielded the floor.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I missed some of the discussion of the \nSenator from Oklahoma. I would like to just highlight some points that \nI will mention about this discussion.\n  I say to the Senator, I am a newcomer to this basic issue here, but \nyou have been involved from the beginning of the BRAC process, all the \nway through.\n  Was it your understanding when this process was set up to close \nbases, that that was exactly the intent of the entire process, to \nindeed close bases, and that this issue of privatization in place came \nalong some time afterward as possibly something that was new to the \nprocess and has actually thrown that process off track? Is that your \nunderstanding?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is my understanding.\n  Before the Senator from Georgia got in here, I commented on several \nof the States. For example, Indiana, where the presiding office is \nfrom, he lost, and did so with grace, as much grace as he could, a \nmajor installation in Indiana.\n  Our own chairman, Senator Thurmond, I mean, no one, no one can have \nmore political influence to stop the closing of a base in his home \nState than the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. And Senator \nThurmond was willing to say, all right we have to bite the bullet.\n  The big issue here is, we need to use the money that is used on \nexcess capacity to be spent on such things as modernization, quality of \nlife, on readiness, on force strength. These are the things that we \nneed to be talking about.\n  So, yes, the whole thing on privatization in place, it was \nanticipated someone might bring it up. So the GAO in their report, when \nthey came to the conclusion that if you privatize that excess capacity \nin place in Sacramento and in San Antonio, it is going to cost the \ntaxpayers, and I say cost the defense system, because that is what it \nis going to come out of--$468 million a year. Over the 5 years, they \nsaid that is $2.34 billion.\n  In further responding to the Senator's question, I would say, you sat \nthere in those committee meetings when we had the service chiefs in \nthere and said, ``Where are we going to come up with the money if we \ndon't carry out the recommendations of the BRAC system?'' We have to \ncome up with several hundred million dollars. Is it going to kill the \nforce stream and quality of life and come out of modernization. ``Where \nis it going to come from?'' What did they say? They said, ``We don't \nhave anything for it to come out of.''\n\n[[Page S5915]]\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. I ask the Senator, is it your understanding, if this \nprivatization in place policy stands--of course, the bill reported out \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee does not prohibit privatization. \nIt just prohibits this policy which has thrown the BRAC process off \ntrack in terms of their logistics centers.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is a very good point.\n  In fact, several people, who would like to have us believe that--\nreferring to the privatization in place--very conveniently leave out \none sentence when they talk about realigning Kelly Air Force Base, \nincluding the air logistics center. The last sentence says, ``Move the \nrequired equipment * * * [and any required personnel] to the receiving \nlocations * * *.''\n  That means not there. Do not privatize excess capacity where you \nmaintain the problem of having five locations, each operating at 50-\npercent capacity. It is very, very clear.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I ask the Senator, isn't it true that if the action \nfollows, that is, the privatization-in-place policy, that we have heard \ntestimony--you and I were in the subcommittee listening to the \ntestimony from the Air Force--that if you followed the privatization-\nin-place policy, rather than just sheer privatization, it begins to \nthwart not only the BRAC decision, but it begins to obscure the whole \nconcept of privatizing to begin with, and that when the Air Force talks \nabout competition, say, competing for the C-5-A workload, they put \nqualifications on it in order to adjust to the privatization-in-place \nrequirement and require that work to be done for the C-5-A workload at \nKelly, and that absolutely compromises, I think, the whole sense of \ncompetition between an air base, say, like in Warner Robins--it is \ngoing after that workload--and a private contractor?\n  Isn't it your opinion that if we do not get rid of this \nprivatization-in-place policy, we will end up with five air logistics \ncenters, which is not the desire of the BRAC Commission, but three will \nbe publicly run by the Air Force and two will be private, costing the \ntaxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars? Is that not right?\n  Mr. INHOFE. You know, that is one of the three bottom lines here. It \nis just so logical that if you have five operating at 50-percent \ncapacity--as they said in this overdraft quoted out of their report; \nthey said it over and over again--you have to close two and transfer \nthe workload.\n  Now, the whole idea of privatization came up--and I hate to say it, \nbut it was highly political. We all get political right before an \nelection. This is what happened right before the election. And it \nhappened out in California. There are a lot of electoral votes in \nCalifornia. The administration said: ``We want to privatize in place.''\n  But clearly you are right. The Senator from Georgia is exactly right. \nThat does not resolve the problems.\n  A minute ago I said there are three bottom lines. That is one bottom \nline. Another bottom line is the fact that this is a national defense \nissue. How can we be sure that if there is a war, if Iran decides they \nare going to use some of that technology and the systems they are \ngetting out of China or Russia and go to war with us, that we are going \nto be in a position to fight that war? It is a national security issue \nso that if we do get in a war, we will not become dependent, for those \ncore activities, on a private contractor.\n  You know, I am all for privatization in place. But that is the other \nissue.\n  The third, of course, is cost. Those who say that GAO did not \nconsider privatization in place, they did. The GAO was before our \ncommittee. You were there with me. We sat there for several hours. We \ncross-examined this gentleman. He said, and repeated over and over \nagain, ``Yes, the costs. It is going to be to the taxpayers or to the \ndefense system. We proximate $468 million a year.'' Then I said, ``Is \nthat old information? Is that new?'' ``No; we brought it up to date.''\n  So that is their current position. That is their past position. The \nGAO was set up to be an independent agency to evaluate these things \nfree of political interference. They came out with this, that third-\ncost thing. The Senator from Georgia knows the problems that we are \nsuffering from right now in our defense system. He knows that we cannot \ncome up with $2 or $3 billion and take it out of something that is \nexisting. So the Senator from Georgia is exactly right.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I say to the Senator, you and I both sit on the \nsubcommittee. That point is well-taken, that regardless of some of the \naspects of this issue, which can be kind of arcane, when you start \ntalking about air logistics centers, the bottom line is, are we going \nto fulfill the goal of the BRAC Commission, and that is have three air \nlogistics centers, lean and mean and working at full capacity and ready \nto go in terms of the readiness of our forces? That is the bottom line. \nIf we compromise the BRAC decision, then we will not have three air \nlogistics centers lean and mean operating at full capacity really ready \nto do their job in a time of conflict and combat. That is one of the \nthings that really concerns me about this whole issue.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I respond to the suggestion of the Senator from Georgia \nthat in capacity, there is potentially enough capacity so there will be \na public depot in the event of war and have some capacity to grow into \nit. That is the reason that, again, it is somewhat arbitrary as to \nwhether it is 75, 80, or 85 percent. The GAO again said that you should \noperate the three remaining air logistics centers somewhere between 75 \nand 85 percent capacity to leave enough capacity so that, as the \nSenator suggests, in time of war we would have that capacity and then \nwe would be at full capacity. Clearly this is a national defense issue.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. I appreciate the Senator from Oklahoma and his \nleadership on this point and his concern for readiness of our forces, \nreadiness of our air logistics centers to do the job, the ability of \nthose centers to do the job economically and effectively, which in my \nreading of the BRAC process was part of the reason for the process even \noccurring, and that he marshaled great facts and arguments for the \ncommittee bill here, which I support, which does not eliminate \nprivatization, it just eliminates an absurd policy that is costing the \ntaxpayers of this country hundreds of millions of dollars and is \ninefficient, ineffective, and ultimately weighs down and compromises \nthree outstanding air logistics centers.\n  I just want to thank the Senator for his leadership and his \nscholarship on this issue. I will be supporting him on a vote.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Before the Senator yields the floor, I would like to \nrespond, in a way. We are talking about this as being a major national \ndefense issue. That is what it is really all about.\n  I am deeply concerned because I understand, certainly not as well as \nsome of the others around here, that the Senate rules do provide that \nany one Senator can stop the train, can stop and can kill a bill.\n  I see Senator Thurmond down there, the chairman of our committee, the \nhours that we put into this thing. I just hope that those who disagree \nwith one small part--this is a tiny part of this bill. We have pay \nraises for our guys in Bosnia. We have modernization programs in there. \nWe have barracks that are starting construction right now that we have \nto continue. We have literally hundreds of things that are totally out \nof this realm, not associated with the depot maintenance, that are in \nthis bill.\n  So I just hope that those who are opposed to this part or any part of \nthe bill would not use the Senate prerogative that each Senator has to \nstop the bill altogether so that we will not have the defense \nauthorization bill, but merely offer amendments to take out those parts \nthat they find offensive. I am prepared to debate against such \namendments that might cause this to come out.\n  So, I just respond by saying, I hope that you share my concern that \nwe do not want to hold up the defense authorization bill. Let us go \nahead, as Senator Thurmond had suggested in a meeting yesterday and \nsaid we have a good bill here. A lot of good things are in it. If \nsomebody does not like some provision, they have every right to stand \nhere on the floor and argue that case and be as persuasive as they can \nto take that out. I think that is the process, for the sake of \nAmerica's defense, that should be used.\n  I assume the Senator from Georgia would agree with that.\n\n[[Page S5916]]\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. The Senator from Oklahoma is absolutely correct. I \nsupport him 100 percent on that point. And the great chairman of our \ncommittee is absolutely correct; if there is anyone who disagrees with \nportions of this authorization bill, offer an amendment to delete it. \nBut to hold up the whole bill is wrong.\n  Second, I am the ranking Democrat on the committee that deals with \npersonnel in the military, particularly with quality-of-life issues. \nThere are many things in this piece of legislation that we are about to \ndiscuss, like the 2.8 percent pay rate increase in barracks housing and \nhousing for families on many bases and an increase in aviator pay, to \nrecruit and retain the best pilots and service men and women.\n  There are many things in this bill that our soldiers and sailors, \nairmen, marines, coastguardsmen out there really need. I hate to see \nthis bill run aground on this particular point that we have been \ndebating.\n  So the Senator is absolutely correct. I support him 100 percent on \nthat point.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Of course, the Senator from Georgia being the ranking \nmember of the Personnel Subcommittee, and Senator Kempthorne, being the \nchairman, as I go around and make the base visits, it is very \ndistressing. You mentioned flight pay.\n  We are losing our quality pilots to the private sector because there \nis a great demand out there. How can we compete, when these guys are \nwilling to do it? They want to fly the F-16's, the F-14's and the F-\n18's, and the equipment we have, the heavy equipment, the B-1's and B-\n2's, and so forth, but they also have families and they have children \nand we have to provide them with the pay that is somewhat competitive. \nWe are way below that. However, you are able to get in some provisions \nthat will, I think, retain some of these pilots.\n  Right now we are in the middle of an incredible housing shortage and \nwe have troops on food stamps, we have housing that they would not let \nprisoners live in.\n  We have a lot of improvements here due to your hard work and that of \nSenator Kempthorne. To jeopardize all of that work just because of one \nsmall provision--I suggest there are some things I do not like in this \nbill. If I do not like them I will offer an amendment to take it out. \nThat is the process. I just hope we can follow that process.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I will not prolong this particular debate about depots, \nbut I was passing through and heard it going on and could not resist \nthe opportunity to make some comments about it. The issue clearly will \nbe debated at greater length and I will have more statistics and \ninformation at that time.\n  The point I want to make in this context has to do with the issues \nraised by the Senator from Georgia and the Senator from Oklahoma \nregarding readiness and capability in the depots. It is the corrosive \neffect of a depot operating at less than full capacity or even \napproaching full capacity.\n  If I may, I will share with the Senate my experience at Hill Air \nForce Base where we have the air logistics depot that was rated No. 1 \nduring the last BRAC process. Let it be understood there were five \ndepots that BRAC looked at, and according to the ratings that were \ngiven these depots, Hill Air Force Base was rated No. 1, McClellan Air \nForce Base which BRAC said should be closed was rated No. 5, and Kelly \nAir Force Base, which BRAC said should be closed was rated No. 4.\n  However, the expected shift of workload from Kelly and McClellan to \nthe surviving three has not taken place. At the Hill Air Force Base \nthey are now down to about 52 percent of capacity. There has been a lot \nof conversation here about how inefficient and expensive that is. I \nagree with all that conversation. It is ineffecient and expensive. But \nit is more corrosive than that in terms of what it is doing to the \npersonnel on whom we will depend at some point for support if there is \na war.\n  The work force at Hill is aging. As people leave, they are not \nreplaced. Why should they be--the capacity of the base is not being \nused, so as attrition comes along and people leave, they are not \nreplaced. The people who are looking toward retirement in the next 5 to \n10 years recognize they will not be replaced if this capacity problem \nis not solved. Their morale is down. When they speak to the people in \nthe surrounding community who might want to apply for jobs, be trained \nand acquire the expertise that we will need, the present folk tell \nthem, quite understandably and logically, ``Don't bother. Don't come to \nwork here. The Air Force has no loyalty to its personnel. The Air Force \nhas no loyalty to this depot. They have done everything they can to \nclose the depot by keeping work spread out at other depots around the \ncountry.''\n  The time will come, and it will come relatively soon in terms of \ninternational defense issues, that is, within the next 5 to 10 years, \nwhen we will not have a work force at all. These people will have \nretired, they will have left, no one will have come in to be trained, \nand the Air Force will suddenly sit there and say, who can we get to do \nthis work at virtually any price, at any place? Depots do not manage \nthemselves. It takes people. Problems do not get solved by facilities, \nit takes people.\n  The process the Air Force is following in this privatization in place \nprocedure is corrosive and destructive of not only the morale but the \nskills of the people at each one of these depots. We would not have \nthis problem at Hill Air Force Base if Hill Air Force Base were \noperating at 75, 80 or 85 percent of capacity. People would be busy \ndoing productive, worthwhile things.\n\n  Now they are painting rocks--not literally, but figuratively. I have \nbeen in the Army. I know what happens when the drill sergeant has you \nfor the afternoon and has nothing for you to do. He requires that you \ngo out in front of the barracks and pick up all the rocks and paint \nthem and then put them back. That is not a really good morale \nexperience to go through. I have gone through that. I think just about \nanybody who has gone through training in the American military has had \nthat kind of experience from time to time. You want to spend your time \nin worthwhile activities, in real training, but they have you for the \nafternoon, they do not have anything for you to do, and military life \nbeing what it is, they will not let you go, so the top sergeant has you \nout there painting rocks. Well, figuratively, many of the people at \nHill Air Force Base are drawing their full salary, charging the \ntaxpayer the full cost, but they are painting rocks. Why? Because the \nwork they should be doing is still being done on the bases that the \nBRAC ordered to be closed.\n  We can talk about the price, we can talk about the money that is \nbeing wasted, we can talk about the inefficiency, but we should not \nlose sight of the corrosive impact on the morale, the expertise and the \nultimate future of the work force that will be necessary to keep this \ncountry alive and strong in the defense in the future.\n  I hope the members of the Armed Services Committee who address this \nissue keep this in mind, along with all of the other issues. We are \narguing about jobs and where they will be. We are arguing about dollars \nand where they will be spent. However, we are in an exercise created by \nthe Air Force's refusal to abide by the requirements of BRAC, that is \nterribly corrosive of the work force, and ultimately the readiness \ncapacity of this Nation.\n  It is very difficult to measure but that does not mean it is not \nreal. It is very difficult to pin down in specifics, but that does not \nmean it is not serious. It is real. It is serious. It is going on, and \nthe BRAC process must be implemented as quickly as possible in order to \nstop it.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the Senate has a very able majority \nleader. It is his business to take matters up after the committees have \nacted and to get action one way or the other. The Senate Armed Services \nCommittee has brought forth a bill here. It is ready to be acted on. \nWhy is this delayed? Some Senators are not pleased with what it \ncontains.\n  Now, any Senator who is not pleased with any portion of this bill and \nwishes to amend it or repeal it has an opportunity to offer an \namendment to do that. But to say to the Senate, we are going to object \nto even taking up the bill, even considering the bill, and holding up \nthe work of the Senate--isn't it reasonable to go forward with\n\n[[Page S5917]]\n\nthis bill, let amendments be offered, let them be acted on? That is the \ndemocratic way.\n  Now, the Senate Armed Services Committee passed this bill out \nunanimously. Every member of the Senate Armed Services Committee voted \nfor it. Every Republican and every Democrat voted for it. It cannot be \ntoo bad a bill in view of the unanimous support it has received.\n  Again, I repeat, any Member who is dissatisfied with any portion of \nthis bill has an opportunity to offer an amendment to the bill to their \nliking. I hope the objections to going forward with the bill and \nconsidering it will be discontinued and we can proceed with the welfare \nof the Senate which is to take up this bill and act on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I came down at noon with my colleague from \nTexas, Senator Hutchison, and objected to bringing the Defense \nauthorization bill to the floor of the Senate under unanimous consent. \nI then rushed back to the Finance Committee where we were finishing our \nmarkup on Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform. I did not have an \nopportunity when I raised the objection to explain exactly what all of \nthis is about. I wanted to come over very briefly and do that now.\n  Let me say I once had the great privilege of serving on the Armed \nServices Committee. I have always been a strong supporter of national \ndefense. My dad was a career soldier, a sergeant in the Army. I was \nborn at Fort Benning and I have always had a special place in my heart \nfor people who wear the uniform of the country. So it produces no great \nhappiness in my heart being in a position of holding up this bill.\n  Let me also say that I never like to do anything that brings distress \nto the chairman of this committee, Strom Thurmond, who is the greatest \nman that I have ever served with in public life.\n  However, let me explain to my colleagues why this issue is so \nimportant, although I do not want to get into a debate today about the \nissue. I am hoping we can work something out. I am hoping that reason \nand fairness will prevail, and like everything else in life, if you \nlook at something from a different perspective, you see it differently. \nI do not have any doubt that our dear colleague from Oklahoma in his \nheart sees this thing differently than I do. I think one of the things \nthat has helped me in public life is what an old Virginian, Thomas \nJefferson, once said, ``Good men with the same facts are going to often \ndisagree.'' So I never try to get personalities involved with issues.\n  This is about what we want to achieve, in some cases for our States, \nin some cases for the country. Let me tell you how I see the issue. \nThis is an old issue, in the sense that it has been building for \nseveral years. It started in the House with a group called the Depot \nCaucus. This is a group of Members of Congress who have depots in their \ndistrict. For those who know more about trains than they do about \nmilitary maintenance, a depot is a Government-owned facility where \nGovernment employees do work for the Defense Department--primarily work \nin maintaining defense systems.\n\n  Now, we have had a longstanding debate about whether maintenance work \nought to be done in depots, or whether it should be done by the private \nsector. You will hear people argue on both sides of the issue. Some \npeople will say only these depots can be relied upon to maintain \nweapons systems that were built by the private sector, not the private \nsector. We have gone through three base closings, and we have now \nclosed five bases in Texas.\n  I was an original cosponsor of the base closing commission. I voted \nfor the commission reports that closed all of those bases. I hated it. \nIt seemed to me that we were penalizing the very people who won the \ncold war, but I understood it had to be done. Let me say to my \ncolleagues that I am for another round of base closings. We have cut \ndefense by a third; we have reduced the number of military bases by 18 \npercent. We have more Army nurses in Europe than we have combat \ninfantry officers in Europe. Tell me that makes sense. We have a huge \nbureaucracy that was built in another era, for another time, for \nanother conflict. And we all love parts of that bureaucracy. Part of it \nis in our State. But it is profoundly wrong for the country, and we \nhave to have a bureaucracy that fits the military we have now.\n  So I am not here trying to defend a base in Texas, Kelly Air Force \nBase. That is closed. It is closed. The case is over. I voted to set up \nthe commission that closed it and voted for the report that closed it, \neven though I wish we had closed a base in someone's State who doesn't \nsupport defense as much as I do. So the issue we are debating here is \nnot trying to keep a base open. It is going to be closed. I don't want \nto reverse the decision. It is done. I wish it had been decided \ndifferently, but it wasn't.\n  Now, the issue before us is a very simple issue. The Defense \nDepartment, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Air Force, \nand those involved in procurement believe that we can save tremendous \namounts of money through price competition. Surely, in America, that is \nnot a revolutionary concept. What the Defense Department wants to do is \nto have competitive bidding between the three depots in the Air Force \nthat are doing maintenance work and private contractors. I should also \npoint out to my colleagues that my State, when Kelly is closed, will \nlose a minimum of 7,000 jobs that will go to the other three depots--\n7,000 jobs.\n  Now, what Senator Hutchison and I want is simply to allow private \ncontractors in our State or anywhere else to have the right to compete \nfor this work and, if they can do it better, if they can do it cheaper, \nthey would have an opportunity to do it. Quite frankly, the Air Force \nbelieves that we could have savings in the range of 20 to 25 to 30 \npercent by having price competition and by choosing the depots through \nGovernment employees to do the work when they are cheaper and choosing \nprivate companies to do the work when they are cheaper.\n  I remind my colleagues, given that defense has been cut by a third \nsince 1985, it ought to be welcome news that we can save that kind of \nmoney. We currently have a proposal out to privatize the maintenance of \nthe C-5, the great big transport plane that is operated by the Air \nForce. We have all seen it or seen pictures of it; it is big. Now, that \nwas a function at Kelly. So what the Air Force wants to do is to put it \nout for bids, and if one of the depots can do it cheaper, to move it \nthere, or if a private contractor can do it cheaper, take the facility \nthat has been turned over to the City of San Antonio and lease it to a \nprivate contractor, or even let a private contractor in any other city \nin the country do it, if they can do it cheaper.\n  Now, the bill before us says that that contract would have to be \nstopped, that you could not have competitive bidding until the depots \nwere operating at 75 percent of capacity, which would be most of all \nthe work that exists in the Air Force today, so in effect there would \nnever be another competitive bid. And it says, even if you had a \ncompetitive bid, nobody using facilities that used to be Kelly Air \nForce Base, or used to be McClellan Air Force base in California, could \ncompete.\n\n  Now, I understand give and take. I understand compromise. But I don't \nunderstand knocking people down and stepping in their faces. That is \nbasically what we are talking about here. Now, if we were simply \ntalking about Texas' interest, I am for Texas' interest. I get paid to \nrepresent it, and I try to do a good job at it. But the reason that I \nam adamant about this subject is this is not just Texas, this is \nAmerica. Why should we not have price competition?\n  I would like to remind my colleagues, when I was on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee--and two of my colleagues here sat with me every day \nI was on that committee--I always supported competition, I always \nsupported privatization, and I always supported it, even though my \nState might have benefited if we had stopped competition, because it is \nsomething I believe\n\n[[Page S5918]]\n\nin. It is fundamentally important to America. I know we have people who \nstand up and say, well, we can't contract out maintenance for the F-l6. \nYou could not trust somebody who didn't work for the Federal Government \nto maintain the F-l6. Our freedom depends on it. Well, who built the F-\nl6? Private contractors. The plain truth is, if Government defense \nwithout the involvement of the private sector really worked, we would \nhave lost the cold war.\n  My point is this: We ought to have it as a matter of policy, and \nsince I am standing on our side of the aisle, let me speak as a \nRepublican. If Republicans believe in anything, it is competition. If \nRepublicans stand for anything, it is that when we are spending the \ntaxpayers' money, we ought to do it as efficiently as possible. We \nought not to be concerned about where somebody lives that can do the \nwork cheaper. We ought not to be concerned about what their gender is \nor their ethnicity. We ought to be concerned about the work they can \ndo, the quality they can provide, and what they are willing to charge.\n  I have tried to break this impasse. Let me explain what I have \nproposed and why I think it is more than reasonable, bending over \nbackward, and then I will yield the floor. Obviously, if you wanted to \nbe reasonable on this issue, you would simply say to the Defense \nDepartment, look, here are a set of criteria for looking at a fair \ncompetition with a level playing surface. Let me say, with all due \nrespect, to the depot caucus in the House, the only fair competition to \nthem is no competition. The last thing on Earth they want is \ncompetition. But we could set out simple criteria for a level playing \nsurface to have competition between the public sector and the private \nsector to do this work. What we ought to do is to do that scrupulously \nand choose the low bidder for the highest quality and get the most \ndefense we can for the money we have. That is logic.\n  To try to break this impasse, I have made the following proposal. \nHave competitive bidding after you first set out the criteria for \ncompetitive bidding. If you want to look at the cost of the facilities \nthey are using, to make adjustments for it, then look at everything--\nlook at retirement costs, look at every single cost, come up with a way \nof measuring it, and have a competition. And then, even if the depots \nlose the competition by less than 10 percent, give it to them anyway. \nIn other words, let's say that we can maintain the C-5 through a \nGovernment depot for $109 million, and let's say that a private \ncontractor can do it for $100 million. What I have said is, to try to \nbreak this impasse, cheat the taxpayer out of $9 million. Give it to \nthe depot. But if the private sector can do it for more than 10 percent \nless, give it to them.\n  Now, what that is saying is that the depots will win any close \ncompetition. If they are no more than 9.99 percent higher, they win. \nBut if the private sector can do it for 10 percent or more less, can it \nbe prudent public policy, can it make any sense to deny them the right \nto do that work? I think the answer is no. That has been a proposal \nthat I have made.\n  Some people have answered, well, you won't have a fair competition. \nThe Air Force will cheat us. I am willing to try to set out criteria. I \npersonally don't believe any of us are so important that the Air Force \nis out to cheat us. I have never believed in conspiracies. But the \npoint is, all I am trying to do here is not keep a Texas base open. It \nis going to be closed. But what I want the workers there to have a \nchance to do is to go to work for private companies that might have a \nchance to compete for work. So I am not asking for anybody to give \nanything to San Antonio, TX. But I am demanding that we have an \nopportunity to compete. A problem we have here is we have a bill that \nbans that competition. And then we are going to conference with the \nHouse, which basically has the approach that whatever money there is \nbelongs to us and we are not worried about how efficiently it is spent, \nand this is really defense welfare anyway.\n  So what I am trying to do, and what I would very much like to do to \nmove ahead, is to try to work out an agreement on the principle of \ncompetition, something we believe in, something that clearly works, and \nI am willing to give an edge to the Government. But I think a 10-\npercent edge is more than generous. I don't think most Americans would \nagree with that, especially when many of the people competing are \nsmall, independent businesses. But, again, I mention this not because I \nthink it is what we ought to do, but what I am willing to do to try to \nbreak this logjam. So I thought it was important, having run over here \nfrom the Finance Committee and objected and then run back without \nhaving a chance to say anything, to get an opportunity to explain why \nthis is important.\n  This is a critically important issue. I feel like Senator Hutchison \nand I have not been treated fairly on this issue. I believe there is a \nfundamental national objective here, and I see it as the competition \nbetween special interests and the public interest and, in this case, \nthe public interest is also the Texas interest. When you combine the \ntwo, I am getting paid twice to do the same work. So I want to be sure \nthat I do it well. That is what this whole thing is about.\n  Again, I want to apologize to my colleagues for inconveniencing the \nprocess. I know they want to move ahead with their bill. But I know \nthat each of them, from time to time, have found themselves in a \nsimilar position.\n  Thank God the Founding Fathers set up the Senate where one Member \ndoes have power; where one person can stand in the face of large \nnumbers of others and say, ``no.'' Ultimately, they can be run over, \nbut they can't be run over for a long time. I think we all benefit from \nthat.\n  So I am simply taking advantage of the rights I have as an individual \nMember, as any Member here would, I believe, under the circumstances.\n  I thank my colleagues for listening. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, I rise to express my objection to a \nprovision in the defense authorization bill that is expected to shortly \ncome before the full Senate.\n  The reason that I take this time now to bring this to the Senate is \nthat it is a matter of great urgency. This is the kind of thing that I \nthink citizens throughout the country will automatically rebel against. \nThis is kind of a shock treatment that every now and then happens here \nthat ought to come to the attention of the American public because it \nis such a flagrant example of the abuse of power, and the power \nbelonging to a corporation with a good friend inside this body.\n  The provision I am objecting to is one of the most flagrant examples \nof special interest corporate subsidy that I have ever witnessed in my \nroughly 15 years in the U.S. Senate. This provision is section 3138 of \nthe defense bill, will have the effect of exempting a company called \nW.R. Grace--a company that has contributed to a hazardous wastesite in \nmy State of New Jersey--from any further liability at this site.\n  Mr. President, this provision was written to get W.R. Grace off the \nhook--out of any responsibility for pollution that they created, out of \nthe obligation to pay for it, thus passing the buck to the American \npublic. This company contributed to this hazardous wastesite in the \nState of New Jersey, and now the bill includes this reference that \nexcuses them from any further liability for pollution that they created \nat this site.\n  The provision effectively grants a special exemption for this company \nfrom a law known as the Superfund law, the law which embodies the \nconcepts that the polluter should pay for the pollution and \ncontamination that they created. It is fundamental. The\n\n[[Page S5919]]\n\nSuperfund law, which I am proud to have helped write, provides the \nGovernment with the tools to go after the polluters who are found to be \nresponsible for the waste.\n  Mr. President, this provision was inserted in the dark of night \nwithout any consultation with this Senator who has worked for so many \nyears to get this site cleaned up; and who has been chairman of the \nsubcommittee on Superfund in the Environment and Public Works Committee \nand is now the ranking member. Though I am not involved directly with \nthe Armed Services Committee, the fact of the matter is that everyone \nwho is here knows that I have been very much involved in helping to \ncreate the Superfund law and making sure that we clean up contamination \nin our country. But here, even the professional staff, the Democratic \nstaff of the committee, was unaware of this section's insertion and \nwere not given any opportunity to review the provision.\n  This provision is a sneak attack on the environment, on the \ntaxpayers, and on the legal process. This provision says to the \ntaxpayer, ``Too bad for you, taxpayer. We will let a corporate polluter \noff the hook because this polluter has some special friends in the U.S. \nSenate. Oh, and by the way, taxpayer, this dump has to be cleaned up. \nSomebody has to pay for it. So I guess it is going to be you. The most \nit can cost you, taxpayers, is $120 million. But it saves Grace that \nmoney.\n\n  So that should make us all feel good, I guess.\n  I want to explain a little bit about the Wayne Superfund site.\n  From 1948 to 1971, thorium, a highly radioactive material, and other \nmaterials, were extracted at the site that was later owned by W.R. \nGrace & Co. in Wayne, NJ. The process of mining thorium resulted in \ncontamination with radioactivity of numerous buildings. When the \ncontamination was discovered these buildings were torn down. The \nresulting waste material was placed in an enormous dump site in Wayne \nTownship, NJ. The Environmental Protection Agency placed this dump site \non the Superfund National Priority List in 1984. They said it was one \nof the worst contaminated sites in the country because this site would \npotentially threaten the drinking water supply for 51,000 New Jersey \nresidents. The Department of Energy, which oversees the cleanup of this \nfund under a program that they call FUSRAP, the Formerly Utilized Sites \nRemedial Action Program, has spent over $50 million so far cleaning up \nthis site. The Department of Energy says that the ultimate cleanup may \ncost as much as $120 million.\n  In 1984, W.R. Grace turned over the property and $800,000 to the \nFederal Government. That year, W.R. Grace signed a legally binding \nagreement with the Federal Government which provided explicit \nassurances that the Government could still pursue the company under any \nlaw, including the Superfund law. So when the Federal Government put \ndown the $800,000 deposit, that didn't permit them to escape any \nfurther liability. W.R. Grace signed the agreement to confirm that.\n  As the Department of Energy began to clean up the site and to further \nstudy the extent of contamination, it soon realized that the cleanup \ncosts were far beyond what they originally believed. In 1996, the \nJustice Department, acting on behalf of the Department of Energy, began \nserious discussions with W.R. Grace to determine the extent to which \nthe company might be willing to contribute additional costs to pay for \nthis massive cleanup.\n  I was assured that these discussions were proceeding in good faith \nand that progress was being made. But then I found out about this \noutrageous breach of the legal process to which I believe the company \nwould be seriously committed either by negotiations or tested in the \ncourts of our country.\n  Mr. President, the residents of Wayne Township are outraged. They \nfeel betrayed by the democratic process, and I share their outrage and \ndisappointment. I am going to be introducing an amendment to remove \nthis provision from the bill and to defend the concept embodied in our \nlaw that says that you create the mess, you clean it up; you can't walk \naway, or, in this case, sneak away from your responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \ncopies of letters from the Department of Energy written in 1995 which \nshow DOE's efforts to get W.R. Grace to come to the table.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Department of Energy,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 20, 1995.\n     Mr. Jeffrey M. Posner\n     Corporate Risk Management Department, W.R. Grace and Company, \n         Boca Raton, Florida.\n       Dear Mr. Posner: I am writing to determine the willingness \n     of W.R. Grace and Company to contribute to the continued \n     cleanup of the former Grace property located at 858 Black Oak \n     Ridge Road, in Wayne, New Jersey. From 1957 to 1971, the \n     facility was operated by the Davison Chemical Division of \n     W.R. Grace. Grace continued to own the site until September \n     1984, when the U.S. Department of Energy acquired the \n     property to facilitate a decontamination research and \n     development project. Congress directed the Department's \n     involvement in this project through the Conference Report \n     accompanying the Energy and Water Development Appropriation \n     Act for Fiscal Year 1984.\n       The Office of Environmental Management of the U.S. \n     Department of Energy is currently conducting the cleanup of \n     the site, also known as the Wayne Interim Storage Site, under \n     the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and \n     Liability Act (CERCLA). The total cost of the cleanup may \n     exceed $100 million, depending on the final remedy ultimately \n     approved by the Environmental Protection Agency\n       As you know, the owner of a site at the time of disposal of \n     hazardous substances at the site is responsible under CERCLA \n     for remedial action costs. Thus, Grace, a former owner of the \n     Wayne property, has a legal duty to pay for the site's \n     cleanup. In addition, there has been continuing congressional \n     and local interest in pursuing CERCLA cost-recovery actions \n     against potentially responsible parties. Recently, the \n     Department has received specific requests from elected \n     officials, including Senator Lautenberg, Congressman Martini, \n     and Wayne Township's Mayor Waks, that the Department review \n     possible legal actions seeking appropriate cost recovery. We \n     expect congressional and public interest in this issue to \n     continue.\n       We believe that it is in the best interest of the local \n     stakeholders and American taxpayers to discuss with your \n     company appropriate ways to avoid litigation and ensure that \n     resources are applied directly to the prompt cleanup of the \n     site rather than to courtroom activities.\n       I will be calling you in the near future to discuss this \n     matter further. If you have any questions, feel free to \n     contact me at 202-586-6331 or have a member of your staff \n     contact Mr. Steven Miller, of the Department's Office of \n     General Counsel, at 202-586-6947.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            James M. Owendoff,\n\n                                        Deputy Assistant Secretary\n     for Environmental Restoration.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                         Department of Energy,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 24, 1995.\n     Hon. Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: In my September 29, 1995, letter, \n     I advised you that the Department of Energy would look into \n     the matter of seeking cost recovery against potentially \n     responsible parties for cleanup of the Wayne, New Jersey, \n     site.\n       After consulting with the Office of the General Counsel, my \n     office has initiated discussion with W.R. Grace and Company \n     to assess their willingness to contribute to the cleanup of \n     the Wayne site. If these discussions are successful, W.R. \n     Grace's cooperation could enable the Department to expedite \n     the overall cleanup schedule for the site.\n       If possible, we would prefer to avoid time-consuming and \n     costly litigation so that available resources are focused on \n     cleaning up the site. If discussions with W.R. Grace are \n     unsuccessful, we will consider other options including \n     requesting the Department of Justice to initiate formal cost-\n     recovery actions.\n       We share your goal of pursuing opportunities to expedite \n     the cleanup activities at Wayne. As one example, the \n     Department began removal of the contaminated material in the \n     Wayne pile through an innovative total service contract with \n     Envirocare of Utah. We want to thank you for the enormous \n     support that you have provided over the years to bring this \n     project to fruition.\n       If you have further questions, please contact me, or have a \n     member of your staff contact Anita Gonzales, Office of \n     Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs, at (202) 586-\n     7946.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Thomas P. Grumbly,\n\n                                           Assistant Secretary for\n                                         Environmental Management.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is a strange anomaly that the name \nof this company, W.R. Grace, is the name of--I am not sure whether it \nwas the founder--but the name of someone who helped build this big \ncompany. It is also the name of someone who wrote a report that was \nofficially called ``The Report of the Grace Commission'' in which they \ntalked about how you reduce Government inefficiency, reduce\n\n[[Page S5920]]\n\ncosts, and cut down the size of Government and get those bureaucrats \noff our backs--all of those words. But now this company said there is \none way to resolve problems, and that is to hide behind a good friend's \nefforts, whoever that friend may be, and get it off the hook for \npossibly--$120 million.\n  We can't find enough money around here at times to take care of \nessential programs. We are cutting back Government as much as we can. \nWe are trying to arrive at a balanced budget in the year 2002. And we \nstruggled here not too long ago to try to get disaster relief money \ninto the hands of people whose homes were torn apart, whose families' \nhistories wiped out, with many left penniless and nowhere to turn. We \nhad a heck of a time getting those funds to those people.\n  Here we have $120 million that this Government is liable to have to \nspend to clean up this site. And what do we do? We let the company duck \nits responsibilities.\n  Well, Mr. President, I don't intend to threaten at all. But I will \nsay this: If this section stays in the bill and lets W.R. Grace off the \nhook, and maybe some other companies, we will have to study it a little \nmore thoroughly. I will stand here, and I will talk. I will read, I \nwill lecture, and I will do anything I can to keep this from becoming \nlaw because it is an outright misuse of taxpayers' funds. I am not \ngoing to let that happen, Mr. President--not this Senator. And I am \nsure other Senators will agree with me.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I thank you. I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that I be \nshown as an original cosponsor of S. 923.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Depot Maintenance\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to just take a couple of \nminutes to respond to the best of my memory to some of the things that \nwere stated by the senior Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm].\n  First of all, he mentioned that personality should not enter into \nthis. I certainly hope that will be the case. Unfortunately, Mr. \nPresident, all too often in both bodies if we get wrapped up in things \nwe honestly believe in, it becomes personal. I do not think this will \nbe the case, certainly in the case of Senator Gramm. He is a man I have \nrespected for many, many years even before I served in the other body \nor this body. In fact, I was one of the individuals who strongly \nsupported him in his bid for President of the United States because I \nthought he was the best choice. And it was not an easy thing for me to \ndo because, unfortunately, our majority leader in the Senate was \nrunning.\n  However, I think some things need to be brought out and some things I \nhave access to because of the fact that I serve on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and chair the readiness subcommittee of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee.\n  First of all, on this issue of the depot caucus we hear so much about \nin the other body, I hear some statements attributed to them that sound \na little bit extreme from time to time, but I have to say also that \nthat is a group of people with a genuine concern over how depot \nbusiness should be handled.\n  All too often we start thinking of parochial concerns, about what is \nthe effect of a certain action going to be on the population of my \nState, and forget about the fact that there is a reason for a depot and \nthere is a reason for core functions to be performed in a depot. All \ntoo long we have gone without a definition of core, and core, Mr. \nPresident, as you well know, is those functions that have to be \nperformed to enable us to defend the lives of Americans.\n  That is what it is all about. When you talk about the depot caucus \nover on the other side, I did some things in this bill, and, of course, \nthe Chair is fully aware of it because he was there at the time, made \nsome compromises that the so-called depot caucus found very offensive. \nI agreed to change the 60-40 formula to 50-50. Also, I did something \nelse that not many people really are aware of because it gets a little \nbit technical but provided for allowing teaming to be done by a public \ndepot. This is extremely significant and it shows that I of all people \nam not against private sector competition.\n  The Senator from Texas [Mr Gramm] talked about this as one of the \nbackbones of the philosophy of the Republican Party and the \nconservative movement. Certainly no one can do more than I have done in \nthe effort for privatization. The difference that has to be \ndistinguished in this case is you can't privatize business, you can't \nprivatize functions that are necessary for the survival of this \ncountry.\n  Let us just say, for example, that in the F-100 engines which are \nused in some of our combat machines that are necessary to defend \nAmerica and we saw performing so well in the Persian Gulf war, that has \nto be done, we have decided, as a policy for America in public depots. \nAnd the reason is even if it costs more money--I do not think it does. \nI think I can come up with an argument that will say that we can do \nthings more efficiently in some of those functions in the public \ndepots; we are set up to do that. But even if we were not able to do \nthat, there is another reason why they have to be done in the public \nsector, and that is the strategic interests of the United States, the \ndefense issues.\n  We have all agreed as the policy of this country that core \nactivities, core functions, must be done by the public sector. And so \nwe established this somewhat arbitrary, which it is arbitrary, 60-40, \nand I was willing to accommodate one of the very prominent Senators \nfrom Arizona on the committee, Senator McCain, and Senator McCain did \nappreciate that very much. So we changed that, and not only are we \ngoing to give the ability to the public depots to team, and that is to \ngo outside and subcontract some work, I am willing to count that in any \nformula as public sector work, even though it is done by the private \nsector.\n  Now, that is a great, I think, compromise that we made in order to \naccommodate some of the Senators who had concerns, and consequently \nthat Senator is in support of the language that is found in this bill.\n  So I think that if we could present the argument, there is no way you \ncould give even a 20-percent advantage to the public sector in depot \nmaintenance and still have a level playing field. We are fully aware of \nthe process that is written into our system that allows the disposition \nof Federal properties to be first offered to the Federal Government, \nthen the State government, then ultimately to local subdivisions such \nas Tulsa, OK, or San Antonio, TX. And so in the event they at no cost \nin the case of a San Antonio, TX, are able to acquire Kelly Air Force \nBase and have that multi, multimillion-dollar facility at no cost, they \nin turn then can give that to a contractor who will bid with no \noverhead whatsoever.\n\n  Now, that is something with which we cannot compete in Tinker Air \nForce Base or they could not compete with in any other military \ninstallation. And there are many other--I have already talked about \nthis and talked about those things that are in the bidding process \nwhich make it so that we cannot do it.\n  I was a little bit surprised when the junior Senator from Texas was \ntalking about John White. During the committee meetings that we had, \nJohn White was not able to answer questions about how to level the \nplaying field and provide for real competition if it is desirable.\n  Keep in mind, Mr. President, it is not desirable because we have \nestablished as a policy that those core functions that are necessary to \nprotect the lives of Americans should be done in public depots. If you \ndo not do that, you are going to have a situation where we can be held \nhostage in times of war, and we know what that could mean for us.\n  Given the manner in which competition is structured, everyone already \nknows that private sector bids will come in well below depots, and \nthere are two reasons why. The private bidders can use marginal \npricing. We know what marginal pricing is in Government work. Private \nbidders, unlike the public sector, are allowed to use\n\n[[Page S5921]]\n\nmarginal pricing to underprice something to get their foot in the door, \nand once the foot is in the door we become reliant upon them and then \nthey run off. I am not saying the people who are the private sector are \nunscrupulous or in any way demeaning what they do. They are out in the \ncompetitive world, and they are willing to use their assets to bid \nbelow cost just to get in there so that the public sector would no \nlonger have the ability to provide that work. I think the Senator from \nUtah made a very good point. We are losing that ability today. As the \nskilled workers, whether they are located in Oklahoma or Utah or \nGeorgia, are leaving, getting into other professions, so we would \nhave--every week that goes by we would have a more difficult time in \nhaving this as public sector work that would defend America.\n  So I conclude, Mr. President--and I do not want to be redundant--by \nsaying that another bottom line is right here. This is a GAO report. \nThe GAO report agrees with what the Air Force initially said on how \nmuch money would be saved by closing the two bases and transfer that \nworkload to other ALC's. Then they later on, when this administration \ntook a position against it right before the election, they rescinded \nthat report, but the GAO, which is independent of that political \ninfluence, came out and said very clearly if you do it, it is going to \ncost the defense system an additional $468 million a year. And \ncertainly the man who is presiding right now, the honorable Senator \nfrom Virginia, who is one of the highest ranking members of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, is fully aware that if we have to somehow \ncome up with $2 billion over a 5-year period to take out of the defense \nbudget in order to accommodate an exception to the BRAC \nrecommendations, where is it going to come from? He will remember very \nwell we had the chiefs of the services there, and we gave them the \nalternatives. It has to come from quality of life, modernization, force \nstrength or readiness. There are only four places it can come from. We \ncannot predict the contingencies this administration will get us into \nthat are very expensive. We can predict these, and there is no place we \ncan come up with this money. So this is an extremely important fiscal \nissue, and I wanted to have the opportunity to respond to the senior \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. INHOFE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5918-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     ELIMINATION OF VETERAN BENEFITS FOR CAPITAL OFFENSE CONVICTION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, it is my hope that yet this afternoon \nwe will be able to take action on legislation cosponsored by Senator \nTorricelli, Senator Nickles, and Senator Inhofe which would deal with \nthe issue of eliminating veterans benefits for anyone who has been \nconvicted of a capital offense. This legislation was introduced \nyesterday and is designed to deal with the situation of Mr. Timothy \nMcVeigh, who last week was convicted of murder in the first degree on \n168 murders arising out of the destruction of the Murrah Federal \nBuilding in Oklahoma City back on April 19, 1995.\n  I was surprised to learn from my staff on the Veterans Affairs \nCommittee that someone in Mr. McVeigh's situation would be able to \nreceive veterans benefits. There are a wide variety of possible \nbenefits. Exactly which ones apply to Mr. McVeigh would have to be \ndetermined, but they are benefits which would include employment \ntraining--obviously he cannot do that at the present time--education, \nother compensation, burial benefits. There was a gap in the law where \nsomeone who has been convicted of a number of crimes cannot receive \nveterans benefits--crimes like treason, sabotage, or espionage--but \noddly enough, curiously enough, a conviction for murder in the first \ndegree is not covered.\n  Senator Torricelli had introduced legislation yesterday and so had I. \nI did not know this when I introduced my legislation and spoke briefly \non the Senate floor yesterday afternoon about Senator Torricelli's \nlegislation, but I found out about it later in the day and talked to \nhim this morning, and we are coordinating our efforts to produce a \njoint bill.\n  I discussed the matter yesterday with the majority leader, Senator \nLott, who said he would work with us to have a prompt determination for \nthe Senate, and we have put it on the hotline, and we are almost \ncomplete, with one Senator yet to respond, and there has been a \nchecking now with the administration, with the White House, with the \nExecutive Office of the President, and also with the Veterans' \nAdministration to see if there is any objection. I do not believe that \nthere will be any.\n  It is my hope we would be able to take action fairly soon this \nafternoon, or, if we cannot, we may have to put it over until tomorrow. \nThere has been considerable public interest and people expressing \nsurprise that someone in Timothy McVeigh's situation could have \nveterans benefits and could, illustratively, be buried with heroes from \nthe veterans wars of World War II, Vietnam, Korea, or the gulf war.\n  So we are proceeding at this time. I wanted to alert my colleagues we \nare hopeful that bill will come up this afternoon and try to expedite \nthe advice from both the White House and the Veterans' Administration \nas to their positions. It is my firm expectation that they will not \nhave an objection but would rather welcome this legislation, but I \nwanted to inform my colleagues of the status at this time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5921-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5921-S5922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATIONS TO CIA AND FBI\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Madam President, I take the floor today to \ncongratulate the Central Intelligence Agency and the FBI for their \nefforts in capturing the terrorist who killed two CIA officers in 1993.\n  Many thought when Aimal Kansi disappeared into Pakistan in 1993 that \nhe would never be caught. I believe that our men and women who played a \nrole in his capture deserve our thanks for the brave effort they went \nthrough to catch him.\n  Another critical question that I do not think has been answered is \nwhy was Mr. Kansi ever allowed in this country in the first place? Why \nwas he here to begin with? He came here in 1991, apparently well \neducated, as a Pakistani immigrant. He came here on a business visa. \nSupposedly, he came here for 1 month. He used false names and \npassports, and then the INS gave him a 1-year work visa. Of course, the \nplan was that he wanted to stay here forever. There was never any doubt \nabout what he wanted. He wanted to be here permanently. A year later, \nhe applied for political asylum. The political asylum issue has been \nabused to a greater degree than anything I can think of. The Clinton \nadministration has made an absolute mockery of the words ``political \nasylum.'' There are almost 100,000 applications for political asylum \neach year.\n\n  Now, here is the scandal. When someone has applied for political \nasylum, they cannot be deported. When you apply for political asylum, \nyou cannot be deported. This application is a complete ruse for people \nto stay in this country illegally. These people can stay here for \nyears. Now, one of the reasons this man sought asylum--if you can get \nthis--and talk about stupidity on the part of this country--is that he \nis part of a militant group in Pakistan that opposes United States \npolicies. That is the reason he needed asylum, so he could stay in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. Kansi apparently moved about frequently. He worked at gas \nstations and as a courier in Virginia. Madam President, why do we need \npeople coming into this country to work at a gasoline station and as a \ncourier? Is this\n\n[[Page S5922]]\n\nsomething we really need to grant a work visa for?\n  Our immigration policies are simply out of control. We have hit a \nrecord number of immigrants coming into the country. In fact, so many \nare coming in that people with criminal records are getting by like \nthey were moving through a sieve. We are filling the country with \nanybody with any excuse or reason who wants to come. People like Mr. \nKansi are getting in by lying, false records, or whatever they want to \npresent. They wind up here one way or another and we simply refuse to \nsend them out.\n  Our immigration policies are out of control and people are coming \nwithout being examined, without being checked. They are here. The World \nTrade Center bombing is an example. The shooting at the Empire State \nBuilding is another. The CIA killing in 1993 is another. All of these \nacts were committed by people that were willingly let into this \ncountry. How many instances does it take like this before we have the \ncommon sense to change the immigration laws that we are letting wreck \nthis country?\n  I think we need to take a hard look at the laws and determine if we \nare letting people into this country that are prone to commit terrorist \nacts against the Nation once they get here.\n  One of the basic problems, of course, with immigration is that we \nhave a more-than-generous welfare system--more than generous. People \nare coming into this country not to work, but to sit down. They are \ncoming here to become part of our welfare system, not to become part of \nour work force. When we attempted to change our welfare laws and cut \noff cash assistance to noncitizens, the Congress got frightened, and we \ndecided it was being too harsh not to give cash money to noncitizens. \nHow cruel could we be not to hand out cash to an illegal noncitizen? We \nhave perpetrated an immigration system that is out of control.\n  Madam President, we know that there are many people who want to be \nAmericans. Many people want to come here and make a contribution to the \nUnited States. We have a long history of immigration. We are all \ndescendents of immigrants from somewhere at one time, except Native \nAmericans. But somewhere we have gone wrong. At one point, people came \nto this country to work and to labor and be a part of it. But now they \ncome to be a part of charity. I think we began to go wrong when we lost \ncommon sense in our immigration policies.\n  Madam President, I think the problem began when we lost common sense \naltogether in the Government, and particularly with the welfare \nprograms supporting the things that these people were coming for. Why \nshould we give noncitizens welfare? Why should the Federal Government \npunish a county or town if they don't print documents in languages \nother than English? Madam President, we do that.\n  Why do we have pages and pages of legislative language just to define \nthe word ``work.'' I think anybody that has done a day's work would not \nneed 14 pages of legalese language to describe it. Madam President, \nagain, I want to thank the agents with the CIA and the FBI that played \na role in bringing this man back to the United States. They represent \nwhat is best about the country. But the immigration laws that allowed \nMr. Kansi to get into this country and to stay here represent the \nworst.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Faircloth].

Mr. President, this bill would amend existing law to \ndeny benefits to veterans who have been convicted of a Federal capital \noffense. Current law denies such benefits to veterans convicted of \nFederal crimes, such as sabotage, treason, and sedition, but not \nmurder.\n  I offer this bill on behalf of myself and my distinguished colleague \nfrom New Jersey, Senator Torricelli, and also Senator Byrd, Senator \nNickles, Senator Inhofe, Senator Feinstein, Senator Campbell, and the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer, Senator Santorum.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I was informed by staff in the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, which I chair, that there is a gap in the law which \nallows Mr. Timothy McVeigh to be entitled to veterans benefits \nnotwithstanding his murder of 168 persons, and his conviction\n\n[[Page S5923]]\n\nfor murder in the first degree in connection with his terrorist attack \non the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995.\n  Frankly, I was surprised to learn of the current gap in the law which \nwould allow him to claim veterans benefits. Those guilty of offenses \nsuch as sedition, treason, and espionage forfeit veterans benefits, but \nthose who are guilty of murder in the first degree do not.\n  The terrorist attack in Oklahoma City was the most heinous criminal \nact in the history of the United States of America, to my knowledge. It \nresulted in the murder of 168 persons, including many children. It also \nresulted in the wounding and maiming of hundreds of others who were in \nthat building.\n  Yesterday, Senator Torricelli introduced legislation similar to mine. \nWe talked this morning, and we decided to join our efforts. Senator \nLott consented to have the matter placed on the calendar for quick \naction. And we have had it now cleared by all Senators.\n  I think this is a piece of legislation which ought to be adopted \npromptly. It would set a mark, saying that capital murderers, like \nthose who commit espionage and similar offenses, forfeit a variety of \nveterans benefits. I cannot say exactly what benefits Mr. McVeigh might \nbe eligible for--there could be a variety of possibilities, including \neducation, employment or housing benefits. Certainly he would be \nentitled to burial benefits, under current law. It surely would be \nunseemly to have Timothy McVeigh buried in a veterans cemetery with \nheroes who served the United States of America.\n  So I believe this is a fair piece of legislation. We ought to act on \nit promptly.\n  I am pleased now to yield to my distinguished cosponsor, the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, in offering this \nlegislation, and very proud, as a Member of this institution, that \nSenator Specter has taken the leadership in correcting what would \nclearly be an inexplicable action upon the execution of Timothy \nMcVeigh.\n  Mr. President, in the United States today there are 114 national \ncemeteries. They contain the bodies of 2.5 million brave Americans who \nhave fought for over 200 years to protect this country, its people, and \nits ideals. Fifty-seven of those cemeteries remain open. And many \nAmericans living in the last years of their lives who fought bravely \nfor this country intend one day to be interred into that soil.\n\n  I do not know how the Members of this Senate, how this Government \ncould ever explain to those brave souls or their families who will \nvisit those national cemeteries through the years, generation after \nsucceeding generation, if by chance some of that soil, one of those \ngraves, next to someone they love and they admire and respect, were to \ncontain the body in a Federal grave of someone who committed a capital \noffense against the U.S. Government.\n  Timothy McVeigh is responsible for the greatest loss of life in a \nterrorist act of anyone in the long and proud history of these United \nStates. When he committed that act and took the lives of these brave \nAmericans, including officers and employees of the U.S. Government, he \nforfeited, according to a jury of his peers, his life.\n  Today, by the actions of the U.S. Senate, he can also have forfeited \nhis right to be buried and have the honor of being in the sacred ground \nof a national cemetery of the United States.\n  Mr. President, a person cannot both commit a capital offense and then \nreceive the high honor of the U.S. Government for having served this \ncountry. They are in conflict. They cannot both occur.\n  I am very proud today once again to be joining with Senator Specter \nin offering this legislation. I am very pleased to have received the \nsupport of Senator Rockefeller and so many of our colleagues. I am very \nproud today to be offering this legislation.\n  By our action today, we let every family of every brave American who \nremains at rest in these national cemeteries to know these soils will \nremain sacred, these cemeteries will remain only the home for the \nbrave. That is the exclusion we vote upon today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We are awaiting Senator Nickles.\n  We invite other Senators to make a statement, but in the interim I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I wish to thank Senator Specter, \nSenator Torricelli, and Senator Inhofe for bringing this bill to the \nfloor, and also Senator Lott for bringing it to the floor this quickly.\n  I think it is somewhat of a tragedy. I read in today's paper that an \nofficial of the Department of Veterans Affairs said that Tim McVeigh \nwould be eligible to be buried in a national cemetery. I think that \nwould be a desecration of our national cemeteries. I think it would be \nan affront to all the veterans who are buried in a national cemetery \nand to their families. And so I want to compliment my colleagues for \nbringing this to the floor so quickly.\n  In looking at the statutes, there is a forfeiture of veterans \nbenefits for a lot of crimes: mutiny, sedition, harboring and \nconcealing persons who have committed espionage crimes, gathering \nclassified information for a foreign government, treason, rebellion, \ninsurrection, and advocating the overthrow of the Government. But there \nis not for a Federal capital offense.\n  Mr. McVeigh was found guilty by a jury, with a unanimous verdict of \nmurdering--actually, I think the verdict was murdering eight Federal \nagents, Federal officers. He is responsible for the murdering or the \ndeaths of 168 individuals, including 19 children. He planned this \nterrorist attack. It was not done at the spur of the moment. He planned \nit for months, maybe for years. He was found guilty. The jury has made, \nin my opinion, the appropriate sentence, a sentence that is appropriate \nfor a crime of this magnitude--the death sentence.\n  Certainly it would be a dishonor to our national cemeteries and the \nveterans if he was accorded veterans benefits, both financial benefits \nas well as burial rights in our national cemetery. I think it would \ndesecrate the cemetery. I think that is certainly sacred ground, \nhallowed ground, honoring our national veterans, individuals that gave \ntheir lives in service to their country, individuals who served our \ncountry and were willing to give their lives.\n  To have Mr. McVeigh buried alongside our national heroes I think \nwould be a serious, serious mistake and a real denigration to our \nnational heroes.\n  So, Mr. President, I am happy to cosponsor this legislation. I am \nhappy with the leadership of the Senate and the leadership of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Specter, and Mr. Torricelli, for \nbringing this to the floor of the Senate. And I am hopeful that it will \nreceive a unanimous vote in this Senate and also be adopted by our \ncolleagues in the House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I support a bill to correct a \nserious problem made apparent by the recent conviction of Timothy \nMcVeigh for his cowardly act of terrorism. I was in the process of \ndrafting a bill on this issue, but in light of the scope of the bill \nproposed by the Veteran's Committee chairman, I am pleased to join as a \ncosponsor of this legislation to accomplish my goals.\n  Our Nation remains outraged at that terrorist act and the individual \nwho was convicted of committing it. We now are further outraged at the \nthought of that person being eligible for burial in a military cemetery \nbeside our fallen brothers and sisters.\n  As you well know, Mr. President, these military burials function to \nhonor the brave men and women who have placed themselves in harm's way \nin order to defend our freedom and the system of government that has \nprotected us for more than 200 years. As a\n\n[[Page S5924]]\n\nKorean war veteran and a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I \nam personally aware of the sacrifices made by our men and women in \nuniform to serve and protect these freedoms.\n  When anyone seeks to destroy our system of government by acts of \nterrorism, it is certainly a slap in the face to those who have served \nto protect freedom. Allowing that individual to be buried alongside \ntruly honorable veterans is not only an injustice, it is disrespectful \nof the memory of those buried in our military cemeteries and to their \nfamilies who sacrificed as well.\n  This bill, introduced by Senator Specter, expands the criteria by \nwhich a veteran should be denied benefits and although I had planned to \nintroduce such a bill, I am pleased to cosponsor S. 923 to be \nabsolutely certain that any individual convicted of a crime as heinous \nas the Oklahoma City bombing will never be buried among our Nation's \nheroes.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 414) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I believe we are already for a vote on \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the measure? If \nnot, the question is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, as my colleagues know, the Oklahoma City \nbombing trial of Timothy McVeigh has concluded in Denver. The jury \nfound McVeigh guilty on all 11 counts against him, and he has been \nsentenced to death.\n  Now that these proceedings are over, I take this opportunity to call \nto the attention of my colleagues the outstanding service of Chief \nJudge Richard Matsch who presided over the Oklahoma City bombing trial \nat a time when many of us here in this body are considering the \nappointment process for Federal judges. His leadership has provided \nmany Americans a renewed faith in the judicial process. His example of \nfair, firm leadership is an outstanding model we should consider for \nfuture Federal judicial appointments.\n  Many members of the legal profession and the media predicted that the \nOklahoma City bombing trial would last 4 months. Under Judge Matsch's \ncalm, competent direction, the trial concluded in only 2 months.\n  Judge Matsch has an impressive legal career. He was associate editor \nof the law review at the University of Michigan School of Law. After \nlaw school, he joined the U.S. Army and became an intelligence officer. \nWhen he left the Army, he moved to Denver where he was in private \npractice. Judge Matsch went on to become a city attorney, a Federal \nprosecutor, and a bankruptcy judge before President Nixon nominated him \nto the Federal bench in 1974. In 1994 he was elevated to chief judge.\n  Judge Richard Matsch has earned the admiration of his colleagues and \nlawyers who have appeared before him. Lawyers and colleagues from the \nbench praised the choice of Matsch to preside over the trial noting \nthat he has the appropriate judicial temperament. One attorney who has \nargued before him said poetically, Judge Matsch ``is better than indoor \nplumbing.''\n  In light of the skillful and professional way Judge Matsch handled \nthe proceedings of the McVeigh trial, I urge my colleagues to join me \nin recognizing the contributions of Judge Matsch to our justice system \nand commending him for his firm, swift justice in such a tragic case. \nHe has touched the lives of many Americans with his outstanding \nservice, and has renewed the faith in all of us that justice can be \nserved.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5924-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5924-S5925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AUTHORIZATION FOR EAST-WEST CENTER\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, during the negotiations to achieve passage \nof the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1997, a number \nof concessions had to be made to accommodate competing interests. One \nsuch example was the continuation of the authorization for the East-\nWest Center at the current level of $10 million for both fiscal years \n1998 and 1999.\n  According to its budget justification, the East-West Center seeks to \nimprove understanding and relations between Asia, the Pacific islands, \nand America. While this may be a worthwhile endeavor, we must question \nwhether it merits a direct subsidy when the center seems to duplicate \nState Department activities and other private business, academic, \ncultural exchange, and tourism programs.\n\n[[Page S5925]]\n\n  The East-West Center already receives a high proportion of its \nfunding from private sources and project specific Federal grants. It \nseems that it could continue its core functions without the American \ntaxpayer footing the bill. Even the Clinton administration has \nrecognized the need to terminate Federal funding for this center. The \nadministration's budget summary noted that the effort to phase out \ngovernmental funding for the East-West Center will continue with its \nrequest of $7 million. Yesterday we took a step backwards from \nachieving that goal. It is my sincere hope that the appropriators will \nreduce funding from the current level.\n  I started my fight to eliminate Federal funding for the East-West \nCenter nearly 2 years ago, and I plan to continue my efforts. Many of \nmy colleagues think that $10 million isn't a lot of money considering \nthat we have a $1.6 trillion budget. I believe every expenditure should \nbe reviewed regularly. At a time when Congress, at the request of the \ntaxpayers, is working to finally balance the budget, this kind of sole-\nsource, noncompetitive project can no longer be justified.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5924-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               U.N. VOLUNTARY FUND FOR VICTIMS OF TORTURE\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, during the debate on reforming the United \nNations to make it a more effective organization, there was little \ndiscussion about the important work that the United Nations carries \nout. One good example which directly relates to my State is, the U.N.'s \nleading role in promoting and providing financial assistance to \ntreatment centers for victims of torture around the world. The passage \nof my amendment to the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of \n1997, which authorizes the United States to contribute $3 million in \nfiscal year 1998 and $3 million in fiscal year 1999 to the U.N. \nVoluntary Fund for Victims of Torture, ensures that treatment centers \nin more than 50 countries will continue to receive support. I would \nlike to thank the junior Senator from Minnesota for cosponsoring my \namendment, and joining me in being an advocate for helping victims of \ntorture.\n  My home State of Minnesota is fortunate to have the first and only \ncomprehensive treatment center in the United States for victims of \ntorture. The Center for Victims of Torture has treated over 500 \npatients since it was established in 1985, and has enabled them to \nbecome productive members of our communities by overcoming the \natrocities suffered in their countries of origin. I have learned a \ngreat deal from visiting the Center and meeting its clients and staff. \nIn addition to providing treatment to persons who have been tortured by \nforeign governments, the Center has been active in providing training \nand support for treatment centers abroad.\n  The United States should take a leading role in encouraging the \nestablishment of additional treatment programs both at home and abroad. \nWe are making progress in this direction. The United States is now the \nlargest contributor to the U.N. Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture. \nWe must continue to support treatment centers, like the one in \nMinnesota, which helps those who cannot help themselves--victims of \ntorture. Dedicating more of our U.N. voluntary funds for this purpose \nwill help provide this important service to more needy victims.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5925-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORTING OF S. 858, THE INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION BILL FOR FISCAL \n              YEAR 1998 FROM THE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, I rise to express my concern about the \npassage of S. 903, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of \n1997. Some of my distinguished colleagues have cited this legislation \nas historic in scope and worthy of support because of the consolidation \nof the U.S. Information Agency, the Arms Control and Disarmament \nAgency, and parts of the Agency for International Development into the \nDepartment of State. I do not object to this consolidation, but I am \nconcerned that the Senate is yet again infringing too much on the \nPresidential prerogative to be the primary architect of U.S. foreign \npolicy. This bill gives microlevel direction on how consolidation \nshould occur, and I feel that this is not appropriate for the Senate to \nbe trying to micromanage the performance of our State Department \nagencies, offices, and employees.\n  Mr. President, I have other concerns as well with S. 903. As Senators \nLugar and Sarbanes have articulated, I feel that we have established \ninappropriate benchmarks for the United Nations in this legislation so \nthat moneys obligated by the United States to the United Nations can be \nreleased. I feel that it is important for the United States to \ncommunicate its concerns to the United Nations about its management \nproblems. But I also feel it is important for the United States to \nhonor its already incurred obligations and pay our debts. Furthermore, \nsome of the tests that we impose on the United Nations are very \ninappropriate. For instance, during the first year, only $100 million \nof the $819 million in arrears payments after a sovereignty test, which \nstates that efforts must be taken to ensure that no U.S. law be over-\nridden or changed by any action of the United Nations. I don't believe \nthat there are many legislators in this Congress who believe for a \nmoment that any U.N. law would purport to have such authority, nor \nwould the United States allow such authority to be vested in the United \nNations. However, the inclusion of this in S. 903 sends a signal to our \nconstituents that this is a serious problem. I was sent to the Senate \nto try and address real problems, not to stir up fake ones.\n  On another front, it seems to me strange that we would be abolishing \ntwo agencies and preparing for the absorption of a third into the \nDepartment of State and at the same time creating a brand-new stand-\nalone agency to oversee the broadcasting functions that were \ntraditionally part of the U.S. Information Agency and under the \nauspices of the Board for International Broadcasting, which was \nabolished by the International Broadcasting Act of 1994. We should be \nbasing our current institutional consolidations on the basis that the \ncold war has ended and that we need to reorganize to meet the \nchallenges of a new and different international system. This \nlegislation however, which sets up a structure virtually identical to \nthe Board for International Broadcasting will cover, among other \nactivities, our broadcasting to Cuba activities. I think that it is not \nwise to build new institutions, which this bill does, which will keep \nour Nation mired in a cold war mode.\n  For these and other reasons, Mr. President, I am registering my \nobjection to this State Department authorization bill, S. 903. I \nrealize that this bill will pass with overwhelming support from this \nChamber, but I believe that sometimes we can give away too much on the \ncommonsense front to strike a deal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5925-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages, from the President of the United States were communicated \nto the Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5925-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5925-S5926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:42 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 985.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to promote the \npartnership of small businesses and federally sponsored research \nentities to develop commercial applications for research projects, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business.\n\n\n           THE SMALL BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing along with Senators \nCleland, Wellstone, Robb, Landrieu, and Harkin, the Small Business \nTechnology Transfer Act of 1997. I ask unanimous consent that those \nsenators listed in my statement be named original co-sponsors. This \nlegislation would reauthorize the Small Business Administration's Small \nBusiness Technology Transfer Pilot Program through fiscal year 2003. \nThe STTR program was originally authorized five years ago to combine \nthe technological innovation of America's universities and research \ninstitutions with the business know-how and entrepreneurial spirit of \nour country's small businesses.\n  The fact is that other countries are significantly more aggressive in \nmany ways about their joint ventures or partnerships between government \nand business in order to try to steal market share or create market \nwhere there may not even be one. Recently we learned that even as the \nUnited States was cutting back on basic research in our budget, Japan \nhad committed a 50-percent increase to its budget because they \nunderstand that basic research is the foundation for the future \nproducts of the world, and those countries that are able to capitalize \non this research are in a much better position to expand their job \nbase.\n  Millions of dollars each year go to federally sponsored research \nprojects at America's universities, non-profit research centers and \nfederal research laboratories. The innovations that are developed are \namazing but the people who conduct the research are not always the best \nones to market the product and develop it for commercial use.\n  We have seen case after case where somebody at a university or at a \nfederally sponsored research facility is sitting on top of a gold mine \nof information and technology, or even a specific product, but they do \nnot know how to identify the proper target market, gain access to \ncapital, or do the other things necessary to move that product from the \nlaboratory to the marketplace. The STTR program was developed by those \nof us who feel very strongly that we need to help bridge that gap; that \nit is an important function in this modern marketplace for us to \nleverage the ability of those small entrepreneurs by partnering them \nwith the researchers to take the technology out into the marketplace. \nBecause the core competency of research institutions lies in research \nand not business, fewer practical applications for federally sponsored \nresearch were developed than was originally desired. It was Congress' \nintention to reconcile this problem by coupling non-profit research \ninstitutions with small businesses in order to promote the transfer of \nvaluable technology into the commercial sector. This not only benefits \nthe economy, but it ensures that the sponsoring Federal agencies get \nfar more results for the dollars that we invest in research. I know \ntaxpayers are much happier when we do that.\n  Small business is a more effective mechanism for transferring \ntechnology from research institutions to industry where the technology \ncan be used to improve the economy. This is important because even \nthough our research institutions lead the world in science and \nengineering research, we have had difficulty successfully developing \nthem into commercial applications. Transferring technology from \nresearch forums to the commercial marketplace not only benefits the \nAmerican economy, but also further serves the needs of the sponsoring \nfederal agency by providing better products as a result of the \ncollaboration between the non-profit and for-profit sectors.\n  Research for federal agencies is conducted in very diverse areas. \nBecause the STTR program is limited to federal agencies with at least \none billion dollars designated for outside research, currently five \nfederal agencies participate in the STTR program. Through a series of \nthree phases, research in areas of defense, health and transportation \nis transformed by small businesses into products and innovations that \ncan be applied in the commercial marketplace. In the first three years \nof the STTR program, over $115 million have been awarded by the five \nparticipating federal agencies. In fiscal year 1996 alone, over $60 \nmillion in awards were made to over 320 projects. My home state of \nMassachusetts had 50 projects receive awards in fiscal year 1996 for a \ntotal of over $8.7 million. Among the recipients of these awards were \nHarvard Medical School, Worcester Polytech and Boston University.\n  The STTR program helps American businesses compete in the highly \ncompetitive marketplace of science and technology. Most of the small \nbusinesses participating in this program do not have their own research \ndepartments and could not afford to conduct the research needed to \nproduce these products. But by collaborating with the various research \ninstitutions, these small businesses gain the access to\n\n[[Page S5928]]\n\ntechnology and advanced research they need to bring quality products to \nthe private sector.\n  I want to tell you about one company whose experience with the STTR \nprogram exemplifies how the small business/research institution \npartnership has succeeded in bringing ideas to market. Metal Matrix \nCast Composites is a small business located in Waltham, Massachusetts. \nMMCC is working with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to \ndevelop and test aluminum alloys reinforced with ceramic particulates. \nBesides having potential military applications, these new materials \nhave many commercial applications including brake systems for cars and \nlanding gears for airplanes. Under a previous STTR contract, MMCC \ndeveloped a product along with Northeastern University in Boston, that \nallowed them to provide advanced composite parts to its customers. \nUnder that contract, MMCC has already sold these parts to aerospace, \nelectrical, computer and medical instrument suppliers.\n  The lesson of Metal Matrix Cast Composites is clear. When given the \nopportunity to collaborate with each other, small businesses and \nresearch institutions can produce quality products with real commercial \napplications that otherwise may not have reached the marketplace.\n  We are not talking about substituting for what the sector does \nalready. We are not talking about taking the place of something that \nthe private sector figured out it could do better by itself or wanted \nto do. We are talking about providing something where it did not exist, \nwhere it will not exist, where in most instances it cannot without the \nproper kind of leverage and the proper kind of coordination. As much as \nall of us would like to feel that Adam Smith's rules are the ones that \nought to prevail in the marketplace, the fact is that every other one \nof our industrial competitors is playing today by a different set of \nrules, by a set of, in many cases, unfair trade practices where they \nare willing to dump, willing to joint venture, willing to subsidize, \nwilling to engage in a host of practices that undermine our capacity to \nmove to those markets.\n  By reauthorizing the STTR program, we will be giving more small \nbusinesses the opportunity to gain access to technology and then to \nsucceed in the marketplace. I urge my colleagues to support this worthy \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record, and I also ask unanimous consent that the \nbill be available for other sponsors who wish to cosponsor it through \nthe course of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 929\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Technology \n     Transfer Act of 1977''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) federally sponsored research at nonprofit institutions \n     has not been adequately applied to commercial purposes in the \n     past;\n       (2) small businesses have the entrepreneurial spirit and \n     business experience to apply research for commercial uses;\n       (3) the partnership between small businesses and research \n     institutions will create more commercial uses for innovative \n     ideas that will spur the economy; and\n       (4) although to date the Small Business Technology Transfer \n     program has produced quality research proposals, an \n     additional evaluation period is warranted before the program \n     is expanded or made permanent.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purpose of this act is to reauthorize the Small \n     Business Technology Transfer program for fiscal years 1998 \n     through 2003 to allow for a more complete assessment of the \n     impact and effectiveness of the program.\n\n     SEC. 4. SMALL BUSINESS TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 9(n) of the Small Business Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 638(n) is amended by striking paragraph (1) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(1) Required expenditure amounts.--With respect to fiscal \n     years 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, or 2003, each Federal \n     agency that has an extramural budget for research, or \n     research and development, in excess of $1,000,000,000 for \n     that fiscal year, may expend with small business concerns not \n     less than 0.15 percent of that extramural budget specifically \n     in connection with STTR programs that meet the requirements \n     of this section and any policy directives and regulations \n     issued under this section.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect on October 1, 1997.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Mack):\n  S. 931. A bill to designate the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness \nand the Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center, to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n marjory stoneman douglas wilderness and ernest f. coe visitor center \n                            designation act\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I'm happy to have this opportunity today \nto introduce legislation to amend the National Parks and Recreation Act \nof 1978 to designate the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness and to \namend the Everglades National Park Protection and Expansion Act of 1989 \nto designate the Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center.\n  Ms. Douglas and Mr. Coe led the charge to establish Everglades \nNational Park and raise public awareness to restore its vitality.\n  I think most Americans know that Everglades National Park preserves \nthe subtropical region at the southern tip of Florida. But what most \npeople don't realize is that the park has been nominated by the United \nStates and accepted by the world community as a world heritage site, a \nwetland of international significance, and a biosphere reserve in \nrecognition of its international significance. It is the only site in \nthe Nation that has received all three designations, which serves to \nunderscore the superlative qualities of the park on a global scale.\n  Everglades National Park is well known for its diverse and unique \nwildlife, including alligators and crocodiles, eagles, manatees, and \nvarious fish species. The park has 13 species of endangered birds. It \nhas open prairies and extensive saltwater areas with sawgrass marshes, \nmangroves, and shallow bays. Its 1.3 million acres of wilderness make \nit the largest subtropical wilderness in the continental United States.\n  In 1926 and again in 1928, Senator Park Trammel of Florida introduced \nlegislation calling for an examination of the Everglades to determine \nif a portion could qualify as a national park. The National Park \nService had made some preliminary inquiries into the matter when Ernest \nFrancis Coe came forward to champion the idea of creating a national \npark in southern Florida. Coe came to Coconut Grove from New England in \n1925 and was overwhelmed with the natural beauty and wildlife of the \nCape Sable and Ten Thousand Islands area. He wanted to find some way to \nprotect the bird rookeries and hammocks, and the establishment of a \nnational park seemed like an ideal solution.\n  Mr. Coe became the central leader in the campaign to create \nEverglades National Park. In 1928, he organized the Tropic Everglades \nNational Park Association and is widely regarded as the Father of \nEverglades National Park. As a landscape architect, Mr. Coe's vision \nfor the park recognized the need to protect south Florida's diverse \nwildlife and their habitats for future generations. His leadership, \nselfless devotion, and commitment to achieving this vision culminated \nin the authorization of the park by Congress in 1934 and its subsequent \ndedication by President Truman in 1947.\n  While it is not required by law that Congress name park visitor \ncenters, this legislation will demonstrate Congress' support for \nhonoring Mr. Coe's legacy. Because of his central role in the \nestablishment of Everglades National Park, it is also a fitting tribute \nthat park visitors be greeted by the congressionally designated Coe \nCenter.\n  In 1947, Marjory Stoneman Douglas published her landmark book, ``The \nEverglades: River of Grass,'' which greatly increased interest in and \nconcern for the Everglades. Ms. Douglas, who celebrated her 107th \nbirthday on April 6, symbolizes the struggle to save the Everglades. \nHer pioneering work was the first to highlight the plight of the \nEverglades and ultimately served to awaken public interest in restoring \nits health. Ms. Douglas has dedicated her life to the defense of the \nEverglades through her extraordinary personal effort and by inspiring \ncountless others\n\n[[Page S5929]]\n\nto take action. Recognizing these accomplishments, in 1992 President \nClinton awarded her to the Medal of Freedom, the Nation's highest \ncivilian award.\n  Ms. Douglas has consistently stated her wish to have Ernest Coe's \nefforts suitably commemorated at the park. She has expressed through \nher associates Dr. Sharon T. Richardson her delight with the idea of \ndesignating the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness area. Dr. \nRichardson has added her opinion that, ``Nothing could mark her life \nmore suitably than to give her name to this resplendent wilderness.''\n\n  I can only echo that sentiment and add that nothing could be more \nappropriate during this 50th anniversary year of Everglades National \nPark, than the commemoration of these two legends as proposed in this \nbill.\n  To quote from Marjory Stoneman Douglas' book ``River of Grass:''\n\n       There are no other Everglades in the World.\n       They are, they have always been, one of the unique regions \n     of the earth, remote, never wholly known. Nothing anywhere \n     else is like them: their vast glittering openness, wider than \n     the enormous visible round of the horizon, the racing free \n     saltness and sweetness of their massive winds, under the \n     dazzling blue heights of space. They are unique also in the \n     simplicity, the diversity, the related harmony of the forms \n     of life they enclose. The miracle of the light pours over the \n     green and brown expanse of saw grass and of water, shining \n     and slow-moving below, the grass and water that is the \n     meaning and the central fact of the Everglades of Florida. It \n     is a river of grass.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 931\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Marjory Stoneman Douglas \n     Wilderness and Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center Designation \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) Marjory Stoneman Douglas, through her book, ``The \n     Everglades: River of Grass'' (published in 1947), defined the \n     Everglades for the people of the United States and the \n     world;\n       (B) Mrs. Douglas' book was the first to stimulate \n     widespread understanding of the Everglades ecosystem and \n     ultimately served to awaken the desire of the people of the \n     United States to restore the ecosystem's health;\n       (C) in her 107th year, Mrs. Douglas is the sole surviving \n     member of the original group of people who devoted decades of \n     selfless effort to establish the Everglades National Park;\n       (D) when the water supply and ecology of the Everglades, \n     both within and outside the park, became threatened by \n     drainage and development, Mrs. Douglas dedicated the balance \n     of her life to the defense of the Everglades through \n     extraordinary personal effort and by inspiring countless \n     other people to take action;\n       (E) for these and many other accomplishments, the President \n     awarded Mrs. Douglas the Medal of Freedom on Earth Day, 1994; \n     and\n       (2)(A) Ernest F. Coe (1886-1951) was a leader in the \n     creation of Everglades National Park;\n       (B) Mr. Coe organized the Tropic Everglades National Park \n     Association in 1928 and was widely regarded as the father of \n     Everglades National Park;\n       (C) as a landscape architect, Mr. Coe's vision for the park \n     recognized the need to protect south Florida's diverse \n     wildlife and habitats for future generations;\n       (D) Mr. Coe's original park proposal included lands and \n     waters subsequently protected within the Everglades National \n     Park, the Big Cypress National Preserve, and the Florida Keys \n     National Marine Sanctuary; and\n       (E)(i) Mr. Coe's leadership, selfless devotion, and \n     commitment to achieving his vision culminated in the \n     authorization of the Everglades National Park by Congress in \n     1934;\n       (ii) after authorization of the park, Mr. Coe fought \n     tirelessly and lobbied strenuously for establishment of the \n     park, finally realizing his dream in 1947; and\n       (iii) Mr. Coe accomplished much of the work described in \n     this paragraph at his own expense, which dramatically \n     demonstrated his commitment to establishment of Everglades \n     National Park.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to commemorate \n     the vision, leadership, and enduring contributions of Marjory \n     Stoneman Douglas and Ernest F. Coe to the protection of the \n     Everglades and the establishment of Everglades National Park.\n\n     SEC. 3. MARJORY STONEMAN DOUGLAS WILDERNESS.\n\n       (a) Redesignation.--Section 401(3) of the National Parks \n     and Recreation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-625; 92 Stat. 3490; \n     16 U.S.C. 1132 note) is amended by striking ``to be known as \n     the Everglades Wilderness'' and inserting ``to be known as \n     the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness to commemorate the \n     vision and leadership shown by Mrs. Douglas in the protection \n     of the Everglades and the establishment of the Everglades \n     National Park''.\n       (b) Notice of Redesignation.--The Secretary of the Interior \n     shall provide such notification of the redesignation made by \n     the amendment made by subsection (a) by signs, materials, \n     maps, markers, interpretive programs, and other means \n     (including changes in signs, materials, maps, and markers in \n     existence before the date of enactment of this Act) as will \n     adequately inform the public of the redesignation of the \n     wilderness area and the reasons for the redesignation.\n       (c) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation, \n     document, record, map, or other paper of the United States to \n     the ``Everglades Wilderness'' shall be deemed to be a \n     reference to the ``Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness''.\n\n     SEC. 4. ERNEST F. COE VISITOR CENTER.\n\n       (a) Designation.--Section 103 of the Everglades National \n     Park Protection and Expansion Act of 1989 (16 U.S.C. 410r-7) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(f) Ernest F. Coe Visitor Center.--On completion of \n     construction of the main visitor center facility at the \n     headquarters of Everglades National Park, the Secretary shall \n     designate the visitor center facility as the `Ernest F. Coe \n     Visitor Center', to commemorate the vision and leadership \n     shown by Mr. Coe in the establishment and protection of \n     Everglades National Park.''.\n\n     SEC. 5. CONFORMING AND TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS.\n\n       Section 103 of the Everglades National Park Protection and \n     Expansion Act of 1989 (16 U.S.C. 410r-7) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (c)(2), by striking ``personally-owned'' \n     and inserting ``personally-owned''; and\n       (2) in subsection (e), by striking ``Visitor Center'' and \n     inserting ``Marjory Stoneman Douglas Visitor Center''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMM (for himself, Mr. Bumpers, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Shelby, and Mr. \n        Cleland):\n  S. 932. A bill to amend the National Agricultural Research, \nExtension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 to require the Secretary of \nAgriculture to establish a national advisory and implementation board \non imported fire ant control, management, and eradication and, in \nconjunction with the board, to provide grants for research or \ndemonstration projects related to the control, management, and possible \neradication of imported fire ants, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n     the fire ant control, management, and eradication act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRAMM, Mr. President, today, I am joined by Senators Bumpers, \nHutchison, Hutchinson, Thurmond, Shelby, Sessions, and Cleland in \nintroducing the Fire Ant Control, Management, and Eradication Act of \n1997. Over the last 76 years, imported fire ants have infested over 275 \nmillion acres in 13 Southern States. The fire ant affects both urban \nand rural areas with damage estimates in the billions of dollars \nannually. In Texas, fire ant damage is estimated at $300 million \nannually, and the cattle industry alone suffers annual losses of $67 \nmillion. Further, it is estimated that the State of Georgia loses $46 \nmillion annually, with Louisiana and Alabama incurring annual damages \nof $23.8 and $16 million respectively. Mississippi has estimated losses \nof $12.3 million. Homeowners in the State of Arkansas spend \napproximately $106 million each year to combat fire ant infestation.\n  Research on the fire ants began in 1950 when they were first \nrecognized as pests. However, from 1950 to mid-1980, most of the \nresearch was directed toward short-term solutions.\n  Researchers generally concede that acceptable approaches to managing \nfire ants will include pesticide use coupled with biological control \nagents. Since the late 1970's more data on the general biology of fire \nants have been established, but vast information gaps still remain.\n  The legislation that I am introducing along with my colleagues will \nprovide a scientific guide to controlling, managing, and possibly \neradicating fire ants.\n  The legislation is modeled after the successful screwworm and boll \nweevil eradication programs, and is supported by the American Farm \nBureau, National Cattlemen's Association, and the National Association \nof State Departments of Agriculture.\n  The bill establishes a national advisory and implementation board on \nfire\n\n[[Page S5930]]\n\nant control, management, and eradication. The board will consist of 12 \nmembers who are appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture and who are \nexperts in entomology and ant ecology, wildlife biology, electrical \nengineering, economics, and agribusiness. An annual total of $6 million \nwill be awarded to at least 4 but not more than 13 research projects \nper year for up to 5 years. After this period, the board will select \ntwo of the previously funded projects to receive an additional 2-year \ngrant not to exceed $4 million each. In preparation for the final plan \nto control, manage, and if possible eradicate fire ants, the board \nshall select one of the two previously funded projects or a combination \nof both as the basis for the national plan. A final 1-year grant of not \nmore than $5 million will be used to develop a national plan to control \nthe imported fire ant.\n  Mr. President, fire ants inflict hundreds of millions of dollars in \ndamage each year to homeowners, small businesses, and farmers, with no \nend in sight. Now is the time to begin using our resources to offer \nsome relief.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kennedy and Ms. \n        Mikulski):\n  S. 933. A bill to amend section 485(g) of the Higher Education Act of \n1965 to make information regarding men's and women's athletic programs \nat institutions of higher education easily available to prospective \nstudents and prospective student athletes; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n                           The Fair Play Act\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fair \nPlay Act, legislation that builds upon the extraordinary success of \ntitle IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 and promotes the continued \nexpansion of athletic opportunities available to women at institutions \nof higher education. I want to thank my colleague from Maine, Senator \nSnowe, my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and my \ncolleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, for their help in writing \nthis bill.\n  Twenty-five years ago, President Nixon signed title IX into law and \nushered in a new era of opportunity for American women and girls. Prior \nto the enactment of title IX, fewer than 32,000 women competed in \nintercollegiate athletics, women received only 2 percent of schools' \nathletic budgets, and athletic scholarships for women were practically \nnonexistent.\n  Today, because of title IX, more than 110,000 women compete in \nintercollegiate athletics and women account for 37 percent of college \nvarsity athletes. Last year at the 1996 Olympic games, American women \nwon gold medals in basketball, soccer, softball, swimming, track and \nfield, gymnastics, and other sports. This Saturday, the first season of \nthe WNBA will debut on network television, and it is my understanding \nthat advertisers have already filled every minute of commercial time \nfor the entire WNBA season. Without title IX, none of this would have \nbeen possible. From the professional level to intercollegiate \ncompetition to local high school soccer fields, women's athletics have \ncaptured the hearts and attention of millions of Americans.\n  But the athletic opportunities created by title IX have contributed \nmore than just winning teams and great female athletes. We all know \nthat sports promotes better physical health. Science has shown us, \nhowever, that female athletes also have better mental health, emotional \nhealth, self-confidence, discipline, and higher academic achievement. \nFemale athletes are more likely to go to and stay in college than their \nnonathletic peers. Female athletes are less likely to drop out of \nschool, and are more likely to achieve higher marks in their academic \nclasses. Athletics are an integral part of education and health, for \nmen as well as for women.\n  In addition, the addition of women's varsity sports at colleges and \nuniversities has led to the creation of women's athletic scholarships. \nThese scholarships translate directly into opportunities to go to \ncollege. Indeed, in this era when the cost of college is rising three \ntimes as fast as household income, athletic scholarships can literally \nmean the difference between going to college and not going to college. \nTitle IX has brought these opportunities within reach of millions of \nAmerican girls and women.\n  Despite the extraordinary success of title IX, however, there remains \na significant gap between the athletic opportunities available to \ncollege-age women and men. While women represent 53 percent of \nstudents, they make up only 37 percent of student athletes. According \nto a recent NCAA study, female college athletes receive only 23 percent \nof athletic operating budgets, 38 percent of athletic scholarship \ndollars, and 27 percent of the money spent to recruit new athletes. The \nPresident's Council on Physical Fitness recently noted, ``The face of \nsex discrimination in athletics has changed. It [is] often no longer \nthe purposeful exclusion of the past, but a collection of more subtle \ninequities that could be explained away by a lack of resources.''\n\n  The fact is, most colleges and universities do not provide their \nfemale students with athletic opportunities comparable to those they \noffer to their male students. According to a recent USA Today survey of \nNCAA division I-A schools, only 9 percent of the 303 schools surveyed \nhave roughly proportionate numbers of female and male athletes.\n  Title IX does not, in fact, as some people believe, require schools \nto devote half their athletic resources to women, or equalize the \nnumber of male and female athletes. Title IX does require, however, \nthat colleges at least make a continued effort to expand their \nathletics programs to fully accommodate the interests of both sexes. In \norder to monitor this progress and title IX compliance, colleges and \nuniversities are required to collect information about their men's and \nwomen's athletic programs, including participation rates, operating and \nrecruitment budgets, the availability of scholarships, revenues \ngenerated from athletic programs, and coaches' salaries, and are \nrequired to make this information available upon request. There is not, \nhowever, any mechanism for the collection and distribution of this \nimportant information, and the Department of Education does not have \nready access to all of this information to assist in its enforcement of \ntitle IX.\n  The Fair Play Act directs colleges and universities to send this \ninformation, which they already compile annually, to the Department of \nEducation. The bill therefore imposes no additional burden on colleges \nand universities. The bill directs the Department to issue an annual \nreport and make the information available through a variety of \nmechanisms, including the Department's World Wide Web site and a toll-\nfree number people to provide easy access to the information reported \nby schools, as well as information about title IX.\n  The Fair Play Act will provide prospective students and prospective \nstudent athletes with the kind of information they need to make \ninformed decisions about where to go to school. It will give the \nDepartment of Education valuable information it needs to aid its \nenforcement of title IX in the area of athletics, and it will encourage \nschools to continue to expand the athletic programs to meet the \ninterests of women nationwide. This legislation is the logical next \nstep in the continuing effort to expand athletic opportunities \navailable to women.\n  Over its 25 year history, title IX has been directly responsible for \nexpanding the athletic opportunities available to millions of women and \ngirls. The Fair Play Act will build on this legacy of success, and \nprovide the information needed to ensure that the expansion of athletic \nopportunities available to women continues into the 21st century.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join us today sponsoring this \nlegislation and ask unanimous consent that a summary and the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 933\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Play Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) June 23, 1997, marks the 25th anniversary of the \n     signing of title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 \n     U.S.C. 1681 et\n\n[[Page S5931]]\n\n     seq.) into law, and on that day communities across the United \n     States will honor the tremendous difference such title IX has \n     made to women and girls in our Nation.\n       (2) Since enactment in 1972, such title IX has played a \n     vital role in expanding the athletic opportunities available \n     to American girls and women.\n       (3) Prior to the enactment of such title IX, fewer than \n     32,000 women competed in intercollegiate athletics, women \n     received only 2 percent of schools' athletic budgets, and \n     athletic scholarships for women were practically nonexistent.\n       (4) In 1997, more than 110,000 women competed in \n     intercollegiate sports, and women account for 37 percent of \n     college varsity athletes.\n       (5) While such title IX has been very successful, a \n     significant gap remains between the athletic opportunities \n     available to men and the athletic opportunities available to \n     women.\n       (6) According to a 1997 study by the National Collegiate \n     Athletic Association, female college athletes receive only 23 \n     percent of athletic operating budgets, 38 percent of athletic \n     scholarship dollars, and 27 percent of the money spent to \n     recruit new athletes.\n       (7) While women represent 53 percent of the students \n     attending institutions of higher education, women comprise \n     only 37 percent of the athletes attending institutions of \n     higher education.\n       (8) There is substantial evidence that women and girls who \n     participate in athletics have better physical and emotional \n     health than women and girls who do not participate, and that \n     participation in athletics can improve academic achievement.\n       (9) Easily accessible information regarding the \n     expenditures of institutions of higher education for women's \n     and men's athletic programs will help prospective students \n     and prospective student athletes make informed judgments \n     about the commitment of a given institution of higher \n     education to providing athletic opportunities to male and \n     female students attending the institution.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to make information regarding men's and women's \n     athletic programs at institutions of higher education easily \n     available to prospective students and prospective student \n     athletes; and\n       (2) to increase the athletic opportunities available to \n     women at institutions of higher education.\n\n     SEC. 4. INFORMATION AVAILABILITY.\n\n       Section 485(g) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 1092(g)) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (4) and (5) as paragraphs \n     (5) and (6), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following:\n       ``(4) Submission; report; information availability.--(A) \n     Each institution of higher education described in paragraph \n     (1) shall provide to the Secretary, within 15 days of the \n     date that the institution makes available the report under \n     paragraph (1), the information contained in the report.\n       ``(B) The Secretary shall prepare a report regarding the \n     information received under subparagraph (A) for each year by \n     April 1 of the year.

Women \n     represent 53 percent of students, yet they make up only 37 \n     percent of college varsity athletes and receive only 23 \n     percent of athletic operating budgets.\n       Under section 485(g) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, \n     colleges and universities are required to compile information \n     about their men's and women's athletic programs, including \n     participation rates, operating and recruitment budgets, the \n     availability of scholarships, revenues generated from \n     athletic programs, and coaches' salaries. They are required \n     to update this information annually and make it available \n     upon request. Because there is no repository for this \n     information, however, it is difficult to obtain and evaluate \n     or put into context.\n\n\n                             Fair Play Act\n\n       The Fair Play Act directs colleges and universities to send \n     this information to the Department of Education, and directs \n     the Department to disseminate the information through a \n     variety of mechanisms.\n       (1) Annual Report--The bill directs the Department to issue \n     an annual report containing the information reported by \n     colleges and universities, including aggregate data, trends, \n     information arranged by athletic conference, and information \n     on individual schools.\n       (2) World Wide Web--The bill directs the Department to make \n     this report available on its World Wide Web site, increasing \n     its accessibility and saving publication costs.\n       (3) Toll-Free Number--The bill directs the Department to \n     establish a toll-free number through which people could \n     request the information reported by schools, the annual \n     report, or other information about title IX of the Education \n     Amendments of 1972.\n       (4) Notification of High Schools--The bill directs the \n     Department to notify high schools of the availability of this \n     information.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join Senator Moseley-\nBraun and Senator Snowe as an original cosponsor of the Fair Play Act \nof 1997. Our goal is to ensure that women applying to college have the \ninformation they need to make decisions about sports opportunities at \ntheir colleges. This information will also enable the Department of \nEducation to do a better job of enforcing title IX of the Education \nAmendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination in college sports \nprograms.\n  We've made progress in the quarter century since title IX became law. \nBut we can do better.\n  Nancy Hogshead is an outstanding example of what we can accomplish. \nAfter suffering a great tragedy, she used sports to heal her body and \nspirit. That determination led to several Olympic medals, and Nancy \ngives title IX the credit for her success.\n  Many other women have excelled because title IX opened the door to \nopportunity. Who can forget the final home run that clinched the gold \nmedal for the women's softball team? Or the medal-winning efforts of \nthe women's soccer team--so many stars of that team were college \nathletes. And, each of us watched in awe as Kerry Strug landed her \nvault on one foot to secure a gold medal for the women's gymnastics \nteam.\n  And we will do even better in the years ahead by ensuring that more \nyoung women in colleges in communities through across the country will \nhave the opportunity they deserve to participate in sports.\n  Title IX is an essential part of our civil rights laws. But, it is \noften undermined by those who still believe that women and girls should \nbe spectators in the grandstand, not participants on the playing field. \nFrom the school gym to the Olympic stadium, if genuinely equal \nopportunities are available, women will take advantage of them and \nexcel. And wherever they go from college, whatever their career, the \nlessons they learn in sports will serve them all their lives.\n  That is why this legislation is so important. The Fair Play Act of \n1997 provides students interested in sports with the information they \nneed about the colleges and universities they will attend. As a result, \nmore and more schools will take greater steps more rapidly to provide \nequal opportunities. And the Department of Education will have greater \nability to assure full compliance with the law.\n  The Department of Education relies on many factors to determine \nwhether colleges and universities are meeting the standards. But \nadditional information will help to identify problems sooner and lead \nto their earlier resolution.\n  I look forward to working closely my colleagues in the Senate and the \nHouse to see that this legislation becomes law. Equal opportunity women \nin sports is an achievable goal. We know\n\n[[Page S5932]]\n\nwe can do a better job on this important issue, and now is the time to \nstart doing it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Bond, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Lugar, Mr. Warner, Mr. Biden, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 934.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nthe Adolescent Family Life and Abstinence Education Act of 1997, and \nthe Adoption Promotion Act of 1997. This legislation updates similar \nlegislation which I introduced in the 104th Congress. The abstinence \nlegislation is cosponsored by Senators Santorum, Bond, Inouye, Lugar, \nWarner, Biden, and DeWine, and the adoption legislation is cosponsored \nby Senators Santorum, Bond, Inouye, Cochran, and Harkin.\n  This legislation, Mr. President, is directed at one of the most \ncontroversial and divisive issues confronting America today, and that \nis the issue of abortion. In my judgment, this is the most divisive \nissue confronting the United States since slavery. While I am \npersonally very much opposed to abortion, I do not believe that it can \nbe controlled by the Government. I think it is a matter for families, \nfor women, for rabbis, ministers and priests, and it is essentially a \nmoral issue.\n  But I believe there is a consensus and general agreement on working \ntoward the elimination of abortion which most Americans would find \nagreeable from all perspectives. I think that America is not pro-\nabortion, but there is a disagreement as to whether the choice of women \ncan be controlled by the Federal Government. One area of agreement is \nthat we ought to do everything we can to discourage premarital sex \namong teenagers, unintended pregnancies, and the abortions which \nfollow.\n  Senator Jeremiah Denton was a leading sponsor of abstinence education \nwhen he served in the Senate, and in 1987, more than a decade ago, I \ntook up Senator Denton's cause in maintaining funding for abstinence \neducation in the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education. Last year, as chairman of that subcommittee, \nwe increased the funding for abstinence education very substantially, \nbut there has not been an authorization bill for some time. This \nlegislation would call for an authorization up to some $75 million a \nyear. I think we are not going to be able to get there in the immediate \nfuture, but I think that is a target where we ought to have \nauthorization to give the Appropriations Committee ample room to work.\n  I have visited schools around the country. I have found it very much \nto the point to talk in very direct and candid terms to teenagers in \nschools about the problems of drugs and about the importance of \nabstinence, and there is an interest I think among teenagers in wishing \nto discuss it in an open and frank way. What young women need is to \nhave counter peer pressure which would move toward abstinence. On \nFriday, March 15, 1996, I had the opportunity to kick off the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania's Teen Pregnancy Prevention Week at \nCentral High School in Philadelphia. During that week, communities \nthroughout Pennsylvania conducted special activities to promote pre-\nmarital abstinence as the healthiest way to prevent teen pregnancy and \nthe many other physical and emotional consequences of early sexual \nactivity.\n\n  Last April, I visited Carrick High School in Pittsburgh, where I met \nwith students who are involved in an abstinence program. I also visited \nthe Susquehanna Valley Pregnancy Service in Lancaster, which works with \nyoung people who have taken pledges of abstinence and counsels them on \novercoming peer pressure with counter peer pressure. I met and \ndiscussed abstinence and other issues with students at Susquehanna \nTownship High School in Harrisburg, Manheim Township High School in \nLancaster, Cedar Cliff High School in New Cumberland, Central York High \nSchool in York, and Liberty High School in Bethlehem.\n  Throughout the 104th Congress, I conducted hearings on the issues of \nteen pregnancy, abstinence education, and adoption in my capacity as \nchairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education. Numerous witnesses shared their expertise and \nexperiences. I ask unanimous consent a complete list of these witnesses \nbe printed in the Record as exhibit 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. The legislation I am introducing today builds on the \nsignificant progress made in the 104th Congress, where we enacted tax \ncredits for adoption and authorized, through the welfare bill, an \nadditional $50 million for fiscal years 1998 to 2002 to provide \nabstinence education. As my colleagues may recall, I introduced similar \nlegislation in the 104th Congress on April 29, 1996.\n  At the outset, let me provide my colleagues with a brief summary of \nthe legislation. My first proposal would reauthorize and expand the \nAdolescent Family Life Program, providing $75 million annually to \npromote abstinence education for teens. My second proposal would \nincrease the tax credit for adopting special-needs children to $7,500 \nand would permit penalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement \naccounts for adoption expenses. These two bills complement my efforts \nto advocate adequate prenatal care, especially for teens, through the \nHealthy Start Program. We know that in most instances, prenatal care is \neffective in preventing premature births. I saw my first 1-pound baby \nmore than a decade ago. It is really a startling sight, a child no \nbigger than my hand, carrying scars for a lifetime and costing as much \nas $400,000 in medical care per child over a lifetime, according to the \nmost recent data from the National Commission to Prevent Infant \nMortality.\n\n  Mr. President, nearly 200 years ago, the French writer Alexis de \nTocqueville is said to have observed that ``America is great because \nshe is good, and if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease \nto be great.'' His analysis is timeless.\n  It is impossible to be a public official today, to travel throughout \nStates such as Pennsylvania and elsewhere in the United States, without \nrecognizing that America's problems are more moral than material. As we \nhave tried to steer toward a growing economy and a balanced budget, we \nhave seen a growing consensus that all our goals must rest on a \nrestored ethic of personal responsibility. A crisis of values, in fact, \nunderlies many of the public policy problems the Senate addresses on a \ndaily basis. This has impressed upon me the need for people of strong \nmoral commitments to enter public service and public debate, so that we \nmay confront the underlying problems together and move our Nation \nforward.\n  While the news media offer us a monthly snapshot of leading economic \nindicators, it may be that our leading moral indicators are more \ntelling, such as the staggering number of teenage pregnancies and the \nrapid rise in juvenile crime, which suggest that the erosion of the \nAmerican family continues unabated. Further, today more than 50 percent \nof American marriages end in divorce, meaning that millions of children \nface at least some instability in their home environment. Marriage is \nobviously important in that a strong family structure, based on a \ncommitment of mutual support and respect, is vital for children. On the \nsubject of family values, I speak with considerable pride about the \nmanner in which my parents and my siblings have respected the \ninstitution of marriage. In addition to my own marriage of 44\n\n[[Page S5933]]\n\nyears and my parents' marriage of 45 years, my brother, Morton, and his \nwife, Joyce, were married for 51 years until his death in 1993. My \nsister, Hilda, and her husband, Arthur Morgenstern, celebrated their \n54th wedding anniversary in April 1997. My sister, Shirley, was married \nto Edward Kety for 46 years until his death in 1995. My son, Shanin, \nand his wife, Tracey, celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary on June \n29, 1996. So our family totals 250 years of marriage, and counting.\n  On this critical question of the health of America's families, the \ngrim statistics are worth airing. The number of teenage pregnancies in \nthe United States continues to reach alarming levels. According to data \ncompiled by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, in 1992, the most recent \nyear for which statistics are available, approximately 931,000 women \naged 15 to 19 became pregnant. Further, the National Center for Health \nStatistics reports that there were 500,744 births to women aged 15 to \n19 in 1995, and an additional 12,318 births to women under 15 years of \nage. By comparison, the United Nations Population Division reports that \nthe United States teenage birth rate, 64 births per 1,000 females aged \n15 to 19 for the period 1990-95, is the highest in the industrialized \nworld. France and Japan report some of the lowest teenage birth rates, \nat 9 and 4 births per 1,000 females, respectively. Another leading \nmoral indicator is the rapid increase in the number of unwed teenage \nmothers. According to Child Trends, Inc., the percentage of births to \nmothers under age 20 that occurred outside of marriage rose from \n48 percent in 1980 to 76 percent in 1994.\n\n  Teenage mothers face more complications in childbirth, and their \nchildren are 50 percent more likely to be born premature. These \nchildren also have a greater risk of dying in the first year of life, \nsuffering developmental problems, and becoming teen parents themselves. \nFurther, the Office of Population Affairs of the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services reports that 80 percent of children born to \nunwed teenage mothers who have not completed high school live in \npoverty. By contrast, of those children born to 20-year-old married \nparents who are high school graduates, only 8 percent live in poverty. \nIn addition, more than three-fourths of unmarried teen mothers began \nreceiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children [AFDC] within 5 years \nafter the birth of their first child. A report released in 1996 by the \nRobin Hood Foundation estimated that adolescent childbearing costs the \ntaxpayers $6.9 billion each year in welfare and food stamp benefits, \nmedical care expenses, lost tax revenue, incarceration expenses, and \nfoster care. To me, this necessitates a strong response from concerned \ncitizens, the clergy, and public officials.\n  We can, and we must, confront our leading moral indicators head-on. \nWe must press harder in the fight to reduce the alarming number of \nteenage pregnancies in the United States. And, when a child comes into \nthe world as the result of an unintended pregnancy, we must do all that \nwe can to ensure that it is raised in a loving, stable family \nenvironment. It is the American family, of course, that chiefly bears \nthese responsibilities. Nonetheless, I believe that the government can \nplay a role and that we in the Congress must pursue legislative avenues \nto strengthen the social fabric and family stability of our Nation.\n  My first legislative proposal, the Adolescent Family Life and \nAbstinence Education Act of 1997, would reauthorize the existing \nAdolescent Family Life Program, known as title XX, a valuable program \nwhich focuses directly on the issues of abstinence, adolescent \nsexuality, adoption alternatives, pregnancy, and parenting. If you want \nto reduce the number of abortions performed in the United States, \nteaching children to resist negative peer pressure is a starting place.\n  In 1981, Congress, with bipartisan support, established the \nAdolescent Family Life Program as the only Federal program of its kind. \nThe program was reauthorized in 1984, and its authority expired in \n1985. Since then, the program has been funded through annual \nappropriations bills. As chairman of the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I pressed to \nappropriate $14.2 million for the Adolescent Family Life program in \nfiscal year 1997, an increase of $6.5 million over fiscal year 1996. \nWithin that amount, $10.8 million is provided for abstinence \ndemonstration programs.\n  A major focus of the Adolescent Family Life prevention projects is \ndelaying the onset of sexual activity, thereby reducing the incidence \nof adolescent pregnancy as well as the transmission of sexually \ntransmitted diseases. Investing in programs that prevent unintended \nteenage births to unwed mothers is also vital in this time of budgetary \nconstraints. Addressing the problem of teenage pregnancy, which alone \ncosts the government about $6.9 billion each year, will save millions \nof dollars in welfare costs.\n  Since its inception, the Adolescent Family Life Program has supported \napproximately 196 care and prevention demonstration projects and 63 \nresearch projects. On April 10, 1996, I met with officials at Mercy \nHospital in Pittsburgh, which has received a 2-year, $1 million grant \nto create a care network to meet the physical, emotional, \npsychological, and educational needs of pregnant and parenting \nadolescents, and to expand upon school-based education programs. The \nresults there have been significant.\n\n  Now, more than 10 years after the authority for this valuable program \nexpired, it is vital that Congress reauthorize the Adolescent Family \nLife Program to stem the staggering emotional and financial cost of \nteenage pregnancy. My legislation, the Adolescent Family Life and \nAbstinence Education Act of 1997, would authorize $75 million in \nFederal spending annually between now and fiscal year 2001 for the \nAdolescent Family Life Program, substantially higher than the $30 \nmillion authorized in 1985. My legislation would also amend title XX of \nthe Public Health Service Act to state expressly that the education \nservices provided by the recipients of Federal funds should include \ninformation about abstinence.\n  Updating Federal law to expressly advocate abstinence education \nprovides necessary guidance to the Department of Health and Human \nServices. I have also proposed amending the law to require the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to ensure, to the maximum extent \npracticable, that approved grants reflect a geographic diversity with \nadequate representation of both urban and rural areas. Further, to \naddress concerns raised by Pennsylvania constituents, my legislation \nwould establish a simplified, expedited application process for groups \nseeking title XX demonstration project funding of less than $15,000. I \nurge my colleagues and others to join me in the effort to reduce \nteenage pregnancies and make America a good society by supporting this \nlegislation.\n  The legislation on adoption, Mr. President, builds upon legislation I \nintroduced last year with my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Santorum, who is the principal cosponsor on both of these \nbills. Our legislation, and there are many others in the field, \nprovided for a $5,000 tax credit for adoption. There are many children \nin America who need homes, and many people in America who would like to \nadopt, but it is a very, very expensive proposition. I was pleased that \nCongress adopted legislation last year providing a $5,000 tax credit \nfor adoption, $6,000 in the case of a special needs child, and this \nlegislation would build on that to provide for an additional $1,500 for \nspecial needs children, for a total of $7,500. Another provision in \nthis bill would allow for a $2,000 withdrawal tax free from individual \nretirement accounts.\n  Far too many children are left to grow up in foster care without ever \nexperiencing the rewards of being a permanent family member. When \ncouples find that they are not able to conceive their own children or \nthat it is not medically advisable, many consider adoption. Many other \ncouples blessed with their own children consider adopting another child \nout of a sense of love and community, particularly where a child has \nbeen in foster care.\n  Recognizing that the costs associated with adoption can be \nprohibitive, Congress passed the Small Business Job Protection Act of \n1996 last August, which provided a nonrefundable tax credit for \nqualified adoption expenses,\n\n[[Page S5934]]\n\nsuch as reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney \nfees, and other expenses related to a legal adoption. The act also \ncontained a tax exclusion for benefits received under employer-\nsponsored adoption assistance programs. Both the tax credit and the \nexclusion of benefits are capped at $5,000 per child, or $6,000 per \nchild in the case of a special needs adoption, and are fully phased out \nfor adjusted gross incomes above $115,000. During Senate consideration \nof this legislation, I wrote to Majority Leader Dole and Finance \nChairman Roth urging the inclusion of a $7,500 tax credit for special \nneeds adoptions, rather than $5,000 as contained in the House-passed \nbill. I was pleased that the final bill included a higher level of \n$6,000 for special needs adoptions, but this is just not enough.\n  We should be doing more to encourage, in particular, the adoption of \nchildren with special needs. Under current law, a child with a special \nneed is one who has a mental, physical or emotional handicap, or who \nfalls into a specific age, gender or minority group, which requires \nassistance to place that child with adoptive parents. This clinical \nexplanation belies the frustrating condition of these children. A New \nYork Times op-ed column by David S. Liederman, Executive Director of \nthe Child Welfare League of America, published on May 9, 1996, stated \nthat there are some 21,000 children with special needs waiting to be \nadopted, and another 65,000 in the care of welfare agencies, awaiting \nlegal clearance to be made available. Many of these children have been \nplaced in foster care because of parental neglect and abuse, exposure \nto drugs or HIV infection, serious emotional and physical disabilities, \nand other problems. These children, especially those with physical \ndisabilities, are often very expensive to raise, which further \ncompounds the difficulty of placing them in adoptive families.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today, the Adoption Promotion Act of \n1997, would increase the tax credit and the exclusion of benefits \nreceived under employer-provided adoption assistance for special needs \nadoptions from $6,000 to $7,500. While it is often much less expensive \nto adopt a special-needs child than a typical infant, related costs may \narise, such as the remodeling of a house to accommodate a physically \nhandicapped child. Increasing the tax credit and exclusion to $7,500 \nwill help to defray such additional expenses.\n  Finally, I have included a provision in my legislation to allow the \npenalty-free withdrawal of up to $2,000 from an Individual Retirement \nAccount [IRA] to help cover the costs of adoptions. I understand that a \ntax credit is simply inadequate to cover all the expenses associated \nwith adoption, and I believe the Federal Tax Code should encourage \nsavings and reward taxpayers, rather than penalizing them for the wise \nuse of their hard-earned money. I have supported other efforts in the \npast that would allow the use of IRA funds for personal capital \nexpenses such as the purchase of a family home, investment in college \neducation, or payment of medical expenses. In my judgment, using IRA \nfunds for adoption expenses is equally meritorious.\n  Given the substantial prior support in both the Senate and House for \ntax incentives to promote adoption, I am hopeful that my colleagues \nwill favorably consider the mix of incentives contained in the Adoption \nPromotion Act of 1997 and enact this legislation in the near future. By \nreducing the financial hurdles to adoption, I hope we will be able to \ngive new hope to the thousands of children who live in foster care \nawaiting the chance to be brought into a loving family environment on a \npermanent basis.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nrestoring the health of America's families by supporting the Adolescent \nFamily Life and Abstinence Education Act of 1997 and the Adoption \nPromotion Act of 1997. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of \nthese bills be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 934\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SENATE RESOLUTION 102--RELATIVE TO INDIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 102\n\n       Whereas India is the world's largest democracy and shares \n     with the United States the system in which the supreme power \n     to govern is invested in the people;\n       Whereas the people of India drew upon the values of the \n     rule of law in creating a representative democracy;\n       Whereas India and the United States share a common bond of \n     being former British colonies;\n       Whereas India's independence was achieved pledged to the \n     principles of fairness, dignity, peace and democracy;\n       Whereas these and other ideals have forged a close bond \n     between our two nations and their peoples;\n       Whereas August 15, 1997 marks the 50th anniversary of the \n     end of the struggle which freed the Indian people from \n     British colonial rule; and\n       Whereas it is proper and desirable to celebrate with the \n     Indian people, and to reaffirm the democratic principles on \n     which our two great nations were born: Now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That August 15, 1997 is designated as Indian \n     Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Indian and \n     American Democracy. The President is requested to issue a \n     proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to \n     observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am submitting this resolution \ncommemorating the 50th anniversary of India's independence. This \nresolution will designate August 15, 1997, as ``Independence Day for \nthe Nation of India,'' a day of celebration of Indian and American \ndemocracy.\n  On August 15, 1947, India came into existence and has been dedicated \nto democracy and the rule of law for the past 50 years. It is a \nmultiethnic country of 950 million people, who speak more than 18 major \nlanguages and hundreds of dialects.\n  I have had the pleasure to visit India on a number of occasions, most \nrecently with the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Senator Brown, \nin August 1995, when we met with Prime Minister Rao. That was a \nfascinating meeting when the Prime Minister immediately undertook a \ndiscussion of the necessity to have the subcontinent nuclear free. \nRegrettably, there has been much controversy, much tension between \nPakistan and India. On that occasion, Prime Minister Rao emphasized his \ndesire to see the subcontinent nuclear free.\n  The next day, Senator Brown and I had occasion to visit with Prime \nMinister Benazir Bhutto in Islamabad and talk to her about establishing \na nuclear free subcontinent.\n  Later, Senator Brown and I wrote jointly to President Clinton urging \nthat the President invite the Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan to \nthe White House to see if a nuclear free subcontinent might be \naccomplished with the assistance of the good offices of the United \nStates.\n  I am delighted to see my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Santorum, assuming the Chair, the lofty position of presiding \nover the U.S. Senate. I am glad to see my colleague here.\n  Back to my resolution. India's democracy has thrived over the past 50 \nyears, testimony to the fact that principles of freedom are not limited \nto the most prosperous countries of the West, but a country which has \nbecome independent and democratic, notwithstanding its problems with \nits economy.\n  There are strong links between the two nations, India and the United \nStates. We are both former British colonies and, in our own civil \nrights struggles of the last generation, great Americans, such as Dr. \nMartin Luther King, borrowed the concepts of peaceful dissent from \nIndia from the teaching of India's independence leader, Mahatma Gandhi.\n  The number of Indian, Americans living in the United States continues \nto increase steadily. The rich cultural heritage and traditions of the \nIndian people contribute to the great diversity of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Relations between our countries have seen some difficulties, and \nthere are still areas for improvement, but our mutual values of \ndemocracy and the rule of law bridge these differences.\n  I submit this resolution because it is proper and desirable to \ncelebrate with the Indian people and to reaffirm the democratic \nprinciples which our two great nations cherish. I ask the American \npeople to join with me in celebrating 50 years of India's independence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5936-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       THE JOHN F.

Mr. President, I am pleased to have lent my \nsupport to H.R. 1757, the 1998-99 State Department authorization bill, \nwhich passed last night. There is much that I support in this bill, and \nI wanted to take a few minutes today to discuss this bill and my vote.\n  With its provisions to reorganize America's foreign policy \ninstitutions and to press for reform at the United Nations I think it \nis fair to say that this bill is one of the most far-reaching and \nimportant bills that we will consider this Congress.\n  For well over a decade the United States has been steadily reducing \nthe amount of money it devotes to international affairs agencies and \nprograms. When current figures are adjusted for inflation, the cuts in \nrecent years have been significant--50 percent since 1984.\n  I was pleased when the administration requested a much-needed \nincrease in funds for international affairs in the 1998 budget request. \nAnd I am pleased that this bill has, on the whole, preserved those \nfunds.\n  The international affairs budget authorized in this bill will go a \nlong way toward righting the inequities of American international \naffairs spending of the past decade, and toward creating an efficient \nframework to support America's global leadership in the millennium to \ncome.\n  Just as important as authorizing funds for the conduct of American \nforeign policy, this bill also takes an historic step in working with \nPresident Clinton and Secretary Albright to create a new foreign \naffairs structure for the 21st century.\n  Many of our current foreign policy institutions were created during \nthe cold war, with specific missions and goals in mind.\n  The reorganization plan put forward by the administration and \nsupported by this bill reflects the need to preserve the unique skills \nand capabilities of each of the current agencies with the requirement \nthat our institutional arrangements reflect the new demands guiding the \nconduct of U.S. foreign policy.\n  By the end of 1999 the result of this bill will be a new streamlined \nforeign policy structure, drawing on the best people and practices of \nthe old agencies, and fully capable of meeting the new challenges of \nthe 21st century.\n  Most importantly, from my perspective, this bill preserves some \nflexibility for the administration in its implementation of the \nPresident's plan.\n  I opposed the reorganization plan we considered in the last Congress, \nbecause it denied the President the flexibility he needs to carry out \nour foreign affairs. This reorganization plan suffers from no such \nflaw.\n  I would also like to take a little time to express my support for the \nplan to repay the United Nations the arrears our Nation owes it and for \nreform of the United Nations that is contained in the bill before us, \nS. 903.\n  I support this package of repayment of arrears and reform benchmarks \nfor one simple reason: because I believe a strong and effective United \nNations is fundamentally important to the national interest of the \nUnited States.\n  I am an unabashed supporter of the United Nations. Now that our \ncolleague, Senator Claiborne Pell, has retired, I believe I am the only \nMember of this body to be in attendance at the founding of the United \nNations in my hometown of San Francisco 52 years ago. I was not a \ndelegate, as was Senator Pell--I was a bit younger then--but I am proud \nthat I was able to help the host city celebrate that important \noccasion.\n  As mayor of San Francisco, I had the honor and privilege of presiding \nover the 40th anniversary celebrations in 1985, and 2 years ago, I \ntraveled with many of my colleagues to San Francisco for the 50th \nanniversary celebrations.\n  These milestones mean a great deal to me, not because of their \nhistorical interest so much as because of their significance in the \nlife of the United States. My own belief is that if the United Nations \ndid not exist, we would have to invent it.\n  I am not among the United Nations' major detractors. I do not believe \nfor 1 minute that the United Nations is somehow out to impose its will \non the United States, or to intrude on our sovereignty. I reject \noutright the paranoid fantasies of those who warn of the specter of \nU.N. taxation or a U.N. army, or the U.N. leading inexorably toward \nworld government.\n  The United Nations serves American interests each and every day. \nThrough the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, it feeds and clothes \nhomeless refugees in time of war. Through U.N. development programs, it \nhelps the poorer nations of the world develop their\n\n[[Page S5938]]\n\ninfrastructures. It provides a forum for negotiating multilateral \nagreements on arms control, protecting the environment, and other \nmatters that affect all nations.\n  The U.N. specialized agencies also address problems that know no \npolitical borders. The World Health Organization fights diseases like \nAIDS that destroy the lives of those they afflict, and, if left \nunchecked, threaten countless others. The International Labor \nOrganization helps keep track of forced labor and child labor, leading \nto multilateral efforts to improve working conditions around the world.\n\n  Perhaps most importantly, the United Nations helps promote peace and \nsecurity in trouble spots around the world. The United Nations is \nprobably best known for peacekeeping. While Americans often remember \nthe debacles of Bosnia and Somalia, few realize that U.N. peacekeepers \nare helping maintain peaceful borders and facilitate peaceful \ntransitions in such places as the Golan Heights, Macedonia, Angola, and \nKuwait.\n  The United Nations also enables the United States to cooperate with \nour allies to carry out missions that are important to U.S. and \ninternational security. With U.N. approval, the United States led the \nnations of the world to expel Saddam from Iraq in Operation Desert \nStorm. The United Nations continues to enforce sanctions on Iraq and \nmonitor Iraqi weapons programs.\n  Because all of these operations require the approval of the U.N. \nSecurity Council, the United States, which has a veto on that Council, \nmust approve them. These operations are never forced down our throats. \nTo the contrary, our leadership role and our veto allow us to leverage \nthe United Nations to conduct operations that are in our interests, but \nwith the burden shared among our allies.\n  For all of these reasons, I value the United Nations and believe it \nis imperative that we help it regain a sound financial footing. The \nUnited Nations' current financial difficulties are threatening to \nrender it unable to implement many of its most important programs. And \nthe biggest portion of the United Nations' shortfall is directly \nattributable to the United States' failure to pay its arrears.\n  So the payment of these arrears is no trivial matter. It is the \nbest--perhaps the only--way to ensure the United Nations' survival as a \nforce for international peace and security in the post-cold-war era.\n  Now, I share the view of the Senator from Indiana, who rightly \npointed out that our payment of these arrears is not voluntary. It is \nan obligation under treaty commitments, signed and ratified according \nto our Constitution.\n  But I also recognize something else. The political reality dictates \nthat if we are to pay any arrears to the United Nations, they must be \naccompanied by a package of reform benchmarks.\n  Over 4 months ago, the majority leader convened a working group of \nHouse and Senate authorizers and appropriators, Republicans and \nDemocrats, to work with the administration on resolving the arrears \nquestion.\n  As the ranking member of the International Operations Subcommittee, I \nwas involved in this task force from the beginning, and my staff \nattended virtually all of the subsequent meetings, until Senator Helms \nand Senator Biden began the detailed endgame negotiations.\n  In the very first meeting of this task force, Secretary of State \nAlbright came to discuss the administration's proposal, which was \nessentially for Congress to appropriate all of the arrears--$1.021 \nbillion--up front, and to attach no conditions to their payment.\n  In the room were a number of leading Republican authorizers and \nappropriators, as well as the majority leader. As I recall, the only \nDemocrats in the room for much of the meeting were the distinguished \nranking member of the House International Relations Committee, Lee \nHamilton of Indiana, and myself.\n  Even then, Mr. Hamilton and I--two strong supporters of the U.S. role \nin the United Nations--told the Secretary of State that, as sympathetic \nas we were to the need to pay these arrears, the administration's \nproposal did not stand a chance. We said it then, and I say it here \ntoday: The votes are not there for repaying our arrears without reform \nbenchmarks.\n  So the negotiations commenced, and they continued through literally \nhundreds of hours. Both sides have made significant concessions. The \nadministration, which wanted to pay all the arrears up front, certainly \nhas. Anyone who saw the early Republican proposals, which called for \npayment of only a portion of the arrears, over 5 years, and with many \nmore, potentially unachievable benchmarks, knows that the distinguished \nSenator from North Carolina has given a lot.\n  But the final result of these talks is a package that calls for a \ntough, but achievable, series of reforms to be implemented by the \nUnited Nations over the next 3 years, while the United States pays off \n$819 million in U.N. arrears, a figure that is the Administration's \nbottom line. These reforms include greater oversight of budgets and \npersonnel, phasing out obsolete programs, and, perhaps most \nimportantly, a reduction in the U.S. share of the assessed budget from \n25 to 20 percent.\n  From the beginning, I felt that 3 years was about the right length of \ntime for this package, and I argued that in the task force. It is long \nenough to give us some leverage to ensure the reforms are enacted, but \nnot so long that the other member States do not believe it is credible \nthat we will pay our debts.\n  Make no mistake, achieving these reforms will take a great deal of \nwork. Some of them, such as the reduction of the U.S. share of the \nbudget, which the other member States must agree to, will require our \nU.N. Ambassador to employ all of his negotiating skills. Others will \nrequire the committed effort of the Secretary General, Kofi Annan--a \nman I believe is genuine in his desire for real reform.\n  I acknowledge that this process is not perfect, and that there will \nbe resentment among other nations who feel that Congress is \nunilaterally dictating what should be multilateral decisions. I \nunderstand that.\n  But these arrears must be paid. And the political reality is that our \nchoice is either to pay these bills in this fashion, over 3 years, \nwhile working with the United Nations for reforms, or not to pay them \nat all. That, to me, is an easy choice. I want to pay our arrears and \nstrengthen the United Nations.\n  In addition to the two major achievements of U.N. reform and State \nDepartment reorganization, this bill also contributes to furthering \nAmerican interests in the world in a myriad of smaller, though not less \nsignificant, ways. Let me provide three such examples.\n  This bill authorizes funds which will go to the International War \nCrimes Tribunal, and which will help assure that those who committed \ngenocide and rape in Rwanda and Bosnia are brought to justice.\n  It lends our support to the work of the Asia Foundation, which, \nthrough innovative public-private partnerships is able to leverage \nFederal resources to effectively promote U.S. political, economic, \ncultural, and security interests throughout the Pacific rim.\n  And this bill authorizes funds which will go to support vitally \nneeded infrastructure and new information technology at our embassies \nand missions.\n  I have been to many of the crumbling and inadequate State Department \nfacilities throughout the world, and can attest from first-hand \nexperience the importance of these efforts.\n  As I stated earlier, it is my belief that this bill, with its United \nNations and reorganization provisions, takes a significant step in the \nright direction on several critical issues which Congress has been \nwrestling with for the past several years. Moreover, the cooperation \nand hard work of the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the \nForeign Relations Committee on this bill, also marks, I believe, a \nreturn to a spirit of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy. I am \nproud to have been able to cast my vote in support of this \nbill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5937-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5938-S5939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SALVE REGINA UNIVERSITY'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the 50th \nanniversary of Salve Regina University, in Newport, RI. Salve Regina \nUniversity is a private coeducational university of the arts and \nsciences, administered by the Sisters of Mercy. In commemoration of \nthis milestone, the U.S. flag will be flown over the Capitol Building \non September 2, 1997.\n\n[[Page S5939]]\n\n  As part of its 50th anniversary celebration, Salve Regina will host \nyear-long activities, open to all, centered around the theme ``The \nEnduring Power of Vision: Tradition, Achievement, Challenge.'' These \nactivities, including a conference on cultural and historical \npreservation, will take place on the university's 60-acre campus, \nbordering on the famed Cliff Walk in Newport.\n  Mr. President, you may be interested to know that since the \nenrollment of its first class on September 24, 1947, the university has \nexpanded to offer 29 undergraduate majors in the arts and sciences and \n16 graduate programs, including a Ph.D. in Humanities.\n  I am particularly pleased that the continued success and achievement \nof Salve Regina will be celebrated this year. And I am very proud to \ncongratulate Salve Regina University for its 50 years of dedication and \nexcellence in education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5938-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ANNOUNCEMENT OF POSITION ON VOTE--AMENDMENT NO. 382\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on Tuesday, June 17, I was unable \nto vote. I would have voted ``yes'' on the Lugar amendment No. 382 to \nS. 903, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1997.\n  I believe that the United States should pay our debt to the United \nNations. However, I also believe that change and reform in the United \nNations are essential if the United Nations is to be revitalized. The \nU.S. dues for the regular U.N. budget and for international \npeacekeeping should be reduced. These cost-saving goals can be achieved \nbut we will have to convince our allies and friends, who will have to \nbear a larger portion of the costs as our contributions decline, that \nwe are serious about our leadership and our compliance with our \nobligations. That is why I believe that Senator Lugar offered a \nreasonable solution to wipe the slate clean of our arrears and clear \nthe way to pursue the U.N. reforms that will make it a more viable \ninstitution.\n  I am hopeful that when this bill emerges from the conference \ncommittee the 38 benchmarks mandated in title XXII of the bill as pre-\nconditions for our payment will be addressed and corrected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5939-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FAIRNESS IN AMERICA'S DAIRY INDUSTRY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak once again \nof one of the greatest impediments to a free market system for U.S. \ndairy: the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.\n  The compact as approved by Secretary Glickman permits six States in \nthe New England area to set the minimum price paid to dairy producers \nabove the minimum price guaranteed by the federal milk marketing order \nsystem. I believe this type of artificial price increase will \ninevitably lead to an overproduction of milk in the New England area. \nUnfortunately, this may serve to further reduce milk prices paid to \ndairy farmers in Michigan and in other regions of the country. \nSubsidizing an already subsidized industry is totally unnecessary and, \nin my opinion, creates a dangerous precedent in allowing regions or \nStates to set up artificial trade barriers. This seems to contradict \nthe intention of last year's freedom to farm bill: removing price \ncontrols and taking Government out of farming.\n  I supported the freedom to farm bill because it eliminates \nagriculture subsidies and gives American farmers the ability to choose \nwhich crops to grow. This bill was of paramount importance to the \npromotion of free markets in the global economy for this Nation's \nagriculture producers. I was disheartened when the Northeast interstate \ndairy compact slipped into the farm bill conference report at the last \nmoment. It is my hope that Congress will correct this flaw and move \nU.S. agriculture one step closer to establishing a true market \neconomy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5939-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE 70TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAVISES\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \ncity of Bismarck, ND, for recently being named an ``All-America City.''\n  This honor comes as no surprise to those of us who have been proud to \ncall Bismarck home. But for many years, weather reports of blowing snow \nand subzero temperatures enabled us to keep what we call the good life \nin Bismarck a well-guarded secret. With this award and new national \nprominence, residents of Bismarck, ND, can no longer be modest.\n  Bismarck is a place where the quality of life is good, the economy is \ngrowing, and the threat of crime is practically nonexistent. Our kids \ncan go to good schools without worrying about carrying knives or guns \nand they can play outside on their streets after dark. It is a place \nwhere people still get to know their neighbors and where hard-working \npeople can make a decent wage. Unemployment for the city is a mere 2.7 \npercent, well below the national average of 4.8 percent.\n  But now our secret's out--and I'm pleased it has been done with such \nhonor. Only 10 cities receive the All America City designation each \nyear from the National Civic League. This year, 120 cities applied and \nonly 30 were chosen as finalists. By surpassing the 20 other cities \nnationwide to win the award, Bismarck gained a title and prominence \nthat will surely attract new businesses, increase population, and \nprovide new opportunities for growth in our State.\n  Bismarck currently has a population of close to 50,000 residents--\nmost of whom are very hard-working, civic minded people who get \ninvolved in the decisions that affect their community--which is one of \nthe main reasons the city was chosen for this award. While Bismarck \nreceived recognition from the judges for three of its projects, the \ncity was singled out for its unique city sales tax allocation. In \nBismarck, citizens have a share in the decision of where their city \nsales tax is spent. The judges applauded this unique approach to local \ngovernment that gives taxpayers input for city projects. What a \nremarkable idea.\n  Bismarck was also recognized for its Suicide Prevention Task Force \nand some local programs produced at the Anne Frank exhibit, including a \n10-minute script that pokes fun of images that some people have of \nBismarck and North Dakota.\n  Again, I want to congratulate the city of Bismarck for receiving this \nprestigious All-America City Award. It is exemplary of the good people \nand good quality of life that we've always enjoyed in our \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5939-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5939-S5940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MR. PATRICK BISTRIAN, JR.\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Mr. \nPatrick Bistrian, Jr., of Amagansett, NY, on the occasion of his \nretirement from the board of education of the Amagansett Union Free \nSchool District after 30 years of service.\n  As a student, Pat Bistrian earned recognition in both academic and \nathletic pursuits. He held almost all the high school track and field \nrecords. Local legend has it that some of them still stand today. His \nleadership in school evolved into a devotion to community service.\n  Throughout his 30 years on the board, he never wavered in his \ncommitment to the children of the Amagansett School District. Guided by \ncommon sense and an admirable dose of doggedness, his can do attitude \nwas always applied for the good of the children. After a fire destroyed \nthe school gymnasium in 1975, Patrick Bistrian fastidiously saw to \nevery detail regarding the replacement of the building. To his credit, \nthe facility exceeded even the grandest expectations and came in under \nbudget.\n  While voluntarism has now become fashionable throughout the land, the \nconcept is not new to Patrick Bistrian; for him, it is a way of life. I \nam certain the Members of the Senate join me in saluting Patrick \nBistrian for his 30\n\n[[Page S5940]]\n\nyears of selfless commitment to the Amagansett community. Much like his \nathletic accomplishments in track and field, he has left behind a \nlegacy that will surely go unrivaled for some time to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5939-5", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5940-S5941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ``ILLUSORY GAME OF ARMS CONTROL''\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, during the recent Senate debate over \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention, a great deal of discussion centered on \nthe proper role of arms control agreements. I recommend the Washington \nTimes op-ed by Sven Kraemer, who served as Director of Arms Control at \nthe National Security Council during the Reagan administration to \nanyone interested in the subject. I ask that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The op-ed follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, May 11, 1997]\n\n                     Illusory Game of Arms Control\n\n                           (By Sven Kraemer)\n\n       ``They cry `peace,' but there is no peace.'' Jeremiah's \n     lament about the false prophets of peace applies tragically \n     to the false prophets of arms control who won Senate \n     ratification of the proposed Chemical Weapons Convention \n     (CWC) recently. They cry ``arms control,'' but there is no \n     arms control.\n       CWC supporters saw the CWC as an ``arms control'' talisman \n     to ward off evil powers and ``to ban forever the scourge of \n     chemical weapons from the face of the globe.'' They \n     proclaimed it a global ban although the CWC is far from \n     global in its list of banned chemical precursors and in the \n     number of states likely to sign or to ratify it. They \n     proclaimed it as ``arms control'' while admitting it cannot \n     be effectively verified or enforced and it cannot stop, and \n     even risks abetting, proliferation.\n       Such false prophets and fatal flaws are tragically common \n     to other ``arms control'' items on President Clinton's \n     radical agenda headed for Senate review. These include \n     proposed ``bans'' on nuclear testing, biological weapons, \n     fissile materials and land mines, a START III ``framework'' \n     that vitiates START II, and a Helsinki summit agreement \n     setting new limits on missile defenses. They don't build \n     foundations or bridges for arms control in the 21st century, \n     but are more like bungee jumps. Counting on miracles, \n     spectacle and concessions rather than effective measures to \n     control and protect against arms, they miss both the \n     opportunities and the obligations of serious arms control and \n     responsible leadership.\n       CWC supporters claimed years of political legitimacy for \n     the CWC and declared that a ``no'' vote would destroy U.S. \n     leadership, wrecking a long effort to establish high \n     international arms control norms and placing the United \n     States on the side of pariah states. But it is a ``yes'' vote \n     that puts the United States on the side of pariahs. A ``no'' \n     vote would have embarrassed a few officials, but would have \n     marked a principled U.S. stand, supported by American public \n     opinion, against a fatally flawed arms control approach that \n     rewards pariahs and rogues, lowers already low arms control \n     standards and seriously endangers our own security.\n\n\n                               next steps\n\n       The required leadership won't come from the White House and \n     its misguided Senate supporters. The task of critique, \n     reinvention and leadership will come from the unprecedented \n     coalition of courageous senators, former Cabinet-level \n     officials, key businessmen, and leaders of some 40 citizens \n     groups who joined in opposition to the CWC and who want \n     serious arms control, serious defense, and serious protection \n     of our citizens' rights. CWC funding and implementation \n     legislation provide early opportunities for such leadership \n     in correcting the treaty's fatal flaws. The extraordinary \n     Kyl-Lott-Helms, et al. ``Chemical and Biological Weapons \n     Threat Reduction Act'' passed by the Senate the week before \n     the CWC vote, will be an excellent foundation for that \n     effort.\n       For the future, CWC opponents will be more dubious than \n     ever about the administration's blizzards of misinformation \n     and the next items on Mr. Clinton's radical agenda. Their \n     concerns are backed by Luntz polls that show the American \n     people to be overwhelmingly opposed to treaties like the CWC \n     which cannot be effectively verified or enforced, which \n     create costly and intrusive new U.N.-style international \n     bureaucracies, and which endanger U.S. rights and weaken U.S. \n     security. The administration and its Senate supporters have \n     been put on notice.\n       To silence such critics and undermine potential long-term \n     opposition, Clinton CWC supporters have sought political \n     cover by invoking George Bush and even Ronald Reagan for \n     their efforts. A George Bush signature was presented as \n     necessarily guaranteeing effective ``arms control,'' and the \n     CWC was even declared a ``Reagan treaty.'' In the wake of the \n     Senate vote, such claims require new review and rebuttal.\n       The Bush signature guarantees nothing. Grave flaws were \n     evident in the CWC when it was rushed to signature in the \n     closing days of the Bush presidency in January 1993. In the \n     four years since then, changed global conditions have turned \n     these flaws into deadly gambles. Left standing, the CWC \n     flaws, high-risk Clinton arms control and defense policies, \n     and dangerous international developments (notably including \n     severe proliferation problems fostered by Russian and Chinese \n     violations which the Clinton administration rewards instead \n     of engages) will be heading the United States into the bull's \n     eye of disaster.\n\n\n            three reagan lessons and legacies for the future\n\n       The invocation of Ronald Reagan on behalf of the CWC and \n     similar spurious arms control efforts is particularly ironic. \n     Mr. Reagan's understanding of history and his approach to \n     arms control are repudiated by the CWC's underlying \n     assumptions, provisions and impact. Mr. Reagan often spoke of \n     the historic reality that arms control agreements were \n     routinely violated by dictators and rogues unfettered by the \n     democratic hopes, principles and processes of the American \n     people and their allies. He often spoke of the high cost \n     paid in lives and treasure for trust in such agreements, \n     including those from the 1970's, which were being \n     systematically violated by the Soviet Union. His strategy \n     of ``peace through strength'' won the Cold War in part \n     because he redefined arms control in terms of its \n     contribution to America's security, not as a matter of \n     trust in a ``process'' or as an end in itself.\n\n\n                   dealing with dictators and rogues\n\n       Enforcing compliance, ending proliferation: From the \n     beginning of his presidency, Ronald Reagan's arms control \n     approach rejected the prevalent lowest common denominator \n     approach of his predecessors in negotiations with dictators \n     and rogues, and focused instead on mastering the task of \n     working with democratic allies effectively to constrain, \n     deter and defend against such evil powers. This task is more \n     important than ever in today's world as Iraq, Iran, North \n     Korea, Libya, Syria and their chief suppliers in Moscow and \n     Beijing routinely violate a wide range of anti-proliferation \n     and other arms control agreements and as the Clinton \n     administration fails to enforce these treaties or even to \n     implement U.S. laws providing sanctions for such behavior.\n       To start with, Mr. Reagan insisted that violations of \n     existing treaties had to be exposed and corrected before new \n     ones could be signed. And for chemical, biological and toxin \n     weapons, the first two years of the Reagan presidency focused \n     on assessing and reporting such violations and seeking \n     correction, especially concerning Soviet Production and use. \n     The Reagan compliance reports were unprecedented in \n     accurately presenting the threat and in pressing the case for \n     establishing higher norms for international arms control \n     compliance. Thus, when he had Vice President George Bush \n     table a preliminary draft CW Convention in April 1984, half \n     of the press and diplomatic kit made available by the White \n     House and the vice president provided detailed information on \n     troublesome Soviet activities that had to be corrected before \n     CW arms control could begin to be taken seriously.\n       Mr. Reagan's CWC draft did not contain the ``poisons for \n     peace'' language of the current CWC's Article XI which \n     requires ``the fullest possible exchange of chemicals, \n     equipment and information'' and which forbids ``the \n     maintenance of restrictions.'' Nor did his CWC draft contain \n     the other pro-proliferation clause, Article X, which declares \n     that ``nothing in this Convention shall be interpreted as \n     impeding the rights of States Parties to request and provide \n     assistance bilaterally.''\n\n\n     effective verification, enforcement and insurance capabilities\n\n       Mr. Reagan insisted that serious arms control treaties had \n     to impose real, verifiable and enforceable restrictions, not \n     the ``nuclear freeze''-type illusions demanded by the \n     Soviet Union and favored by the self-styled U.S. ``arms \n     control'' lobby. Thus, he proposed the ``zero option'' for \n     Intermediate-Nuclear Forces in 1981 and a ``deep cuts'' \n     Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty in 1982. And when a draft \n     CW Convention was tabled in Geneva in 1984, Mr. Reagan \n     insisted on an interagency and international work program \n     focused on a long-term effort to try to develop such \n     effective restrictions in the future. Reflecting this \n     Reagan imperative, George Bush told the Geneva press: \n     ``Let's try to use this as a beginning, a place to get a \n     start on the negotiations.''\n       Mr. Reagan insisted that effective arms control required \n     U.S. security capabilities in place to provide the insurance \n     of high-confidence U.S. verification, enforcement and \n     defense, and he required that such capabilities be certified \n     for each arms control proposal by the U.S. intelligence \n     community and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. For chemical \n     weapons, he required enhanced intelligence, robust anti-\n     chemical defenses, and a small residual stock of modern \n     chemical weapons to provide enforcement and negotiation \n     leverage until a period near the end of the final weapons \n     destruction date.\n       In addition to such U.S. insurance capabilities for \n     specific arms control treaties, Mr. Reagan's Strategic \n     Defense Initiative, introduced in March 1983 (a year before \n     the draft CWC was tabled), provided for deterrence and \n     defense based on protection rather than on his predecessors' \n     dubious Cold War policy of Mutual Assured Destruction (MAD). \n     The American people, and people around the world, were to \n     share the benefits of the accelerated development and \n     deployment of advanced U.S. theater and strategic defenses to \n     be available against missiles--the delivery system of choice \n     most threatening in the use\n\n[[Page S5941]]\n\n     of chemicals, toxins and other weapons of mass destruction. \n     As late as 1992, George Bush and Boris Yeltsin agreed that at \n     least a limited global anti-missile defense system (GPALS) \n     would be important to security and stability.\n       In contrast to the Reagan defense insurance policies, the \n     United States is not only unilaterally eliminating its \n     chemical stockpiles, a move other nations are not following, \n     but the Clinton administration is cutting back several \n     hundred million dollars in U.S. chemical defense investment, \n     reducing its intelligence, dumbing down theater missile \n     defenses, and further postponing the national missile defense \n     deployments required to protect the American people against \n     growing threats from rogues and from accidental launches.\n\n\n       protecting u.s. constitutional rights and u.s. sovereignty\n\n       Mr. Reagan's arms control policies insisted on assuring \n     U.S. constitutional rights and protecting U.S. sovereignty. \n     His CWC interagency work program reflected the requirement to \n     study and to try to resolve the serious Fourth and Fifth \n     Amendment dilemmas raised by extensive CWC reporting, \n     regulatory and inspection requirements, which in the current \n     CWC potentially affect the rights and budgetary and \n     proprietary interests of up to 8,000 U.S. companies. Unlike \n     the current CWC, Mr. Reagan's draft CWC of 1984 had the \n     United States and other permanent members of the U.N. \n     Security Council as five guaranteed members of the CWC \n     Executive Council, and required a Preparatory Conference and \n     other forums to operate by consensus, providing a U.S. voice \n     and veto when CWC provisions and processes required \n     amendment.\n       As the Senate now reviews CW implementing legislation, \n     funding requirements and other elements of the radical \n     Clinton agenda, it should send its own veto on behalf of U.S. \n     security and serious arms control. In the face of the globe's \n     gathering storms, it is not too late ``to provide for the \n     common defense'' and to prevent the historic tragedy now \n     unfolding because of U.S. reliance on ``arms control'' \n     illusions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5940-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5941]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HALTING NEW DEPLOYMENTS OF LANDMINES\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the bill to halt \nthe unmitigated spread of landmines sponsored by Senator Leahy and \nSenator Hagel. In particular, I laud Senator Leahy's tireless efforts \nin lining up over half the Members of the Senate behind this important \nlegislation. Also, Senator Hagel's experience as an Army sergeant in \nVietnam and his unrelenting support for veterans and the military make \nhis leadership role on this bill quite appropriate.\n  This bill would halt new deployments of U.S. antipersonnel mines \nstarting on January 1, 2000. What better way to open the new millennium \nthan to clamp down on these hidden, unmanageable devices that kill or \ninjure someone somewhere every 22 minutes.\n  Let's not lose sight of the fact that landmines kill and maim without \nimpunity--men, women, and children alike will continue to lose their \nlives or limbs as long as landmines remain buried around the globe. \nThat attribute, the completely random killing, sets these devices apart \nfrom all other weapons of war, with the possible exception of weapons \nof mass destruction. Yet, even a hydrogen bomb cannot kill a child \nplaying in a pasture a decade after the bomb was dropped.\n  Today there are 100 million land mines in 68 countries that wait \npotently to explode, be it tomorrow, years from now, or decades hence. \nMore soldiers, U.N. peacekeepers, and children will surely lose their \nlives before the world acts to stem the tide of these horrible weapons. \nThe question is: How many hundreds more must die needlessly before we \npursue vigorously a treaty banning antipersonnel landmines?\n  Late last year, the U.N. General Assembly resolved, without a single \ndissenting vote, to do just that. Having introduced that resolution in \nour customary role as world leader, we must now take action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5941-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5941-S5942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       WENDY GRAMM'S GRADUATION SPEECH GIVEN AT TRI STATE COLLEGE\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord a graduation speech given by Wendy Gramm at Tri-State College. I \nthink it is an inspirational message to young people. Wendy, while very \naccomplished in her own right, is also the wife of Senator Phil Gramm. \nWhile this speech is about a significant man in her life, she recalled \nstories about her father, not her husband.\n  The central message of the speech is drawn from the personal \nexperiences of three generations of Wendy Gramm's family. Mrs. Gramms' \nfather graduated from this institution of higher learning with a degree \nin engineering.\n  During this commencement, Wendy was awarded an honorary doctorate \ndegree from her father's alma mater. In her speech, Wendy talked about \nthe traits that made her father successful. Mrs. Gramm's point is that \nthese same traits can make the graduating class a success. These traits \ninclude: define goals, work hard, show leadership, practice the highest \nstandard of ethics.\n  Wendy Gramm gave the students her definition of what makes a leader: \n``Leaders lead by example, and must show honesty and fairness always.''\n  The text of the speech follows:\n\n       Congratulations to graduates, parents, teachers, relatives \n     and friends. You've done it and you deserve congratulations.\n       All too often we work so hard, focused on where we are \n     going, and fail to stop and enjoy what we've accomplished. \n     You've heard it before--and it's true--life is not a \n     destination, but a trainride, so enjoy the ride. Enjoy your \n     accomplishments today. Pat yourself on the back. And take \n     time to thank those who helped you.\n       This is a special day for you--and for me, too. I will \n     celebrate receiving this honorary degree--and will make \n     everyone call me doctor-doctor for today. Today is also \n     special because my father graduated from TriState, 61 years \n     ago. My mom is here, as well as much of my family--my \n     husband, one son (the other is studying for exams), and two \n     sisters and a brother-in-law.\n       Let me tell you his story, because I believe his story has \n     lessons for all of us today. The stories also illustrate what \n     I believe are essential qualities of leadership and rules for \n     a full, happy, and successful life.\n       My grandparents came from Korea at the beginning of the \n     century to work in the sugar cane fields of Hawaii. They came \n     as contract laborers, meaning they paid for their way over by \n     agreeing to work in the sugar cane fields for a number of \n     years--new indentured laborers. They came with nothing, not \n     even knowing the language. They came looking for freedom and \n     opportunity.\n       My father, Joshua, was the second in a family of 12 \n     children.\n       The first story is about having dreams and goals in life. \n     When my father was in high school, there was an essay \n     contest--students were asked to write an essay about what \n     they could do to make this a better country. Dad thought and \n     thought, as the minutes ticked by and the blank page stared \n     up at him (you know the feeling). He wondered, what could a \n     beach bum like Joe Lee do that would affect a whole country? \n     The answer came to him in the middle of that contest--he \n     could do the most for his country if he made something of \n     himself.\n       He won the contest and $25, a small fortune in the early \n     1930s.\n       The essay contest helped define his goals in life, and he \n     decided to pursue his dream--of becoming an engineer and \n     making something of himself. He started college at the \n     University of Hawaii, but ran out of money. So he worked in a \n     laundry.\n       The next summer a classmate of his told him he was going to \n     Tri-State College to study engineering. My grandmother told \n     my father--I'll give you money for transportation to \n     Indiana--the rest is up to you.\n       Dad set a goal, and worked hard--to find a way to reach the \n     goal. A second important quality for success is commitment to \n     a goal. And dad was committed. Upon arriving in Angola, he \n     lived first few days on day old bread and pork and beans--\n     still loved p\n       He found room and board in the home of the postmistress in \n     town, and helped in the yard and tended the furnace. She was \n     a kind a gracious lady, and dad couldn't believe it when he \n     visited her 25 years later in 1950. She looked exactly the \n     same!\n       The first job he applied for was at a restaurant. The \n     restaurant owner told dad that he was thinking of getting a \n     dishwashing machine. My dad said he could wash dishes faster \n     and better than the new dishwashing machine--he would race \n     the machine for the job. My father won the race and the job.\n       He worked his way through Tri-State, generally holding \n     three jobs at the same time, working in two restaurants, as a \n     tree surgeon and painting trim on houses, along with his \n     furnace tending and yard work.\n       The third important quality for leadership and success is \n     my favorite story about Tri-State. Dad had gone to class \n     where they went over a test they had taken. During the class, \n     Dad realized that the professor had made a mistake and had \n     given him a higher grade than he deserved. So we went up to \n     the professor after class and told him of the error. The \n     professor then said that he had deliberately made mistakes on \n     all the students' tests, and Dad was the only student who \n     came up to him and admitted it. I don't remember the punch \n     line--I believe the professor gave Dad an A for the test--but \n     the punch line isn't important. What is important is that Dad \n     had the highest standards of ethics.\n       Perhaps the most important quality of a leader is the \n     highest level of integrity--leaders lead by example, and so \n     must show honesty and fairness always.\n       Regrets? Not having gone to a big 10 football game. \n     Remember what I said earlier about enjoying your day, and the \n     train ride.\n\n[[Page S5942]]\n\n       Dad lived his life like the engineer he was--organized, \n     efficient, prepared, never procrastinating, and finishing \n     each job on time or before.\n       He moved back to Hawaii after graduating in 1936, and met \n     Angeline Lee (Lee is a common name in Hawaii). He arranged a \n     date--and, like the engineer he was, showed up for the date \n     one week early. But mom liked him anyway, and they got \n     married, had four children, and Dad died shortly after his \n     50th wedding anniversary.\n       The principles he lived by--don't brag, just do a good job, \n     and rewards will come; be prepared and organized and just go \n     ahead and do the job; be fair and honest. These principles \n     and the leadership qualities he exhibited--vision, commitment \n     and integrity--worked well for him--he became the first Asian \n     American ever to be an officer of a sugar company in the \n     history of Hawaii.\n       Recap: my grandfathers cut sugar cane by hand, my father \n     became VP of the same sugar company, and when I chaired the \n     Commodity Futures Trading Commission Presidents Reagan and \n     Bush liked to point out that I oversaw the futures trading of \n     all American commodities, including cane sugar.\n       This is the American Dream.\n       The story I have told you is not just the story of my \n     family, Tri-State University, or leadership. It is not the \n     story of an extraordinary family, but the story of an \n     ordinary family in an extraordinary country.\n       It is the story of America, where ordinary people can and \n     do accomplish extraordinary things.\n       So congratulations once again. I wish you good luck and \n     every success.\n       As you go out into the world, remember this day. Remember \n     your accomplishment. I also hope you will remember my family, \n     the American Dream, and Tri-State's role is making that \n     American Dream for our family and for me.\n       I also hope that you will come to appreciate that great \n     American Dream Machine--freedom and free enterprise--and that \n     you will work to preserve and protect it so that the Joshua \n     Lees of tomorrow can have a dream, maybe come to Tri-State, \n     and go on to be a success, a leader, and make better lives \n     for themselves, their families, their communities, and their \n     country.\n       And may you do the same and have great success and \n     happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5941-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5942-S5943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        DISASTER SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS AND RESCISSION ACT\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that I can finally \ntell the people of North Dakota that a disaster relief package has \nfinally been passed by Congress and signed by the President. I am \npleased that I can finally tell tens of thousands of individuals and \nbusiness owners, who were devastated by the worst winter on record in \nNorth Dakota followed by a millennial flood, that help is on the way.\n  Everyone who has watched the news over the past 2 months has been \nmoved by both the devastation and the determination of the citizens of \nNorth Dakota. You watched our people working side by side, day and \nnight to sandbag their homes, their schools, and their businesses. The \ndramatic photos on every TV station are a living legacy of what \ncommunity is all about. It was neighbor helping neighbor. In the end, \nMother Nature won the battle, but we fought the good fight and we did \nit together.\n  Despite 9 blizzards which dropped more snow in North Dakota than in \nany other year on record; despite storms which killed more than 125,000 \nhead of livestock and knocked out hundred of miles of power lines; \ndespite a millennial flood which forced the evacuation of 50,000 people \nfrom Grand Forks; despite the fact that many North Dakotans have lost \ntheir homes and all their worldly possessions, we North Dakotans will \ncontinue to work together to rebuild our cities, our businesses, and \nour communities in order to preserve a way of life which we all \ncherish.\n  We are a strong, proud, and resolute people. We will face the \nchallenges ahead with courage and commitment. But with damages expected \nto be in the billions, we could not proceed without the Federal support \nprovided in the disaster relief bill.\n  With this bill and the assistance that flows with it, the disaster \nvictims in North Dakota and the other flood ravaged States can begin \nthe long and painful process of recovery. The money provided in the \nrelief bill will allow them to make informed decisions about their \nlives, their homes, and their businesses. They have waited too long for \nthis help. But the wait is over. Help is on the way, and rebuilding and \nhealing can begin.\n  I would like to thank all the Members of the Senate and House \nAppropriations Committees for their help in working with me to ensure \nthat sufficient assistance to address the incredible needs of North \nDakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota was ultimately included in the \ndisaster relief bill. Individually and collectively, we have suffered a \ndisaster of catastrophic proportions which has required an exceptional \nresponse, and that is what the disaster relief bill provides.\n  There are many people to thank as for their help on the disaster \nappropriations bill. At the top of the list are Senators Stevens and \nByrd who were extremely helpful and supportive throughout every step of \nthe process. Without their personal intervention and continuous \nsupport, many items and millions of dollars would not have been \nincluded in the final package. On behalf of all the people of North \nDakota, I want to thank them for their generous assistance.\n  Let me just list a few of the items in the disaster bill which will \nhave a direct bearing on our ability to rebuild:\n  $3.4 billion for FEMA, a significant portion of which will go to the \nUpper Midwest region.\n  $500 million in community development block grants. This is the most \nflexible form of disaster assistance and the most crucial component to \nallow for buyouts. While all disaster States are eligible for this \nassistance, we anticipate that the majority will go to the Dakotas and \nMinnesota.\n\n  $134 million in emergency agricultural assistance for the Upper \nMidwest, including\n  $50 million for a new livestock indemnity program which will help \nNorth Dakota farmers and ranchers who have lost close to 125,000 head \nof livestock;\n  $15 million in Department of Agriculture funds to purchase floodplain \neasements to reduce hazards to life and property due to the floods; and\n  $5 million for the interest assistance program to provide additional \nfunding for guaranteed, low-interest loans to farmers.\n  $20 million to reimburse school districts who have had to educate \nadditional children who were dislocated by the floods.\n  $15 million for all preconstruction and design work for an outlet \nfrom Devils Lake to the Sheyenne River.\n  $27.9 million in Corps of Engineers funding for North Dakota from the \nflood Control and Coastal Emergencies program.\n  $600,000 for Ramsey County to mitigate damages to the sewer system \nfrom flooding, if necessary.\n  About $20 million for the Corps of Engineers to raise the levees at \nDevils Lake.\n  $210,000 for North Dakota's national parks.\n  $3.9 million for the BIA in North Dakota.\n  $265,000 for the Indian Health Service in North Dakota.\n  $6.1 million for North Dakota to repair damaged freight rail lines.\n  $9.3 million to the Fish and Wildlife Service in North Dakota.\n  $840,000 for the U.S. Geological Service in North Dakota.\n  Department of Education waiver authority language which will permit \nthe Department to help students having difficulty meeting application \nand other statutory deadlines regarding Federal education funds.\n  Language which allows States greater flexibility in using its child \ncare and development block grant funds to help families in \nnonemployment related activities relating to the cleanup and recovery.\n  A provision which directs the Office of Management and Budget to work \nwith universities damaged by the floods in revising and extending their \nFederal grants, contracts, and cooperative agreement.\n  In order to provide my colleagues with more detailed information on \nplans for enhanced diking at Devils Lake, ND, I ask to have printed in \nthe Record a letter from the St. Paul District of the Corps of \nEngineers dated May 19, 1997.\n  There are many people beyond the Congress to thank for their support \nin the wake of a series of historic and devastating disasters in North \nDakota. Above all, I want to thank the people of North Dakota who, \ndespite their losses, have refused to be overcome. They have displayed \na remarkable\n\n[[Page S5943]]\n\nsense of courage, caring and conviction throughout the ordeal. Never \nhave I been more proud to represent the State of North Dakota than I am \nnow. They are the best citizens in the country. They know the meaning \nof neighbor. Whenever and wherever they were able, they extended a hand \nto those less fortunate.\n  The great spirit of our people is embodied in the mayor of Grand \nForks, Pat Owens. While small in stature, she has the heart of a giant. \nShe gave us the courage not to lose courage. Her indomitable spirit \nheld the citizens of Grand Forks together during the worst days of the \ntragedy, and now is guiding us patiently and compassionately through \nthe recovery.\n  I also want to thank all the Federal agencies for their long hours \nand hard work in bringing emergency assistance to relieve the immediate \nsuffering of our citizens. They have done a magnificent job under \nextremely trying circumstances, and we are grateful for their \nsuperhuman efforts. James Lee Witt, the Director of FEMA, has been the \nguiding light in this endeavor. He came to North Dakota and personally \nwitnessed the devastation, and then rushed personnel and resources into \nthe State to assess damages and provide emergency assistance. He has \nalso coordinated the activities of other Federal agencies in trying to \nget assistance to those in need as quickly as possible. That process is \nongoing, and James Lee remains the stalwart in that endeavor. We thank \nhim for all he has done and continues to do.\n  In conclusion, let me thank my colleagues once again for their help \nin passing an historic disaster relief bill. North Dakotans are \ngrateful for the helping hand the disaster relief bill provides. \nRecovery will be a long and painful process, but we will face the \nchallenges ahead with courage and commitment. With our prairie faith to \nguide us, we will rebuild, we will recover, and we will be a stronger \ncommunity.\n  The letter follows:\n         Department of the Army, St. Paul District, Corps of \n           Engineers,\n                                       St. Paul, MN, May 19, 1997.\n     Hon.

This letter will describe the \n     work required to provide this additional protection.\n       The levee project at the City of Devils Lake that is \n     currently under construction is a raise of the Federal levee \n     project built by the Corps of Engineers in the 1980s under \n     the Continuing Authorities program. The ongoing construction \n     is raising and extending the existing levee system to provide \n     an increased level of protection from the lake. The original \n     levee was design to protect against a lake level of elevation \n     1440. The ongoing construction will protect against a lake \n     level five feet higher, to an elevation 1445. The top of \n     levee is being constructed five feet higher than the design \n     lake level to provide the necessary freeboard to handle wind, \n     waves & ice action.\n       The current work was started in 1996 when the lake was at \n     elevation 1437, approaching the protection level of the \n     original levee, 1440. The early National Weather Service \n     forecast for the lake level this summer was elevation 1440.5, \n     well within the level of protection being provided by the \n     current work. However, in mid-April this year, the National \n     Weather Service increased the forecast lake level by three \n     plus feet to elevation 1443.5 to 1444, projecting this level \n     to be reached in July 1997. Based on this revised forecast \n     lake level, it is necessary to consider additional protection \n     by raising the levee system even higher than currently being \n     constructed.\n       An additional levee raise to provide protection against a \n     lake level of 1450 is highly desirable and can be constructed \n     cost effectively. The additional work required to provide \n     this higher level of levee protection, with appropriate \n     freeboard, would consist of the following features:\n       Increase the height and base width of the existing earthen \n     levee sections.\n       Extend and modify the levee alignment to tie into high \n     ground at the new top of levee elevation. This could include \n     the extension of the line of protection to areas which were \n     not previously considered practical to protect, but which due \n     to the higher level of protection may now be necessary and \n     effective;\n       Increase the extent and thickness of the riprap on the \n     lakeward side of the levee to assure adequate erosion \n     protection;\n       Modification of the pumping stations and/or installation of \n     another pumping station, and modification of interior \n     drainage facilities to accommodate increases in the drainage \n     area behind the levee protected and increased pumping head;\n       Additional road relocation work and closures at levee \n     crossing; and,\n       Additional utility relocation work.\n       If you have any questions regarding the above information, \n     or wish to discuss this matter further, please contact me.\n     Sincerely,\n\n                                                  J.M. Wonsik,\n\n                                                 Colonel, Corps of\n     Engineers District Engineer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5942-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5943-S5944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SOLVING CITIZEN BAND RADIO INTERFERENCE PROBLEMS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 608, \na bill offering potential relief to neighborhood residents victimized \nby the illegal use of a citizen band [CB] radio. In Grand Rapids, MI, \nand in other towns in Michigan and across the country, CB operators \nhave boosted the power of their signal using equipment prohibited under \nFCC regulations. As a result, nearby residents have been unable to \nwatch television, listen to their radios, or have a telephone \nconversation without experiencing interference from a neighbor's \nillegal use of a CB radio.\n  Currently, there exists a series of rules governing the appropriate \nuse of CB radio, including restrictions on equipment and frequencies, \nduration of broadcast, and appropriate content. Due to a change in \npriority, the FCC no longer investigates related interference \ncomplaints. The Commission merely sends individuals a packet of \ninformation outlining steps which can be taken to reduce the \ninterference. Unfortunately, these solutions have been met with only \nlimited success. In many cases, after having exhausted all available \noptions, residents are left with no legal recourse. In addition, when \nresidents turn to local authorities, they are denied assistance. \nBecause of the Communications Act of 1934, the Federal Government has \nexclusive authority to regulate radio frequency usage and to enforce \nrelated rules. Therefore, State and local authorities are prevented \nfrom enforcing FCC rules already in existence.\n  This is where S. 608 would provide a remedy. This bill, which I have \ncosponsored, would give limited authority to State and local \ngovernments to enforce FCC rules governing CB radio equipment. I would \nlike to emphasize this legislation will not jeopardize the exclusive \nregulatory jurisdiction of the FCC, neither will it impose added \nrequirements on State and local governments. This bill merely allows \nlocalities to enforce rules already in effect, thereby giving citizens \na legal recourse in solving radio interference disputes.\n  Mr. President, I view this legislation as a small, yet simple \napproach to solving CB radio interference problems. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill, and I look forward to working with \nSenator Feingold to secure its passage.\n  I ask that the text of a Grand Rapids City Commission resolution in \nsupport of S. 608 be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n                                    Grand Rapids, MI, May 7, 1997.\n     Senator Spencer Abraham,\n     Southfield, MI.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: Enclosed is a certified copy of \n     Resolution 63295 approved by the Grand Rapids City Commission \n     on April 29, 1997, which encourages you and all the members \n     of the Michigan Congressional Delegation to support Senate \n     Bill S. 608 which changes Federal Communications Commission \n     rules to allow states and local units of government to \n     enforce certain regulations regarding the operation of \n     citizen band radio equipment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Mary Therese Hegarty,\n                                                       City Clerk.\n       Enclosure.\n       Your committee of the whole recommends adoption of the \n     following resolution encouraging Senator Abraham and the \n     Michigan Congressional Delegation to support Senate Bill S. \n     608 which would amend the Federal Communications Act of 1934 \n     to allow state and local governments to prohibit citizens \n     band radio equipment and operations which are not authorized \n     by the Federal Communications Commission and to enforce those \n     regulations.\n     J.

Mr. President, today, I lend my support of the \nresolution my colleague Senator Domenici has introduced to bring the \nquality of Indian education on par with the rest of America. Increasing \nthe quality of education available to our Native American youth will go \nfar in solving many of the problems facing tribal governments and \nIndian people.\n  This resolution acknowledges that the facts are discouraging. Indian \nyouth lead all ethnic and racial groups in drop-out and poverty rates. \nTheir juvenile delinquency rate continues to grow faster than the rest \nof young people in America. Both Indian reservation and Bureau of \nIndian Affairs schools are severely underfunded from a programmatic \nstandpoint. These schools attempt to provide services to their children \nin spite of substandard facilities--facilities that no parent should \nhave to send their child to and that no teacher should have to work in. \nThese schools are understaffed and Indian educators are sorely \nunderpaid.\n  As this resolution makes clear, the United States has a moral and \nlegal obligation to provide or aid tribal governments in providing \nquality education to American Indian and Alaskan Native youth. This \nresponsibility is recognized in treaties, Executive orders, court \ndecisions, and statutes. Yet, the disturbing facts that I have just \nmentioned make it clear that this obligation is not being met. It is my \nhope that this resolution will be the first step in building awareness \nof the current state of Indian education that will allow us to focus on \na pragmatic solution.\n  The importance of Indian education cannot be overstated. It holds the \nkey to solving the most prevalent and devastating problems in Indian \ncountry: grinding poverty and the absence of opportunity for Indian \nyouth.\n  I am drafting legislation to address the unemployment problem on \nreservations by helping tribes create jobs and attract businesses. But \nin addition to a lack of capital and an abundance of regulatory \nobstacles, tribes face the challenge of filling jobs with trained \npeople. Education and job creation must go hand-in-hand if tribes are \nto improve the standard of living for their members. Only through \neducation will Indian tribes be able to solve problems such as \nunemployment, economic development, and achieving higher standards of \nliving.\n  At a recent Indian Affairs Committee hearing, a member of the Office \nof Juvenile Justice stated in his testimony that ``while violent crime \nis falling in American cities, it is rising on American Indian \nreservations.'' Additionally, a report released by the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Center reveals that over the past 5 years gang \nrelated crimes, in the form of drive-by-shootings and homicides, have \nincreased by more than 500 percent in some Indian communities. Mr. \nPresident, it must be understood that many of the problems facing \nIndian youth today center on the erosion of their culture. Too often, \nIndian children lack pride in who they are, where they live, and where \nthey come from. This lack of self-esteem has caused consequences that \nripple through the lives of Indian youth such as high drop-out rates \nand a growing juvenile delinquency and gang problem. As we resolve to \nbetter the quality of education for Indian children, we must strive to \ndo so while acknowledging the importance of promoting Indian culture.\n  Mr. President, as the 105th Congress proceeds, I urge my colleagues \nto join in supporting this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5944-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5944-S5945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        BENNETT AMENDMENT TO STATE DEPARTMENT AUTHORIZATION BILL\n\n   Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered by Senator Bennett, which urges the administration to enforce \nthe Gore-McCain Iran-Iraq Nonproliferation Act of 1992.\n  There is wide agreement among leaders in the Congress and the \nadministration that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \n[WMD] and advanced conventional weapons is one of the key national \nsecurity threats facing the United States today. In fact, in 1994, \nPresident Clinton issued Executive Order 12938 declaring that the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means of \ndelivering them constitutes ``an unusual and extraordinary threat to \nthe national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United \nStates,'' and that he had therefore decided to ``declare a national \nemergency to deal with that threat.'' The President reaffirmed this \nExecutive order in 1995 and 1996.\n  But despite declaring a national emergency, the administration has \nbeen unwilling to take actions which would reduce the threat we face, \nsuch as enforcement of the nonproliferation laws passed by the Congress \nand signed by the President. For example, the administration has \nrefused to invoke sanctions on China for the transfer of advanced C-802 \nantiship cruise missiles to Iran as required by the Gore-McCain \nNonproliferation Act of 1992. This act requires the United States to \nimpose sanctions on any entity that transfers ``goods or technology so \nas to contribute knowingly and materially to the efforts by Iran or \nIraq (or any agency or instrumentality of either such country) to \nacquire chemical, biological or nuclear weapons or to acquire \ndestabilizing numbers and types of advanced conventional weapons.''\n  The administration's failure to invoke sanctions as required by law \nis particularly disappointing in light of the statement then-Senator Al \nGore made on the Senate floor on October 17, 1991, about the need for \nstrong actions to combat proliferation. Mr. Gore urged governments \naround the world to make sales of sensitive technologies ``high crimes \nunder each country's legal system; to devote the resources necessary to \nfind those who have violated those laws or who are conspiring to \nviolate them, and to punish the violators so heavily as to guarantee \nthe personal ruin of those who are responsible, and to easily threaten \nthe destruction of any enterprise so engaged.''\n  In 1996, China sold C-802 antiship cruise missiles and fast-attack \npatrol boats to Tehran. The C-802 has a range of 120 km with a 165 kg \nwarhead and is especially lethal due to its ``over-the-horizon'' \ncapability. In an interview last year, Vice Adm. Scott Redd, commander \nof the U.S. Fifth Fleet expressed concern that the C-802 gave the \nIranian military increased firepower and represented a new dimension to \nthe threat faced by the U.S. Navy in the Persian Gulf.\n  On April 10, 1997, former U.S. Ambassador to China, James Lilley, \ntestified to the Senate that Iran planned to increase the survivability \nand mobility of its force of C-802's, by mounting some of the missiles \non trucks, which could use numerous caves along the gulf coast for \nconcealment. And just this morning, Secretary of Defense Cohen \nannounced that Iran had successfully tested an air-launched version of \nthe missile earlier this month.\n  Yet despite these facts, the administration has narrowly interpreted \nits legal obligations and has not invoked sanctions on China for the \nsale of these missiles to Iran. The administration concedes that the \nmissiles are advanced, but claims the sale was not destabilizing, \nthereby dodging the requirement to impose sanctions.\n  As we saw in 1987, when 37 sailors died from the impact of one \nmissile on the U.S.S. Stark, cruise missiles like the C-802 pose a \ndangerous threat to U.S. forces and our allies in the gulf. The \npresence of the U.S. Navy in and around the Persian Gulf is critical to \nthe fragile equilibrium of that region. Iran's possession of C-802 \ncruise missiles threatens this equilibrium and is clearly \ndestabilizing. As Secretary Cohen said this morning, ``Iran's word and \naction suggests that it wants to be able to intimidate neighbors and \ninterrupt commerce in the Gulf.''\n  Mr. President, the time has come for us to back up our words about \nthe terrible threat we face from weapons of mass destruction and \nadvanced conventional arms with actions. Actions that will reduce the \nthreat we face by punishing those countries that supply these dangerous \nweapons to irresponsible regimes like the one in Iran. We should begin \nby enforcing the nonproliferation laws currently in place. The \namendment sponsored by Senator Bennett is a meaningful step in the\n\n[[Page S5945]]\n\nright direction. I urge my colleagues to support its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5944-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ORDERS FOR JUNE 19, 1997\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

RES. 98\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, on June 12, Senator Hagel and I and other Senators \nintroduced Senate Resolution 98, expressing the sense of the Senate \nregarding the conditions of the United States becoming a signatory to \nany international agreement on greenhouse gas emissions under the U.N. \nconvention. On that same day, in addition to Senator Hagel and myself, \n44 Senators cosponsored that resolution, making the total 46.\n  Since that time, 14 additional Senators have indicated an interest in \nbeing cosponsors. So I will read their names shortly. But in addition \nto requesting a star print of Senate Resolution 98, I indicate for the \nRecord a substantive change in the resolution. It is required that \nthere be a substantive change in order for there to be a star print. I \nwant a star print to show the additional 14 Senators' names. The \nadditional names are: Senator Akaka, Senator Coats, Senator Cochran, \nSenator Domenici, Senator Gramm, Senator Grams, Senator Lott, Senator \nMoseley-Braun, Senator Robb, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Sessions, \nSenator Smith of New Hampshire, Senator Specter, and Senator Stevens.\n  Now, Mr. President, the substantive change would be in the form of an \nadditional ``whereas'' clause. I will read it:\n\n       Whereas, it is desirable that a bipartisan group of \n     Senators be appointed by the majority and minority leaders of \n     the Senate for the purpose of monitoring the status of \n     negotiations on global climate change and reporting \n     periodically to the Senate on those negotiations: Now, \n     therefore, be it''.\n\n  That is the new ``whereas'' clause, and those are the words that \nwould constitute the substantive change.\n  Therefore, I will ask unanimous consent that there be a star print of \nSenate Resolution 98 which will indicate the additional 14 Senators' \nnames and the additional whereas clause.\n  May I say, parenthetically, that I think it would be good for the \nadministration to know that there is an independent group of Senators \nwho have status, who have been authorized by the U.S. Senate to monitor \nthe developments and negotiations on global climate change, and who \nwill be authorized to report periodically back to the Senate concerning \nthose developments. That is the purpose of the additional clause, and \nI, therefore, make that request.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I will \nnot object--let me again thank the Senator from West Virginia for his \nleadership in this area and the refinement of this Senate resolution, \nwhat he is doing. What now 61 Senators are saying is that this is a \nvery, very important issue for this country, and to the world. And the \nSenate wants to be active players and observers in the development of \nthis potential treaty because ultimately it gets here to the floor of \nthe United States Senate for us to make that decision.\n  Senator Byrd has offered us tremendous leadership in this area. I \nthank him. Mr. President, I, too, know that you have become our leader \non this issue, and I appreciate that. Thank you.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Chair will momentarily indulge me, \nmay I say that the Presiding Officer of the Senate, Mr. Hagel, will be \nconducting the hearings on tomorrow by this subcommittee which he \nchairs, the subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee on this \nvery subject.\n  I urge Senators to follow the conduct of these hearings. It is my \nunderstanding, in talking with Senator Hagel that there will be \nsubsequent hearings tomorrow. These will be important hearings, and \nthere will be witnesses appearing who will have testimony that I think \nwill be worthwhile to the Senate as it proceeds on the course of \nfollowing the negotiations, having a voice in them, and, as it were, \nleaning over the shoulders of the administration as the negotiations \ntake place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of the resolution that \nthe distinguished Senator from West Virginia just spoke of. I applaud \nhim. I associate myself with the kind remarks that the Senator from \nIdaho made because it is a very forceful tool, and is a very badly \nneeded tool to make sure that our Constitution and our economy is \nprotected.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, if the Senator from Iowa will yield without \nlosing the right to the floor, let me also join him and the Senator \nfrom Idaho, and compliment the distinguished Chair, and my friend from \nWest Virginia, on what is attempted here.\n  I just watched the statement today that, if this Tokyo plan goes \nthrough, all of our energy generating facilities just go right across \nthe border to Mexico. They are excluded. So all our jobs will go down \nthere. All our electricity will come from there because they are \nexcluded and to the detriment of our people.\n  So I couldn't compliment the Senator from West Virginia more. He has \nbeen diligent in this, and I compliment him. And I just hope I can \nfollow his lead. So whatever he needs from me, let me know.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank both Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the previous \nunanimous-consent request is agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5945-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5945-S5947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DRUG FREE COMMUNITIES ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 65, H.R. 956.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 956) to amend the National Narcotics \n     Leadership Act of 1988 to establish a program to support and \n     encourage local communities that first demonstrate a \n     comprehensive, long-term commitment to reduce substance abuse \n     among youth, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today the Senate is giving final \napproval to the Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997. This bill will help \nprotect our children from the deadly danger of drugs. By approving this \nbill, we are putting more resources in the hands of those who are \nmaking a difference in the fight against drugs: parents, teachers, \ncoaches, and civic and religious leaders.\n  At the same time, though, the bill is fiscally responsible. In this \ntime of tight fiscal constraints, we have created a bill that does not \nincrease the Federal deficit by a single penny. The legislation simply \nredirects existing Federal funds from less productive areas of the drug \ncontrol budget to community-based anti-drug coalitions with proven \ntrack records in the fight against drugs. What's more, the bill \nrequires a financial commitment from communities that seek funds. The \nrequirement of matching grants will force the communities to \ndemonstrate an even greater commitment to fighting drug abuse before \nreceiving Federal funds.\n\n[[Page S5946]]\n\n  The Drug-Free Communities Act has attracted the support of more than \n150 State and local law enforcement groups, churches, and other \norganizations. On the national level, it has been endorsed by groups as \ndiverse as Mothers Against Drunk Drivers and William Bennett's Empower \nAmerica. In my own State, the South Dakota Department of Human Services \nand Siouxland Cares have also committed their support. As these \nendorsements suggest, this bill represents a wonderful opportunity to \nprovide meaningful help to community anti-drug coalitions in South \nDakota and throughout the country.\n  I am extremely pleased that my colleagues are supporting this \nlegislation to keep our children away from drugs, and drugs away from \nour children.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for bringing the Drug \nFree Communities Act to the floor today. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of this legislation--and I urge all my colleagues to support \nit today.\n  We face an epidemic of drug abuse in this country--particularly among \nchildren. Substance abuse by young people has more than doubled during \nthe past 5 years, and children are beginning to use drugs at younger \nages. This trend has major implications for public health, which \ninclude the dangers of long-term addiction and disease. There also are \ncosts to society as a whole in the form of poorer educational \nachievement, lost productivity, increased health care costs, and higher \nlevels of crime. The most important cost, however, is the tragic loss \nof the potential and aspirations of many of our young people.\n  During America's long fight against substance abuse, community-based \ncoalitions have offered a way to turn this situation around. These \ncoalitions have consistently shown that grassroots efforts to educate \nyoung people about the dangers of drug abuse do work. It is clear that \na Federal drug abuse strategy must complement and enhance community \nactions wherever possible.\n  Recognizing the success of community-based programs, the Drug Free \nCommunities Act will enhance programs that work by providing matching \ngrants to community coalitions with proven track records. This is a \nsensible approach, because it builds on the hard-won, practical \nexperience of people who have been in the forefront of the fight \nagainst substance abuse.\n  America's children are our most important resource, and substance \nabuse places them at great risk. The Drug Free Communities Act will \nenhance the ability of communities across the country to protect the \nhealth of their young people. This proposal has great potential for \nsuccess and deserves our wholehearted support.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to express support for the \nDrug-Free Communities Act and I would like to commend its sponsors, \nSenators Grassley, Daschle, DeWine, and D'Amato for their efforts in \ndeveloping this important legislation.\n  Unfortunately, a recent poll conducted by the Partnership for a Drug-\nFree America indicated that younger and younger children are using \ndrugs. This poll is only the latest evidence of a very disturbing trend \nof increasing drug use by young people. It is important that we act to \nstop drug use and to prevent the devastation that drug use will have on \nAmerica's young people.\n  The Drug-Free Communities Act is an important step in this effort. \nThis legislation provides local community groups, who have proven track \nrecords addressing teen drug use, with the funding they need to really \ncombat drug usage. The Drug-Usage Communities Act creates an advisory \ncommission, consisting of local community leaders, who will oversee the \nprogram and make sure that funds are directed to those groups that are \nsuccessful in fighting drug use by America's children. The act provides \nfunding only to those groups that can match the Federal dollars with \nnon-Federal funds, ensuring that viable community groups will \nparticipate in the program and sustain anti-drug efforts as the fight \ncontinues. Lastly, the Drug-Free Communities Act requires no new \nfunding. Funds will come from the $16 billion Federal drug control \nbudget.\n  This legislation is extremely important to the war on drugs. With the \nlatest news that our efforts are flagging, that children are giving in \nto the temptation of drugs, we must fight back. The drug dealers are \nnot waiting to approach our children, they never hesitate to make a \nsale. We cannot delay in fighting for them. We must reinvigorate the \neffort to protect our children. We must pass the Drug-Free Communities \nAct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I'm pleased that the Senate is turning \nits attention today to the Drug Free Communities Act. As a cosponsor of \nthis legislation, I want to thank Senator Grassley for his leadership \nin developing the bill and the chairman for agreeing to move it through \nthe committee expeditiously. This is an important bill for children and \ncommunities, and it deserves to be passed quickly and signed into law.\n  The Drug Free Communities Act will provide needed support to local \npartnerships, which play an important role in helping children and \nteens to resist drugs. My State of Wisconsin currently has 132 such \ncommunity-based partnerships--groups of parents, teachers, community \nand religious leaders, youth advocates, and others who come together to \nteach leadership skills and provide kids with alternative activities \nand opportunities.\n  In Marshfield, WI, for instance, the Wood County Partnership Council \nhas focused on activities to reduce drunk driving by teens. Programs \nsponsored by the council have included regional teen institutes, parent \nto parent workshops, and general prevention training of community \nmembers.\n  In Milwaukee, Neighborhood Partners has developed grassroots \nneighborhood organizations which focus on preventing substance abuse \nand drug-related crime. These organizations have helped to establish \nneighborhood watch programs, after school tutorial programs, and block \npatrols. Two years after founding this partnership, the personal \nproperty crime rate in the targeted area fell by 16 percent, as \ncompared with a Milwaukee-wide decrease of 12 percent.\n  These are the sorts of programs that might apply for funding under \nthe Drug Free Communities Act, in order to help support parents and \nother community volunteers reach more youths with their important \nmessages.\n  No new funds will be appropriated under H.R. 956. Instead, funding \nfor qualifying local partnerships will be diverted from the existing \n$16 billion drug control budget. In order to ensure that the coalitions \nreceiving these Federal dollars are sustainable, grants will be made \navailable only to broad-based, local partnerships that have been active \nfor at least 6 months, and are able to match their Federal awards \ndollar for dollar, with either cash or in-kind contributions.\n  Supporting locally-based prevention initiatives is a critical piece \nof a comprehensive drug control strategy. The Judiciary Committee, on \nwhich I sit, spends a good deal of time addressing issues of crime that \nstem from youth and adult drug use. I'm pleased that today the Senate \nis focusing, in a bipartisan way, on preventing the root cause of so \nmuch crime, by supporting parents and localities in their efforts to \nprevent youth drug use.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nplaced at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I will \nnot object--there is no objection on this side. I would like to note \nthat the distinguished Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, who is \nunable to be here this evening, is a cosponsor of this legislation and \nendorses it highly.\n  I have no objection.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I might go beyond that and say this has \nvery, very broad bipartisan support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 956) was passed.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed \nH.R. 956, the Drug Free Communities Act of 1997, today. Earlier this \nmonth, this same bill was approved by a vote of 420 to 1 in the other \nbody. As you know, I, along with 18 of my colleagues, introduced a \ncompanion version of this legislation in the Senate\n\n[[Page S5947]]\n\nearlier this year. By the close of business today, this legislation has \ngarnered a total of 29 cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, this is an outstanding show of support for this \nimportant piece of legislation. When each of us return home over \nrecess, we meet with the people that we represent. We listen to their \nproblems, and we listen to their solutions. And when we talk about \ndrugs, and talk about what can be done to keep our kids from using \ndrugs, it always comes back to the community. What matters most is what \nparents, schools, churches, law enforcement, community groups, and \nbusinesses do, working together, to keep our kids drug free.\n  This legislation will support these efforts. It will allow \ncommunities with established coalitions, coalitions that have a proven \ntrack record, to receive matching funds to support their efforts. It \nwill provide additional resources in the hands of those who make a \ndifference; people that our children respect and listen to: parents. \nPlacing resources at the community level allows parents, teachers, \ncommunity, and religious leaders to use these funds to make a \ndifference in the lives of our children, our future.\n  I want to thank my colleagues and co-sponsors on both sides of the \naisle. I particularly want to thank Senator Daschle, Senator DeWine, \nSenator Biden, and Senator Hatch and many others for their support and \nefforts in moving this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5945-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I would like to talk about the \nDepartment of Defense's [DOD] problem disbursements.\n  I have spoken on the subject many times in the past.\n  I would like to speak on it again today because the Pentagon's Chief \nFinancial Officer, or CFO, Mr. John Hamre, claims he's whipping the \nproblem.\n  His claims do not seem to stand up to scrutiny.\n  The GAO has issued a new report on DOD's problem disbursements. It is \nentitled ``Improved Reporting Needed For DOD Problem Disbursements.''\n  This report rips Mr. Hamre's claims to shreds.\n  In May 1996, Mr. Hamre claimed he had an $18 billion problem. Now, \nit's $8 billion and falling.\n  The GAO says Mr. Hamre is understating the problem by at least $25 \nbillion.\n  Mr. Hamre is blowing smoke to hide the problem.\n  He is falling back on the oldest trick in the bureaucrat's book: \nRedefine the problem to make it appear smaller.\n  He did it by administrative decree in December 1996.\n  His decree arbitrarily excludes huge chunks of problem disbursements \nfrom official reports to Congress.\n  He just waved his magic wand and shrunk the universe.\n  It is not smaller because he cleaned up the books or reconciled \ndelinquent accounts.\n  He did not do any oldtime bookkeeping to get the job done.\n  In fact, he did not get the job done. He just wants us to think the \ndid.\n  Mr. President, to understand what Mr. Hamre is up to, we need to \nunderstand problem disbursements. What are they, and why are they a \nproblem?\n  The GAO says there are three types of problem disbursements: in-\ntransit disbursements, unmatched disbursement, negative unliquidated \nobligations or NULO's.\n  An in-transit disbursement is one that is floating in limbo.\n  The check was written and the bill was paid. But the payment has not \nbeen posted to an account.\n  If Mr. Hamre were on the ball, there would be no in-transits. \nTransactions should be recorded as they occur. That's basic accounting \n101 stuff.\n  That's how businesses operate.\n  The Pentagon's accounting guru--Mr. Keevey--says that's the right way \nto do it. I quote Mr. Keevey:\n\n       Under a good finance and accounting network, you would \n     never make a payment until you check it against the \n     underlying obligation and the underlying records.\n\n  If DOD practiced what Mr. Keevey preaches, there would be no problem \ndisbursements. Period.\n  Congress has been telling DOD to do exactly the same thing every year \nfor the last 3 years.\n  Section 8106 of last year's appropriations bill says:\n\n       Match disbursements with obligations before making \n     payments.\n\n  But the bureaucrats complain: ``No can do. It's just too hard.''\n  They think it's normal for disbursements to float in limbo for up to \n120 days or even longer. For them, a disbursement floating in outer \nspace for 4 months is OK.\n  It's not a problem disbursement under Mr. Hamre's exclusion policy.\n  Here's a prime example of how well Mr. Hamre's policy works.\n  The GAO discovered, for example, that DOD excludes certain \n``recurring and routine'' transactions.\n  Mr. President, you should see what the GAO found in the Pentagon's \n``recurring and routine'' basket?\n  The GAO discovered $4.5 billion of payroll disbursements from \nautomated teller machines or ATM's that were once located on Navy \nships.\n  They just weren't very fresh.\n  They were so old that their points of origin had disappeared off the \nface of the Earth. The ships that carried the ATM's have been \ndecommissioned.\n  Time passed them by.\n  Most of these ATM transactions were at least 2 years old but some \ndated back to January 1988, or 9 years ago.\n  To the average citizen, a check that is not recorded in a checkbook \nregister for 9 years just might be a problem.\n  But not to Mr. Hamre.\n  He says it's ``normal and routine'' for a disbursement to float \naround in outer space for 9 years. ``It's OK. It doesn't count. Not to \nworry.''\n  Unmatched disbursements are more troublesome than in-transits.\n  When in-transits finally reach the accountant's desk, the accountant \ntries to match the disbursement with its corresponding obligation.\n  An obligation is like a contractual commitment of money.\n  When a corresponding obligation cannot be identified, you have a \nproblem--an unmatched disbursement.\n  In some cases, the hookup is made. Sometimes it takes months or even \nyears. And sometimes, the match is never made.\n  That's an unmatchable disbursement.\n  That happens when supporting documentation has disappeared.\n  When you have a check and no supporting documentation, you have a hot \npotato.\n  That's a problem, Mr. President. It's a big problem for anyone \nresponsible for controlling public money.\n  CFO Hamre found a quick and easy cure for this ugly wart. He just \nlopped it off.\n  In 1995, he literally wrote off billions of dollars in unmatchable \ndisbursements.\n  He just wiped them clean off the books. Problem solved.\n  When Mr. Hamre did this, I came to the floor and criticized him for \ndoing it. I thought it set a terrible precedent.\n  Maybe Mr. Hamre had no choice, but when you write off billions of \ndollars of disbursements, some heads should roll. And it should never \nhappen again.\n  Sadly, no one was held accountable.\n\n[[Page S5948]]\n\n  The third category of problem disbursements are NULO's.\n  With a NULO, you get a quick match, but there is not enough money in \nthe account to cover the check. It is overdrawn.\n  That could be a violation of the Anti-Deficiency Act, and that's a \nfelony.\n  There is a fourth category of problem disburements that DOD doesn't \nreport. I did not mention it up front because it is not official. It \nwas invented by the Senator from Iowa.\n  I call it mismatched disbursements.\n  I have spoken about Mr. Hamre's illegal progress payment policy \nseveral times this year.\n  Under the Hamre policy, checks are deliberately charged to the wrong \naccounts. That creates a mismatch.\n  It is a mismatched disbursement.\n  A mismatched disbursement is the flip side of an unmatched \ndisbursement. It is a problem disbursement, for sure.\n  Mr. Hamre's progress payment scheme is producing a whole new category \nof problem disbursements.\n  And he doesn't even know it.\n  DOD makes over $20 billion a year in progress payments.\n  If most are mismatched--as I suspect--then DOD's problem \ndisbursements exceed the $45 billion figure cited by the GAO.\n  If this were a $1 million problem, I might not worry so much.\n  Unfortunately, billions of dollars of public money could be at risk. \nWe just don't know--until DOD gets a good match.\n  When you have billions of dollars in checks with no documentation and \nyou're writing them off right and left, your accounts are vulerable to \ntheft.\n  As CFO, Mr. Hamre is accountable for this mess.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Hamre has been selected by Secretary Cohen to fill \nthe No. 2 spot at the Pentagon.\n  He would become the Deputy Secretary of Defense. That's a big job.\n  I am opposed to this nomination.\n  I will have much more to say about Mr. Hamre in the weeks ahead.\n  Mr. President, I want to be sure my colleagues understand where I am \ncoming from.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5947-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5948-S5949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CHIEF JUDGE KAZEN, U.S. DISTRICT COURT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to briefly address an issue \nI talked about already on June 5. I want to clarify the record \nregarding an inaccurate Washington Post front-page story on Chief U.S. \nDistrict Judge George P. Kazen of the southern district of Texas.\n  To refresh your memory, the Post reported on May 15 of this year that \nJudge Kazen had stated he was overworked, couldn't manage his caseload \nand needed more judges. The article then more than implied there was a \nbacklog in his district and there was a crisis across the Nation which \nwas created by the Judiciary Committee playing politics at the cost of \njustice.\n  I had hoped we were done talking about that example of inaccurate and \nmisleading reporting, but judging by a remark made Monday here on the \nfloor, I must reiterate what I already said on June 5: there is no \nbacklog in the southern district of Texas, the article III judges of \nthat district, and of most districts of the country, for that matter, \nassure me that they can handle their caseloads just fine.\n  I noticed my colleague Senator Leahy used this article Monday to once \nagain complain about the pace of confirmations. Unfortunately, he has \nalso become a victim of that misguided article.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight \nand the Courts, I felt compelled to come before my colleagues and set \nthe record straight on the southern district of Texas. Therefore, on \nJune 5, I gave you the applicable statistics for the district and I \ngave you the responses my 1996 survey produced for that district. As \nyou might recall, in an effort to keep the lines of communication open \nbetween this Congress and the judicial branch, I sent a comprehensive \nsurvey to all article III judges last year. Some of the questions in \nthe survey addressed precisely this issue of a backlog. I said on June \n5 and I'll repeat it today, both my survey and my communications with \nour Federal judges clearly show that there is no backlog and that a \nvast majority of the judges in the southern district of Texas, one of \nthe largest and busiest in the Nation, can more than aptly manage their \ncaseload. By the way, the same holds true for the Nation in general.\n\n  When I spoke to you on June 5, I wondered how come Judge Kazen would \nturn to the Washington Post and create such a different impression from \nwhat my research, my figures, and, most importantly, my communications \nwith our Federal judges indicated. Well, it turns out that Judge Kazen \nwas as surprised by the article as I was. You see, I just received a \nletter from Judge Kazen on June 6 and it has now become clear that \nJudge Kazen is as much a victim of inaccurate reporting as everyone who \nended up reading that article is. According to Judge Kazen, he only \ntalked to the reporter regarding his district's contemplation to move \nthe home seat of a judicial vacancy from Houston to either Laredo or \nMcAllen.\n  Incidently, the vacancy Judge Kazen was talking about has been around \nsince 1990. It therefore appears that my Democratic colleagues, who are \nso quick to cry ``politics'' when the Judiciary Committee dares to \nscrutinize a Clinton nominee, had ample opportunity to fill that seat \nand for one reason or another they chose not to do so.\n  Judge Kazen insists in his letter that while the article ultimately \nquoted him as speaking about judicial vacancies, the conversation he \nhad with the reporter was solely on the proposed move of the future \njudge's home seat. Judge Kazen further states that the article's focus \non filling vacancies was never the focus of his conversation with the \nPost reporter. If mentioned at all, it was nothing more than a passing \nreference. Judge Kazen, in his letter to me, is adamant that he never \ndescribed ``any caseload as being unmanageable.''\n  Therefore, not Judge Kazen, but the Washington Post used this one \nexample to complain of backlog and unmanageable caseloads. Mr. \nPresident, the vast majority of the judges who have responded to my \nsurvey, who have written me letters, who have called my offices, or who \nhave come before the Judiciary Committee or my subcommittee are not \nbacklogged and are quite able to manage their caseloads. Judge Kazen's \nletter to me underscores that fact, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                   Southern District of Texas,\n\n                                                     June 6, 1997.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \n         Courts,\n     Senate Hart Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: Your letter of May 30, 1997, prompts \n     me to seek clarification of what issues you believe that I \n     raised in the Washington Post article of May 15. That article \n     was the result of a telephone call in April from a Texas \n     reporter working for the Post. She inquired about a letter I \n     had written in February to the Democratic members of Congress \n     from southern Texas. The letter had apparently been released \n     to the media by one or more of the recipients, as it had \n     already been the subject of press reports in Texas.\n       The purpose of my letter was to advise the Representatives \n     that our Court was contemplating a request to the Judicial \n     Council of the Fifth Circuit that the home seat of the judge \n     who would eventually succeed former Chief Judge Norman Black \n     be moved from Houston to either Laredo or McAllen. The \n     possibility of such a move had been discussed off and on \n     during 1996, but no action had been taken. We knew that this \n     position would not be filled immediately, and we could have \n     deferred action until later. However, we learned in February \n     that the Representatives were meeting soon to recommend a \n     nominee to the White House. They were doing so under the \n     natural assumption that the person would sit in Houston. We \n     decided that basic fairness required us to at least alert the \n     Representatives to our plan.\n       The letter advised that the Court would ``probably'' \n     request the move and that our final decision would be made at \n     a meeting of the full Court in May. The letter stated in \n     general terms why we were taking this step. This included the \n     fact that the four ``border'' divisions of our Court have \n     long borne the burden of one of the heaviest criminal dockets \n     in this country. We advised that scores of new Border Patrol \n     agents are scheduled for assignment to Laredo and the Rio \n     Grande Valley this year, along with projected increases of \n     other law enforcement agents. We concluded that many more \n     agents inevitably will lead to more arrests and more \n     prosecutions in our southern divisions. At least, this\n\n[[Page S5949]]\n\n     should be the result if the agents do what they are hired to \n     do.\n       The letter also advised that, for the first time in over \n     twenty years, the chief judgeship of the Court had moved \n     outside Houston. Under our seniority system, it will remain \n     outside Houston for at least the next twenty years. The chief \n     judge has typically been required to take a reduced docket to \n     attend to the administration of this vast district, which \n     consists of seven divisions spread over some 44,000 square \n     miles.\n       The Post reporter had called to ask about the status of \n     this matter. I told her that our plan was still on course. I \n     never described any caseload as being ``unmanageable.'' In \n     response to her questions about the reason for our decision, \n     however, I did try to explain the special pressures caused by \n     an unrelenting criminal docket and why our judges felt the \n     move was appropriate.\n       I realize that the Post article ultimately focused on \n     filling vacancies, but that was not the focus of our \n     conversation. If that topic was mentioned at all, which I \n     cannot recall, it would have been a passing reference to the \n     fact that we have a very old vacancy which we hope can be \n     filled this year. The portions of the article actually \n     quoting me are addressed to the issue of why our Court is \n     seeking to move a judgeship away from Houston. It is our \n     belief that this move is an internal judicial issue, governed \n     by 28 U.S.C. Sec. 134(c). If I am mistaken in this regard, or \n     if your subcommittee has concerns about it, I will try to \n     assemble whatever data might be relevant, although this \n     proposal is based to some extent on our best estimate as to \n     the situation as we expect it to be whenever that new judge \n     would be confirmed.\n       It does not surprise me that some of my colleagues reported \n     to you that their dockets were manageable. It is precisely \n     for this reason that the Houston judges have supported me in \n     the effort described above. Their support is based on certain \n     assumptions. First, we are assuming that Senior Judge Norman \n     Black will be able and willing to carry at least a fifty \n     percent caseload in Houston for the next several years. From \n     June 1992 until December 1996, we had only one senior judge. \n     That was Judge Hugh Gibson, who was helping with Judge Sam \n     Kent's unusually large civil docket in Galveston. Judge \n     Gibson became seriously ill last year and is only now \n     beginning to attempt a comeback. Second, Judge John Rainey \n     has currently been working in three divisions--Houston, \n     Laredo and Victoria. Whenever the new judge arrives, Judge \n     Rainey would drop Laredo and take a larger portion of the \n     Houston docket. We think this is a positive step. Travelling \n     between two divisions is not efficient; travelling among \n     three divisions is grossly inefficient, especially when those \n     three divisions stretch over 300 miles. Third, we are hoping \n     that the Houston filings will not drastically increase during \n     the next several years. If any of these assumptions prove \n     untrue, we may well have to go back to the proverbial drawing \n     board.\n       I am attaching a newspaper report that a ``record-setting \n     number of U.S. Border Patrol recruits'' are currently \n     undergoing basic training, to be assigned along the Mexican \n     border. Forty-two of these persons are scheduled for the \n     Laredo Sector and 133 for the McAllen Sector. We understand \n     that increases in other law enforcement agencies, together \n     with United States Attorneys, are also planned.\n       In 1996, the criminal filings in the four ``border'' \n     divisions (Laredo, McAllen, Brownsville, Corpus Christi) were \n     1239, compared with 1069 in 1995, a 16% increase. As of May \n     31, the 1997 criminal filings in these divisions are 206 in \n     Brownsville, 130 in Corpus Christi, 175 in Laredo, and 158 in \n     McAllen. These are the results of five months of grand jury \n     work. Projecting those figures over 12 months would yield \n     filings of 494, 312, 420 and 379 respectively. This would \n     make a total of 1605, a 29% increase over 1996. These \n     projections do not consider that, as far as I know, few if \n     any of the new law enforcement agents are actually in place \n     yet. Also, these statistics refer to cases, not defendants. \n     Many of these criminal cases, especially narcotics cases, \n     involve multiple defendants. For example, the 1239 cases \n     filed in the four divisions in 1996 involved 1884 defendants. \n     I am currently processing a single case with 22 defendants. \n     These projections also do not consider any civil filings.\n       The step our court is proposing is, in my opinion, sound \n     management and would increase organizational efficiency. I \n     would hope that you would applaud our effort to place our \n     resources where the demand is, since I believe that you have \n     previously encouraged the Judiciary to consider precisely \n     this type of move.\n       Despite the fact that I was not discussing the issue of \n     vacancies with the Post reporter, I do not wish to imply that \n     I am disinterested in that issue. Chief Justice Rehnquist and \n     many others more eloquent and prominent than I have spoken \n     often on the subject. In addition to the new vacancy created \n     by Judge Black, we have a vacancy that has existed since \n     1990. The nominee currently before the Senate is the third \n     person either nominated or recommended for this position, \n     going back to President Bush. The current candidate was first \n     nominated in late 1995, if I am not mistaken. She was \n     renominated earlier this year. This person is scheduled to \n     sit in Brownsville. As you can see, we are conservatively \n     projecting almost 500 criminal filings in that division this \n     year, apart from any civil filings. The new judge and the \n     incumbent, Filemon Vela, were also due to help Judge Ricardo \n     Hinojosa, who sits alone in McAllen. As far as I know, no one \n     has ever advised our Court that there was any doubt about the \n     need for this position. In fact, based on our statistics, the \n     Judicial Conference of the United States recently recommended \n     that still another judge be added to our Court. The 1996 \n     Biennial Judgeship Survey supporting this request is \n     attached. I am also attaching our latest Magistrate Judge \n     Survey, dated December 1994, prepared by the Administrative \n     Office of the United States Courts, and the 1996 statistics \n     showing the significant amount of work done by our magistrate \n     judges.\n       Ours is a hard-working, very productive Court, which closed \n     almost 13,000 cases last year, in addition to almost 4500 \n     petty criminal cases closed by our magistrate judges. We \n     realize that we will not get Judge Black's successor, much \n     less a new position, anytime soon. However, we believe it is \n     critical that at least our 1990 vacancy be filled in the \n     reasonably near future. Judge Vela will be taking senior \n     status within three years, and we must have a judge with some \n     judicial experience in Brownsville before the vacancy cycle \n     begins anew.\n       I hope this letter is helpful. I would be happy to discuss \n     this situation with you at your convenience.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     George P. Kazen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/18/senate-section/article/S5948-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
