As a \nreminder to all Members, under a previous order, a cloture vote on the \ntobacco committee substitute will occur at 2:15 p.m. today. Members \nhave until 12:30 p.m. in order to file second-degree amendments.

Therefore, rollcall votes can be \nexpected this morning prior to the recess for the party caucuses to \nmeet. If the first cloture motion is not invoked--and I expect it will \nnot be--I will be consulting with the minority leader for the timing \nwith regard to the second cloture vote, which would occur some time on \nWednesday. It could occur on Wednesday morning, but it will depend on \nother developments in the interim. Also during today's session, the \nSenate may consider any legislative or executive items cleared for \naction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess from 12:30 \np.m. until 2:15 to allow for the weekly party caucuses to meet.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I understand that the order of business \nis the amendment that I and Senator Craig and Senator Abraham have made \nto the tobacco legislation; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2451\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in the closing hours of debate last \nweek, I was somewhat----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Parliamentary inquiry. I thought I was recognized and \nwas asked to yield so that the clerk could report. Do I understand that \nI lost the floor and the Chair recognized another Senator?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order was the reporting of the \nbill, at which point recognition was then available. It was at that \npoint I recognized the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Further parliamentary inquiry. Since I was recognized by \nthe Chair, could I retain my right to continue to address the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order was to report the bill, and \nat that time recognition was sought by the Senator from Georgia, and he \nwas recognized.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as I was saying, when the debate was \nclosing, several Senators acknowledged the importance of drug abuse, \nteenage drug addiction, but thought that, we are suggesting, this was \nnot necessarily the appropriate time to do it, which I take great \nexception to.\n  I think this is exactly the time to do it. I think that it sends the \nwrong message for us to be talking about teenage addiction and wrap our \narms around it like it is only involved in tobacco.\n  About 14,000 teenagers die from drug addiction every year. And, as I \nwill enumerate in a bit, teenagers, parents, our society in general \nview the No. 1 teenage addiction problem as drugs.\n  Tobacco is a problem and tobacco use among teenagers has increased by \n40 percent. Drug abuse among teenagers has increased by 135 percent in \nthe last 6 years. The figures used last week were that 400,000 people, \naccording to CDC, die each year of smoking-related illnesses. We are \ndissecting those numbers. I do not dispute them. But the point I make, \nMr. President, is that of course this is of the entire population. You \ncan't just measure the effects of teenage drug abuse by measuring the \ndeaths. Fourteen thousand young people die each year, but the societal \ncost of drugs to our society are just staggering.\n  Illegal drugs, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, \nrepresents $67 billion in an annual drain on the United States. \nAccording to the University of Southern California, it is $76 billion. \nAnd 80 percent of all prisoners, whether they are in a local jail or \nFederal prison, today are there on drug-related charges--direct or \nindirect.\n  When you look at the scope of the prison population in the United \nStates today, you might as well look at it and say, well, there is the \ndrug-related causes. It is a staggering sum of money. And it produces--\nremembering that those folks who finally find their way to prison are \nbut a dot on the map as compared to the incidents related to this--\nthese are the handful that the system finally ensnares and gets in \nprison and is not even a measure of all which has occurred and who have \nnot been apprehended or somehow interacted with the system and never \nended up in prison.\n  We have had a lot of discussions in here of late about violence among \nteenagers. Our young society is becoming more violent. It is directly \nrelated to an increasing consumption and use of drugs by our younger \npopulation. It is an epidemic of enormous proportions, and the reach of \nit is stunning and staggering.\n  I guess where the other side was headed was that the cost of \nconfronting teenage drug addiction would somehow interfere with the \nattack on the teenage smoke addiction. First of all, over 25 years, if \nfully appropriated, this amendment would use 14 percent of the funds \nraised through the tax hike the other side envisions. Over 10 years, \nthis amendment would consume 23 percent and, over 5 years, 23 percent, \nin rounded off figures; over 25 years, 14 percent; over 10 years and 5 \nyears, about 23 percent.\n  If we are using 23 percent of the funds--and by anyone's measure, it \nis the No. 1 problem--if you want to reduce it to financial \nmeasurements, it is an equal problem. The cost to American society is \nas great on the drug side as it is on the tobacco side. The perception \nof parents, families, and teenagers is that it is a far greater \nproblem, and in the data we have before us, it is an equal financial \nproblem. So, why in the world would we ever come down here and talk \nabout teenage addiction and not talk about the No. 1 problem--a problem \ncausing massive violence, total disruption, and a financial partner to \nthe costs of tobacco?\n  This is how public schoolteachers rate the top disciplinary problems: \nNo. 1, drug abuse; No. 2, alcohol abuse; No. 3, pregnancy; No. 4, \nsuicide; No. 5, rape; No. 6, robbery; and No. 9, addiction. I point out \nthat the No. 1 problem is probably driving all the others--robbery, \nassault, and the others.\n  A national survey of American attitudes in substance abuse: What is \nthe most important problem facing people your age?--that is, the thing \nwhich concerns you the most. That was the question raised for 1996 and \n1995. No. 1, 31 percent--one out of three--drugs; No. 2, social \npressures; No. 3, crime and violence in school. Not that it is \nrelevant, but after you go through 10 or 12 different items, teenage \nsmoking is never raised at all. That is among students. That is what \nstudents say.\n  What do the parents say when asked the same question? No. 1, drugs; \nNo. 2, social pressure; No. 3, crime and violence in school. It goes \nall the way down to getting a job, problems at home. At no time do the \nteenagers or the parents raise the question of smoking as a serious \nproblem for teenagers.\n  I don't agree with them. I think teenage smoking is a serious \nproblem, a very serious problem. The point is that the most important \nproblem is drug abuse, teenage drug addiction.\n  Let me read from the startling results of the 1995 CASA survey of \nteens. Illegal drugs were cited as the most serious problem teens face, \nfar above any other concern, well ahead of the 14 percent who cite \nsocial pressures. This question was open ended, meaning respondents \nwere not provided with a list of possible responses, and it was asked \nearly in the interview before any other question raised, the issue of \nillegal drugs.\n  While responses to this question do not strongly correlate with the \nteen risk score, those who cite drugs as their biggest concern are no \nless at risk than the average teen. Some interesting patterns do \nemerge. Teens who cite doing well in school as their biggest concern \nare less at risk than other kids. They are more concerned with doing \nwell in school, and it keeps their minds attending to other things.\n\n  As I said a moment ago, according to the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation, the total economic cost of drug abuse is valued at $67 \nbillion annually in 1990, up $23 billion from 1985. Research at the \nUniversity of Southern California using the same methodology estimated \nthe economic costs of drug abuse at $76 billion, up more than $30 \nbillion from 1985.\n  I don't know the final disposition of this tobacco legislation. I \nkind of divide the debate into two camps; there is a health-related \ncamp and a revenue-related camp. I am very concerned with the revenue-\nrelated camp, but it is my intention and I think the intention of \nseveral other members, we are not going to debate the tobacco addiction \nwithout including a strong and forceful statement on the issue of \nteenage drug addiction, the reason being, again, that teenage drug \naddiction is the No. 1 problem being faced by teenagers. It is an equal \npartner, in the context of social costs to our society, as tobacco. \nParents, teenagers, science-based institutions, law enforcement \nofficers--you can go anywhere in the country, any community, and ask \nthem what the No. 1 problem going on here is, and they will say it is \ndrugs, it is drugs.\n  I had an Atlanta city traffic judge call on me a couple weeks ago. I \ndidn't know exactly why he wanted to visit. He came into the office. \nThe first words out of his mouth were, ``Senator, drugs are burning the \nheart out of America.'' He said, ``I see it every day, and it is \ngetting worse by the second, and we're not fighting it, we're not \ntaking it on. If we don't, it will ruin our country.''\n  Mr. President, this is the time and the exact moment, and appropriate \nin\n\n[[Page S5739]]\n\nevery other way, to bring to the forefront what drugs are doing to \nAmerica's teenagers, what drugs are doing to America. As we make a \nconscious decision to deal with the health issues affecting America's \nteenagers, it is absolutely appropriate we talk about tobacco. We need \nto get at it. It is a very unhealthy habit, and it can be exceedingly \ncostly. Teenage drug abuse has the same effect, and I might add that \nsmoking marijuana as compared to smoking cigarettes is five times more \ndeadly, five times more deadly.\n  With that opening statement, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I regret enormously not just the amendment \nof the Senator from Georgia, which I know is well-intentioned, and I \nknow his efforts on narcotics are sincere, but the entire panoply of \namendments that are coming forward on the Republican side are--at least \nin my judgment, and I think in the judgment of many other Senators--\ncalculated not to fundamentally improve the bill but to kill this bill. \nAnd there are provisions in here which have very little to do with drug \nfighting--a voucher provision to allow any Federal education funds to \npay the tuition of victims for a religious school or for a private \nschool. Boy, there is one we have spent a lot of time on under the \nbanner of education in the U.S. Senate, which we know to be \nfundamentally controversial in the Senate. That is here in this bill \nfor the purpose of reducing the number of kids smoking.\n  What really disturbs me about it--and I think I have been involved in \nthe drug fight as long as anybody in the Senate, since I first came \nhere. I led the effort to try to expose what was happening with our \nloose borders during all of the efforts to fund the Contras, the \nnarcotics that were flowing through Central America. I have led efforts \nto put 100,000 cops on the streets of America. We now have that \nhappening. Everybody who fought against it was the first to go out and \ncampaign in their districts, saluting the virtues of community \npolicing. Senator Biden and others helped design and fight the 1986 and \n1988 drug bills that we passed. There have been many efforts here. \nThere is a sincere effort in the Senate to try to deal with drugs.\n  But to suggest that we now ought to make the drug effort competitive \nwith the drug effort is rather remarkable to me. What do I mean by \nthat? Well, to stop kids from smoking is part of the drug effort. There \nisn't anybody who doesn't say that smoking isn't sort of the gateway to \nmarijuana and other drugs, and marijuana a gateway to cocaine, and so \nforth. If you treat--as we want to in this legislation--tobacco as the \naddictive substance that it is, that kills people, and recognize that \nthis legislation seeks to give broad authority to the FDA in order to \nbe able to regulate tobacco, then the question ought to be asked: Why \nare we setting it up so that we have this competition between the \neffort to stop kids from smoking and the effort to fight drugs? Let's \ngo to the violent crime trust fund. Let's go to a host of other arenas \nand do some of the things that the Senator from Georgia is talking \nabout.\n  But that is not really what is going on here. What is really going on \nhere is the piling on of amendments that are calculated to kill the \nbill to stop kids from smoking. What is going on here is a group of \npeople who are doing the bidding of the billions of dollars that are \nbeing spent on all of the advertising in the country, to somehow \nsuggest to people that this bill is overweighted or that this bill is a \ntax bill--all the things that this bill is not.\n  The tobacco companies agreed to raise the price of cigarettes. The \ntobacco companies are settling in State after State; they are agreeing, \nand they agreed originally in the national settlement, that the price \nof cigarettes ought to be raised. The tobacco companies agreed to do \nthat. But the great fear-mongering that is going on, to the tune of \nmillions of dollars being spent on all of these radio advertisements \nand television advertisements around the country, is to try to scare \nthe American people, because people want to help the tobacco companies \nand do the bidding of the tobacco companies.\n\n  The tobacco companies contribute an awful lot of money to campaigns. \nThe tobacco companies are a powerful lobby in this country, and the \ntobacco companies are working their will hard to try to convince people \nthat this bill is somehow against the public interest. What is against \nthe public interest, Mr. President, is an effort to stall this bill in \nthe U.S. Senate. What is against the public interest is a willingness \nto somehow see this bill die and forget about the fact that 400,000 of \nour fellow citizens die every year as a result of smoking.\n  The cost to America of smoking is far, far greater than any cost in \nthis bill. I heard the majority leader say over the weekend that this \nbill is going to die under the weight of amendments. Well, they are not \nDemocrat amendments, they are Republican amendments--amendment after \namendment--that are coming, trying to weigh this bill down. Everybody \nknows that some of the amendments that may have passed are going to be \nfixed in conference--if we can ever have a conference. Everyone \nunderstands that if this bill is given an opportunity to breathe, if it \ngoes out of the Senate and ultimately the House passes a bill, there is \ngoing to be a very significant negotiation and a very significant \nrewrite of whatever is to leave the U.S. Senate.\n  The effort here is to prevent something from leaving the U.S. Senate, \nand it is to prevent it from leaving the Senate by doing everything \nexcept paying attention to kids who are smoking. I have heard \nRepublicans come to the floor and criticize the amount of money that is \nin this bill and the pot that is being used in order to stop kids from \nsmoking. They say, isn't it terrible, here is this big pot of money, \nand all the Democrats want to do is spend it on some program. Well, the \nprogram happens to be counteradvertising to stop kids from smoking; it \nhappens to be a cessation program, proven to work, which involves young \npeople directly in the effort to try to make better choices other than \nsmoking. What do they want to do? They want to come and spend the money \non something that has nothing to do with trying to stop kids from \nsmoking--nothing at all.\n  Their alternative is to fix the marriage penalty. Many of us on this \nside of the aisle want to fix that, Mr. President. The question is, \nWhat is an appropriate amount of money to take out of this bill, and \nwhat is the impact on a whole lot of other things that matter? The \nfunding of this bill that the Coverdell amendment would strip away \nreaches 5 million smokers who would receive cessation services. And 90 \npercent of young people, age 12 to 17--more than 20 million people--\nwould be exposed to effective counteradvertising that would discourage \nthem from taking up cigarette smoking. And 50 million children would \ntake part in school-based prevention programs, and all 50 States would \nimplement comprehensive State-based prevention programs in order to \nstop underage smoking and support laws that prohibit the sale of \ntobacco products to minors and develop culturally sensitive preventive \nprograms.\n  All of those would be threatened if the Coverdell amendment passed. \nThey would be threatened because the Coverdell amendment wants to take \nmore than half of the money allocated to those efforts and put it into \nthe drug war, the Coast Guard, and into vouchers, into a set of things \nthat, as worthy as some may be, would wind up totally negating the \npurpose of the health portion of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, this legislation has traveled, obviously, a very \ndifficult road. But it is clear that the intent of a number of these \namendments coming from the Republican side is calculated not to \nlegitimately improve the bill, not to figure out, OK, which one of \nthese cessation programs works the best? Do some States have a better \nmodel than others? If so, why don't we try to support those models \nmore? Why don't we get more specific about diverting some of this money \ninto a very specific set of counteradvertising efforts that we know \nwork better? Some of those kinds of things might be very legitimate \napproaches to improving the bill. But to come in and say, no, we are \ngoing to take more than half of the money and just give it to the \nmarriage penalty, and we are going to take some more money and give it \nto the Coast Guard and other antidrug efforts. Worthy as those may be, \nas I say, you wind\n\n[[Page S5740]]\n\nup stripping away completely the capacity to do what a lot of States \nare struggling to do and what the health community of this country has \nadvised us again and again is critical that we do if we are going to \nstop kids from smoking. That is what this bill is about. Somehow, a lot \nof colleagues seem prepared to simply trample on that. No one disputes \nthe notion that somewhere in the vicinity of 3,000 kids, every single \nday, start smoking.\n  No one has come to the floor and been able to dispute the testimony \nof the tobacco companies themselves who acknowledge that raising the \nprice is a critical component of reducing the accessibility of \ncigarettes to teenagers. Nobody has any counterevidence to that. But \nthey simply come down and try to pile on the notion that this bill is \nsomehow too big.\n  Mr. President, in the tobacco bill we have an expert designed \napproach to try to provide smoking cessation programs for 5 million \nAmericans. That is an effort to try to give a second chance to some 5 \nmillion Americans. There are 45- to 50 million Americans who are hooked \non cigarettes. How can you come down here and suggest you are going to \ntake half the money that is directed towards 5 million of the 45- to 50 \nmillion Americans and say you are improving things with respect to the \nhealth of the country or with respect to young people's introduction to \nan addictive substance that kills them?\n  There is a total contradiction here in coming down and saying what we \nhave to do is stop cocaine and stop heroin, whatever substance you are \ntrying to stop from coming in with interdiction by beefing up the Coast \nGuard or beefing up Customs, all of which we ought to do, but doing it \nat the expense of stopping kids already in this country from smoking \ncigarettes which are already in this country when we know we have the \nability to stop them from doing that.\n  I don't doubt the urgency the Senator from Georgia applies to the \ndrug war. I have been the first to say we haven't been fighting it \nadequately, but I am not going to suggest that we ought to be robbing \nPeter to pay Paul, that we ought to be stealing from these kids in \norder to somehow beef up the Coast Guard. That doesn't make sense, \nparticularly since cigarettes are the entryway to the very drugs that \nthe Senator from Georgia wants to stop coming in.\n  So let's find that money. But let's find it in an appropriate place \nwithout gutting the cessation, counter advertising and other kinds of \nefforts that are contained in here to try to stop our own children from \nsmoking in our own country and from getting hold of the cigarettes that \nare manufactured here that are already here and that kill them here. \nWhat is the common sense in coming down here and stripping away all of \nthat to suggest somehow--Do you know what this is? This is, ``Let's \ngive the Senate a tough vote. Let's make it hard for people to vote \nagainst drug control, and we can strip away a little bit of the bill \nand strip away a little more.'' And indeed it will be overweighted in \nprecisely the way the majority leader suggests because the entire guts \nof the bill will have been ripped out. That is what we are really \ntalking about.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that hopefully colleagues will \nrecognize that the crunch time is coming on whether or not we are going \nto try to find the bipartisan collegiality to try to legitimately \nimprove this bill or whether people are just determined to kill it. If \nthey kill it, it will be clear to every American why and how it \nhappened and who did it.\n  That is the choice here. If we want to legitimately restrain what \nsome people on the other side think might be an aberration in terms of \na particular choice of spending as to how you stop kids from smoking, \nthen surely we can find a better way to help stop those kids from \nsmoking.\n  There is a clear distinction between the legitimate effort to try to \ndo that and the efforts that we are seeing on the floor, which are to \nstrip away all the funds altogether and put them into things that have \nnothing to do with stopping kids from smoking, nothing to do with \nhelping kids to be able to build the character and the value system \nnecessary to empower them to be able to say no to cigarettes. If you \ncan't say no to cigarettes, you are going to have a real hard time \nsaying no to the marijuana, or to the cocaine, or to whatever it is \nthat might flow at a later date. These are directly related.\n\n  My hope is that we will recognize the real choices of what lies in \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for the last several days we have \nattempted to find a way to get around the impasse we have experienced. \nI am disappointed that we haven't made more progress, and it was only \nwith the frustration which I had experienced that we were led to file \ncloture on two occasions last week.\n  Our desire to come to some closure on this bill and on the amendments \nthat are pending could not be greater. We have no reservations and no \nobjections to having a vote on the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Texas, Senator Gramm, or the amendment offered by the Senator from \nGeorgia, Senator Coverdell. What we would like, however, is the \nopportunity to offer similar amendments that deal with the same issue \nat approximately the same time. Let's have an amendment offered by our \nRepublican colleagues. Then let's have an amendment by our Democratic \ncolleagues. Let's go back and forth as we had been doing now for some \ntime. But I really do not think it is the amendments or the procedure \nrelating to the amendments that is keeping us from getting this job \ndone. I think the opponents of the bill will never let a fair process \nunfold.\n  It is every Senator's right to hold up legislation. That is the \nprerogative of the U.S. Senate. So we all understand this is a \nfilibuster. The only way to break a filibuster is to invoke cloture.\n  The bill, as everyone knows, is designed really to stop 3,000 kids a \nday from smoking. That is really what this is all about. Since we have \nbeen on this bill, 60,000 kids have become smokers. I think everybody \nneeds to understand what has happened; 60,000 new smokers have begun \nsmoking since we started this legislation, 60,000 of them. About one-\nthird of them will die of smoking-related diseases. So 20,000 of those \nkids at some point, because they started smoking since we have become \ninvolved in this legislation, will die.\n  From votes taken on those issues, it is clear that there is a \nbipartisan majority for reaching conclusion here. Some of the Senate \nwants votes on other issues like taxes, drugs, and lawyers. We are \nprepared, as we have already expressed, to have votes on those issues. \nOur position is as clear as it can be. Let's have the votes. We voted \non lawyers' fees. We have already voted on an array of other issues. \nSome I voted for, and many I voted against. We are ready to vote on the \nmarriage penalty. We are ready to vote on drug abuse. We are ready to \nkeep voting, just like we started alternating back and forth. We are \nready to sit down and work out a way to process the rest of the \namendments, and to finish the bill. But we have now spent more time on \nthis bill than any other bill this Congress.\n\n  The time for talking is over. Now is the time to act. Now is the time \nto vote. Now is the time to stand up and be counted. How many more \nthousands of kids will start smoking before we finish? Another 60,000? \n600,000? And, if it is, indeed, one-third of those who will die from \nsmoking, how many kids can we prevent from acquiring the habit and from \ndying? That is what this bill is about. That is why it is so important \nto come to closure.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I now send a cloture motion signed by 16 \nof my colleagues to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the modified \n     committee substitute for S. 1415, the tobacco legislation:\n\n[[Page S5741]]\n\n         Thomas A.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2451\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is an important bill, legislation \nthat I hope that this body can reach an accord on. The Coverdell-Craig \namendment on drugs is not a way to undermine the bill but a way to \nimprove the bill.\n  Drug use among young people is the No. 1 concern of parents, \naccording to authoritative polling data. We have a bill that has gone \nfrom $360 billion to, some say, $750 billion in income to the U.S. \nTreasury. It would be a tragedy were we not to take this opportunity to \ndo something about the drug abuse problem that continues to increase at \nextraordinary rates, particularly among young people in America today.\n  I serve as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Juvenile \nCrime. I have had the occasion to deal with the drug abuse problem in \nthat capacity. I also had the occasion, for 15 years, to be a Federal \nprosecutor and 12 years as U.S. attorney in the Southern District of \nAlabama. During that time, I was actively involved in the Mobile Bay \nArea Partnership For Youth, the primary drug-fighting organization \nwhich was later added to the Coalition for a Drug-Free Mobile. We \nworked on a monthly basis with the leadership in our community to do \nwhat we could do, as citizens within that community, to reduce drug \nabuse in our schools and among young people.\n  I learned some things during that process. I learned that what you do \nmakes a difference. I was proud to have served under the Reagan-Bush \nadministration as a Federal prosecutor. During that time, I observed a \ncontinual decline in drug use, according to the University of Michigan \nstudy that tested high school seniors, among others, every year for 20 \nyears. It is probably the most authoritative and respected study in \nAmerica. It showed that, for the 12 years under Presidents Reagan and \nBush, drug use went down every single year, something I was \nextraordinarily proud to have been a part of. President Reagan and Mrs. \nReagan sent a message down to every federal agency to cooperate in \nefforts to reduce drug abuse, because we cared about young people; we \ndid not want them to be hooked on drugs. And it worked. Those who said \nthe drug fight was a failure were wrong; we were making progress.\n  When President Clinton was elected, I sensed, and told my friends and \nprofessional acquaintances who were involved in this area, that he was \nmaking some very serious mistakes. When you go on MTV and you joke \nabout whether or not you inhaled, saying, ``Maybe I wish I had,'' that \nsends a message to young America that something has changed, that the \nmoral-based unacceptability of drug use message that had gone out \nconsistently for over a decade was now changed; there was going to be a \nnew day. I recognized it then, and so did professionals. This was bad. \nThe drug czar's office, the office that Bill Bennett used so \neffectively to continue to drive down drug use, was gutted. It is only \nrecently that we have shown the need for the drug czar's office to be \nstrengthened again and for General McCaffrey to begin to stand up to \nsome of the inertia and bureaucracy in this Government to make a \nclearer point about the problem of drug use.\n  So, I just say that this is an important matter. It would be \nunfortunate, indeed, if, in our concern here, as part of this tobacco \nbill, which is to help the youth and health of children, we didn't also \nfocus on drugs. It is the No. 1 concern of parents, and well it should \nbe.\n  I would just say this. In general, there are a number of other \namendments we need to talk about with regard to this tobacco bill. I \nhave been intimately involved in the attorneys' fees matter. We need to \nvote on that again. As far as I am concerned, I will not support a bill \nthat does not limit the incredible fees that attorneys stand to gain. \nSo we need to have a discussion about that. We have an attorney in \nMiami, FL, according to John Stossel on ``20/20,'' who hits golf balls \nout into the ocean from his beach-front mansion when he practices his \ndriving. That is just indicative of how wealthy they have become from \nthis litigation. He expects not millions, not tens of millions, not \nhundreds of millions of dollars, but billions of dollars. They want \n$2.8 billion in attorneys' fees in Florida.\n\n  They say, ``A judge can decide this.'' A judge has already approved \n$2.3 billion in attorneys' fees to the firms in Texas. This is \nextraordinary--a billion dollars. To give an indication, the general \nfund budget of the State of Alabama is less than a billion dollars. \nThis is the kind of fees we are talking about paying.\n  So I think we are going to have to talk about that some more. There \nis a provision in this bill that allows for $8 billion to be paid out \n``to victims who win lawsuits, smokers who win lawsuits.'' They can go \nto this fund, run by the tobacco companies, and they can get money up \nto $8 billion, and then they are cut off. That is a terrible plan, \nbecause some States are going to have laws, traditional laws, that will \nprobably not allow smokers to win at all. Other States may allow them \nto win. One jury may give $10 million, another nothing--``You smoked; \nit warned you on the package when you smoked; you should not recover.'' \nWe are going to have aberrational justice of the most extraordinary \nnature. It is going to be like the asbestos litigation, in which there \nare 200,000 pending asbestos cases today--200,000--and no more than 40 \npercent of the money paid by the asbestos companies actually got to the \nvictims of asbestos. We are creating the exact same process with this \nlegislation.\n  So I have an amendment, Senator Jeffords and I do; we will be \nintroducing it--to create a compensation fund and let the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, under certain guidelines, distribute the \nmoney promptly to people who are in need. If you have lung cancer from \nsmoking, your life expectancy is a matter of months. You don't need to \nhave 2 years of litigation before you get any compensation. If you are \nentitled to it, you ought to get it promptly. We would have awards \nwithin 90 days and without attorneys' fees. We don't even need \nattorneys under those circumstances.\n  So there are a lot of things we can deal with. We have a huge tax \nincrease, and how we are going to reduce some taxes in the course of \nthis will be important also.\n  So there are a lot things we need to talk about. We have 17 programs, \n$500 billion, $600 billion, $700 billion in new income to the \nGovernment. We ought not to pass this lightly. It is just going to take \nsome time to go through it. I am chagrined that the Democratic leader \nwould feel we ought to cut off the opportunities to debate and improve \nthis bill.\n  As I said, I have spent some time wrestling with the drug issue over \nthe years. It is a matter about which I feel very deeply. I gave a lot \nof my personal time to it. I have worked with civic leaders. I have \nworked with juvenile judges. I have worked with mental health \nofficials. I have worked with treatment officials and other people. I \nbrought in national experts to my district. I have met with them and \ntalked with them. When I was U.S. Attorney, I chaired a national \nantidrug committee for the Department of Justice and had a lot of \nconcern about it.\n  Let me share with you a few thoughts about what we ought to do.\n  We have--and Senator Coverdell has done an outstanding job on this \nlegislation--agreed to a particular amendment that I suggested, the \nparental consent drug testing provision. It is a provision that \nallocates $10 million to be available to schools. A school will have to \nask for it. It will be voluntary for the school. They will establish a \nprogram to drug test within that school. Parents will have to consent \nfor their children to be drug tested. If they do not want them tested, \nthey do not have to allow them to be tested.\n  I will talk about that for a few minutes and explain why, if we \nreally care about children, this is a tool which I believe has a \npotential to do more than any single other thing I know of to reduce \ndrug abuse in America.\n  We have talked about it a lot. We tell our children we do not want \nthem to\n\n[[Page S5742]]\n\nuse drugs and it is dangerous, but we do not do the things that allow \nus to know whether or not they are using drugs. Dr. Laura tells us we \nneed to confront our children and be honest with them and find out \nwhether or not they are using drugs. Sometimes you can't always take \nwhat they say at face value. Drug testing is a tool for parents, it is \na tool for teachers, and it is a tool for people who love children, who \ncare about them. If you love them, if you care about them, you want to \nknow whether or not they are undertaking bad habits.\n  It is disclosure. It is truth. It is confrontation. It is what the \npsychologists and psychiatrists call intervention. They will not use a \npositive drug test to prosecute somebody or to otherwise send them to \njail or invoke the criminal law. That is prohibited by this \nlegislation. What it will do is allow that parent, that teacher, that \nprincipal to know that this child has a problem and it could get worse. \nIf we intervene early before addiction occurs, we have a much better \nchance of changing those life habits.\n  I don't know if this program will work--maybe it won't work--but my \nexperience, and it has been over a number of years, tells me that it \nwill. Let me tell you why.\n  A number of years ago in the early 1980s, the captain of a Navy \naircraft carrier spoke before a civic organization of which I am a \nmember. He told us that less than 2 years before, over 60 percent of \nthe sailors on that ship, in his opinion, had tried an illegal drug \nwithin the past few months--60 percent on that naval ship. He said \nsince they began a rigorous program, ``Just Say No. No Drugs in Our \nNavy,'' and drug testing, that was down to 2 or 3 percent, in his \nopinion, in a matter of 2 years.\n  Some people were kicked out of the Navy, true, but not that many. \nMost of them who had a clear message of what they were expected to do, \nwhat kind of standards they were expected to meet and that those \nstandards were going to be enforced, met those standards. Were their \nlives better? Was the quality of life on a naval ship better when \npeople were not using drugs than when they were? I submit it is much \nbetter. And, in fact, I believe if you go back and study what has \nhappened in our military, you will find the great upsurgence in quality \nand strength of our military coincides with the time we took a strong \nstand on drugs and removed drugs from the military. In fact, the \nmilitary has some of the lowest drug use statistics of any group in the \ncountry. That was progress. That was good. That is the kind of thing \nthat makes life better. It makes better soldiers, it makes those \nsoldiers better family leaders, better parents, better with their lives \nand community activity. I say that is important.\n\n  I talked to a man who ran a work release center in my hometown of \nMobile. He told me this story. They had 16 members on a work release \ngang, and they received approval to do a blind testing of those members \nfor drugs. They had not been doing it that much. They checked them. \nFifteen of the 16 had used drugs, they tested positive for drugs on a \ncriminal prison work release program.\n  When they began to test regularly, drug use went down dramatically. \nThey had discipline--not harsh discipline--but they had discipline for \nthose who did not stay drug free, and it worked. Are those work release \npeople better off because somebody cared enough to test them, to stay \non them, to discipline them when they failed? Yes, they are.\n  Jay Carver, who we brought to my hometown of Mobile, ran the drug \ntesting program in the District of Columbia for many, many years. It \nwas the largest, most effective and efficient drug testing program in \nthe world, I suppose, certainly in America. He said he had people who \nwere testing positive, who had drug problems, tell him they wanted to \nstay on the program even after their time on it was off. Why? Because \nit helped them stay off drugs, and they wanted to stay off drugs. That \ndiscipline, that testing and reporting, helped them stay drug free.\n  Prison guards--we have had problems with drugs in prisons, and there \nhas been a small number of prison guards over the years who, it has \nbeen discovered, were using drugs and also bringing drugs into the \nprisons. Drug testing among prison guards has caused a big step forward \nin reducing drug use in prisons.\n  Police departments, fire departments, transportation personnel, \nprivate companies and businesses all testify to the great increase in \nproductivity that occurs when you eliminate drugs in those departments. \nI say to you that drug testing has proven to be effective in reducing \ndrug use.\n  A lot of people have discussed whether or not it can be done in \nschools and whether or not it is constitutional. I personally believe \nit is. Certainly it is if parents agree, and if schools voluntarily \nattempt to offer it as a program, I think we will find perhaps that \nbecause certain schools are showing dramatic improvement in reducing \ndrug use, others may want to do it in the future. And if the program \ndoesn't work, well, we will have learned that, too. I suspect if it is \nproperly run, we will have significant drug use reduction, and maybe as \nthe years go by other schools may want to try it and we can develop a \nmore comprehensive program that will improve the fight against drugs.\n  Mr. President, let me mention a few things that are important. Why do \nwe want to talk about drugs when we are talking about tobacco? Why? \nWell, this is all about children and their health. Let me share with \nyou some statistics.\n  Some say, ``Well, you are just being political; you are just talking \nabout Presidents Reagan-Bush versus President Clinton,'' but we ought \nto know these factors. I predicted to the people I dealt with that the \npolicies of this administration were going to undermine the successes \nof President Reagan and Mrs. Reagan's ``Just Say No to Drugs'' program. \nI see it happening. Let me show you what has happened according to \nunchallenged statistics throughout this country.\n  For eighth graders, the portion using any illegal drug in the prior \n12 months has increased 71 percent since the election of President \nClinton. It has increased 89 percent among 10th graders; 57 percent \namong 12th graders. That is use of any illicit drug. It has increased \nthat much in this period of time, following a time when it had been \ngoing down.\n  Marijuana use has accounted for much of this increase, and its strong \nresurgence among eighth graders is obvious. Use of marijuana in the \nprior 12 months by eighth graders has increased 146 percent since 1992. \nYes, tobacco is important, but now we have an indication of why parents \nsay drugs are their No. 1 concern.\n  Since the year President Clinton was first elected to office, among \n10th graders the annual prevalence increased 129 percent, and among \n12th graders, 76 percent since 1992.\n  This is something we ought to have talked more about in this country. \nI do not think the American people fully understand that policies do \nhave impact, that leadership does count. If you are sounding an \nuncertain trumpet, then you have a real problem.\n  I remember the first drug adviser to President Reagan before you had \na drug czar. Dr. Carlton Turner was from the small county in Alabama \nwhere my mother is from. I got to know him and watched him. He came to \nour community and he talked about the drug issue at a civic club, my \nLions Club.\n  While he was there, somebody raised their hand and mentioned a rural \ncounty. He said the No. 1 cash crop in that county is marijuana, ``ha, \nha, ha.'' Dr. Turner jumped down that person's throat. He said, ``I \ndon't want you ever laughing about drugs. This is very, very \ndangerous.'' He had a Ph.D. and had studied marijuana. That was his \nfield of study. He said, ``We should never be laughing about it. This \nis a serious matter. We, as a nation, need to send a clear, unequivocal \nmessage of intolerance to drugs, and we need to stand by it. And you, \nas leaders in your community, need to do the same.''\n  I thought that was a very good message. I never forgot that. That was \nin the early 1980s.\n  We started joking about, ``I wish I'd inhaled.'' We have more drug \nuse references in rock music, more drug use references on television \nand in movies than we had before. That is bad. It is one of the things \nI think is driving this increased use.\n  Daily use of marijuana, according to the survey, continues to rise by \neven younger and younger people. More than\n\n[[Page S5743]]\n\n1 in every 25 of today's high school seniors is a current daily \nmarijuana user, according to the PRIDE study, which is a good study--\nthat is an astounding statistic--with an 18.4 percent increase since \nonly last year.\n  While only 1.1 percent of 8th graders used marijuana daily in 1997--1 \npercent is a lot of 8th graders using drugs. That is 1 out of every 100 \nthat are daily users. That still represents an increase of 50 percent \nsince 1992.\n  LSD has increased. That is Dr. Leary's ``get high'' drug. It has \nincreased over 52 percent. It has increased 50 percent among 8th \ngraders since 1992.\n  More than 1 in 20 seniors in the class of 1997 used cocaine this \nyear, a 12.2 percent increase over last year. That is cocaine, a highly \naddictive drug. Crack-cocaine use has continued its gradual climb among \n10th and 12th graders.\n  Since 1992, annual cocaine use is up 87 percent for 8th graders, 147 \npercent for 10th graders, and up 77 percent for 12th graders. Those are \nbig increases. That is a real societal problem. That is why parents \nlisted it as such a high priority with them.\n  So I want to say to those who express their concern about tobacco and \nits damaging health impact on children, they are correct. But as you \nknow, marijuana, Mr. President, is, I think, 40 times more carcinogenic \nthan tobacco. It is a highly carcinogenic drug, in addition to the \nadverse effects such as habituation and other problems.\n  We know, for example, learning skills go down when marijuana is used. \nKids grades drop, and they lose their motivation to work. That is a \ncharacteristic of marijuana use that ought not be dismissed lightly. It \nis a very serious drug.\n  So I just say this, Mr. President--I see the Senator from Arizona has \nreturned to the floor, and I know he has many things he would like to \nsay--but I salute Senator Coverdell for his outstanding effort to \nimprove this bill with a tough antidrug initiative. It will be \neffective. I believe the one part of it that I have discussed mostly \ntoday, the part that allows drug testing for those high school \nstudents, whose parents agree to it, could be a turning point in our \neffort to reduce drugs among teenagers, to make their lives healthier \nand richer as time goes by.\n\n  My experience, as a Federal prosecutor and as chairman of the Youth \nJuvenile Crime Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, convinces me \nthis is the right course for us to take. I hope that we will continue \nto pursue it. I hope this amendment will be made a part of the bill, \nand I know it will strengthen it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Alabama leaves the \nfloor, I want to thank him for not only the great, important remarks he \nhas made about the pending amendment concerning the problem of drugs in \nAmerica, but I want to also thank him for his efforts to resolve \nanother very contentious aspect of this legislation, and that is the \nissue of lawyers' fees.\n  There was an amendment that the Senator from Alabama proposed which \nwas defeated, perhaps because the amount of money involved in \ncompensation for the plaintiffs' lawyers was too low. But I know that \nhe and the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, and others are \nworking on another amendment I hope we could add to this bill before we \nvote on final passage that would properly compensate the legal \nprofession who has been involved in this issue, but at the same time \nnot deprive the victims from the compensation they deserve, deprive the \nprograms from the funding that is absolutely critical and needed if we \nare going to address this issue. The reality is we cannot divert as \nmuch money as being contemplated in the State settlements as well as in \nother areas that would go to the legal profession.\n  I thank the Senator from Alabama for his work on that. As we all \nknow, in his previous incarnation he served as attorney general of the \nState of Alabama, and I appreciate his efforts in that direction. I \nalso appreciate the comments he made, his opening comments, and that \nis, he believes we need to pass this legislation. I believe that still \nreflects the majority view here in the Senate. And I am eager for the \nSenate to complete its work on the bill.\n  Mr. President, we are, I know, in the third week now of contemplation \nof this legislation and amendments and debate and discussion. \nUnfortunately, last week's activities were truncated, to some degree, \nby a requirement for a large number of us to attend the funeral of my \npredecessor, Barry Goldwater. I think it is clear we are reaching a \npoint in this legislation where we either come to closure or then we \nhave to move on to other issues.\n  I believe at the right time that cloture should be invoked, if that \nis what it takes to complete our work in a timely fashion. I hope that \nrather than cloture we could agree to time agreements on the \namendments. I hope we could agree to narrow the amendments even \nfurther, and we could dispose of the issues at hand. I think it is \nimportant to point out that we have pending amendments which have to do \nwith drugs, we have tax cut alternatives, and we have substitute \nmeasures as well as I mentioned earlier an additional amendment on the \nattorneys' fees issue.\n  Very frankly, Mr. President, there are not any other significant \nissues or amendments that would affect this legislation. So I think \nthey could be disposed of in short order if we can enter into time \nagreements. That will be my effort this morning as we enter into \ndiscussions with other Members who have an interest in the bill.\n  I would not vote for cloture at this time until it is clear to me \nthat we have exhausted our efforts to come to time agreements and \ndispose of pending amendments. I think that is a far better way of \nproceeding as, frankly, we do on most pieces of legislation that come \nbefore the body.\n  Mr. President, I also point out that there are interests that want to \nsee this legislation fail.\n  I think we should acknowledge that. It is interesting, which parts of \nthe political spectrum these efforts come from.\n  I do not question the motives of any opponent of this legislation, \nand they may succeed. I remind opponents of this legislation that if it \ndoes not move forward and we have to move to other issues, the issue is \nnot going away. No matter what is done on the other side of the aisle, \nor if nothing is done on the other side of the aisle, there will be, in \nthe words of one well known plaintiff's lawyer in the America, ``a rush \nto the courthouse.'' There will be 37 States who will proceed with \ntheir suits. There will be settlements. If the past four have been any \nguideline, those judgments are substantial. And, by the way, they have \nentailed substantial plaintiff fees--in the case of the State of \nFlorida, I believe over $2 billion, if my memory serves me correctly. \nSo the issue of children and tobacco is not going to go away.\n  I hope that when colleagues of mine on both sides of the aisle who \nwould rather see this bill die, for whatever reason--whether it be a \nphilosophical problem they have with a ``big government solution'' or \nwhether it be, in all candor, perhaps, the use of this issue in the \nNovember elections to some political advantage, or whatever reason--the \nissue isn't going away.\n  Every day that we do delay, there are 3,000 children who start to \nsmoke, and 1,000 of them will die early. I appeal to the better angels \nof our natures here in this body and ask for a lowering of the \nrhetoric. I am not sure it does any real good to attack someone else's \nposition on an issue. I don't think it does any good to even question \nanyone's motives, whether they agree or disagree with this legislation. \nFor the first couple of weeks, or at least the first week or 10 days as \nwe addressed this issue, it was characterized by respect for one \nanother's views and, I think, was very helpful as an educational \ndebate.\n  Beginning the end of last week, obviously that atmosphere of comity \nwas dramatically reduced, if not disappearing. I hope my colleagues \nwill not get too partisan on this issue. It is not one that should be \npartisan. It is one that should be, indeed, nonpartisan rather than \nbipartisan, because it is a problem that transcends party lines.\n  I intend, as I said, to work this morning in trying to get some time \nagreements on pending legislation. We clearly have debated the drug \namendment to a significant degree, and I think we could vote on that \nvery soon. We continue to talk with Senator Gramm\n\n[[Page S5744]]\n\nabout his tax cut amendment. There may be another one besides that, and \nthen substitute measures, and attorneys' fees. I have to say, in all \ncandor, Mr. President, there is no reason to delay any more after we \nhave resolved those issues.\n  Let me just make a couple comments about the drug amendment. \nObviously, illegal drugs are a terrible problem in America. It \ncontinues to pose a serious threat to our youth, and I strongly support \nmany aspects of the pending amendment to attack the problem.\n  I am compelled, however, to mention that one of the criticisms that \nhas been leveled at the pending legislation is the ``new \nbureaucracies'' issue: There are new bureaucracies and new programs, \nand this is a big-government solution. Let me just list some of the new \nprograms and bureaucracies that are in this amendment: Drug Testing \nDemonstration Program, Driving Work Grant Program, Student Safety and \nFamily Choice Program, Victim and Witness Assistance Program, Victim/\nWitness Assistance Grants, Report Card Grants, Random Drug Testing \nGrants, Parental Consent Drug Testing Demonstration Projects, Drug-Free \nWorkplace Grants, Small Business Development Centers, Convicted Drug \nDealers Grants, on and on.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that those of my colleagues who are \nsupportive of this legislation, as I am, will perhaps better understand \nwhy there is money spent for specific reasons in the overall tobacco \nbill for basically the same reason money is spent for ``bureaucracies'' \nin the drug bill--because we have to have some kind of vehicle within \nexisting bureaucracies to attack the problem. None of us should want to \nsay OK, Federal Government, here is the money, do whatever you want to \nattack either the drug problem or the tobacco problem. We have to \nspecify as to how this body, in its wisdom, with the advice of the \nexperts, can best dispense those funds in programs that will attack the \nproblem.\n  I think a Driving Grant Program is probably important. I think a \nStudent Safety and Family Choice Program is important. I think Report \nCard Grants are important. And on and on and on. So those who support \nthis amendment--and I know it is a majority of my colleagues certainly \non this side of the aisle--I hope they will understand better why the \narguments about ``new bureaucracies'' is not necessarily valid when we \nare attempting to address a specific issue with specific programs.\n  Finally, on the issue of the money, I believe the tobacco trust fund \nshould pay a fair share in taking action that will defend efforts to \nprevent and cease drug use in America. But I also hope we can take some \nof the money from the violent crime trust fund and other sources of \nrevenue and ensure that funding for tobacco, for drug enforcement \npurposes, does not undermine the basic purposes for which the fund was \nestablished.\n  As I said before, I do not support a cloture vote at this time. I am \nhopeful that we can, as we go through this morning and early afternoon, \nagree on time agreements on amendments. I do believe that if we can't \ndo that, then we either vote for cloture or we move on to other issues \nthat are important. I believe we can move forward. I believe the \nmajority of the American people want us to move forward, and I am still \nconfident that we can complete this legislation in a timely fashion.\n  I note the presence of my colleague from Massachusetts on the floor, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to express strong support for what \nmy friend and colleague from Arizona has commented to the Senate and \nthank him for this long and continuing battle. He has been a leader in \nterms of trying to have a responsible position on this tobacco issue. \nAs all of us understand, this has been an issue where there has been a \ngreat deal of diversity in this body, but there has been an enormously \nadmirable, noble, and I think commendable effort on his part to try to \nmove this legislation in a responsible way that tries to find a common \nground. I want to just commend him for his continued efforts to move \nthis process forward.\n  We may have some differences on some particular issues as we address \nthem, but I think every Member of this body who believes in the \nimportance of developing a responsible position has to recognize his \nvery, very strong and positive leadership. I join with others who have \nexpressed that previously but, again, take note based upon his \ncontinuing efforts and upon his very reasoned statements that he made \nhere earlier today.\n  Now, I want to just join in welcoming many of our colleagues' focus \nand attention on the problems that this Nation is facing in terms of \nsubstance abuse. I am so delighted that many of our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have brought forth their strong support for \nthis Nation to be addressing this particular problem in a more \naggressive way. And I welcome that, because many of us stood on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate in the period of the past 3 years when we saw \nthe Drug-Free School Program, which is the one program that has been \ndeveloped that had bipartisan support, that is focused on the high \nschools of this country, that is focused on dealing with the problems \nof substance abuse, alcohol abuse, and conflict resolution. It doesn't \nprovide a lot of resources--maybe $12 or $14 per school. Nonetheless, \nthere have been a number of very impressive and important programs that \nhave been developed on that. We have seen in recent times many of those \nwho have spoken in favor of this particular amendment voting in favor \nof cutting the program back in a significant way that would bring \ntargeted help and assistance in terms of the at-risk youth. We have \nseen that program, which includes the young people who are attempting \nto try to acquire some kind of treatment and attention and have been \nafflicted by this horrific kind of addiction in terms of substance \nabuse, significantly cut back and cut back again.\n\n  We have seen the important success, I believe, of adding police \nofficers to the streets across this country. The neighborhood policing \nconcept reaches far beyond the total number of 100,000 police officers. \nI can tell you that in my city of Boston, where they have had the \nadditional kinds of police officers that are community policing, that \nare involved in the community policing network and are out in schools \nsetting up local kinds of police departments in these schools, in \nrecreational areas, working virtually around the clock and doing a lot \nof work with community groups, nonprofit agencies, outreaching in terms \nof trying to deal with some of the problems of gangs. They have had a \nvery important success.\n  In my State of Massachusetts--particularly in Boston--up to just 2 \nmonths ago we went close to 2 years without a youth homicide. There are \na lot of factors included in the efforts in Boston. Paul Evans, our \ncommissioner, deserves great credit. The neighborhood policing support \nthat was received as a result of some of these programs played an \nimportant part, and, again, that program was opposed.\n  So I am not going to take much time here this morning to go through \nthe opposition that many of us faced as we were looking for drug courts \nwhich have, I think, demonstrated to be very important and very \neffective in dealing with the more violent aspects of those that are \ninvolved in substance abuse, and the battle we have had in terms of \nsupport for those kinds of programs that have been developing to try to \ndemonstrate their success in different regions and communities across \nthe country.\n  So over the period of these past years, many of us have been trying \nto give additional life to the problems of substance abuse in our \nsociety and we haven't been able to get very much support. So whatever \nthe circumstances, we are glad that at least we are hearing on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate an increasing priority for this Nation in \nterms of focusing resources. We are not saying that necessarily just \nadding dollars to a particular program is going to solve the issue, but \nwe do say that the allocations of resources--in this case, the \ncommitment of appropriations, is at least the Nation's priorities in \nterms of allocating these resources. For many of those, I might say, in \nwatching this debate on the problems of substance abuse and the so-\ncalled drug amendment, we have not heard their voices, we have not seen \ntheir support, we have not had their votes in the very recent times as \nall of\n\n[[Page S5745]]\n\nus are trying to find ways of dealing with a problem that affects too \nmany communities and families in this Nation.\n  So if nothing comes out--and hopefully something will--of the debate, \nat least we will have additional kinds of focus and attention and, \nhopefully, support to try to help families, schools, and communities \ndeal with the problems of substance abuse.\n\n  Let's go back again to what we have here on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. What we will find out, Mr. President, if you bring the experts \nin, in terms of substance abuse, is that virtually without exception \nthe gateway drug to substance abuse is smoking. It is smoking. They \nwill say that is the predominant one, and access to beer is a secondary \naspect. But they will say smoking is the gateway drug to substance \nabuse. We won't take the time this morning--perhaps later in the \ndebate--to show the correlation of smokers to those who get into the \nuse of marijuana, or young smokers that start at 12, 13, and 14 years \nold that begin to use substances like heroin. The correlation is \npowerful, it is compelling, and it is convincing. If we are trying to \ncome back to the problems in terms of substance abuse, the first place \nand the best place to start is with the issue of smoking. The younger \nthe better. The younger the better.\n  That is why I think it is important, as we are coming to this time in \nthe debate and discussion, to keep our focus on what the underlying \nlegislation is all about, which is the public health of young people in \nthis country, to discourage them from smoking with the increase in \nprice and a vigorous antismoking campaign on the back end to try to \nhelp provide both information and assistance, cessation programs, and \nothers, in dealing with the challenge that this Nation is facing, and \nwhich other countries are facing as well.\n  So, Mr. President, this is why it is so important that we get on with \nthe business that is before the Senate, which is getting, I think, \naction in terms of voting rather than talking on the issue of tobacco \nlegislation. We have all been through these various battles and we have \nlegislation on the floor of the Senate, where there are strong \ndifferences of opinion, and the ability to delay action is readily \navailable by Members on this issue. It seems that the debate has moved \nalong. The issues before us are imperative and we ought to go ahead in \nhaving the cloture vote, and we can then deal with those amendments \nthat are relevant at that time.\n  The first vote we are going to be facing this afternoon on the motion \nto invoke cloture on the tobacco legislation is a key vote. For more \nthan 3 weeks, opponents of the legislation have used every \nparliamentary trick in the book to prevent the Senate from passing this \nbill, even though a clear majority are for it. In the 3 weeks since the \nSenate started this debate, 66,000 more children have started to smoke, \nand 3,000 more will start each day until the legislation is enacted and \nimplemented. While the Senate fiddles, the cigarettes burn.\n  The opponents have attempted to create a smokescreen to divert \nattention from the real purpose of this legislation, which is to \nprevent children from beginning to smoke and becoming addicted to \ntobacco and help current smokers stop smoking. The opponents are \ndesperate to have the Senate focus on anything else--limiting \nattorneys' fees, reducing the marriage penalty in the tax laws, \nprohibiting illegal drug use, school vouchers--any issue but the real \nissue. They would prefer to ignore the fact that tobacco use is \nresponsible for 20 percent of all premature deaths in the United \nStates.\n  Tobacco is the Nation's leading cause of preventable death and \ndisability. It accounts for 400,000 deaths a year--more deaths than \nfrom alcohol, more deaths than from car accidents, more deaths than \nfrom suicides, more deaths than from AIDS, more deaths than from \nhomicides, more deaths than from illegal drugs, more deaths than from \nfires, more deaths than from all of these combined.\n  Yet, the opponents of this legislation are not interested in \nprotecting the public health and saving lives from tobacco use. They \nare interested in protecting big tobacco and blocking any effective \naction that would reduce tobacco use and therefore reduce tobacco \nprofits.\n  The American people understand what is going on here. Today's vote \nwill lift the smokescreen and demonstrate where each Senator stands on \nthis fundamental issue. Do they stand for further delay and \nobstruction, or do they have the courage to act against the will of the \ntobacco lobbyists?\n  Parents are watching to see if the Senate will continue to allow \ntobacco companies to blatantly market their products to children, or \nwill we force the Marlboro Man into the sunset?\n  People are watching to see if the Senate will continue to allow \nnonsmokers to be exposed to secondhand smoke, which causes 3,000 to \n5,000 lung cancer deaths each year in the United States and up to 60 \npercent of all cases of asthma and bronchitis in young children.\n  Are we willing to stand up against the tobacco industry, and stand \nfor the smoking cessation programs and the counter-advertising \ncampaigns and the law enforcement efforts that are needed to prevent \ntobacco sales to minors?\n  There is no valid reason why the Senate cannot vote on final passage \nthis week. If the majority leader was willing to permit the fair and \ntimely scheduling of amendments from both sides of the aisle, we could \ncomplete action on them within a few days. We have filed for cloture \nbecause it is the only way to break the parliamentary logjam created by \na small group of willful defenders of the tobacco industry. It will \nprovide an irrefutable public record of who is ready to vote for strong \nlegislation to prevent youth smoking and who is attempting to talk the \nlegislation to death.\n  The opponents of the McCain bill are engaging in filibuster by \namendment--amendments which do not even deal with the subject of \nsmoking prevention. These amendments are transparent attempts to \nscuttle the legislation, not improve it. The Coverdell amendment would \ndivert more than 80 percent of the funds currently directed to anti-\nsmoking prevention and cessation programs.\n  According to the analysis, the Coverdell-Craig amendment will slash, \nas I mentioned, funding for the smoking prevention programs by 82 \npercent over 5 years. This will be $13 billion, down to the $2.4 \nbillion that will match reduction for these programs that have been \ndemonstrated to be effective. We have gone through that in the course \nof the debate, including my own State of Massachusetts, California, and \nother various communities, and neighboring countries such as Canada. \nThe list goes on.\n  Effectively what we are saying is the Office of Management and Budget \nsays this amendment would drain $10 billion from the $13 billion set \naside by the bill each year for the antismoking programs. Effectively \nit guts the program.\n  These anti-smoking initiatives are at the very heart of the \nlegislation. If the Senate is serious about stopping children from \nbeginning to smoke and saving lives from tobacco-induced diseases, we \nhave to invest in these important public health measures.\n  If the Coverdell amendment is enacted, there will be less funding for \nsmoking cessation programs, for counter-advertising programs, and for \nschool and community-based education initiatives, all of which have an \nexcellent track record of preventing smoking by children and helping \nadults to stop smoking.\n  Clearly, we need greater enforcement efforts to prevent the illegal \nsale of tobacco products to minors. Each year, American youths spend \nover $1 billion to purchase tobacco products, despite laws in all 50 \nstates that prohibit underage sales. According to Professor Joseph \nDiFranza of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, ``if $1 \nbillion in illegal sales were spread out evenly over an estimated 1 \nmillion tobacco retailers nationwide, it would indicate that the \naverage tobacco retailer breaks the law about 500 times a year.''\n  We shouldn't weaken these important law enforcement efforts by \nreducing their funding, when they could have such a significant effect \nin reducing teenage smoking.\n  The federal government currently spends $520 million a year on \ntobacco control efforts. That sum is dwarfed by the amount spent to \nfight illegal drugs, which will total $16 billion this year--thirty \ntimes as much.\n\n[[Page S5746]]\n\n  Deaths caused by tobacco, 400,000; the amount that is actually spent \non Federal spending, $520 million; deaths caused by substance and \nillegal drugs is 20,000. We spend close to $16 billion. Of course, we \nare all concerned about the problems of substance abuse. But we are \ntalking about now dealing with the issue of tobacco because it is the \ngateway to the substance abuse problem that we are facing in this \ncountry. If we don't understand that interconnection, we don't really \nunderstand this problem in a very important way.\n  This disparity is especially significant, since tobacco use causes \n400,000 deaths a year, while illegal drugs are responsible for 20,000 \ndeaths.\n  Clearly, we can do more to reduce illegal drug use, but those efforts \nshould not come at the expense of needed anti-smoking initiatives. \nPresident Clinton has already asked Congress to act this year on a $17 \nbillion counter-drug budget--the largest anti-drug budget in our \nhistory.\n  The National Drug Control Strategy increases funds for drug \nintervention programs for youth and for treatment programs. It adds \n1,000 officers to the Border Patrol and 540 new DEA positions. Two \nhundred counter-narcotics agents will be assigned to initiatives to \ncombat heroin and other drug smuggling. In fact, some of the components \nof the Coverdell amendment duplicate anti-drug strategies set in motion \nmonths ago.\n  The Coverdell amendment contains another provision--private school \nvouchers--which are poison pills for the tobacco legislation. I \nstrongly oppose these provisions, and the Senate should reject them.\n  The private school voucher provisions are a blatant attempt to force \nthe Republican anti-public school agenda on the tobacco bill. The \nSenate has already debated this issue at length earlier this year. We \nall know that it is a highly contentious issue. We should not revisit \nit in the context of the tobacco legislation, since private school \nvouchers are totally unrelated to reducing youth smoking. The only \nreason it was included in this amendment is to serve as an anchor to \nweigh down this important bill.\n  Our goal is to improve the public schools, not abandon them. Instead \nof draining much-needed resources from public schools, we need to take \nsteps to help all schools, not just a few schools--and to help all \nstudents, not just a few students.\n  The Coverdell amendment would undermine these efforts by diverting \nfederal funds to help private schools.\n  Supporters of this legislation are certainly prepared to allocate \npart of the funds to the anti-drug measures in the Coverdell amendment, \nbut it makes no sense to allocate the vast majority of the funds to \nthose programs.\n  It is time for Republicans in Congress to stop holding the tobacco \nbill hostage. We should free the prisoner, and do what's needed to \nreduce smoking.\n  Cloture should be invoked now to prevent any more delaying tactics. I \nurge my colleagues to vote to end this pro-tobacco filibuster and pass \nthis needed legislation.\n  Mr. President, just to reiterate, we welcome the new voices that are \nspeaking in terms of support for the substance abuse programs. We could \nhave used both their voice and their vote in recent years when those \nprograms were under attack and assault here in the appropriations \ncommittees as we were trying to deal with those issues. But now that we \nfind new interest in these programs, we welcome their effort. But you \ncan't get away from the fact that even in dealing with the illegal \nproblems of substance abuse and illegal drugs that the gateway to all \nof this is tobacco. That is what we are focused on. That is the core \nissue. We take meaningful steps in terms of tobacco by discouraging \nyoung people from purchasing as a matter of price, and by taking the \nantismoking kinds of programs that have been included in this effort, \nwe are going to have a meaningful impact on the number of young people \nthat are going to smoke, and we are going to have a meaningful impact \non the problem of substance abuse.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can come back this afternoon and move \ntowards cloture and get on with the business before the Senate. The \nAmerican people have been listening to this debate for some 3 weeks. \nFamilies are entitled to have a vote to protect their children in this \ncountry. We ought to be able to take a stand. We should be willing to \ntake such a stand and be held accountable for that. We will have the \nfirst opportunity to do so this afternoon. I hope all of our colleagues \nwill give support for that program so we can move this legislation, so \nthe House will move it, eventually the President will sign it, and we \nwill make meaningful progress in reducing the problems of youth smoking \nin this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to \nspeak in regard to the effort to restrict debate on this bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, following the \nremarks of the Senator from Missouri, the Senator from Iowa be \nrecognized for 5 minutes, and following those remarks, I be recognized \nfor 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to \nspeak briefly against restraining the debate by invoking cloture here. \nThere are too many outstanding issues to invoke cloture and to amend or \nstop the debate and amendment process. I rise today to oppose invoking \ncloture on the tobacco bill. A vote to invoke cloture, a vote to cut \noff debate on this massive legislation, is a vote in favor of a massive \ntax increase. It is a vote against tax relief, a vote against fighting \nillegal drug use in this country. I doubt whether those who are not \nkeenly familiar with the procedures of the Senate would understand that \nwhen you invoke cloture, you limit amendments, and if you invoke \ncloture at this time--if we were to vote to invoke cloture today, we \nwould basically be saying that we could not include in this bill any \nantidrug measures, we could not include in this bill any tax relief.\n  I think it is clear that the American people are beginning to learn \nwhat this bill is about. The American people are beginning to \nunderstand what $868 billion in new taxes really means. They are \nbeginning to understand that there are boards and commissions and new \niterations of the Federal Government, of the National Government, \ndictating activity in this bill, and it is time for us to continue the \ndebate. The American people are beginning to learn that there is \nforeign aid in this bill, that there is $350 million a year in foreign \naid just to provide for studies in foreign countries of the impact of \nsmoking in those countries.\n  This legislation is almost 500 pages long. It is quite possibly an \nattempt at the largest expansion of government since the ill-fated \nHealth Security Act, President Clinton's attempt to take over one-\nseventh of the U.S. economy in the health care measure. And, while we \nhave spent several weeks on this bill, we have not begun to scratch the \nsurface of this 480-page bill.\n  As I believe others who will be coming to the floor will show, you \nwill find a bill like this is very complex. As I mentioned, the kinds \nof foreign aid measures, the kinds of things virtually unrelated to any \nbenefit people in this United States could expect to receive from this \nbill are tucked into the nooks and crannies of this bill. It is no \nwonder people do not want further amendments. It is no wonder they want \nto curtail debate. But I think it is time we continue to have debate. \nWe have spent several weeks on this bill. We have not begun to scratch \nthe surface. There are issues that we have discussed but haven't voted \non and issues that have yet to have a full and fair debate. On Friday, \nover 100 amendments were filed to this bill. More than 30 Members of \nthis body have filed amendments to this bill. We should not curtail the \ndiscussion of this bill by invoking cloture.\n  Many important issues will not be addressed if cloture is invoked. If \ncloture is invoked, many of those amendments--the antidrug amendment \nand the tax cut amendments--would be ruled nongermane and would not be \nallowed to be considered. Some say this is legislation that is dead or \ndying and cloture is needed to salvage this legislation. That is the \nmindset of people who are afraid that the details of the\n\n[[Page S5747]]\n\nlegislation will be exposed to the American people and, as a result, \nthe American people will no longer support the measure. That is the \nmindset of people who are afraid the American people will learn that \nthis bill in fact contains a massive tax increase, $868 billion, and it \nis focused, 60 percent of it, on people who earn less than $30,000 a \nyear.\n\n  The American people have a right to know what is in this bill, and we \nhave only begun educating the American people about the bill and \ndebating the important issues. We have had only 5 votes on amendments \nto this legislation, 3 motions to table that were agreed to and 2 that \nwere not--a bill of almost 500 pages and only 5 votes so far. We have \nnot even begun to discuss the controversial provisions regarding \ntobacco farmers. We have just begun to talk more about the serious \nproblem of illegal drug use by teenagers and the fact that most parents \nare far more concerned about that than they are about smoking.\n  We have yet to vote on any amendment to provide relief from the \ndiscriminatory marriage penalty. I know there are several Senators who \nhave amendments to address this tax penalty, including the minority \nleader, who has expressed that. Of course, I have a measure in this \nrespect, as does the Senator from Texas and the Senator from New \nMexico. But this cloture motion would put an end to these discussions. \nI ask my friends who filed this motion, what are they afraid of? Why \nwon't they allow full and fair debate on this bill? What are they \nafraid of, that the American people will find out that is included in \nthis legislation?\n  I believe if we are going to raise the kind of taxes that are \nincluded in this bill, we need to have a complete and open debate. \nUnfortunately, some from the beginning have tried to hide the tax \nincrease. The Commerce Committee--I was a member of the committee, but \nI was the only one to vote against this bill--simply refused to call \nthis a tax; instead, they called it a penalty on the tobacco companies, \nbut put in the bill a requirement that the tobacco companies would pass \nit on to the American people. Thankfully, what we call something will \nnot change its real character. If it is a tax, it is a tax, whether we \ncall it that or not. The Finance Committee at least had the integrity \nto say it was a tax and that this is a massive tax increase on the \nAmerican people.\n  The fact that the bill requires this to be paid by the American \npeople, by consumers, not the tobacco companies, is something the \nAmerican people deserve to know. This is a bill that is designed, at \nleast in the minds of many people, to somehow punish the tobacco \ncompanies. But there is a mandate in the legislation that requires that \nthe tax be passed through to the consumer. Tobacco companies will be \nfined if they don't pass the price increase on to the addicted \nconsumers, and of course this tax does fall most heavily on those who \nare least able to pay it, those earning less than $30,000 a year.\n  Using data provided by the Centers for Disease Control, this tobacco \nlegislation will be an annual $382 million tax increase on individuals \nin my home State--a $382 million tax increase on Missourians. That is \nmore than $3 million per county in my State. Roughly $227 million of \nthat amount would be paid by individuals in households of less than \n$30,000.\n  It is clear we should not invoke cloture. Invoking cloture would \ncurtail the availability of amendments relating to drug use. It would \ncurtail the availability of amendments relating to tax relief. In the \nface of a tax measure which potentially would add $860-plus billion to \nthe tax responsibilities of the people of this country, I believe we \nshould maintain our ability to talk about tax relief in the same \nlegislation.\n  With that in mind, I oppose the invoking of cloture here. I think it \nis bad judgment. It curtails discussion unnecessarily and unduly. It \nwould provide for the masking of the real character of this legislation \nfrom the American people when the American people have every right to \nknow and learn about the full nature of this measure.\n  I thank the Chair for this opportunity to speak, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Coverdell \namendment. I sincerely hope that the Senate will adopt this important \namendment. I think the main concern on this side of the aisle is not \nabout the importance of an antitobacco campaign and an education \nprogram so teenagers will not smoke in the first place. This is very \nimportant, and it should be well funded. But money above and beyond \nthat ought to go into fully funding existing programs rather than \ncreating a whole new scheme of programs. Creating new Federal programs \nis a goal of this administration. It is important that we not just \ncreate the programs for their sake, but that we make sure that it is \nused wisely. There will be a lot of new revenue generated by this bill \nand we must not use it all to create new Federal programs.\n  We cannot put an obligation on the people of this country to support \nprograms that we do not know, down the line, how much they are going to \ncost, just because there is a big new bonanza of money available.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to keep teenagers from starting to \nsmoke in the first place. This must remain our focal point. This is one \nimportant reason that I support the Coverdell amendment, because it \nwill put excess money into existing programs and not create a whole new \nlist of programs. Another is that this amendment will combat illegal \ndrug use--which also kills our children. We should not address one \nwithout addressing the other. If we say that we are going to help our \nchildren, then we simply cannot walk away from an opportunity to help \nthem fight against illegal drugs. This is not one against the other--\neither we fight youth tobacco smoking or we fight illegal drug use. \nQuite the contrary, this amendment means that we do both.\n  We are in the process of considering monumental legislation. We are \nengaged in a major debate about what to do about tobacco. Many of the \narguments in favor of this bill focus on keeping kids from starting to \nsmoke. I believe this is a very important objective. But there is more \nwe can do with this bill to help our kids. When you talk to young \npeople about what concerns them, when you look at what they tell \npollsters, you learn what most concerns them. If we are going to engage \nin all of this talk of what to do for young people, it might be a good \nidea to listen to what they have to say.\n  Young people today are very concerned about the availability of \nillegal drugs and of the violence that is all too common in our \nschools. Whatever else we might say about tobacco, it is not the source \nof the violence that threatens so many young people. While it has \nserious health consequences, those are not immediate. Smoking tobacco \nmay give you heart disease or cancer in the future. The use of illegal \ndrugs and the bad things that they do are not a problem of tomorrow, \nthose are problems this very day, they are immediate problems, and the \navailability of these drugs is what most concerns kids.\n  We hear very little of this in this debate. I think we make a mistake \nin not consulting what our young people are telling us. They are \ntelling us that we must also address the use and availability of \nillegal drugs if we are to protect their health. That is why I am \nsupporting amendments to the tobacco bill that will bring the issue of \nillegal drugs into the discussion. I wish every time the President took \ntime to discuss tobacco and kids, he would bring the issue of illegal \ndrugs into the discussion. And I wish that the President of the United \nStates would never be seen with a cigar in his mouth if his campaign \nagainst tobacco is to be credible.\n  Seeing that he is not likely to do that, I believe that we in the \nCongress must talk about illegal drugs. I therefore draw to my \ncolleagues' attention these amendments and ask them to join me in \nvoting for them. That includes the Coverdell-Craig amendment on drug-\nfree neighborhoods and others that strengthen our efforts to deal with \nillegal drug trafficking and use. These amendments put drugs back into \nthe debate, and they should be there. They should be there every time \nhe talks about tobacco. They should be there every time he talks about \nchildren s health. The President should also talk about not only drugs \nbeing illegal and not that they are bad because they are illegal--but \nthey are illegal because they are bad. These amendments give\n\n[[Page S5748]]\n\nsupport to increasing our prevention, treatment, and interdiction \nprograms for the issues that most concern our young people.\n  I also call to mind an important point. In the years that we made \n``Just Say No'' a critical element of our counterdrug efforts, we saw a \nsignificant decline in illegal drug use among our young people. And we \nalso saw something else. ``Just Say No'' had a halo effect. Kids not \nonly stopped using illegal drugs, but they also stopped using tobacco \nand alcohol in impressive numbers.\n  In the last several years, in the absence of a coherent antidrug \nmessage, drug use is on the rise--use of all drugs--especially among \nyoung people. Tobacco use is also on the rise. We must address these \nthreats to the health and well-being of our children. And the situation \nis worse than we think.\n  As the most recent national drug strategy hints at and other studies \nconfirm, we have been under reporting drug use for years. That means \nthere are more addicts than we thought; there are more users than we \nthought. We need to keep this in mind as we talk about teen smoking. We \ncannot afford to leave a problem that kids say concerns them most out \nof our discussions. We cannot look young people in the face and tell \nthem that we are doing all this on tobacco for their sake and ignore \nillegal drugs. This is a landmark opportunity to do both, and we owe it \nto our kids to do as much as we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to come over this morning to say a \nfew words about the bill and about cloture. I am strongly supportive of \nthe amendment by Senator Coverdell, and what I would like to try to do \nin my brief remarks is to put this whole debate in proper context. I \nknow literally dozens of our colleagues who support the bill have come \nover and spoken. It is awfully easy on these kinds of issues for people \nto get confused. So what I would like to do, very briefly, is to go \nback and put the focus of attention on where the money is coming from \nthat comes into the bill, where the money is going, and what both--\nwhere the money is coming from and where it is going--say about the \nbill. Then I would like to talk very briefly about the Coverdell \namendment and conclude by making a remark on the cloture vote.\n  First of all, for endless hours our colleagues who support this bill \nhave damned the tobacco companies. They have indicted--convicted on \nmany occasions--the tobacco companies for their activities over the \nlast 25 years. And let me say that it seems to me, based on the \nevidence they have presented, that if one were sitting on a jury, one \nwould have to find the tobacco companies guilty.\n  While our colleagues hold the tobacco companies in contempt, seeking \nto draw our eye to the tobacco companies, the problem is that the money \ncoming into this bill comes not from the tobacco companies but it comes \nfrom working Americans who are relatively-modest-income people.\n  The reality of the bill is, interestingly enough, that while our \ncolleagues who support the bill go on and on about the tobacco \ncompanies, damning them for their activities--and justifiably so--the \nreality of their bill is that the tobacco companies not only do not pay \nthese taxes but they are mandated to pass the taxes through to the \nconsumer.\n  I hope when people listen to this debate about the terrible \nactivities of tobacco companies, they will realize that what we have in \nthis bill is one of the giant legislative bait and switches in the \nhistory of American Government. The bait is tobacco companies--savage \nthe tobacco companies--but the switch is that we are taxing blue-collar \nAmericans, and, in fact, with an incredible pass-through provision in \nthe bill, we are requiring the tobacco companies to work in concert to \nsee that working Americans pay every penny of these taxes. That is the \nbait and switch of this bill.\n  The proponents of the bill hold up tobacco companies to revile, but \nthey reach into the pockets of blue-collar working Americans and take \nuntold billions of dollars in one of the largest tax increases in \nAmerican history and certainly the most regressive tax increase of any \nsize in the history of this country.\n  And I would like to remind my colleagues that 34 percent of the over \n$600 billion of taxes collected in this bill will come from Americans \nin families that make $15,000 or less; 47.1 percent will come from \nAmericans in families that make $22,000 or less, and 59.1 percent of \nthe taxes in this bill will come from families that make less than \n$30,000 a year.\n  So while our colleagues hold up tobacco companies as this source of \nevil and the focus of the debate, the reality is that the tobacco \ncompanies are paying no taxes and that Americans who make $30,000 or \nless are paying 59.1 percent of the taxes in this bill.\n  This is a tax on blue-collar workers, and it is a massive tax. Let me \njust give you an example. The Presiding Officer is from Alabama. And \n24.9 percent of the people in Alabama, who are adults, smoke. That is \n762,857 smokers. If this bill is implemented and, as is predicted by \nmost sources, the price of a pack of cigarettes rises by $2.78 a pack, \nthat means that a blue-collar worker in Alabama, a truck driver, a \nwaitress, will pay $1,015 in additional taxes to the Federal Government \nif they smoke one pack of cigarettes a day.\n  We can say, well, they ought not to be smoking cigarettes. And, \nobviously, we all hope they will quit smoking cigarettes. But the point \nis, this bill clearly assumes they will continue to smoke in vast \nnumbers, because how else then would the bill get over $600 billion to \nspend?\n  So the question we have to ask ourselves is, in the name of punishing \nthe tobacco companies, why are we imposing a tax of $1,015 per year on \nblue-collar workers in Texas and in Alabama and all over the country? \nIt is interesting to note that if this bill goes into effect, the \nFederal tax burden on people making less than $10,000 a year will rise \nby 44.6 percent. So this is a massive confiscatory tax on blue-collar \nworkers.\n  The amazing thing is, by the logic of this bill, they are the \nvictims. These are the people the tobacco companies conspired to induce \nto smoke, targeted with their advertising, many of them when they were \nless than 21 years of age. They now are addicted to nicotine. While the \nbill dubs them as ``victims,'' and promises them that they will be \nhelped, the reality is the victims are being taxed by a massive amount \nto fund this bill. That is a point we must never forget.\n  I have an amendment pending to give some of this money back to blue-\ncollar workers. I have read it written up in many newspapers and being \ncovered in the media. Obviously, I must be doing a poor job of \nexplaining what the objective of this amendment is, or else you would \nhave to conclude that maybe the point is not being portrayed \naccurately. I would never assert that.\n  Basically, what I am trying to do here is to say to blue-collar \nworkers all over America who smoke: Look, this bill wants to raise the \nprice of cigarettes to discourage teenagers and to discourage you from \nsmoking. But rather than impoverishing you, our objective is to change \nthe price of cigarettes and alter behavior, so we are going to take a \nportion, a substantial portion of the money and give it back to blue-\ncollar workers by repealing the marriage penalty for couples that make \n$50,000 a year or less.\n  Now, let me make it clear. In our budget, and the tax cut that will \nflow from it, we are going to cut the marriage penalty for those who \nmake over $50,000 a year. And if we do not pass this bill--and \nincreasingly it looks like we may not--then we are going to repeal the \nmarriage penalty for everybody. But the reason that I focused in on \n$50,000 and below in this bill, is that smoking in America today is \npredominantly a blue-collar phenomenon. Seventy-five percent of these \ntaxes will be paid by people who make $50,000 or less. So the objective \nhere is to give some of the money back to them, so we raise the price \nof cigarettes but we do not pound blue-collar workers literally into \nthe ground with this tax.\n  We have been in a period of chaos since my amendment was introduced \nbecause our colleagues are concerned about losing the money. If you \nlisten to this debate, almost every day, at\n\n[[Page S5749]]\n\nleast a dozen times, proponents of the bill say, ``This is not about \nmoney. This is about smoking. We're raising taxes not because we want \nthe money.'' They say, ``But we're raising taxes because we want to \ndiscourage people from smoking, and studies have shown that price is \nthe most effective way to do that.''\n\n  But their bill belies what they say in two ways: No. 1, they spend \nthe money; and, No. 2, they spend it in the name of getting people to \nstop smoking when, in fact, of the 60 percent reduction in teenage \nsmoking they seek, 50 percent would be produced by raising price alone.\n  So what I am trying to do in my amendment is to simply do this. Let \nthem raise the price of cigarettes, but hold them to their word that \nthis is not about money, and give a substantial amount of the money \nback to blue-collar workers who are paying this tax in the form of a \ntax cut, and the one I have chosen is to repeal the marriage penalty \nfor modest income people.\n  I think the debate about the marriage penalty is well understood. \nWhen we get to my amendment, I will talk about it in detail. But never \nin America should there be a penalty involved for people who fall in \nlove and get married. The average marriage penalty in America is $1,400 \nof additional taxes that people pay for the privilege of being married. \nAs I have said on numerous occasions, my wife is worth $1,400, but I \nthink she ought to get the money and not the Government.\n  And so I am going to hold out on my amendment. This bill will not \npass without my amendment being part of it. And it may not pass with my \namendment being part of it.\n  The argument against the tax cut which I have proposed, which is \nreally a rebate to people who are bearing confiscatory taxes under this \nbill, and the argument against the Coverdell amendment, which seeks to \nbroaden the protection for teenagers from smoking to smoking and drug \nuse, the argument against it is we do not have enough money to do these \nthings.\n  We are collecting over $600 billion in this bill, but they do not \nhave enough money to give some of it back to blue-collar workers and \nthey do not have enough money to try to do something about illegal \ndrugs even though that is the No. 1 concern of parents.\n  In a recent poll, when parents were asked what things they worried \nmost about in terms of things their children might do, 39 percent said \nusing illegal drugs, 16 percent said joining a gang, 9 percent said \ndrinking alcohol, 7 percent said having sex, 7 percent said driving \nrecklessly and 3 percent said chewing or smoking tobacco.\n  What the Coverdell amendment simply says is, while we are protecting \nour children, let us not just protect them from the 3 percent, let us \nprotect them from the concern that 39 percent of our parents list as \ntheir No. 1 concern, and that is using illegal drugs. But yet our \ncolleagues say, we do not have enough money to do this.\n  That leads me to the next point, and that is, what are they using the \n$600 billion for? The cold reality is, not only do they have enough \nmoney to give some back to workers to prevent a massive tax-and-spend \nprogram from coming into effect, not only do we have money to improve \nour war on drugs and to promote the cessation of smoking for teenagers \nand adults, but the plain reality is this bill is awash in money. It is \nobvious from looking at how it is spent. And I want to give you three \nexamples.\n  The first example has to do with the tobacco farmer. Obviously, we \nare all concerned about the impact of this bill on tobacco farmers. But \nwhen you look at this bill it is clear in looking at the tobacco \nfarmers section that no logic whatever has gone into devising this \nsection. In fact, it is clear that this bill has more money than it \nknows what to do with.\n\n  Let me just give two examples, not to belabor the point. The first \nexample is that we are in the midst of a program we call Freedom to \nFarm where we literally have gone through our major commodity groups \nand given farmers transition payments to begin phasing out of the \nprogram. We are in the process for wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, \noats, upland cotton and rice. We paid for wheat, a total over a 7-year \nperiod of $125.34 per acre; for corn, $220.27; for grain sorghum, \n$131.25. The highest payment was for rice, $714.09 per acre. If you add \nup all the amounts, all that we paid all seven major crops combined was \n$1,495.78. If you multiply that times the 740,000 acres we have planted \nin tobacco in America, under the Lugar provision of this bill, if you \npaid the cumulative amount of all the other programs combined, you \nwould pay tobacco farmers $1,106,877,000. The Lugar provision in the \nbill pays tobacco farmers $22,297.29 an acre and they can go right on \ngrowing tobacco. We don't even get the land for $22,297.29 an acre.\n  Now, my purpose here is not to ridicule this provision. My purpose is \nto point out how much money is squandered in this bill. Robert \nSamuelson, in his article in the Washington Post the other day, cites a \nfigure of $92,000 an hour paid to attorneys in these tobacco \nsettlements. Yet we have no provision of this bill setting out some \nlimit. It is my understanding that we are going to try to limit that at \n$1,000 an hour or $2,000 an hour, but in a bill where supposedly we \ncan't give any of the money back to working people who are bearing a \nmassive tax increase, we have enough money to pay tobacco farmers \n$22,297.29 an acre. We have enough money to pay plaintiffs' attorneys \n$92,000 an hour.\n  I have a new one today, and what I thought I would do is begin to do \na new one each day that we do this bill. My new one today is on Native \nAmerican smokers cessation. We have a provision tucked away in this \nbill, one of dozens and dozens of provisions, where we are going to \nprovide up to $7.56 billion for smoker cessation programs among Native \nAmericans. These bills will be targeted at the 1.4 million Native \nAmericans served by the Indian Health Service. Adult Native Americans \nsmoke at a higher rate than the population as a whole--39.2 percent. We \nwill be spending $18,615.55 per adult Native American smoker in this \nprogram. If you have a family in which both adults smoke, we will be \nspending on their smoker cessation programs under this bill--now, hold \nyour hat on this--$37,231.10 for every Native American family who \nsmokes, $37,231.10.\n  Now, we could buy people a Chevrolet Suburban. We could buy every \nsmoking Native American family a Suburban for what this program will \ncost on a per capita basis for smokers.\n  Now, does anybody believe that when we are talking about one little \nprovision--and I could make this point about dozens of other programs, \nand I will as we go further along the debate--but does anybody believe \nthis bill is seriously ``scrubbed'' for how we are spending money, when \nwe are spending $37,231.10 per smoking Native American family on \ncessation? Does anybody view that as anything other than what a \ncandidate for State office in my State called this whole process when \nhe said, ``We won the lottery.''\n  Well, let me remind my colleagues that to some people this money is a \nlottery, but to blue-collar working Americans who will bear the brunt \nof this tax, this is going to be a massive tax increase.\n  Now, even at this late date, what could we do to salvage this bill? I \nthought I would add one final thing before I end my remarks this \nmorning. What could we do that would make it possible to move ahead \nwith this bill? First of all, the bulk of the money we are collecting \nought to go back to the people paying the tax. If the objective of the \ntax is not to tax and spend, if the objective of the tax is not to fund \nmore government, why not raise cigarette taxes, but give the bulk of \nthe money back to the same people by repealing the marriage penalty, by \nmaking health insurance tax deductible for the self-employed, and \npeople who don't get health insurance on their job so that Joe and \nSarah Brown--one a waitress and one a truck driver, neither of which \ngets health insurance on their job--get the same treatment as General \nMotors.\n\n  Repeal the tax penalty. What I would like to see is maybe 60 percent \nto 70 percent of the money given back in tax rebates--not tax cuts \nbecause their taxes are going up. The taxes of Americans making less \nthan $50,000 a year as family income will go up on a massive scale in \nthis bill. If we repeal the marriage penalty for them, if we make \nhealth insurance tax deductible for people who make less than $50,000 a \nyear, their taxes will still go up as a result of this bill, but they \nwon't go up as\n\n[[Page S5750]]\n\nmuch as they would under the existing bill and will raise the price of \ncigarettes without impoverishing people. Now, if my colleagues are \nserious when they say that it is not their objective to get this money \nto spend it, they just want to raise the price of cigarettes, I don't \nunderstand why we don't begin there.\n  Second, we ought to bring drugs and tobacco on an equal level in the \nbill and use half our money for smoking cessation for teenagers and \nhalf our money to try to get teenagers to stop using drugs. Since 1992, \ndrug use among seniors in high school has risen faster than tobacco \nuse. It is a much more serious problem and ought to be treated at least \non par in this bill.\n  Now, if we had a bill that gave some of the money back to the States, \ngave some of the money back in tax rebates to the very people who will \npay the taxes, and then took the rest of the money, throughout all of \nthe massive overkill--you can't spend the money; the levels of money \nspent in this bill are virtually unspendable by any stretch of the \nimagination. Read two paragraphs in here and you can't figure out what \nthey are doing, and we are giving them $10 billion to do it. Read \nanother paragraph, it is not clear what they are doing, and we are \ngiving them $20 billion to do it. What I am saying is throw all that \nstuff out, come up with a coherent, antismoking, antidrug program. If \nyou do that, we have a bill. But if you do that, you do not have what I \nbelieve is driving this bill in many quarters, and that is the desire \nfor a massive tax increase to fund the most rapid growth in government \nspending since Lyndon Johnson became President.\n\n  So if this is not about tax and spend, this bill can still be saved. \nThe way it can be saved is give most of the money back in tax cuts, get \nthe benefit of raising the price of cigarettes, give money to the \nStates, take what is left, split it between drug abatement and smoking \nabatement, and come up with a simple, coherent, practical program to \ntry to abate smoking and drugs for teenagers. If we do that, we can \nstill have a bill. But we are not going to have one of the largest and \ncertainly the most regressive tax increases in American history to fund \na massive growth in Government.\n  I assume my colleagues will vote against cloture. If they vote for \ncloture, they are basically voting to freeze all of these programs in \nplace--two different programs; I was only talking about one of the two \nprograms for tobacco farmers. All of this wasteful spending, all of \nthese massive tax increases, all of this tax-and-spend effort--if \npeople vote for cloture, they are locking that in, because at that \npoint none of these amendments--the Coverdell amendment to bring in \ndrug abatement, my amendment to give a tax rebate to moderate-income \npeople so we don't drive them into poverty with this tax--all these \nthings will be denied. The Senate will not have an opportunity to vote \non them if they vote for cloture. I trust that my colleagues will not \ndo that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the Senator \nfrom Texas. Even when I wasn't on the floor, I heard some of it on the \ntelevision. I must say that what fascinates me about it is that the \nreal bait and switch is not the bait and switch that he has described. \nHe has tried to describe that somehow because this bill defines a \nproblem of smoking and then raises the prices on cigarettes, which is \nwhat the tobacco companies have agreed to do, and the tobacco companies \nhave acknowledged affects the number of people who smoke; but he tries \nto allege the switch is that we don't like the tobacco companies, so \nwhat do we do? We turn around and hurt the victims.\n  Now, in the next breath, at the end of his speech, the Senator says \nwhy don't we just raise the price and give it back to people. Why don't \nwe raise the price, but give it back in tax cuts. The bait and switch \nis that the Senator from Texas doesn't give the money back to the \npeople who pay it. He gives it back to a whole bunch of people, many of \nwhom are doing much better than the people who will pay the higher \ncigarette taxes and are also people earning much more income, and also \npeople who don't smoke. The Senator is willing to say in one breath \nthat here you have these victims being hurt by raising the price of \ncigarettes, but his amendment doesn't help those victims--maybe a very \nfew number of them--because he is willing to give money back under a \nmarriage penalty rebate, which even goes back to people who aren't even \nhurt by the marriage penalty. Talk about bait and switch. That is the \nmost extraordinary bait and switch.\n  In addition to that, the Senator wants to have it both ways. The \nSenator from Texas comes to the floor and says, Why, these folks have \npresented enough evidence to allow me to find the tobacco companies \nguilty. So he acknowledges the evidence is that the tobacco companies \nhave targeted young people and have willfully put a narcotic substance \ninto the mainstream of America and helped our children get addicted to \nit and then lied about it; he acknowledges all of that evidence. He \nsays that is fine; the tobacco companies are terrible, and we ought to \ndo something about it. But what does he say we should do about it? He \ncomplains about raising the tax on the victims, but then he agrees that \nwe ought to leave the tax in place, not give the money back to the \npeople who he describes as victims, and somehow we ought to punish the \ntobacco companies. But he doesn't say how. Well, how are you going to \ndo that?\n\n  I remember a few days ago the Senator from Texas came to the floor \nand said, ``Why don't we have a windfall profit tax?'' Whoever heard of \nany tax on any company for any purpose that isn't subsequently written \ninto their ability to make profits by passing it on to the people who \nbuy their products? The Senator from Texas is, after all, a former \neconomics professor. I know he understands the notion that if it costs \nyou x amount to produce your product and you are in business to make \nmoney, you are going to sell your product to people, you are going to \nwrite in the cost of doing business to the cost of your product. So if \nall of a sudden we were to sort of somehow punish the tobacco companies \nby raising taxes on them, who in America doesn't believe the consumer \nisn't going to pick up the cost? Who in America doesn't believe if you \nwant a better car with more luxurious appointments in it, are they \ngoing to give it to you? No. You are going to pay for it. If the \ncigarette companies are charged in whatever form you want to call it--a \nwindfall profit, an excess, a bad behavior tax, a deception tax, or \nwhatever you want to call it, to punish the companies, you are \nabsolutely going to see that passed on to the consumer in a higher cost \nof a pack of cigarettes.\n  But that is not what we are doing here. The Senator from Texas and \nthose who want to kill this bill and who are working so hard with all \nof these carefully crafted amendments that create tough votes for \npeople in the Senate understand there is only one reason the U.S. \nSenate is presented with legislation that raises the cost of a pack of \ncigarettes, only one reason. It is because every expert in the \ncountry--those who have spent more years studying this issue than any \nof us in the Senate--has told us unequivocally that if you raise the \nprice of cigarettes, you will reduce the number of kids who smoke. That \nis the reason the cost of cigarettes goes up.\n  So the Senator and others who oppose this legislation seem to be all \nover the place. They are willing to accept the price increase. They are \ncrying for the victims, but they don't want to give back the money to \nthe real victims, and at the same time, they are saying this is a big \ntax bill. At the same time, they are willing to live with the price \nincrease that is the ``big tax bill,'' as long as they give it back to \nthe certain things they think are important. So what we are seeing is \nthe greed factor played out on the floor of the Senate in the form of a \nlot of ideological grab bags that are going to try to get vouchers. I \nmean, we are going to have a voucher program here on education taken \nout of the hides of kids who we are trying to stop from smoking.\n  The bottom line is that for every day this debate goes on, as our \nfriends try to stop this legislation in its tracks, more American \nchildren begin smoking--3,000 a day. For the period of time that we \nhave been on the floor of the Senate debating this, 60,000 kids have\n\n[[Page S5751]]\n\nstarted smoking, and 20,000 of those 60,000 kids will some day die \nearly as a result of a tobacco-related disease. That is what this is \nabout. Now, we keep hearing complaints about the amount of money that \nis somehow being spent.\n  I just heard the Senator talk about $38,000 that is going to be spent \nper Native American on a cessation program. Well, here is another \nexample of the kinds of distortion that we see in the debate.\n  First of all, the amount of money that is made available under an \nauthorization only, which has yet to conceivably be appropriated in an \nappropriate amount, is somewhere between $70 million and $196 million \non an annual basis. Is that to go, as the Senator argued, just for \ncessation? The answer is no; that is not what it is for. If this were a \nreal debate about the real issues that really deal with the facts, the \nSenator would note that it is--one of the critical components this bill \nhas tried to recognize is the extraordinarily bad health status that \nexists on Indian reservations and within the Native American community, \nand it tries to deal with that by providing health care equipment, \nfacilities, construction, repair of clinics themselves, and a whole \ngroup of inpatient and outpatient services. So the Senator from Texas \nmay want to come to the floor and be cynical and/or sort of sarcastic \nabout Native Americans and suggest that this bill is going to spend \n$38,000 per Native American to stop from smoking, but that is not what \nthe bill says. That is not what the bill seeks to do. The bill seeks to \nrectify an enormous imbalance that for years has taken place in what is \navailable in terms of health care overall, recognizing that all of that \nplays into any individual's ability to be able to be healthy and stop \nsmoking and reduce other kinds of costs.\n\n  We also heard the Senator talk at some length about this unfair tax \nburden on the average American of $1,015 that the person who smokes is \ngoing to pay in a household under, I think it was about $30,000 on an \nannual basis. The Senator's amendment on the marriage tax doesn't just \ndeal with that $30,000-or-under individual. It goes up to about $50,000 \nand, as I said earlier, rewards people. People are actually rewarded by \nthe marriage tax, because there are some people, depending on how much \nmoney they earn and what their individual incomes are, who come out \nbetter under the current marriage structure in the Tax Code, not worse. \nThey get rewarded, too, under the approach of the Senator from Texas.\n  But far more importantly, the reality is that there are only four \nareas where funding is allocated in this legislation: Public health, \nfarmers, research, and the States. Forty percent of the money that is \nraised in this legislation goes back to the States directly. That very \nconservative fundamental has been one of the things that the \nRepublicans have fought for for years. It is called a block grant. \nThere is a block grant of 40 percent of the money. It is interesting \nthat the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Georgia don't take \nmoney out of the block grant. They do not take money out of the \nfarmers. They don't take money out of research. They only go to the \npublic health components of this bill and cut that by one-half or more. \nHere, it is actually considerably more. This is the funding \ndistribution under the public health account. Under the public health \naccount, which would fund cessation programs, counteradvertising, \nprevention and education, enforcement and learning, antismuggling and \nIndian health, they would actually take, I believe, 82 percent. That \nwould be cut under this approach in order to go into exclusively the \nso-called drug war.\n  Mr. President, if this were a fair-minded effort to try to deal with \nthe problems of this legislation, you might want to try to approach \nthis in a fairer distribution of how you are cutting the funds or how \nyou want to fund the drug war. Some of the efforts the Senator from \nGeorgia wants to make in funding I agree with completely. For years, I \nhave said we don't have a real drug war in America and there is a lot \nmore we could do. But to do it at the expense of those proven efforts \nthat will reduce kids picking up the gateway drug, which is nicotine--\ntobacco--doesn't make sense. It would be far fairer--if we are going to \ntalk about all the money that is being raised and all the money that is \nbeing spent in this legislation, then why not grab back some of the \nmoney from the farmers, or from the research, or from the States? I \nthink the answer to that is fairly obvious as to why it isn't \nhappening. It describes the politics of precisely where we find \nourselves today.\n  Mr. President, we keep coming back to the reality. The Senator talks \nabout the victims and the $1,015 they spend. Nobody is forcing them to \ndo that. One should have a little sympathy, I suppose, because the \ntobacco companies so adroitly and intensely worked to get them addicted \nwhen they were young kids, recognizing that 86 percent of the adults in \nAmerica who today smoke and are addicted began smoking as children.\n  We ought to probably feel something about the compulsion that sends \nthem to buy those cigarettes. But if, in fact, raising the price will \nreduce even some of them smoking, as the tobacco companies have \nacknowledged--the R.J. Reynolds memoranda, the Philip Morris memoranda, \nall document that adults were reduced in smoking by the price increases \nof the 1980s. So it stands to reason that they would be reduced in \ntheir smoking levels by this price increase in the late 1990s. But \ntheir price increase in the 1990s would be accompanied by very \nsignificant efforts to train professionals, to educate children, to \nreach into our schools, and create a climate within which the entire \nattitude about smoking and drugs and health will change.\n  I would suggest respectfully to the Senator from Georgia that nothing \nwould help our antidrug efforts more than some of the value-building, \ncharacter-building efforts that are part of the counseling and \ncessation programs that build sufficient self-esteem and awareness \namong our young people that they will decide not to smoke. Quite \nclearly, if you have built up the courage and the capacity to say you \nare going to refuse a cigarette, you are most likely building the \nfoundation to be the kind of person who can also say no to marijuana, \nwhich is a form of cigarette. So I think there is a real contradiction \nin what is happening here--that, unfortunately, to strip away the \nability to be able to pursue these proven efforts is significant.\n  In addition to that, one of the things that the Senator from Texas \nand others vilify so much is the category under counteradvertising. Mr. \nPresident, a number of tobacco industry documents make it clear how \nmuch the industry targeted young kids as young as 13 years old. While \nthe Senator says, ``I accept the notion that the tobacco companies are \nevil for having done this and they would be found guilty for doing \nit,'' the fact is that it takes a certain counteradvertising effort, \nwhich is very expensive to counter, to contradict, and undo that \ntargeting process. You can't just acknowledge it and walk away from it. \nYou can't just say, ``I accept. Let's find them guilty, but we are \ngoing to give them probation or even less than that.'' The question is, \nAre you going to do something about undoing the consequences of it? The \nfact is that at present there is no national antitobacco public \neducation campaign that counters the protobacco imagery that has been \npresented to both adults and children by the tobacco companies.\n  Very few States have the resources to be able to undertake the kind \nof long-term, sustained effort necessary, I think Nancy Reagan proved \nbeyond any doubt whatsoever in her steadfast and, frankly, significant \ncampaign in the 1980s on the ``Just Say No'' Program. I join with my \ncolleague in saying that I think there has been a retrenchment from \nthat. I think we have gone backwards. I think the administration has \ndropped the ball to some degree in its efforts to help counter \nnationally the kind of efforts we want. ``Just Say No'' had a profound \nimpact on at least casual use in this country, and we saw the figures \ngo down. Why on Earth then, given that record, would we want to turn \naway from an effort to have the counter media effort here and have \nantitobacco advertisements?\n  The 1994 Surgeon General's report indicates that the mass media are \nparticularly appropriate channels for tobacco education among young \npeople who are heavily exposed to and often greatly interested in the \nmedia. Several States, my own among them--\n\n[[Page S5752]]\n\nMassachusetts, California, and Arizona--have developed programs that \nare particularly effective. They work. We have seen a reduction in \nsmoking as a consequence of those efforts. But we have learned that \nthey have to be sustained and they need to be of even greater impact. \nThat means creating this national strategy and having the funding to do \nit. So that is in here. That is one of the efforts that is being wiped \nout by the current proposal as well as by most of the criticisms that \nwe have heard.\n  And the cessation programs themselves--it is just like the debate I \nremember we had on the crime bill. People came to the floor of the \nSenate, and there was such scorn and derision about midnight \nbasketball, and such scorn and derision about some of these programs \nthat take place in the boys and girls clubs, or the YMCA or the YWCA. \nPeople were able to say those are somehow tax-and-spend programs.\n  But what we have learned is that they really are the lifeline for a \nlot of kids in this country who have no parents at home, whose school \ndoors shut at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and who are, according to the \nCarnegie Foundation report some 7 years ago, most likely to get into \ntrouble either with an unwanted teenage pregnancy or with some problem \nwith drugs, introduced on the street in the afternoons when there is no \nadult supervision or structure in their lives. That is a proven fact \nall across this country. Talk to the president of the Boys and Girls \nClub. Talk to any of the people who dedicate their lifetimes trying to \ntake care of kids who are stranded, alone, without sufficient parental \nsupport. Those people will tell you it makes a difference to have an \nadult role model, to have adult supervision, to have structure in their \nlives.\n  I recently went to a middle school in Charlestown, in Boston, and \ntalked to a lot of kids in the middle school aged 10 to 14 years old. I \nwas dumbstruck to learn that more than 15 percent of those kids aged 10 \nto 14 were going home in the afternoon, at 2 o'clock, to households \nthat had no adult in them for 4 to 5 hours, for the rest of the day. \nThat is the kind of program that now meets with derision on the floor \nof the Senate, where, specifically targeted with respect to children, \nwe would have the ability to reduce these kids' exposure to a lot of \nthe vicissitudes of life, not the least of which would be smoking and/\nor drug dealing and other kinds of problems that arise in the course of \nthe day, unsupervised.\n  We believe what the Surgeon General and other experts have suggested, \nwhich is that there are some 48 million Americans out there who \ncurrently smoke and want to quit, who would like to quit, and they \nspend billions of dollars every year on patches, on nicotine \nalternatives, on chewing gums, on counseling, on hypnosis, and on all \nkinds of other efforts just to quit smoking. But one of the most \nsuccessful ways to quit smoking is to help kids never start.\n  In Massachusetts, we have a program underway. We wish we could reach \nmore kids. If we pass this legislation, we could reach more kids. But \nright now, limited as it is, we have been able to reach about a million \nkids in the State. We have been able to reduce smoking by 30 percent. \nThat is a very significant level. That saves lives, saves money, and \nultimately provides a much healthier country.\n  So that is the choice here. My hope is that a little bit more common \nsense and a little less effort to stop this legislation in its tracks \nwould guide some of the amending process we are going through. I will \njoin my colleagues and say I think there is a lot of money here. I \nthink some of it might, indeed, be better spent. There are ways we \ncould constructively arrive at that. But if all we are going to do is \ncome to the floor and fight about these amendments that carve out and \ncarve out, with a whole lot of issues involved in them that have \nalready proven very tricky and very contentious and very divisive on \nthe Senate floor in previous incarnations, if we keep revisiting them, \none can only interpret that, unfortunately, as an effort to either \nderail or slow down or stop the fundamental legislation we are trying \nto achieve ourselves.\n  There is a simple bottom line here. You cannot argue this every \nsingle way--certainly, I suppose you can, and be inconsistent. That \nnever bothered some people around here. But it seems to me if we are \ngoing to try to achieve a significant piece of legislation that will \naffect kids, you can't accept one notion that you ought to raise the \nprice and then cut away the capacity to put into place the significant \ncessation, counteradvertising, and other kinds of efforts that would \nmost impact the level of teenage smoking, which is what this \nlegislation is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note Senator Stevens is on the floor \ndesiring to speak. Might I ask, is he on a short timeframe? Does he \nwant to speak now?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No. I thank my colleague very much.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there are no time limits, are there, on \nspeeches at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are no restrictions. We are under \nconsent to adjourn at 12:30.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. At 12:30; I hope I don't take that long.\n  Mr. President, I wish I could have been on the floor when Senator \nGramm spoke a little earlier, because I would have risen when he stated \nwhat we ought to try to do and what components we ought to try to agree \nupon to get a bill. I think he is right on. For those who were not \nlistening, let me see if I can repeat.\n  First of all, let me suggest, in the past--I have noticed that we get \nlarge groups of lobbyists in a room promoting causes in only two \ncircumstances. One, when there is a giant tax bill or tax reform \nmeasure, the halls are lined with them. That prompted Senator Dole, \nonce, to speak of the ``Gucci gultch.'' The only other time I see a \nlarge group in a room joined together lobbying, sending notes, watching \ntelevision, is when there is a huge amount of money to spend. I have \nnot seen large groups for any other causes. Guess what. In this case, \nit is obvious. The proponents of the bill have nothing in mind for tax \ncuts. So this large group meeting, with just scores of people watching \nevery speech on the Senate floor and then sending people out to all the \noffices to get things done is because this is a giant spending bill.\n  There is no one more concerned about what is happening to young \npeople and tobacco than I am. I was a smoker for a long time. I didn't \nstart when I was a youngster, however. Fortunately, for me, I quit. It \nhas been 8 or 9 years--I can't remember--and I am very lucky. I have a \nlarge group of wonderful children and not a single one smokes. My wife \ndoesn't smoke. I can hardly imagine what a burden I was on them when I \nhad these cigarettes around all the time. I even remember the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, the distinguished Senator from Florida, \nSenator Chiles, who had to sit there while I smoked through all these \nmarkups. He bought me one of those suction machines. I would have to \nput my cigarettes on it and then it would suck up all the smoke. At \nleast, he said, I could make it through these 10- to 12-hour markups.\n  But, frankly, if we knew how to make our children quit smoking with \n$150 billion, and we said that is going to really keep them off \ncigarettes, and cancer rates are going to come down and the adult \npopulation is going to imitate the kids and they are going to stop \nsmoking--because we have not talked about adults. I mean, they are \nsmoking, too.\n  As a matter of fact, those in the health business of the United \nStates and health care--clearly something admirable and something we \nare all concerned about--they are the lobbyists for this bill. They all \nstarted off with something in mind. They had their pet projects, and \neverybody would talk about them as if they were related to teenage \nsmoking. Everybody would come to the floor and speak about the \nstatistics on teenagers smoking and talk about ``that is what we were \nhere for,'' while the provision of the bill that had to do with teenage \nsmoking is about one fiftieth of the bill in terms of pages. The rest \nof it is programs, programs we are supposed to fund and money we are \nsupposed to give back to the States.\n  I wonder how many Senators know that of the amount we give back to \nthe States, we tell them how to spend at\n\n[[Page S5753]]\n\nleast half of it. When you look at the list, one wonders what the \ndifferent programs the States are going to spend the money on have to \ndo with teenage smoking. They have nothing to do with it. But it is \nsuggested the Governors chose the programs--and they ought to have the \nright to--and we ought to comport with it and say ``that is all you can \nuse it for,'' because, after all, they spent so much State tax money \ntaking care of those people in their States who got lung cancer and \nwere hospitalized, and had these very large treatment expenditures that \ncame out of Medicaid.\n  Let me tell you, it is absolutely amazing that we are so willing to \nput a huge portion--40 percent--of what we are supposed to take in \nunder this bill to compensate the States for health care costs when the \nbig health care costs were actually paid for by the U.S. Government \ntaxpayers and the U.S. Government, because Medicare and Medicaid, in \nparticular Medicare, is an Federal program, not a State program. This \nbill doesn't put a penny in it. It is still going bankrupt because of \nthe enormous drag on that program of more than $25 billion a year for \ncancer-related smoking diseases.\n  Medicaid, I know in my State, is paid for 75 percent by the Federal \nGovernment. Some States were 50; some States were 65. I think it is \nmore than logical that a very large portion of anything we get here, if \nwe put this together, should either go back to the taxpayers or will go \nback to the U.S. Government to help defray the expenses that we put \ninto programs, like Medicare, which tax the American working men and \nwomen in a very, very regressive manner.\n  Having said that, I believe, and I state publicly right here today, \nthat I think a bill can be put together. I am not sure that it isn't \ntoo late for many because they are already part of the group that wants \nto spend all this money on all these different programs that are \nsupposed to be directed at our children smoking, but I believe there \nought to be a part of this program that goes back to the States. I \ndon't know that there has to be 40 percent, and I don't know that it \nhas to be for the programs that are dictated in this bill for the \nStates.\n  I also believe there ought to be a major antismoking and antidrug \ncomponent to this bill, and it ought to be rather substantial. I \ncertainly compliment the distinguished Senator from Georgia for the \namendment that he has which brings front and center an even more \ndisastrous habit which is catching on with our teenagers, more \ndisastrous than smoking, and that has to do with illegal and illicit \ndrugs from marijuana to the hard stuff, to cocaine. Now, the new surge \nis even something different from cocaine. We thought we were doing some \ngood in that regard. Now heroin is back in vogue and use is growing. I \ncompliment Senators Coverdell and Craig for offering this amendment.\n  If we decided to give back to the States some but not necessarily as \nmuch money as this bill says, if we had a major program in illegal drug \nprevention akin to the amendment which the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia and his cosponsor, Senator Craig, have put before us, and then \nwe did something for research through the NIH, or related, and gave the \ntaxpayers of this country a break, especially those who are going to \nsee the very onerous cost of cigarettes impinge on their lives because \ncigarettes may be as high as $3.50 to $4.50 a pack, if a bill like this \npasses, collecting a rather substantial amount of money--and I believe \nany bill ought to have a component which says let's reduce taxes, and \nsince almost everybody on both sides of the aisle--maybe we quibble \nover details--but everybody knows the most antifamily, antichildren \nprovision of the Tax Code is the one that punishes families who have \ntwo members working for a living as compared to two single people \nmaking the same amount--the marriage penalty. It is antifamily, it is \nantichildren, and clearly, that ought to be fixed. This is a rare \nopportunity to do that. If we can come together on a stripped-down bill \nthat got rid of a lot of the things in this bill that really are not \nnecessary and are not directly related to the problem at hand, we might \nmake some headway.\n  I also remind everyone that whenever any of us come here and say \nlet's not pass a brand new major tax-and-spend bill under the \nnomenclature and title of helping our children quit smoking--Secretary \nShalala said that if, indeed, the FDA regulations that they propose \ncould be put in effect--and I will add, if they are constitutional--\nthat they alone have been predicted by the Administration to reduce \nsmoking by 50 percent in 7 years. That is a rather significant proposal \nand a rather significant assessment by an administration about teenage \nsmoking.\n  Why are we in such a hurry to put this big tax on and spend it for \nall these other things under the emphasis--I think ill-placed \nemphasis--that we are helping people quit smoking, when if we just \ntried those FDA regulations, if they are constitutional, they would \nrestrain it by 50 percent in 7 years? I doubt we would achieve a higher \ngoal even if we enact this huge tax and spend bill. In fact, I am not \nat all sure that we will do better.\n  If you look around the country, as I have in my home State, New \nMexico recently completed, I say to my friend from Georgia, a drug, \nalcohol, and tobacco use survey of public high school students around \nthe State of New Mexico. Not surprising, cigarette use has increased \nslightly. It is now 54 percent at the 12th grade level. In 1993, it was \n47.\n  What is more shocking about the results of the survey is how much \nillegal drug use has increased in the past 5 years. In my State--I was \nlooking at the chart which Senator Coverdell used--and in my State, \nmarijuana use by 12th graders is up 38 percent; cocaine is up 144 \npercent; and 51 percent of the students in New Mexico who smoke \nmarijuana said they got it from friends at school. We know that drug \nuse often correlates with illegal behavior. I said ``often,'' I didn't \nsay ``always.''\n  Sixty-three percent of the kids detained in New Mexico's juvenile \njustice system for violent behavior reported they used drugs on a \nweekly basis prior to their arrests. So nationally, the statistics are \nno more encouraging, and the Senator from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, \nhas stated those in his emphasis as to why we ought to adopt his \namendment.\n  I support that amendment because it goes after illegal drug use from \na number of fronts, and I am particularly pleased that in addition to \npromoting an anti-illegal drug use campaign, it does give some \nadditional resources to those who are out there in the trenches \nfighting this war.\n  I say to Senator Coverdell, I suggest that in the State of New \nMexico, a major group of policemen--probably 40 percent of the law \nenforcement in the State is one police entity--they informed us and put \nout an article which they really believe there ought to be more money \nput into law enforcement. Particularly I will tell you what they are \nvery worried about. They are worried about the fact they are going to \nget stuck with all the black market and illegal sales of tobacco, and \nthey are going to be the ones to go out and enforce it. They truly \nbelieve at these prices it is going to be enormous in a State like \nours; that it will come across from Mexico and all different places, \nand they are going to just be besieged.\n  Obviously, I have not thought of a way to help local law enforcement \nin this bill, but it is not too far-fetched as part of that provision \nwhich seeks to help us with reference to the black market, that we \nought to give some thought to our local law enforcement people.\n  This afternoon or tomorrow I am going to speak on another subject, \nbut I will say to Senators, I am continually amazed at what I find in \nthis bill as page after page is looked at.\n  I have two reports here. One is called ``Reducing the Health \nConsequences of Smoking,'' 1989. The other is called ``The Health \nConsequences of Using Smokeless Tobacco, Advisory Committee to the \nSurgeon General.'' And there is a third report referred to in a \nprovision of this bill that we can't even get the report, so we have \nonly the executive summary of 1986, a report to the Surgeon General.\n  All I want to say about it right now is, believe it or not, there is \na provision in this bill--I do not know who wrote it --but it says the \nburden of proof in the courts of America will be shifted to the tobacco \ncompanies with reference to any illness, disease, infirmity, that is\n\n[[Page S5754]]\n\nreported in any three of these reports--even if it is mentioned. It \nmeans all you have to do is go file in the future, file a cookie-cutter \nlawsuit, and the tobacco company must disprove that your ailment or \nyour disease or your condition came from smoking.\n  This afternoon, or when I get the floor again, I will go through a \nlist of what that is going to mean. I mean, if ever--if ever--there was \na lawyers' relief bill, beyond that which we have been discussing in \nterms of their recompense for the settlements, it is here.\n  We have been looking around for tort reform. And here we have exactly \nthe wrong kind of tort reform. I do not believe very many Senators know \nthat this provision is in this bill. I do not know whether I will try \nto take it out. I would just like to make sure it is well known.\n  I do not want to leave the impression, and never have, that tobacco \ncompanies should not pay for what they have wrought on this society in \nterms of misleading advertising and the effects of smoking. But to say \nthat three reports that compiles the research of every ailment or \ndisease that has been researched to try and find a causal relationship \nbetween that ailment and cigarette smoking should be incorporated by \nreference in this bill is not a good way to legislate. Under this \nprovision a plaintiff would not have to worry about proving it anymore, \njust allege it, sue for it, and the tobacco company must then prove \nthat they did not cause it.\n  That provision has been researched of late, and we will talk about it \nin a little more detail--how many thousands and thousands of lawsuits \nthat would precipitate from people with diseases and ailments who never \neven gave a thought until now that they might find somebody who would \npay for that; namely, the tobacco companies.\n  So I say to those who are very, very well-intentioned, who support \nthis measure, I have said before--and the bill was redone--I said \nbefore that it was far too cumbersome, had way too many agencies and \nbureaus and bureaucratic innovations in it that nobody should really \nsupport. It was fixed somewhat. And I still seriously question how it \ngot put together, how these kinds of provisions could find themselves \nin there with no discussion.\n  To me, this is one bill that I am very glad is taking a long time to \nget through the Senate. We normally say discussion on the Senate floor \nis good because it lets everybody understand what is going on and what \nthe issues are. Frankly, I do not think we would have found out about \nall the things in this bill if we had not been down here for a couple \nweeks. It is just a very difficult job, very hard to do.\n  So let me summarize. I believe the amendment ought to pass, because \nif we are going to raise significant money, as purported in this bill, \nwe ought to go after more than just the problems that teenage tobacco \nsmoking brings to our country. We ought to try our best, in a very \nreasonable and well directed way, to spend money trying to get a better \nhandle on illicit and illegal drug use by our children and, in fact, by \nthe American population. So I hope that passes. I hope cloture is not \ninvoked.\n  But I say that I believe it is beginning to come to the surface that \na bill could be put together. It surely cannot be the bill that is \nbefore us. As a matter of fact, I think probably it ought to just get \nredrafted, if people want to put a bill together. Essentially, it ought \nto take care of the States in some way, not necessarily 40 percent. It \nought to have a very significant tax cut, especially for those American \nfamilies who are going to pay the tobacco tax--pay most of the tobacco \ntax. If we do that, it ought to be directed at the marriage penalty, \nperhaps some health related tax provisions, but that ought to take the \nlead. And we ought to put a major program together in trying to really \ndeclare war through advertising and other initiatives to aid in the \nprevention of smoking among kids. And, as I indicated, it is corollary \nwith reference to illegal drugs.\n\n  Another component could be research at NIH on cancer and related \nkinds of research. And that is probably doable in this country. And if \nyou are going to spend some additional money, you can probably justify \nit there as well as anywhere else, although I would suggest that if you \nhave a big bill like this with a lot of resources, we can bring \namendments to the floor, one after another, showing areas where the \nU.S. Government is not doing what it ought to do in certain areas of \nendeavor that are our responsibility as a nation. And if it is needed, \nand doing a better job, we could have a myriad of amendments that we \ncould let people vote on and decide what to do.\n  For instance, I give you one. It is totally unrelated, but some \nprovisions in this bill are also. When will the U.S. Government pay for \nIndian schools in America?--which are falling down around the kids, \ntotally ill-equipped, are way beyond anything we would have non-Indian \nkids in in the United States. And the only entity that is supposed to \npay for it is the Federal Government. It is not a school board, not a \nState; it is the Federal Government. There is a backlog of over $750 \nmillion. And we are leaving those kids out there, watching the suicide \nrates go up, watching the illegal drug rate go up, watching all the \nsocial problems they have, and every year we take care of one or two \nschools.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for those who have counted out the tobacco \nlobby, for those who said the tobacco giants are now flat on their \nbacks and have no strength left on Capitol Hill, I am afraid the last \nvote is an indication that there is still life in that tobacco lobby. \nThis vote of 42 to 56 on a motion to bring to a halt the debate and \nbring to a vote the tobacco bill is a sad commentary on where we are \ntoday.\n  This legislation, S. 1415, which is the product of the Senate \nCommerce Committee and the hard work of both Republican and Democratic \nSenators, deserves a vote, not just because it is on the floor today \nbut because what this bill sets out to do is so important for this \nNation. Instead, what we have seen are the opponents of this \nlegislation come to this floor over the last 3 weeks, producing \namendments to grind us down, mire us down in debate, sink us in this \nmorass of technicalities and procedures so we never get to this bill.\n  Many of my colleagues, Senators, have come to this floor and offered \nvery important amendments, interesting amendments. They are not related \nto tobacco and children though. An amendment comes to the floor from \none of the Senators, ``Let's talk about reforming the Internal Revenue \nCode.'' That is a good idea. We should do that on a regular basis. But \non this bill? Why on this bill? This bill, which is designed to stop \nthe addiction of our children to tobacco products, why should it be a \nforum for this debate on reforming the Internal Revenue Code?\n  Another Senator comes to the floor and says, ``Let's talk about the \nproblem of narcotics in America.'' It is a terrible problem. It is a \nterrible problem. Everyone agrees with that. Every parent agrees with \nthat. Yet, to raise that as an issue on this bill? To suggest, as part \nof this debate, we ought to talk about school vouchers? School \nvouchers, that is an important debate, too. But why in this bill? Why \nin this legislation, this historic piece of legislation that gives us a \nchance, for the first time in this Nation's history, to do something \nmeaningful about tobacco, are we being diverted by so many amendments?\n  Do you know what the order of business before the Senate is at this \nmoment? I can tell you what it is. You may want to write this down. For \nthose with scorecards at home, be prepared with your pencils ready. We \nare currently debating the Coverdell amendment to the Durbin amendment \nto the Gramm motion to recommit with two underlying Gregg amendments \nstill pending.\n  Hard to follow? It is designed to be hard to follow. It is designed \nto tangle us up in procedure so we never get to vote on this bill and \nnever vote on this issue.\n  The tobacco companies have to be cheering after that last vote, 42 to \n56, so we continue to mire ourselves in this procedural mess and never \nget to the bottom line. What is the bottom line? Let me show you in \nthis graph. This is the bottom line. The smoking rates among high \nschool seniors in America are at a 17-year high. As I speak today, in \nthe Senate gallery we have many visitors and friends and a lot of \nyoungsters who are here from schools. You know what I am talking about. \nYou know what is happening in your grade schools and in your junior \nhigh schools and in your high schools--more and more children are \nstarting to smoke. I have never in my life ever met a parent who has \ncome to me and said: ``Great news, I just got the best news. My \ndaughter just called, she started smoking.'' Have you ever heard that? \nI never heard that from any parent. It is a troubling piece of \ninformation which every parent dreads.\n\n  More and more kids, now over half the high school seniors in America, \nare taking up this deadly habit. Since we started this mindless debate, \n66,000 children in America have started smoking for the first time. \nTobacco companies have a big smile on their face: More and more kids \naddicted to their products, kids who will spend a fortune over their \nlifetimes on this addiction and ultimately a third of them to be \nvictims of an early grave, because of this tobacco addiction. Yet here \nwe are on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Here we are with this historic \nopportunity, with bipartisan legislation, to do what is right, to pass \nlegislation and say to the tobacco companies, ``The game is over. We \nare no longer going to allow you to appeal to and addict our children. \nWe are going to ask you be held accountable, accountable for reducing \nthe percentage of children who are smoking.'' And, by overwhelming \nvotes, Senators on both sides of the aisle supported my amendment last \nweek to hold the tobacco companies specifically liable if kids continue \nto be lured into this addiction. Yet, over the weekend one of the \nleaders here in the Senate says the tobacco bill is all but dead--all \nbut dead, after all this work.\n  Keep in mind, we are not just talking about another piece of \nlegislation in the Senate. We are talking about the No. 1 preventable \ncause of death in America today. Members of the Senate, Democrats and \nRepublicans, who missed this opportunity, will, frankly, have to answer \nfor it--perhaps not in the next election, but maybe at a later time--as \nto why at this moment in history, when we had the chance to seize the \nopportunity and do something to help our children, we failed to do so.\n  I continue to believe we have a chance to pass this legislation. We \nhave Democrats and Republicans alike who believe it is not only right \nbut timely. But if we allow this procedural morass to continue, if we \ndo not bring to a vote the critical amendments necessary so we can \nbring this bill to final passage, then the clock runs out.\n  As I said once before, I guess time is on the side of those who want \nto stop this legislation. But history is not on their side. History \nwill judge them harshly. Having been given this opportunity to pass an \nimportant bill, they missed it. They missed it, to the detriment not of \ntheir own political careers but of their children. And the money to be \nraised from this bill, the money that comes from a tobacco tax--that is \nright, t-a-x, tobacco tax; call it a fee or what you like, I call it a \ntobacco tax--that money is going in for specific purposes to help \nchildren: Smoking cessation clinics, antismoking advertising, and \nmedical research.\n  I will stand in the State of Illinois, or wherever I am called on, to \ndefend that vote. I think asking smokers to pay more for their product \nto reduce the sales to children and put money in the Treasury for those \npurposes is a defensible thing to do and not something we should shrink \naway from. I have heard\n\n[[Page S5756]]\n\nall this argument on the other side about this bill: Senator McCain's \nbill is going to create some massive Federal bureaucracy. Not so. Not \nso. This bill basically does, in self-executing ways, what we sought to \nachieve in the beginning, when 42 State attorneys general filed \nlawsuits across the United States saying to tobacco companies: Your day \nis over. You are going to be held accountable. This came to a basic \nagreement about a year ago. We are building on that agreement.\n\n  I salute them for their initiative in allowing us to reach this \npoint. But, will this Senate miss this opportunity, as we missed the \nopportunity to pass campaign finance reform? Will we miss this \nopportunity to pass comprehensive tobacco legislation? This last vote, \n42 to 56, is an indication we have a long way to go. Cooler heads have \nto prevail. Senators on both sides of the aisle have to understand, \nthis is more than gamesmanship on some amendment tree; this is \nfundamentally a question about the public health of America and the \npublic health of our children.\n  What we and the American people are waiting for is leadership, \nleadership here in the Senate to bring action to a close on this \nlegislation. While we wait for that leadership, the advertising \nindustry is waiting, too, pens poised, ready to write the next \ngeneration of ads for cigarettes to hook children. That will happen if \nthis bill fails.\n  The lawyers are waiting, too. The lawyers are waiting with their \nlegal briefs in hand to continue the next round of State litigation, \nand that will continue, month after month and year after year, if this \nbill fails.\n  The parents are waiting. The parents of America are waiting to see \nwhether or not their children will be able to escape this addiction to \ntobacco while they go to school and while they grow up. Passing this \nbill will help those parents.\n  And, yes, the tobacco companies are waiting, too. They are waiting to \nsee whether the Senate will drop the ball and give them another year of \nobscene profits at the expense of our children.\n  The President of the United States and this administration have shown \nextraordinary leadership on this issue. No President in history has \never stuck his neck out as far as President Clinton in fighting the \ntobacco lobby. He has taken a lot of grief for it. There have been a \nlot of people who invested a lot of money in opposition to folks who \nsupported it. But he was right to do it. Those of us on the floor of \nthe Senate who have been fighting this tobacco battle for over a decade \nhave dreamed of this day and this opportunity.\n  And that is why it is so sad that we find ourselves in this gridlock, \nthis procedural gridlock. I am sorry that the motion to close down \ndebate and limit the amendments to those germane to the bill did not \nprevail. A similar motion will be offered tomorrow, and I hope that \nmotion will prevail. In the meantime, I hope Democrats and Republicans \nwill join Senator McCain and Senator Kerry of Massachusetts in a \nbipartisan effort to pass this landmark legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague from Illinois, I \nunderstand his frustration. I understand the goals that he is \nattempting to reach, and I agree with him, but I am one of those who \nvoted against cloture. In his 15-minute speech, he did not mention the \nfarmer, the farmer who could wake up in the morning if we pass this \nbill with some amendments in it and be out of business in 36 months. \nThe Senator from Illinois wouldn't mind that, but I certainly do.\n  I don't object to smoke-free schools. Ninety percent and better in my \nState, a tobacco State, are opposed to underage smoking. We have no \nproblems with that. But be fair to those and help those who have a life \nin front of them based on a legal product. They have had no part in all \nthese problems of lies and documents and court cases, but are down \nthere living by the sweat of their brow. And we are not talking about \nthe farmer.\n  Look at this bill that is before us and the amendments that have been \nadopted or that are pending, and you want cloture to be invoked on that \nbill and be the bill that goes out of here? I cannot allow that. I \ncannot in good conscience allow cloture to be voted on that bill and my \nfarmers not be taken care of.\n  I agree with the Senator from Illinois--of course I do--we have lost \nthe target. We have lost the target. Someone figured up the other day \nthat if everything that has been introduced and is in this bill is \ntaken care of, we will spend 169 percent of the estimated amount of \nmoney that is going to be raised in the next 5 years.\n  Mr. President, I am one of those--and I admit it, it is on the \nrecord--but I want people to know why I voted against cloture and will \ncontinue to vote against cloture until we can get some consensus as it \nrelates to my farmers.\n  The Senator from Illinois said he wants leadership. I think our \nleader is doing one heck of a job. I think he is pushing the point. I \nthink he is doing the right thing for the position he is in, and I \nthink the leadership on the other side is making one mistake after the \nother after the other after the other, because of what they are trying \nto do--to make a lifesaving piece of legislation into a tax cut bill. \nWe need to understand that, and I think the American people will.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that before we have too many cloture \nvotes and are criticized for voting no on cloture that we can have \nsomething that is palatable or even reasonable--even reasonable--that \nwe can vote on to do the right thing for those we represent. I \nrepresent 65,000 small farm families, and I intend to see that, to the \nbest of my ability, every one of those are treated fairly. Up to now, \nthe answer has been no, and the answer will continue to be no on \ncloture until such time that we can see some daylight as it relates to \nthose families that are struggling down in my State of Kentucky. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2451\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I, of course, am aware of the \nlongstanding concern of the Senator from Illinois about tobacco, but I \nthink to suggest that some of the amendments that are being discussed \nhave some meaning other than their stated purpose is not appropriate. \nThe amendment before the Senate is an effort to make sure that any \nlegislation that deals with teenage addiction embrace all the \ncomponents of teenage addiction. Yes, smoking, but, yes, drug abuse and \nthe smoking of marijuana which, I point out, is five times more \ndangerous than smoking a cigarette--five times.\n  The principal drug abuse and addiction on behalf of teenagers is \nsmoking, not cigarettes, but marijuana. I have long felt that for us to \ncome to the Senate and talk about the dangers of tobacco and the \naddiction of tobacco and be absolutely silent on the question of \nteenage addiction to drugs is unconscionable policy.\n  Mr. President, just yesterday on June 8, the President of the United \nStates at the United Nations in New York said:\n\n       Ten years ago, the United Nations adopted a path-breaking \n     convention to spur cooperation against drug trafficking. \n     Today the potential for that kind of cooperation has never \n     been greater or more needed. As divisive blocks and barriers \n     have been dismantled around the world, as technology has \n     advanced and democracy has spread, our people benefit more \n     and more from nations working and learning together. Yet the \n     very openness that enriches our lives is also exploited by \n     criminals, especially drug traffickers. Today we come here to \n     say no nation is so large and powerful that it can conquer \n     drugs alone; none is too small to make a difference. All \n     share a responsibility to take up the battle. Therefore, we \n     will stand as one against this threat to our security and our \n     future. The stakes are high, for the drug empires erode the \n     foundations of democracy, corrupt the integrity of market \n     economies, menace the lives, the hopes and future of families \n     on every continent. Let there be no doubt that this is \n     ultimately a struggle for human freedom.\n\n  Those are pretty lofty remarks, but where is the administration in \nsupport of our attempts to confront these drug cartels, to confront the \nfact that the target of these cartels are kids age 8 to 14 years old--8 \nto 14? Yes, tobacco is hazardous, and it has been abusive to health and \nit is increasing. Over the last 6 years, it has increased about 40 \npercent.\n\n[[Page S5757]]\n\n  What about drug abuse? What about these points the President made to \nthe world? It has increased 135 percent in the last 6\\1/2\\ years--135 \npercent. And his team, the President's team the day following these \nremarks is blocking votes on trying to make a component of teenage \naddiction embrace and confront drugs. It is OK to talk the talk, but \nyou have to walk the walk.\n  Mr. President, this administration does not have a good record on the \nissue of teenage drug addiction. It does not have a good record. It \ncame into office--if we are talking about the troubles of drug abuse--\nit came into office, and it closed down the drug office, for all \npractical purposes. It came into office and it massively reduced \ninterdiction efforts in the Caribbean and on the border. As a result, \nMr. President, massive amounts of new drugs are flowing into the \ncountry almost unfettered.\n  As a result of that, the price of these drugs has collapsed, utterly \ncollapsed, and for some of these drugs, the price has dropped 70, 80, \n100 percent--not 100--70 percent. So no message--more kids are unaware \nof the fact that drugs are dangerous. In fact, several years ago--2 \nyears ago--that number was at the lowest ever. The number of children \nwho perceived drugs to be dangerous to them was at an all-time low. So \nwhy are we surprised, if they do not think it is dangerous, that \nsuddenly the use of it would just skyrocket and go up 135 percent?\n  Mr. President, framing what has happened here is important: Quit \ntalking about it; dismantled interdiction; closed the drug czar office; \nmassive amounts of new drugs in the country; no message to kids or \nparents about the dangers of drugs--boom, a new epidemic, a new \nepidemic. One million-plus new teenagers caught up in drugs.\n  Mr. President, there are 1.1 million prisoners in America today. Over \n800,000 of them, 800,000 out of 1.1 million, are there on drug-related \ncharges--indirect or direct. And $67 billion a year it is costing this \ncountry.\n  The No. 1 problem for teenagers, according to teenagers, according to \nparents, according to all statistics--and not by a slim margin; by an \nenormous margin, 2, 3, 4 to 1--they have said that is the No. 1 problem \nour kids face, smoking marijuana, getting in the drug culture, the No. \n1 problem. It is accessible everywhere, and it is cheap. The other side \nsays, ``Oh, this is not appropriate to be talking about this on the \ntobacco bill.'' What in the world does it take to be appropriate?\n  Five times more dangerous to smoke it, mind-altering, 800,000 \nprisoners, $67 billion a year, the principal problem of teenage \naddiction, and we just heard the Senator from Illinois: ``This is a \npoison pill amendment.'' The logic defies me, absolutely defies me.\n  He talked about school choice. What he is talking about is three \nparagraphs in this amendment that says if a child becomes a victim of a \ncrime, including drug-related, that the school system could move the \nchild to another school.\n  Mr. President, I will give you an example. First of all, we have a \nletter from the all-knowing NEA, which says, ``This amendment''--this \nis the drug amendment provision--``to allow Federal tax dollars to be \nused to provide private school vouchers is a cynical attempt to use the \nrecent tragic violence in our schools to advance a political agenda.''\n  What they are talking about is the ability for a local school to take \nthis teenage girl, who was assaulted at her school, sexually assaulted, \nin an abandoned locker room in De Kalb County--this amendment would \nallow this school system to move her to another school. That is what \nthe ruckus is about over there. Heaven forbid that we would make it \npossible for one of these victims of a violent crime to be moved to a \nsafer location. That is what he is talking about when he talks about \nthe nonrelated issue of school choice. He is talking about this girl \nand the right for a school system to try to protect the victim of a \nviolent crime. ``But this is not a serious attempt to make the bill \nbetter. There's not any relevance here.''\n  Fourteen thousand teenagers die every year as a result of teenage \ndrug use. Once again, in the drug culture, the chances of \nrehabilitation are very limited. That is why you have to have massive \ncampaigns to educate. The administration and the Congress have already \nunderstood this because they are trying to launch a national campaign \nnow. And I applaud them for it. It is just too little. If we are going \nto get this drug epidemic under control we have to get serious.\n\n  There was an article in the paper June 2, a pretty interesting \narticle, Mr. President. I will just read a few select remarks from it.\n\n       As commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard for the last 4 years, \n     Admiral Robert E. Kramek played a key role in the war on \n     drugs, serving as coordinator for U.S. interdiction efforts. \n     But in leaving the post last week, after 41 years in the \n     service, the 58-year-old admiral could not hide a sense of \n     frustration and dismay about what he described as partisan \n     bickering, pork-barrel politics that have hamstrung the \n     United States in its fight against illegal narcotics. He \n     said, ``If we want to win the war on drugs, we've got to have \n     the will to win.'' He said, ``While politicians have \n     described the war on drugs as a high priority and a matter of \n     national security, they have failed to fund it adequately, \n     preferring instead to pour billions of dollars into other \n     things.'' He said, ``Funds spent on interdiction represent 10 \n     percent of the antinarcotic budget. Today [this is the \n     admiral] I have two-thirds of the money, half of the ship \n     time, half of the aircraft flight hours I need,'' the admiral \n     said. ``And you can't get there from here. You can't make a \n     50 percent reduction in demand in the flow of drugs into this \n     country over the next 10 years with what we're committing to \n     the battle.''\n\n  The amendment that the other side does not want us to vote on, that \nsome on the other side say is not relevant, the amendment responds to \nthe admiral. The Coast Guard appropriation for interdiction would be \ndoubled with this amendment. In other words, exactly what the admiral \nsaid he did not have the amendment gives him. It gives him the ship \ntime to get back in the waters instead of being in mothballs. It gives \nhim the aircraft and the surveillance that he needs to shut down the \nCaribbean.\n  The Caribbean got shut down in the 1980s, Mr. President. It got shut \ndown. It was pouring into the United States. The will was put together, \nand in the 1980s it was locked off. It is not locked off anymore. It is \npouring through the Caribbean again, pouring through the Caribbean.\n  Now the amendment also doubles the interdiction budget of U.S. \nCustoms. It doubles the interdiction budget of the Department of \nDefense. It strengthens the civil and criminal penalties for custom \nviolations and doubles the number of border agents by the year 2003.\n  Now, why all the interdiction? Because part of the reason that our \nteenagers, who are the target of these cartels, are being so affected \nby these drugs is that they are everywhere and readily accessible and \ncheap. If these interdictions are successful, the price goes up and the \navailability goes down. Price goes up. The other side is talking about \nthe fact that price affects purchasing. It works that way in drugs, \ntoo. If the floor of the price drops out, you can buy marijuana as \ncheaply as a pack of cigarettes, what do you think will happen? The \nprice affects not just tobacco, it affects drug use, too. And we have \nallowed the price to just plummet, too much of it, too accessible, too \ncheap.\n  So the admiral is absolutely correct. If we are going to stop this \nepidemic, it is going to require a nation demonstrating the will. If \nthe President is serious in his statement about our nations of the \nworld coming together to confront the evil empires, then he needs to \nhave a message sent over here to his team and say we want drug \naddiction to be a part of this effort.\n  I find it curious, I have to tell you just at the outset, as to how \nyou could have ever gotten into a debate about teenage addiction and \nbeen absolutely silent on the No. 1 problem, addictive problem, \nteenagers are facing. I find it incredulous. Then to make matters even \nworse, some lame argument that it isn't relative. First of all, the \nmajority of the teenagers using it, smoke it. It is a product that is \nsmoked, just like tobacco. The only difference is it is five times more \ndangerous. National Institute on Drug Abuse and National Institutes of \nHealth say:\n\n       Someone who smokes marijuana regularly may have many of the \n     same respiratory problems that tobacco smokers have. These \n     individuals may have daily cough and phlegm, symptoms of \n     chronic bronchitis, and more frequent chest colds. Continuing \n     to smoke marijuana can lead to abnormal functioning of lung \n     tissue injured or destroyed by marijuana smoke. Regardless of \n     the THC content, the amount of tar inhaled by marijuana \n     smokers and the level of carbon monoxide absorbed are three \n     to five times greater than tobacco smokers. This may be due \n     to\n\n[[Page S5758]]\n\n     the marijuana users' inhaling more deeply and holding the \n     smoke in the lungs.\n\n  But it is not relevant? What a puzzle. I have been trying to figure \nthe logic. Just try to match that paragraph with the suggestion that \nthis amendment is not relevant to this issue. Nonsense. It is the No. 1 \nissue. No. 1 for parents, for teenagers, for our society, for this \ncountry. It is an epidemic.\n  We had a lot of discussion about the fact that tobacco is focused on \nyoungsters--and that is horrible--but the cartels are totally focused \non teenagers, age 8 to 14. It is the first war that has ever been waged \nagainst kids that we are in the middle of.\n  So we suggest an amendment, if this legislation becomes law, that \nsays 20 percent of the resources, 20 percent, are to be focused on the \nNation's No. 1 problem. I think that leaves 80 percent to deal with \nwhat is, among families and teenagers, the eighth most serious problem.\n\n  I see the coauthor of this amendment has arrived on the floor. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Wednesday, \nJune 10, between the hours of 3 and 4 p.m, Anson Chan, the chief \nsecretary of Hong Kong special administration regional government, be \ngiven floor privileges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am so pleased to be able to stand on the \nfloor today with my colleague from Georgia who is the primary author of \nthe important amendment that is before the Senate. He has done such an \nexcellent job of laying out what everyone in America knows to be the \nNo. 1 issue facing our young people and literally facing the American \nculture, and that is the drug culture and the impact it is having on \nthe lives of an awful lot of our citizens and especially our young \npeople.\n  Neither he nor I belittle the concern that 3,000 young Americans \nstart smoking every day. But 3,000 young Americans that start smoking \ndon't die every day. But about 40 of our youngest and sometimes our \nbrightest die every day because of an overdose of drugs or because of a \ncrossfire of a gang shooting that was drug-related. That adds up to \nabout 14,000 young Americans.\n  Yet this legislation we have before us, S. 1415, 753 pages that our \ncolleagues tell us will cause young citizens in this country to smoke \nless and live a better life, has not one word in it about illicit \ndrugs, the drug traffic, and what we as a citizenry and those of us as \npolicymakers ought to be doing, where we can, to stop the rapidly \nincreasing flow of illicit drugs into this culture.\n  My colleague from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, and I join together. By \nthis amendment we are saying if you are really sincerely concerned \nabout what goes on amongst our young folks today that may in some way \ndamage them, then you ought to be voting for this legislation because \nthe Senator from Georgia, like myself, and I know like the Presiding \nOfficer at this moment, have on many occasions gone before grade school \nand high school groups to talk about the state of affairs of our \ncountry and the importance to those young people of what goes on in our \ncountry, and we have asked the question, Is cigarette smoking a \nproblem. Yes, a few hands go up. They are concerned about it. Others \nare not because they are smoking. But when you ask about drugs, when \nyou ask about the character of them, the nature of them, the \navailability of them, all hands go up, or nearly all hands, because \nyoung people know better than anyone else what is going on amongst \ntheir peer group. They are frighteningly concerned because oftentimes \nit impacts the life of a friend or it disrupts in a massive way a \nfriend's family.\n  Yet today this Senate is silent on the issue. This administration has \nretreated in a dramatic way from the war on drugs that was launched by \nthe administrations of President Reagan and President Bush.\n  Let me give some very interesting statistics. While there are not as \nmany pot smokers as tobacco smokers at current rates, if the current \nrate continues, in but a few short years there will be almost as many \nmarijuana, pot, weed smokers amongst our youth as there are tobacco \nsmokers. There has been a 25 percent, 38 percent, and 31 percent \nincrease in the number of children who have smoked a cigarette in the \nlast 30 days, in the month of May. In comparison, there has been 175, \n153 and a 99 percent increase, respectively, in the number of children \nwho have tried a joint of marijuana in the last 30 days in the 8th, \n10th and 12th grades, respectively.\n  That is an American tragedy. We know it. Yet, we have allowed this \nadministration and, frankly, we have allowed the Congress to be \nrelatively silent on the issue. That is why the Senator from Georgia \nand I could be silent no longer. It is critically important that we \nspeak out, that we begin to shape more clearly policy that will work \ntoward interdiction. As the Senator has just spoken to, the Coast \nGuard, dramatically cut back, with ships in mothballs--they are not out \nin the Gulf of Mexico, where they were for a good number of years, \nstopping the flow of illicit drugs moving into the market.\n  There is a 70 percent flow of drugs coming across our southern \nborders, and we are silent to it. Well, yes, in all honesty, there has \nbeen a limited amount of interdiction. Yes, there was an effort on the \npart of this administration as it related to the money laundering in \nMexican banks. But just the other night, on television, there was \nattention addressed to three Mexican brothers operating south of the \nborder, in Tijuana, talking about the multihundreds of millions of \ndollars in cash-flow and the intimidation and the deaths that they can \nbring down on citizens who get in their way because they are the kings \nof drugs flowing up the west coast. We know who they are. Their \npictures were shown on television. But we do limited amounts of things \nagainst them. Are we frightened of them? No. It is just a retreat from \nthe scene. It is the attitude of, well, we will fund a little bit of \ntherapy if somebody gets hooked on drugs. But somehow we don't want to \nengage in a war to save our children.\n  I was once a smoker. I am not proud of it, but I was. But I quit, I \nguess when I matured enough to know that it wasn't good for me and \nsmart enough to know that it wasn't the right thing to do. But you \nknow, if I would have been hooked on a major drug like cocaine, I might \nnot be here today. The great tragedy of young people and drugs is that \nit kills them. Young people, while smoking cigarettes may be the cool \nand stylish thing to do amongst their peers, grow up and mature. There \nis a reverse peer pressure that begins to develop, and in great numbers \nwe see young people quitting in their twenties and early thirties. They \ncan quit because they are not dead. But if they are hooked on cocaine \nor heroin, which is the follow-up to marijuana, they are dead. That is \nhow they quit. We know it.\n  We saw the great tragedy out in California of the great humorist a \nfew weeks ago whose wife could not get off cocaine. She finally killed \nthat humorist and then took her own life and left two small children. \nThat is the story of drugs, the tragedy of drugs. The other side is \nsaying that we have a bitter pill here: We are trying to destroy a \ntobacco bill. Quite the opposite: We are trying to make it a good piece \nof legislation that truly does something against this phenomenal drug \nculture in our society. That is what we ought to be debating. Those are \nthe real issues.\n  Let me give you some fascinating statistics. Young people are young \npeople, and for those of us who are now adults, but, more importantly, \nfor those of us who have raised teenagers, we know a lot more about \nkids than we used to know, especially if we have raised our own. We \nknow that if you put a challenge against them, oftentimes they will \nmeet the challenge. Well, guess what? The American public knows that, \ntoo. And so when they were recently asked, just in the last week, in a \nnationwide survey--not funded by a tobacco company, funded privately--\nthe question was asked: Which of the following do you believe is the \nmost responsible for young people initially beginning to smoke? Ten \npercent of the American public said Hollywood, television, popular \nculture.\n\n  You know, it is true. When that handsome or attractive television \nstar or movie star walks out in prime time\n\n[[Page S5759]]\n\nwith a cigarette in their hand, that is cool; that is something, those \nviewing say, I ought to do. Yes, when President Clinton said he didn't \ninhale and then later on MTV he jokingly said he might have on a second \ntry, guess what happened? Marijuana usage amongst teenagers bottomed \nout and headed up, because the leader, the icon of America's culture, \nkind of shrugged it off as no big deal. But the tragedy of no big deal \nis that, step one, marijuana smoking leads to step two, a search for \ncocaine, which can lead to death. The numbers have dramatically changed \nduring this administration. I am amazed that they aren't out on the \nfront line with us attempting to lead a war against drugs.\n  Well, back to the question: Who most influences young people to \ninitially start smoking? Thirteen percent say the parent example--in \nother words, a power figure, an important figure in your life. If your \nparents smoke, you are likely to smoke.\n  The tobacco industry and their advertising--if you listened to the \ndebate from the other side on the floor, you would be convinced that \nthey alone caused 3,000 kids a day to start smoking. The American \npublic says that maybe 6 percent of the cause is laid at the feet of \nthe tobacco companies. I am not going to let the tobacco companies off. \nYes, we now know that they targeted young people by their advertising, \nand that is wrong, and we ought to try to stop that. But the public \nknows that it didn't work that much.\n  Guess what. No. 1 factor: 59 percent say influence of peers and \nfriends. If you have ever raised a teenager, you know that that is \nabsolutely correct. It is the pressure of those whom they associate \nwith, those whom they go to school with, those whom they play with; \nthat is the real influence. If the friend is smoking, then there is a \ngreat pressure for you to smoke. Worst of all, if the friend is using \ndrugs and thinks it is cool, and you are in that group, as a teenager, \nthere is phenomenal pressure on you to go along, to be cool, to be part \nof the crowd.\n  Well, the statistics go on. But, most importantly, the American \npublic has not been fooled by the rhetoric on the floor from the other \nside that somehow this massive tax increase, this massive expansion of \nGovernment programs, is somehow going to stop teenagers from smoking \nand make the world a safer and healthier place, because when they were \nasked, in this same poll, basically what the impact of this legislation \nwould do and what it really was, 57 percent of them said it was a \nmassive tax increase and a major increase in Government. And then they \nasked the question about raising the price of a pack of cigarettes by \nbetter than double--$2.50 when everything is added in at the furthest \nextension of the bill--is that more likely or less likely to stop \nteenagers from smoking? Sixty-seven percent of Americans said it was \nless likely. Strangely enough, Mr. President, if you do the math and \nyou raise cigarettes to that amount, all of a sudden marijuana becomes \nless expensive in a relative sense. Kids are paying three times or four \ntimes the price of tobacco for a joint of marijuana. Yet, we are being \ntold that if you just jack up the price somehow they quit smoking. Yet, \nmarijuana usage in a 30-day period in this last month of May was up 157 \npercent amongst eighth graders. It sounds like a lot of spendable \nincome to me. Yet, that is not taken into consideration.\n\n  So my colleague from Georgia and I said that somehow we have to \nchange this. We have to work with our colleagues here in the Senate to \nchange it. How long can we go with these figures and statistics and \ndeath rates smacking us in the face and saying it is not a problem, it \nis not a problem if 14,000 young people die directly or indirectly \nrelated to drugs on an annual basis? That is a national crisis by any \ndefinition deserving a national effort of magnitude against it. That is \nwhat the Coverdell-Craig amendment does.\n  As my colleague from Georgia was speaking and talked about doubling \nthe interdiction budget for U.S. Customs, doubling the interdiction \nbudget for the Coast Guard--in other words, ships out of mothballs and \nback in the water--the Department of Defense put some effort there \nbecause they have been pulled back. As my colleague from the State of \nIdaho who is chairing at this moment knows, we have seen a major effort \nout in our State with drug-free communities and a drug-free \nneighborhood effort. We help there. While that has been a marvelously \nsuccessful voluntary effort bringing in business and educators in our \nState, we help them out by some block grants giving flexibility to do \nmore in the local communities by millions of dollars nationwide to \nencourage the successes in Idaho and other communities to have those \nsuccesses across the board everywhere. Does it make a difference if \nnational leaders and local leaders and State leaders are standing up \ntelling their young people not to get involved in drugs? You bet it \ndoes. Our First Lady, Nancy Reagan, was oftentimes joked about because \nshe said ``just say no.'' Yet, because she was and is a national leader \nand a national image of great respect, the young people responded.\n  There is value in saying no and not shrugging it off and laughing and \nsaying, ``Maybe I ought to have tried to inhale.'' But it is very \nimportant that leaders of this country say no.\n  Our legislation helps leaders at the local level and the State level \nsay no. Why should teenagers convicted of drug crimes or associated \nwith drug purchases have a driver's license? If you are caught drinking \nat an illegal age in the State of Idaho, you don't have a driver's \nlicense. Shouldn't it be the same? Our bill provides for that \nincentive, and it ought to.\n  But the real arena is our schools. This legislation makes allowable \nthe use of Federal funds to provide school choice for grades K through \n12 for students who are victims of school violence related to drugs, \nand includes drug-related crimes, creates incentives for States to \nprovide an annual report card for parents and teachers listing \nincidents of crime. In other words, it lifts the awareness of drugs in \nthe community and in the school system to get parents involved along \nwith their educators to build a drug-free school environment. That is \nwhat we ought to be talking about--and a smoke-free environment. Let me \nadd that. That is important, too, because we want to get kids away from \ntobacco.\n\n  The thing I fear most in all of what we do or may not do is that we \nare hiding in the myth that has been perpetrated by some, including the \nformer Director of the Food and Drug Administration, that if you just \njack up the price of a pack of cigarettes the problem goes away. Yet, \nevery nation that has tried that in the past--and Canada is a perfect \nexample--lost their market because the market went into the black \nmarket. When there is a desire in the public arena for something and \nyou restrict the ability of the public to get to it, they will find a \nway. Thirty percent of the sales in Canada went into the black market. \nThey had to lower the tax to get the sales back to control the product.\n  My point is very simple. If we do that in this country and 30 to 40 \npercent of tobacco and cigarette sales move into the black market, then \nthat cool dude on the street that is selling your kids marijuana or \ncocaine is going to open his coat and say, ``Oh, you can have some \ncigarettes, too. I am your local cigarette vendor, but I also have \nmarijuana and cocaine. What is your choice?'' Wouldn't that be a human \ntragedy if that is what this legislation, S. 1415, results in?\n  I am not saying that is the intent. I am saying that is how the \nmarket reacts. The statistics and facts show that in Canada, in Europe, \nand in Germany, that is exactly what happened. Yet, we are so naive to \nthink you just jack up the price as high as you can possibly get it. \nOh, sure, you are going to get hundreds of billions of dollars from the \nlower income, 30 percent of the socioeconomic scale of this country, \nand you are going to spend that in all kinds of programs. The trial \nlawyers are all going to get billions of dollars. But what about the \nkids? What about the kids?\n  You can't tell the tobacco industry to quit advertising without their \nconsent. It is something called the first amendment in our country. \nThey said they would voluntarily do that if we would control this a \nlittle bit. This Senate has chosen not to do so. So we will not get \ntheir consent. They will not become involved. But the great tragedy is \nour kids will be the victims still. While it may curb a few of them \nfrom smoking, we are silent--deathly silent--to the issue of drugs.\n\n[[Page S5760]]\n\n  I am extremely proud to stand on the floor today with my colleague \nfrom Georgia to offer the most comprehensive anti-teen-drug amendment, \nto my knowledge, that this Senate has put forward. I don't plead with \nmy colleagues from the other side. I challenge them to get aboard, to \nquit looking at the dollars and the political game being played, and \ncome with us into good, effective public policy that mans the front \nlines once again in the war against drugs, that allows national \nleadership and State and community leadership to unite to say that \nperpetuating a drug culture among teenagers of our country is an evil \nwe will not tolerate. That is what our amendment does so very clearly.\n  So to the other side, don't call it a bitter pill. How dare you? I \ndon't blame you for being embarrassed about the President's record. The \ncountry ought to be. But we don't have to live with that record. We can \nwalk beyond it. This amendment allows that to happen. This is not a \nbitter pill, nor is it a placebo. It is the beginning of a major and \ncomprehensive effort to deal with the reality of our time. That is that \nthere is the growth of a drug culture in our society that is killing \nAmerica's youth in greater numbers than we ever dreamed possible. It is \ntime that we stop it.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. There are so many numbers that we talk about here. We \noften talk about how complicated it gets. But when the Senator talks \nabout the magnitude of this issue, I think there are two figures that \nhave been spellbinding to me, and it fits so much with what the Senator \nis saying.\n  What all this means is that today one in four--that is 25 percent--of \nhigh school students are using drugs now regularly--one in four. Most \nof them are smoking it. They smoke it. But they say it is not \nrelevant--1 in 10 junior high schools students. When the Senator was \ntalking about the number of students that are affected by this, the \nnumber of deaths, 25 percent of the high school population in the \nUnited States and 10 percent of the junior high population in the \nUnited States.\n  I just wanted to make that point.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The last 30 days, 8th, 10th, 12th graders, using \nmarijuana, up on the average of 100 percent. That is a dramatic figure \nthat you speak to.\n  Out in my State of Idaho--rural, big public land State--two major \nraids last year of huge magnitude, to interdict marijuana, and still it \nremains, by everybody's figures--and we don't have those figures--the \nNo. 1 cash crop in this country being driven by this huge market in \nthis country. And that is in this country. And we are not getting that, \nlet alone getting the huge flow of cocaine and heroin coming in from \nthe outside along with marijuana, 70 percent of the flow across our \nsouthern borders.\n  The Senator from Georgia dealt with that with greater money for \nBorder Patrol and interdiction. When we look at what is going on in \nMexico today and their attitude in relation to this, it is a huge money \nmachine for them, and it permeates down through their system, and it \ncorrupts it. And it will corrupt ours, because there is the constant \neffort to corrupt. So that those who are of the profiteers can gain \naccess through to the innocent, the children.\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia for his effort and his energy in \nthis area. He brought my attention to this issue, and it was obvious to \nme in a very short time that we had to deal with this. We will be back, \nsuccessful or unsuccessful here. This is something I think neither of \nus will rest on until we have a much clearer, stronger public policy in \nthis area and we engage our Government in probably one of the most \nsignificant wars--against our very culture and our people, our young \npeople, our future--that we have ever seen before.\n  I thank my colleague, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, working off the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Idaho, which I appreciated very much--not only his cooperation in \njoining in the amendment in the first place but the energy and \nintellect that he has brought to the discussion since that time--as he \nwas talking, I was reminded of a meeting that occurred, probably, now, \nsome 2 years ago.\n  I was encouraged to stop by a female youth detention center in the \nmiddle of my State. I really didn't expect that much from the meeting, \nbut they gathered about 20 of the inmates. Their ages were 12 to 16. \nThey were each given the assignment to tell about their own experience \nand what happened. As they walked--I was quite taken with the courage. \nIt is not an easy thing. First all, the circumstances were pretty \nrough; and then they have to sit there and talk about it. But they did. \nThey walked around the room. They were in the detention center for \nprostitution, assault and battery, attempted murder, car theft--and you \nname it--all related to an addiction to drugs. All of it.\n  It was very moving, the damage and their realization of it. I asked \nthem, in the meeting, if they could say whatever they wanted to say to \nthe rest of the youth of the Nation, what would they say? Really quite \nremarkable. They all said essentially the same thing in different ways. \nThey said, ``Don't use drugs. Do not believe you can control them''--\nwhich is the point my colleague was making. ``The drugs will control \nyou. And do not use drugs to be anybody's friend, because if somebody \nis encouraging you to use drugs, they are not your friend.'' They all \nhad a sense of how dramatically their lives had been changed. One young \ngirl said she was afraid to leave the institution; she just knew she \nwas going to have difficulty breaking away from it.\n\n  Cigarettes are a tough problem. But there isn't anybody in a youth \ndetention center over it.\n  Mr. President, as has been stated here repeatedly, this amendment is \na very bold statement about what this Nation is going to do about drug \nuse. I am not going to name the individual here I was talking with \nseveral months ago. Suffice it to say, the individual was the head of \none of our Nation's most powerful agencies. I said, ``Are we guilty of \njust taking on this drug epidemic in a kind of day-to-day, you just \nkind of keep the wheels turning, but have been unable to understand, as \nin the Persian Gulf, that this Nation needs to be bold and forceful and \ncome down on this with a hammer?'' He paused for a moment, and he said, \n``We are guilty. We are not paying enough attention. We are not getting \nbold.''\n  That makes all those men and women out there on the front lines--two \nof whom were killed a couple of weeks ago, overwhelmed at the border, \nshot and killed. All those people out there--I am not talking about the \nteenagers for a moment, but the people trying to help them--get the \nfeeling that we don't care. I am sure the debate they have listened to \nhere on this amendment has not encouraged them: ``This is not \nrelevant.'' This is relevant. This is destroying lives as we stand here \nand talk. The chance of recovery once the addiction occurs, once \nsomebody is on this stuff--getting them off of it is murder. Our best \nshot is that they don't get on it in the first place.\n  So, yes, we need advertising to dissuade people from smoking. In \nfact, we have been doing a lot of that. This Nation has improved the \nstatistics about tobacco. All of you have seen it. You walk outside, in \nthis new culture, and you see a gaggle of people outside the building \nsmoking in front of the building. When you walk into a restaurant, we \njust take it for granted, but the hostess says, ``Smoking or \nnonsmoking?'' The flight attendant says, ``This is a no-smoking \nflight.'' Everywhere we go, in our culture, we are beginning to get a \nmessage: Tobacco is not healthy.\n  We are making progress, and we should continue doing it. And I do not \nfault the underpinnings of the bill to improve the advertising. But it \nis flawed thinking, to think we can go to the Nation and say it would \nreally help teenagers, and we would have been silent on the No. 1 \naddiction problem and the one that is undermining our society, the one \nthat is so difficult to correct, if somebody does get snared on this.\n  One of the provisions in this amendment gives Customs the authority \nto, up to 5 percent of their force, be able to move it, irrespective of \ncollective bargaining agreements. There is a flurry of worry on the \nother side because of that. Why is this language in the\n\n[[Page S5761]]\n\namendment? Because Customs has to have the authority, from time to \ntime, to alter the nature of who is present at a point of entry. They \nhave to mix it up. So, we have this amendment which--as I said, it is \nlimited up to 5 percent, to give them some flexibility to be able to \nmaneuver who is at a given post at a given time.\n  It is almost as if every NEA, Fraternal Order of Police, lets them \ndominate this war. For heaven's sake, we don't want a rape victim to be \nable to be moved or someone who is a victim of a drug crime, we don't \nwant to give a school district the ability to move that student to a \nsafe-haven school.\n  Mr. President, I am going to take a few minutes and describe in more \ndetail exactly what the amendment does.\n  No. 1, it stops the flow of drugs at our borders, and it doubles the \nresources for U.S. Customs, doubles the resources for the U.S. Coast \nGuard and doubles the resources for the Department of Defense. It also \nincreases the antinarcotic capacity of the FBI by 25 percent and the \nDrug Enforcement Agency by 25 percent. In other words, I am responding \nto the gentleman I talked to a moment ago. It is a bold statement. It \nresponds to what the admiral, who I quoted, said, that the Nation \ndoesn't have the will to fight this battle. This says the Nation does \nhave the will and is going to fight it. Then the accountability will be \nup to the admirals. We are going to give them the materiel to fight the \nfight, and then they better win it.\n  It strengthens the civil and criminal penalties for Customs \nviolations and doubles the number of border agents by the year 2003.\n  It protects our neighborhoods and schools from drugs.\n  It has a title dealing with drug-free teen drivers, providing $10 \nmillion per year in grants for States that institute voluntary drug \ntesting for teen driver license applicants and for States that enact \nand enforce laws that crack down on drivers who use drugs. Only five \nStates do that, Mr. President. Only five States have expanded DUI to \ndrug driving. So this legislation encourages an expansion of drug \ndriving.\n  Drug-free schools: It makes it allowable to use Federal funds to \nprovide compensation and services to K through 12, kindergarten through \nhigh school students, who are the victims of school violence, including \ndrug-related crimes. It creates incentives for States to provide an \nannual report card to parents and teachers listing incidents of school \nviolence, weapons possession or drug activity, and makes voluntary \nrandom drug testing programs an allowable use of Federal funds.\n  The drug-free student loan provision: It restricts loans for students \nconvicted of drug possession, 1 year for first offenders, 2 years for \nsecond offenders and indefinitely for third. It restricts loans for \nstudents convicted of drug trafficking, 2 years for first offenders and \nindefinitely for second offenders. It resumes loan eligibility on an \nexpedited basis for students who satisfactorily complete a drug \nrehabilitation program that includes drug testing.\n  Drug-free workplace: It authorizes $10 million per year in SBA \ndemonstration grants for small- and medium-size businesses to implement \ndrug-free workplace programs and provides technical assistance for \nbusinesses through SBA.\n  Drug-free communities: It authorizes $50 million per year to \nencourage communities nationwide to establish comprehensible, \nsustainable and accountable antidrug coalitions through flexible \nmatching grants, and it allows up to $10 million of these funds to be \nused each year to encourage the formation of parent-youth drug \nprevention strategies.\n  Mr. President, there is data that strongly suggests that if parents \ntalk to children about the drug issue, the chance of their children \nbecoming users are cut in half--cut in half. But if you ask students by \nsurvey or in person whether they are talking to their parents about \nthese problems, they are not. Only about 10 percent of the knowledge \nthat students learn about drugs are coming from the parents. That \ndialog is not occurring, which also explains why what parents think \nabout the drug epidemic is different from what children think, and \nchildren are far more knowledgeable, unfortunately, about the drug \nepidemic than their parents.\n\n  The other day I mentioned one statistic of, ``Do your children know \nsomeone who uses marijuana?'' The percentage of parents who think that \nis the case is 20 percent. When you ask the students, ``Do you know \nsomeone who smokes marijuana?'' Yes, over 70 percent. There is a \ndisconnect out there, and that disconnect is hurting us. That is what \nthis provision is meant to get at. We have to get parents talking to \ntheir children.\n  One of the ads being used now from the drug czar's office shows a \nlittle girl sitting at a desk, and she is being talked to by a voice. \nThe voice says: ``There is a pack of matches there. Do you use \nmatches?''\n  The little girl says, ``Oh, no, they are dangerous.''\n  ``How do you know that?'' the voice says.\n  ``My mommy told me so.''\n  Then they say, ``Well, are drugs dangerous?''\n  And the girl just sits there and looks at the camera. Inference: \nMommy is not talking to the little girl about drugs.\n  These provisions begin to highlight this dialog.\n  Ban free needles from drug addicts. This has been very controversial, \na dispute in the administration, the drug czar's office arguing there \nshould be no needle exchange program. It almost came about, but the \ndrug czar caused a change.\n  I was given this pamphlet earlier this afternoon. It is published by \nthe Bridgeport Needle Exchange Program of Bridgeport, CT. This is the \nkind of thing that a needle exchange program would move toward.\n  The brochure says: ``Shoot smart; shoot safe. Tips for safer crack \ninjection.''\n  I have to tell you, Mr. President, the Federal Government should have \nnothing to do with anything associated with this kind of activity.\n  ``Get your stuff ready. Have a cooker, water, syringe, citric or \nascorbic acid, cotton or alcohol wipes ready.''\n  It is your ABCs on how to use a needle. It goes through every step.\n  ``Get a vein ready. Tie off a good vein and clean with alcohol wipe. \nNever share a syringe or cooker.''\n  Just all your tips.\n  This legislation makes it absolutely clear that there will be no \nneedle exchange program. It would be banned, and it ought to be.\n  As I mentioned a little earlier, the Drug Enforcement Agency would \nreceive an antinarcotic budget increase of 25 percent. The Federal \nBureau of Investigation would receive an increase in the drug \nenforcement budget by 25 percent. It would require the registration of \nconvicted drug dealers and provides $5 million per year in incentive \ngrants to States that require convicted drug dealers who target kids to \nregister with local law enforcement.\n  That is the nuts and bolts of the amendment that we are discussing \nthis afternoon, an amendment that has been criticized as being not \nrelevant to the subject or issue.\n  From the outset, I have been stunned that this legislation would be \nsilent on teenage drug addiction. Myself, Senator Craig and others \ndecided that could no longer be the case.\n  If we are going to talk about teenage addiction, we have to simply \nmake sure that in the center of this debate is the subject of teenage \ndrug abuse. Why? Because teenage drug abuse is the No. 1 problem--No. \n1--because it is costing our society $67 billion a year; because it has \nresulted in 800,000 U.S. prisoners in jails, in prisons, State and \nFederal; because it has caused, and continues to cause on a daily \nbasis, the most violent, hostile attack on our citizenry and its \nproperty.\n  As bad as smoking a cigarette is, it does not cause a mind to pick up \na gun and murder someone. But drug abuse does. That is why we have seen \nthis surge of violent crime among our youth that everybody is so \nalarmed about--drug based. And as we have wondered about the increase \nin mindless crime, just senseless and brutal--drug based. Drugs alter \nthe mind, and they cause inexplicable activity and hostility that the \nrest of society bears the brunt of.\n  Relevant? You bet. And this Senator, for one, any time you talk about \nteenage addiction, which I am glad we are talking about, we are going \nto talk\n\n[[Page S5762]]\n\nabout drug addiction because it is part of it. And it is smoke driven, \nthe only difference being that it is five times as dangerous to smoke \nthis stuff as tobacco.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, at this point in the debate, it is \nappropriate to ask one very simple question: Why are we here? Why have \nMembers of the Senate spent months of their time focusing on this \nissue? Why, with a busy schedule, and few legislative days left this \nyear, are we occupying the Senate's time with this bill?\n  The answer to this question is equally simple--the most important \nthing the Senate can do this year is to make significant inroads in \ncutting youth smoking.\n  If you accept this simple premise--that the goal of a tobacco bill \nshould be about reducing teen smoking, then the decision on how to vote \non the Coverdell amendment is clear. The amendment should be opposed.\n  Mr. President, let me be perfectly clear. I support increased \nappropriations for drug enforcement and drug interdiction. I represent \na State that has experienced major crises related to drug trafficking \nand drug use. And I know better than most, as a member of the Senate \nCaucus on International Narcotics Control, the importance of fighting \nthe scourge of drugs in America.\n  Last year, I joined my House colleague and fellow Floridian John Mica \nin establishing a new High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area in Central \nFlorida. I was also an original co-sponsor of the Drug Free Communities \nAct. I have co-sponsored a bill with Senator Grassley that will \nestablish a national strategy to attack money laundering. I have fought \nto increase funding for our counternarcotics efforts time and time \nagain.\n  Just next week I will be holding a field hearing in Miami on the \ncurrent interdiction efforts in the Caribbean. I know how serious the \ndrug threat is, and I have been and will be committed to doing whatever \nit takes to keep drugs away from our children.\n  I support many of the measures in the Coverdell amendment. And if the \nUnited States Senate ever gets serious about addressing this issue, \nperhaps funding these measures through general revenues, I would \nsupport them wholeheartedly.\n  In fact, we will have an opportunity to vote on an alternative which \naddresses the drug problem by authorizing funds to increases the number \nof border patrol agents, Coast Guard officers, and money for the \nDepartment of Defense to increase interdiction. And we will be able to \naugment these programs without gutting anti-tobacco efforts.\n  Mr. President, let's stay focussed, stick to the purpose, and send a \nmessage to parents right now that we are serious about reducing teen \nsmoking.\n  If we adopt the Coverdell amendment, here's what happens: five \nmillion smokers will not receive smoking cessation services. Those who \nargue that the tobacco taxes are regressive should remember that \ncessation and other public health programs are targeted toward helping \nthose who will actually pay the tax.\n  Over 20 million children will not receive the benefits of effective \ncounter advertising to discourage them from taking up the deadly habit \nof cigarette smoking.\n  Fifty million children will not participate in school-based \nprevention programs.\n  States will not have the funds to develop their own anti-smoking \nprograms which are so vital in protecting our children.\n  We will not have the benefit of future biomedical advancement through \nincreased funding for NIH research.\n  In addition, we have solid scientific evidence to suggest that if we \nstop kids from smoking, they may never take up the use of illicit \ndrugs, such as cocaine and marijuana. This ``gateway effect'' has been \nwell documented.\n  Let's look at the findings of the Surgeon General's 1994 report, \n``Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People''--ninety-eight percent of \nall cocaine users smoked cigarettes first.\n  Among 12 to 17 year olds--those who smoke are 114 times more likely \nto use marijuana and 32 times more likely to use cocaine.\n  By contrast, less than one percent of those children who never smoked \nend up using cocaine or marijuana.\n  Mr. President, if we are interested in cutting drug use among our \nchildren, we should pass this tobacco bill now, and leave the funding \nto States and public health intact, and then come back and fund the \nreal anti-drug initiatives in the Coverdell proposal and the Democratic \nalternative amendment. There is simply no reason why we cannot and \nshould not do both. Our kids are worth it.\n  This is simply the greatest opportunity, and perhaps our only \nopportunity to take a huge step toward reducing youth smoking. This \nbill is our best chance to have a significant impact on the Nation's \npublic health. We shouldn't blow it.\n  Mr. President, those who attempt to gut this bill through funding \nextraneous programs--are going to be on the wrong side of history. For \nall of these reasons, I urge the rejection of the Coverdell amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed for the next 20 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5754-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5762-S5764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE TRANSPORTATION EQUITY ACT FOR THE 21ST CENTURY\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words about the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, otherwise known as the \nISTEA reauthorization legislation. This was passed by the House and \nSenate on May 22, and the President will sign this historic legislation \ninto law later this afternoon.\n  In the rush to finish the conference before the Memorial Day recess--\nand I know the Chair remembers well the frantic hours that were taking \nplace then--and during our subsequent efforts on the technical \ncorrections bill to this overall legislation, I did not have an \nopportunity to speak about what was accomplished in this important \nbill. I also want to take this chance to thank the many people who were \ninvolved in the effort.\n  First, a word about the legislation. It is the result of over 2 years \nof hard work and careful negotiation. But I think the final product is \nbetter for the extra time and effort that was put into it.\n  This legislation builds upon the landmark achievements of the so-\ncalled first ISTEA legislation, which stands for Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act. That was in 1991. Senator Moynihan of \nNew York was chairman of our committee at the time, the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, and was, I think it is fair to say, the \nprincipal author of that landmark legislation in 1991.\n\n  Now, how is this bill historic? And how is it different from the 1991 \nlegislation?\n  First, and most obvious, ISTEA II, or sometimes called the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, authorizes a record \namount of funding for surface transportation: almost $218 billion for \nhighway and transit programs over the next 6 years.\n  Of this amount, almost $174 billion will be for highways--that \nincludes bridges, obviously--$3 billion is for highway safety programs, \nand $41 billion is for transit programs.\n  Now, $205 billion of these funds are authorized from the highway \ntrust fund, and $13 billion from the general fund. In total, the funds \nprovided in the conference report represent a 40 percent increase over \nthe last so-called ISTEA legislation--40 percent increase.\n  We will provide these record funding levels in the funding guarantee \nwithin a balanced budget. I think that is terribly important to \nremember, Mr. President. We are not increasing the Federal deficit, \ndespite some of the statements that have been made in the various news \nmedia.\n  For achieving these record funding levels for the highway program, \nSenators Byrd, Gramm, Warner and Baucus deserve special recognition, as \nwell\n\n[[Page S5763]]\n\nas Congressmen Shuster and Oberstar from the House. All of those \nMembers fought long and hard to ensure transportation would receive \nsubstantial increases over the original ISTEA legislation.\n  I know that the sums in this bill are large, and the press reports \nsometimes imply we spent too much, but I think we have to put all this \ninto context.\n  The bill authorizes, indeed, $218 billion. And I must say, that is a \nlot of money, as we all recognize. It is over 6 years. As I said, this \nrepresents a large increase over ISTEA I of 1991.\n  However, and I think this is an important point, only about 30 to 40 \npercent of the total projected spending for highways and transit by all \nlevels of government is encompassed in this legislation. People come up \nto me and say, well, isn't that a lot of money to be spending on \ntransportation--that is, highways, bridges and transit--over the 6 \nyears? Yes, it is a lot of money, but you have to realize it only \nrepresents about 30 to 40 percent of the total projected spending that \nwill be done.\n  Where does the other spending come from? It comes from counties, it \ncomes from States, it comes from cities that are doing things on their \nown.\n  In addition to record authorization levels, this legislation made \nsignificant changes to the way we budget for transportation at the \nFederal level. This legislation changed the budgetary treatment of the \nhighway trust fund following the model set forth in a bill first \nintroduced by Senator Bond, which I was pleased to cosponsor and work \non with him, the so-called Bond-Chafee legislation.\n  This bill ensures that all Federal gas tax revenues deposited into \nthe highway trust fund are spent on transportation programs. In effect, \nthis bill reestablishes the linkage between the highway trust fund \ntaxes and transportation spending that was envisioned when the highway \ntrust fund was created. If future revenues to the highway trust fund \nincrease, then under this legislation the highway spending will \nincrease; and, of course, it works the other way, likewise. If the \namount going into the highway trust fund from the various taxes--\nprincipally the Federal tax on gasoline--decreases, then highway \nspending, likewise, will decrease.\n  Now, using Congressional Budget Office projections, $198 billion of \nthe total funding for highway and transit programs will be guaranteed \nunder the new budget mechanism we have. Of the $198 billion, $162 \nbillion is for highway and highway safety programs and $36 billion is \nfor transit programs. It is important to note that this historic change \nwhich reestablishes the linkage between the trust fund moneys and trust \nfund spending was all accomplished within the balanced budget \nframework. We will keep the highway trust fund on budget as part of a \nunified budget and we will offset the increased spending with spending \nreductions in other programs.\n  I want to thank Senator Bond for his tireless work on the so-called \nBond-Chafee proposal, which provides the underlying foundation for the \nbudget reforms we implemented in this legislation. I thank the \ncosponsors of the Bond-Chafee proposal for their input. I also want to \nthank Senator Domenici and his staff for their work throughout the year \nand for their help in crafting the final budget mechanism that will \nbecome law later this afternoon.\n  I believe the original ISTEA was a landmark piece of legislation. I \nhave said that many, many times. However, it is true that in the 1991 \nlegislation there were some shortcomings, particularly for the so-\ncalled donor States. These were the States that put in substantially \nmore into the trust fund than they got back. The original ISTEA \nestablished a 90 percent minimum allocation program which was intended \nto guarantee that each State at least got back 90 percent of what that \nState put into the trust fund. The problem was that it didn't work. The \n90 percent only applied to some of the programs and wasn't structured \nmathematically to achieve its goals. The old minimum allocation \ncalculation applied to fewer than 80 percent of the programs, leaving \nsome States to receive a percentage share that was equal to 70 to 80 \npercent of their share of contributions. In other words, a program that \nwas designed to make sure that every State got back at least 90 percent \nfailed. Indeed, some States were left with between 70 plus up to 80 \ncents back on the dollars as opposed to the 90 cents.\n\n  In this legislation, thanks to the leadership of Senator Warner and \nothers in the Senate, tremendous efforts were made to guarantee that \neach State would get back--at least originally, we sought 92 percent. \nWe weren't able to achieve that under the formula, but we did come up \nso that every State got back 90.5 cents for every dollar that State put \ninto the trust fund, at least. So the donor States were put in far \nbetter shape than they previously had been under the old former \nlegislation.\n  Other members of the Environment and Public Works Committee who \nplayed a key role in achieving this result were all very, very helpful. \nIn addition, we had Senators who were not on the committee who were \nvery anxious about the program. Senators Abraham, Lugar, Coats, Mack, \nGraham, and Levin were diligent in their efforts to see that their \nStates got back at least the 90.5 cents.\n  Another area where ISTEA broke with the past is how priority \nprojects, otherwise known as demonstration projects, are treated. I \nrealize that these projects are viewed by some just like the \ndemonstration projects of the past. However, I think the way we dealt \nwith them in this legislation was somewhat different. First, the \nspecial projects, demonstration projects in this bill, did receive an \namount of attention that was far out of proportion to their dollar \nsignificance. The high priority projects similar to those in ISTEA I \nonly received 5 percent of the total. If you read the newspapers, you \nwould think they were consuming 40 to 50 percent of the total. Not at \nall. These special projects received 5 percent of the total. In the \noriginal bill, priority projects were treated as mandatory spending, \nexempt from the appropriations process. In this legislation, priority \nprojects are discretionary spending, subject to the obligation \nlimitations in the appropriation process.\n  Third, under the former bill, ISTEA I, priority projects were always \nfunded at 100 percent of their authorized level. In other words, \npriority projects were not reduced when the total authorization went \ndown. However, in this legislation, these projects were treated as the \nsame as the other core projects, taking their share of any reduction \ncaused by a shortfall in final appropriations. If the total amount goes \ndown, the special projects go down, likewise.\n  We made a sincere commitment to safety in this legislation, \nrecognizing that more than 40,000 Americans die and 3 million are \ninjured in highway crashes every single year in our country. This is a \ntragic effect for millions of American families. We recognized these \nstatistics and included a variety of initiatives to address this \nterrible problem. We increased the Federal commitment to improve \nroadway safety, providing more than $6.6 billion for highway safety \nprograms; $3.6 billion of that will be available for safety \nconstruction, efforts aimed at eliminating road hazards and improving \nsafety at rail-highway grade crossings. We provided a little over half \na billion in incentives to States to promote seatbelt use. Seatbelt \nusage is by far the most important step that vehicle occupants can take \nto protect themselves in the event of a crash. We provided half a \nbillion in incentive programs to encourage States to adopt tough .08 \nblood alcohol concentration standards. This is something that Senators \nLautenberg and DeWine worked very, very hard on. I want to recognize \ntheir efforts.\n  Under the category of innovation, we recognized we must maintain the \nstrength of the transportation system we have in place but we have to \nprovide new tools to address new problems and supply new solutions. We \nhave to look at ways to finance our substantial infrastructure needs, \nevaluating the potential of new methods to design and build \ninfrastructure more efficiently so we have innovative financing \nprovisions, the so-called Transportation Infrastructure Financing and \nInnovation Act. That is a mouthful. It is also known TIFIA. I want to \nthank Senators Graham and Moynihan for their leadership on that \nimportant provision.\n  As far as intelligent transportation systems go, this is a forward-\nlooking\n\n[[Page S5764]]\n\ninitiative. We have to make the most efficient use of our existing \nhighways. We provide new options for transportation planners to address \nsafety and capacity concerns. The objective is to move more vehicles in \na safer fashion over the same amount of highway that exists--not expand \nthe highways, just move more vehicles along the existing highways in a \nsafe fashion.\n  The environment received great attention in our legislation, and, I \nmight say, so did ISTEA I in 1991. But we continued that. Indeed, we \nincreased funding for the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality \nProgram. In other words, where congestion arises, we took efforts to \nmitigate those problems and the reflections that that congestion has \nupon our air quality.\n  We boosted funding for the Transportation Enhancements Program. We \nincreased that by 38 percent over the prior legislation of 1991. So \nStates can use these funds for what we call transportation \nenhancements, such as bicycle and pedestrian facilities and historic or \nenvironmental preservation projects.\n  We initiated a wetlands banking system to mitigate transportation's \neffect on wetlands. When we build new roads, all too often wetlands are \naffected. We want to promote wetlands restoration. We did that by \nmaking wetlands restoration a profitable private enterprise.\n  We reauthorized and amended the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, which \nprovides about $350 million annually to States throughout the Nation \nfor sport fish restoration and boat safety programs.\n  So these are some of the things that we did. We had environmental \nstreamlining. We held the line on administrative expenses. We added a \ndesign-build system for contracting. Current law doesn't allow the use \nof the so-called design-build concept in highway construction. The \ndesign-build concept combines the design and construction phases of a \nhighway project, allowing projects to be built faster and at less cost \nto the taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude by recognizing the tremendous efforts \nput forth in this legislation by the staffs and by the Department of \nTransportation. I want to thank Secretary Slater and Federal Highway \nAdministrator Wykle for their time and effort on this bill and for \nmaking the full resources of the Department available to us. From the \nDepartment of Transportation, I thank specifically Jack Basso, Nadine \nHamilton, Bud Wright and his staff, Tom Weeks, Bruce Swinford, Roger \nMingo, Dedra Goodman, Frank Calhoun and his staff, Patricia Doersch, \nBryan Grote, and David Seltzer. These individuals, particularly on the \nformula runs, were tremendously helpful.\n  I thank Secretary Slater for allowing Cheryle Tucker from the Federal \nHighway Administration to be detailed to our committee for 16 months to \nhelp us on this. I thank all the conferees from the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee; all 18 were conferees. I think that was very \nhelpful to me, and I believe it worked well. These members took hours \nfrom their busy schedules to listen to summaries of what was taking \nplace and offered suggestions. I thank the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Warner, and the ranking member, Senator Baucus, \nfor their efforts in getting this legislation up to the full committee.\n  Lastly, I would like to recognize the efforts of the Senate staff who \nworked so long and hard. Of course, I thank every single one of them. \nParticularly, I recognize the work of Jimmie Powell, who was just \ntireless, and a series of others who did such a good job. I am going to \nrun over the names of some of those who worked on the reauthorization \nthat I was particularly close with. Chris Hessler; Dan Corbett, of \ncourse, who was tireless and always present; Ann Loomis; Tom Sliter; \nKathy Ruffalo, with Senator Baucus; Chris Russell; Gary Smith; Tracy \nHenke, with Senator Bond; Jason Rupp; Doug Benevento, with Senator \nAllard; Abigail Kinnison with the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee; Al Dahlberg with the Environment and Public Works Committee; \nLinda Willard with the Environment and Public Works Committee; Ellen \nStein with Senator Warner; Chad Bradley with Senator Inhofe; Chris Jahn \nwith Senator Thomas; Gerry Gilligan with Senator Sessions; Rick \nDearborn with Senator Sessions; Arnold Kupferman with Senator Moynihan; \nPolly Trottenberg with Senator Moynihan; Liz O'Donoghue with Senator \nLautenberg; Kirsten Beronio with Senator Lautenberg; Drew Willison with \nSenator Reid; Melissa White with Senator Graham; Tim Hess with Senator \nGraham; Joyce Rechtscheffen with Senator Lieberman; Christopher Prins \nwith Senator Lieberman; Rob Alexander with Senator Boxer; Joshua \nShenkmen with Senator Wyden; Howard Menell with the Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs; Peggy Kuhn with the Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs; Joe Mondello with the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; \nLoretta Garrison with the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs; Bill \nHoagland with the Budget Committee; Brian Riley with the Budget \nCommittee; Austin Smythe with the Budget Committee; Mitch Warren with \nthe Budget Committee; Ann Begeman with the Commerce, Science and \nTransportation Committee; Charlotte Casey with the Commerce, Science \nand Transportation Committee; Clyde Hart with the Commerce, Science and \nTransportation Committee; Bob Greenawalt with Senator Chafee; Ashley \nMiller with Senator Roth; Keith Hennessey with Senator Lott; Carl \nBiersak with Senator Lott; Janine Johnson with Senate Legislative \nCounsel; Peter Rogoff with Senator Byrd; Pam Sellers with Senator \nCoats; Steve McMilin with Senator Gramm; and Dave Russell with Senator \nStevens.\n\n  They all were tremendous, and I feel bad if I left out the names of \nany of them. So it goes, Mr. President, without the help of these \nindividuals, we plain could not have gotten this legislation \naccomplished. So I thank every one of them.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5762-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5764-S5767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL TOBACCO POLICY AND YOUTH SMOKING REDUCTION ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to return to a discussion of \nthe bill that is currently before the Senate. I voted against cloture \ntoday, and barring some major shift in the direction of this \nlegislation, which now, regrettably, appears unlikely, I will have no \nchoice but to vote against cloture again tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I have a keen interest in the pending legislation. I \nhave three children, all now grown. No member of my family smokes now, \nand I hope they never do. In the Senate, we represent millions of \nparents who have the same wish for their children. There are thousands \nof Virginians who belong to the American Heart Association, the \nVirginia Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, Virginians who \nhave fought for years against the scourge of smoking-related disease.\n  There are also, however, thousands of honest, hard-working, God-\nfearing, law-abiding, taxpaying Virginians whose lives and livelihoods \nwould be dramatically affected solely by the actions this Congress may \ntake on the tobacco issue. For example, there are thousands of \nVirginians who work to manufacture tobacco-related products, and \nthousands more who work in associated industries, like the dock-workers \nat the Ports of Hampton Roads, foil manufacturers, and filter makers. \nAnd there are the thousands of Virginia families who work the soil and \ngrow tobacco, who face not only the uncertainty other farmers face \nregarding the weather and other uncontrollable forces, but must contend \nwith the added uncertainty of what Congress may do to affect their \nlives.\n  In short, to an extent not shared by many of my colleagues I \nrepresent virtually every interest affected by this legislation. While \nsome would argue that because I'm from a tobacco state I must be biased \non this issue. I believe that because I'm from a tobacco state, I'm in \na unique position to be objective. I'm willing to listen with an open \nmind to public health advocates, who want to protect the Commonwealth's \nchildren, but I'm also willing to listen with an open mind to tobacco \nworkers and tobacco growers whose very livelihood is under attack. \nIndeed, I've\n\n[[Page S5765]]\n\nworked closely with both the public health community and the tobacco \ngrower communities--as well as the tobacco worker communities--whose \nconcerns were not fully represented in the June 20 agreement.\n  I have believed from the outset that a resolution of the issues \nsurrounding tobacco is in the best interests of all interested \nparties--children, the public health community, tobacco workers, \nplaintiffs, tobacco companies, tobacco farmers and their communities. \nI've said that from the very beginning and my position has not changed.\n  I still want very much to support comprehensive legislation that will \naddress these concerns. Comprehensive legislation, however, must be \nreasonable. While by its very nature complicated legislation will not \nbe perfect in any one individual's eyes, it must be fair and \nresponsible. And indeed, it must meet its stated objectives. I have \nreluctantly come to the conclusion that as it now stands, this \nlegislation has lost sight of its objective and will do more harm than \ngood.\n  When we began this process of crafting legislative solutions to the \nproblem of tobacco use among our children, we all understood it would \nnot be easy. We knew that difficult and complicated issues needed to be \naddressed, and consensus would be hard to reach. But as I stand here \ntoday, I've become convinced that this effort has hopelessly faltered, \ntripped up by an unholy alliance of those who wanted to toughen the \nbill and those who wanted to kill it. We've lost our focus on our \noriginal goals. The lure of money to pay for both expensive tax cuts \nand federal programs, and the politics of punishment, have \nunfortunately proven irresistible.\n  We had, and regrettably for now we've lost, an historic opportunity \nto address underage tobacco use. While I did not agree with every \nelement of the proposed resolution of tobacco issues that emerged with \nthe original settlement agreement on June 20, 1997, I did see it as a \nchance to resolve many of the issues surrounding tobacco that have \nproven intractable in the past. The process of reaching the conclusion \nwas not perfect, and there were parties who were not invited to \nparticipate, most notably in my view the tobacco growers and tobacco \nworkers, to the extent their interests did not coincide with the \ncompanies'. But the framework for a resolution was there, representing \ncompromise by the states, the tobacco companies, and the public health \ncommunity.\n\n  A carefully crafted, moderate compromise, however, is no match for a \nhot political issue. Between those who focused on punishing tobacco \ncompanies, and those who focused solely on opposing a tax increase, we \nhave a political free-for-all. And these two factions, one of which \nbelieves it is protecting the children and the other which believes it \nis protecting the taxpayer, have united to create legislation in its \ncurrent state that has become unworkable, irresponsible and unlikely to \nsolve the problem it is designed to address.\n  This legislation should be about developing a plan to stop children \nfrom using tobacco products. And I do not doubt the commitment of those \nwho have worked so hard on this bill to achieve a reduction in youth \nsmoking. In my view, however, the amendments to the underlying bill \nthat we have adopted recently do not get us closer to that goal. To the \ncontrary, they make the essential compromise unreachable.\n  It is clear that the advertising and marketing rules the FDA put in \ntheir regulations represented the outer limits of what the government \ncould do to restrict speech without the consent of those being \nrestricted. To entice consent from the tobacco companies to modify \ntheir speech, the bill contained a cap on the amount of money a \nconsenting company could be required to pay during any one year. That \ncap did not shield any company from paying any judgment rendered by a \ncourt; it merely regulated the time period over which such payments \nwould be made.\n  During the amendment process, we've witnessed the emergence of an \nunlikely coalition of those who seek to punish the companies and those \nwho seek to kill the bill who teamed up to strip that provision from \nthe bill, virtually ensuring that no company will consent to greater \nrestrictions, and preventing us from further limiting the advertising \nand marketing practices of the tobacco companies which many have come \nto the floor to denounce. However gratifying that vote may have been \nfor some, I believe that amendment moved us away from our objective to \ncombat teen tobacco use.\n  I believe the absence of liability protection does even further \ndamage to the goal of the legislation. Without some limitation on \nliability, a ``Powerball'' plaintiff could hit a jackpot with a lone \njury and walk away with the keys to the company. If that occurs, the \ncompany's funds will not be there to spend in the public interest as \nelected representatives see fit, but will be spent however the winning \nplaintiff sees fit. No funds for counter-advertising, no funds for \nsmoking cessation programs, no money for cancer clinical trials and, \nyes, no money for farmers. This is a perverse result, which may satisfy \na short-term craving for revenge but will leave the programs we want to \nsupport starved for funding over the long-term.\n  A better approach, in my view, would be to eliminate punitive damages \nfor prior bad acts in exchange for a substantial up-front payment by \nthe tobacco industry. This approach would have the benefit of allowing \nthose ``punitive damages'' to go toward the public good, rather than to \nplaintiffs and their attorneys who ``hit the jackpot.''\n  Without liability protection, a single runaway jury could wipe out a \nmajor U.S. corporation, without any corresponding public benefit except \nthe satisfaction of some from ``slaying the beast.'' But it would come \nat great social cost. It would destroy the jobs of those employed by \nthose companies, and all of those in related jobs whose livelihoods \ndepend on the company. And because there would still be a demand for \ncigarettes, other companies, both foreign and domestic, would simply \nstep into the market and continue selling cigarettes, so there would be \nno guarantee of any perceptible public health benefit. I'm not \nconvinced that this is the most rational course.\n  I'm also uncomfortable with the look-back provisions. The look-back \nprovision sets up a performance standard, requiring certain goals of \ntobacco use reduction by minors. If those goals are not met, a strict \nliability scheme imposes penalties on those who manufacture tobacco \nproducts. While I certainly favor performance standards, I question \ntheir application when meeting the standard is not within the control \nof the entity charged with reaching it. Meeting the goals of the look-\nback provisions depend entirely on controlling the behavior of \nadolescents.\n  I'm not convinced that either the government or the tobacco companies \nreally know how to control teen behavior, and while we should certainly \ntry to develop methods of eliminating the use of tobacco products by \nadolescents, I don't believe we should assess damages against companies \nif those strategies don't work. The way the look-back provisions are \ncurrently structured, if the tobacco companies do everything this \nlegislation requires them to do, and it doesn't work, they are still \nassessed damages, regardless of culpability. I believe this \noverestimates the power of the tobacco companies, because it requires \ncompanies to be responsible for the behavior of adolescents.\n  Finally, with regard to the tax increase on tobacco products, I'm not \nunalterably opposed to raising the price. In fact, I voted against the \namendment that would have eliminated any tax from this bill. I have in \nthe past supported necessary tax increases when I believed them to be \nin the national interest, such as the 1993 deficit reduction package \nwhich has helped spur the economy. But I believe we should think long \nand hard before levying a tax that disproportionately taxes those at \nthe bottom of the economic ladder. If we determine that raising the \nprice by $1.10 per pack is the only way to tackle the problem of teen \ntobacco use, then I believe we have an obligation to assess it. But \ngiven the uncertainty as to what will actually stop teens from trying \nto act like adults by smoking, it seems to me we should try other \napproaches first. A massive, regressive tax ought not be the first \nresort, it should be the last resort.\n  In its 1996 regulations, for example, the Food and Drug \nAdministration indicated that marketing and advertising restrictions, \nand tougher retail enforcement, could cut teen tobacco use\n\n[[Page S5766]]\n\nin half. While that estimate was likely overly optimistic, I think that \nwe can expand upon the approach taken by the FDA to achieve the goal we \nall share. In the proposed rule, the FDA stated that ``the agency has \nexamined many options for reducing tobacco use by children and \nadolescents, and believes an effective program must address the two \nfollowing areas: (1) Restrictions on cigarette and smokeless tobacco \nsales that will make these products less accessible to young people; \nand (2) restrictions on labeling and advertising to help reduce the \nappeal of tobacco products to young people along with requirements for \na manufacturer-funded national education campaign aimed at those under \n18 years of age to help reduce the products' appeal to these young \npeople.'' I would prefer enhancing these proposals, and determining \nwhether they can solve the problem, before assessing a major tax on \nadults. Since only 2% of the cigarettes purchased are used by children, \nI would place emphasis on a far more precise tool than a tax on the \nother 98%, unless such a tax is the only weapon left in our arsenal.\n  For example, I would like to focus more on requiring those children \nwho smoke to accept some short-term consequences of the decisions they \nmake, such as taking away their car keys.\n  This is the type of approach that would be a more exact tool. But it \nis not to say that I could not have supported some look-back provision, \nor some tax increase, so long as they were contained in an otherwise \nbalanced bill and the proceeds targetted toward supporting and \nenhancing the objective. In fact, I agreed to serve on the tobacco task \nforce to try to help develop a balanced approach that would solve the \nproblem. I knew going in that no proposal would be completely to my \nliking, and I was prepared to accept some less palatable provisions as \npart of a workable package I could have embraced.\n  For example, although I've always believed the look-back provisions \nwere not sound public policy, despite the support they had from the \ncompanies, as part of a fair and reasonable resolution, I could have \nsupported this approach. I was willing to accept a certain level of \nvariance from my ideal in the interest of accomplishing the \nobjective. This legislation, however, has reached the point where the \nburden is too heavy and the variance too great.\n\n  I cannot in good conscience support legislation which places too \nheavy a burden on people I represent without some guarantee that their \nlegitimate concerns would be addressed and without some certainty that \nthe objective of reducing youth tobacco use would be met. All along, \nI've wanted to achieve the dual goal of reducing teen tobacco use and \nlooking out for the economic well-being of the hard-working people I'm \nhere to serve.\n  This bill in its current form no longer has enough emphasis on these \nobjectives, which is why I now am not supporting it. An unusual \nconfluence of those who want to punish the companies and those who want \nto kill the bill have shaped legislation which many of us who wanted a \nresponsible bill can no longer support. I had hoped to come to a \ndifferent conclusion about this process. I still believe that a \nproperly crafted global settlement is in the best interest of those \nconcerned about tobacco. A resolution of the issues that have dogged \nthe tobacco industry for decades, if done correctly, would be good for \ngrowers and their communities, children, tobacco workers, the tobacco \nindustry, smokers, non-smokers, and the public health community. The \nuncertainty that now surrounds these issues is good for no one.\n  Discussed rationally, I believe we could develop a solution that \nwould address these uncertainties. On the floor of the Senate during an \nelection year, as we all know, rational discourse doesn't always carry \nthe day.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I began this process \nwith an open mind and a sincere belief that comprehensive tobacco \nlegislation that could be both reasonable and effective in reducing \nsmoking among our youth was in the best interest of all parties \ninvolved. I would have supported that legislation. But in the last \nthree weeks, in amendments aimed at punishing tobacco companies, we \nhave weakened the ability of this legislation to do what we all say we \nwant it to do: reduce teen smoking. Again, this has been done by an \nunfortunate alliance of those who want a bill that's too punitive and \nthose who want simply to kill this bill. In the end, I cannot support \nlegislation that brings great and unnecessary economic harm on working \npeople, and does not effectively achieve the benefit of preventing \nyoung Virginians--and young Americans--from becoming young smokers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. ROBB. I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend from Virginia, I have great \nrespect for his analysis and for the sober, introspective approach that \nhe brought to this legislation. I must say I cannot disagree with him--\nthat from, certainly, my perspective, there are one or two amendments \nthat have been agreed to that may be a reflection of sort of a first-\nround fervor on the floor of the Senate. On the other hand, I am \nconvinced that is going to change over the course of the legislative \nprocess. Some people have been trying to wish this bill dead for some \nperiod of time.\n  I think the Senator from Arizona and I would agree, this bill is not \ndead. This bill is going to continue to be fought out in the context of \nthe Senate. I hope in the end the Senator from Virginia will find that, \nwhile he may not agree with what could still leave the Senate floor--\nand I believe the bill could still leave the Senate floor--if the \nCongress of the United States works its will in a complete way, it is \npossible that something could come back, ultimately, that the Senator \nmay feel is better.\n  I also respect the Senator's particular needs with respect to \nVirginia. There are certain Senators here who obviously have a very \nparticular problem they need to try to resolve in the context of this \nlegislation. At the moment, there is not certainty as to that for the \nSenator. But I might say that might be also resolved as we go along \nhere. So, I do respect his thinking on it. I appreciate his thoughtful \napproach.\n  Just so colleagues may have a sense of where we are and what we are \ndoing, we do believe it may be possible within a short period of time \nthat there would be a couple of votes. Our hope is to be able, though \nit is not yet guaranteed, to proceed forward with a couple of votes, \nconceivably one on the Coverdell amendment and then an alternative \nthereto, and then conceivably, first thing tomorrow, we may be able to \ndeal with the issues of the Gramm amendment and a Democrat alternative \nto it.\n  So, even though things are not bubbling over with excitement on the \nfloor itself, I think there is some quiet progress being made in some \nmeetings behind the scenes. Hopefully, that will allow us to begin to \nbreak forward and set up something of a legislative agenda where we can \nbegin to debate some additional amendments and, hopefully, proceed \nforward. That, obviously, will continue to depend on the goodwill of \nour colleagues and on the degree to which there is a good-faith effort \nto try to legislate rather than to procrastinate. Hopefully, within a \nshort period of time we may be able to propound a request with respect \nto that.\n  I see the Senator from Wisconsin is on his feet and wishes to speak, \nso I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I come here today to discuss an amendment to \nthe tobacco bill and to highlight how tobacco companies have used court \nsecrecy orders to deceive and endanger the American public. While \nsecrecy orders may be justified to protect personal information or \ntrade secrets, they all too often have been abused--especially by \ntobacco companies--to undermine health and safety. We need to strike a \nbetter balance and make sure this tactic can't be used to cover up \nfuture bad conduct.\n  Typically, tobacco companies--like many other defendants--threaten \nthat without ``secrecy,'' they will fight to conceal every document, \nand they will refuse to settle. They insist on making secrecy--or \n``protective''--orders a precondition to turning over documents and to \nsettlement. And overmatched\n\n[[Page S5767]]\n\nvictims have no choice but to accept these demands, even though there \nis no legal reason why most of the documents should be kept under \nwraps.\n  While courts actually have the legal authority to deny requests for \nsecrecy, often they do not--because both sides have agreed, and judges \ndon't take the time to independently look into the matter themselves.\n  Over the years, we have raised this concern, citing several examples, \nincluding defective heart valves, exploding fuel tanks, and dangerous \nplayground equipment. In case after case, people have been injured or \nkilled by defective products that remained on the market while crucial \ninformation was sealed from the public light. This is not only wrong, \nit is also unacceptable.\n  There is no doubt that the most flagrant abuse of secrecy orders \ninvolves Big Tobacco. This tactic has served the industry in two \ndisturbing ways. First, it dramatically drove up the cost of litigation \nby making every plaintiff ``reinvent the wheel.'' As one tobacco \nofficial boasted, rather crudely, ``the way we won these cases was not \nby spending all of [our] money, but by making that other S.O.B. spend \nall his.'' And secrecy orders helped them do it.\n  Second, secrecy kept crucial documents away from public view. The \ntobacco companies have used secrecy orders and attorney-client \nprivilege to conceal all kinds of materials critical to public health \nand safety, including many relating to teen smoking and nicotine \nlevels. Once these documents were released, public outrage compelled \naction. But if the public had this information earlier, we could have \nsaved thousands of lives.\n  The underlying tobacco bill--which I strongly support--sets up a \ndepository where tobacco companies are supposed to send current and \nfuture documents. But the tobacco companies have made clear that they \nwill not cooperate. They'll just tie up this and other provisions in \ncourt, and the promise of a meaningful document library will literally \nbe empty.\n  So the bill leaves a big, big loophole. In the future, tobacco \ncompanies could add new ingredients to cigarettes that pose health \nrisks or make tobacco more addictive. And they will still be able to \nrely on secrecy orders to conceal these hazards from the public.\n  Our proposal will close this loophole. It is simple, effective and \nlimited in scope. It only applies to a small category of cases, like \ntobacco, which involve public health or safety. Before approving \nsecrecy orders, courts would apply a balancing test--they could permit \nsecrecy solely if the need for privacy outweighs the public's right to \nknow. In addition, the amendment bars any agreement that would prevent \ndisclosure to the federal and state agencies charged with protecting \npublic safety.\n  Mr. President, our proposal does apply to more than just tobacco \ncases, of course, and it should. We need to prevent others from copying \nthe tobacco industry's tactics.\n  Bipartisan support for this proposal has grown over the years. Last \nCongress, it passed the Judiciary Committee 11 to 7. So if the tobacco \nbill moves forward, this proposal should be included.\n  But even if the tobacco bill goes down, we still need to address this \nproblem. Because who knows what other hazards are hidden behind \ncourthouse doors? So if necessary I will offer this amendment to \nanother measure.\n  Today, a debate is raging about whether the President is hiding \nbehind court orders and legal privileges. But when health and safety \nare at issue, there shouldn't be any debate at all. This is far too \nimportant. We need to learn our lessons from tobacco and take action to \nstop the next threat.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I want to speak just for a moment about \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights that we have introduced in the Senate and \nthat many of us in the Senate hope can be considered on an expeditious \nbasis by the U.S. Senate.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights is a piece of legislation designed to \naddress some of the concerns we have about managed care. In many \ninstances, health plans are denying patients the right to know all of \nthe treatment options available for their not just the cheapest \ntreatments available. The Patients' Bill of Rights would guarantee that \nright, along with the opportunity to understand your rights with \nrespect to emergency care and a range of other rights that we believe \nshould be inherent.\n  I want to tell the Senate another story, as we have done almost every \nday the Senate has been in session, that describes, again, the urgent \nneed for passage of the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  This is about a young woman named Paige Lancaster from Stafford, VA. \nIn 1991, when Paige Lancaster was 11 years old, her mother took her to \nsee her HMO pediatrician because she had complained of nausea and \nsevere daily headaches for some long while.\n  For the next 4 years, Paige repeatedly sought medical treatment for \nheadaches from two other HMO pediatricians available. They prescribed \nadult-strength narcotics but never once consulted with a neurologist \nnor did they recommend during all this time an MRI, CAT scan, EEG, or \nany other diagnostic test, for that matter, to diagnose Paige's \ncondition.\n  Then in 1996, Paige's school counselor worried about this young \ngirl's deteriorating high school performance. She recommended to the \ndoctors that they perform some diagnostic tests to determine the cause \nof this young lady's debilitating symptoms.\n  Mr. President, 4\\1/2\\ years after the first visit by this child \ncomplaining of severe headaches, the doctors finally ordered an EEG and \nan MRI. The MRI revealed a massive right frontal tumor and cystic mass \nthat had infiltrated over 40 percent of her brain. One week later, \nPaige underwent surgery to remove the tumor. However, the surgery was \nunsuccessful because of the tumor's size and maturity. Paige then \nunderwent a second and third surgery and radiation therapy, and she is, \nwe are told, likely to require additional surgery and ongoing intensive \ncare.\n  What is so outrageous about this case is that the HMO covering Paige \nhad in place a financial incentive program under which her physicians \nwould receive bonuses for avoiding excessive treatments and tests.\n  This is not something new. We know of managed care organizations in \nwhich the contracts with the physicians require that, if a patient of \nthe physician shows up in an emergency room, the cost of that emergency \ntreatment comes out of the payment to the physician--an unholy \ncircumstance, in my judgment, because it creates exactly the wrong kind \nof incentive for physicians.\n  In this case there is the same kind of incentive in reverse. The HMO \nhad in place a financial incentive under which physicians would receive \nbonuses for avoiding excessive treatments and tests. Clearly, \nphysicians should not prescribe excessive treatments and tests, but, \njust as clearly, physicians should not have to consider their own \nfinancial circumstances when determining whether they should prescribe \na test.\n  The Lancasters, Paige's parents, challenged the HMO's handling of \nPaige's case, but, unfortunately for them, the insurance for their \nchildren was provided by Mr. Lancaster's employer and was subject to \nsomething called ERISA, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. \nUnder ERISA, the only available remedy to the patient is the cost of \nthe benefit denied, in this case the $800 cost of the MRI. In other \nwords, under ERISA, the HMO cannot be sued. The piece of legislation \nthat we have proposed in the U.S. Senate, the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nwould hold HMOs accountable by allowing patients to sue when their \nHMO's coverage, or lack of it, has caused them harm. The bill will also \nrequire HMOs to disclose any financial\n\n[[Page S5768]]\n\nincentives that might cause the HMO doctors to skimp on patient care. \nAny incentives that exist between the HMO and the doctor must be \ndisclosed to the patients.\n\n  This young girl, Paige Lancaster, waited nearly 5 years for a \ndiagnosis, one might argue, in part, because the wrong incentives \nexisted between an HMO and a doctor. The incentives were about saving \nmoney rather than providing quality health care.\n  We very much hope we can get back to the notion in this country that \npracticing medicine ought to be done in doctor's offices and hospitals, \nnot in the office of some insurance company accountant 500 or 1,000 \nmiles away. It is our hope that we will be able to bring to the floor \nof the Senate the Patients' Bill of Rights because we think this \ncountry needs it. We hope the Senate can debate it and pass it in the \ncoming weeks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the other day, I had the pleasure of \nbeing invited to join my son Ben at the Blessed Sacrament School in \nArlington to see my granddaughter participate in one of her first \nevents at that school. I appreciated that opportunity because I had \noccasion to meet up with a friend, Elizabeth ``Betsy'' Downs Engelken, \nwho has been a teacher there for some 20 years. We have something in \ncommon. She happens to also have a relationship to my granddaughter, \nbecause she is the mother of my son's wife, Elizabeth.\n  As Betsy retires after 20 years, I thought I would come to the floor \nand talk about this lady who has developed such creative teaching \nskills and has endless enthusiasm for the children with whom she works. \nShe has a sparkling sense of humor, and it is really a delight to see \nwhat she has done working with the Diocese of Arlington for these past \n20 years.\n  While she has been there, Betsy Engelken has developed unique talents \nto identify students that need special assistance and have learning \ndisabilities. She has been a representative of the teachers on the \nschool board and successfully initiated action to bring about \nadditional recognition for teachers and pay increases.\n  She has worked on developing new techniques to find ways to bring \nchildren into the 21st century. She has brought them awareness of the \nnew kinds of systems that they encounter as they go through school. But \nabove all, I think she has really had a great impact on the many \nchildren she has taught because she has a real commitment to children.\n  So I want to share with my colleagues the joy I have had recently in \nterms of being able to participate in this event with my granddaughter \nSusan. And I also want to congratulate Elizabeth ``Betsy'' Downs \nEngelken for her years of commitment to the children of this area.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, as most Senators are aware, there is a \nsigning ceremony at the White House at 5:30 on the highway \ntransportation bill, so a large number of Senators will be there for \nthat occasion. But we thought it was important we get a vote on the \ndrug-related amendment this afternoon. So we have checked with parties \non both sides.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on amendment No. 2451 at 6 \np.m. this evening, and immediately following that vote the Senate \nproceed to vote on the Democratic alternative, with the time between \nnow and 6 o'clock to be equally divided on the issue of drugs.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that immediately following the \ngranting of this consent, the Democratic leader be recognized to offer \ntheir alternative, and the Coverdell amendment be temporarily laid \naside for that purpose.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators--and I know Senator \nKerry will want to comment; but I want to make it clear what we have \ndone here--these two votes will be the two votes that will begin at 6 \np.m., with one right behind the one at 6. They will be the last two \nvotes of the evening.\n  Following those two votes, we will continue to work on a similar \nagreement, which we have not yet gotten everybody to sign off on, that \nwill provide for votes on the marriage penalty and the self-\ndeductibility of taxes issue by midday on Wednesday. We are working to \nsee if we can get an agreement to have a vote at 1 o'clock, followed by \nan alternative that the Democrats would offer.\n  We do have a joint meeting in the morning to hear the President of \nSouth Korea at 10 o'clock. So we will not actually be able to get \nstarted on the marriage penalty and its alternative discussion until \nabout 11 o'clock. But Senators will be notified when the second cloture \nvote will occur and the marriage penalty votes will occur during \nWednesday's session of the Senate, we assume shortly after the noon \nhour; hopefully by 1 or 2 o'clock.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the majority leader for \nhis hard work in putting together this unanimous consent agreement. At \nthe completion of it, we will have made progress on two of the very \nimportant key issues associated with this legislation, the drugs and \ntax cut. I also want to thank him for comity in giving the other side, \nobviously, an opportunity to propose their amendment. I am very \nencouraged by this. It seems to me, and the majority leader I hope \nwould agree, that there are a couple of substitutes--attorneys' fees \nand the agricultural issues--that are the difference between Lugar and \nthe LEAF bill that would keep us from completing action on this \nlegislation.\n  I want to thank the majority leader, again.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator would yield, I want to say I have discussed \nwith him today and with others in the Senate and in the administration, \nthe fact of the matter is, we sort of have been locked in this position \nfor a week. The important thing was to try to come to an agreement and \nget some votes on these important issues. This gets us started in that \ndirection. I think that is important.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think they are two important provisions. Obviously, we \nhave had significant debate on both the issue of drugs and tax cuts. \nI'm very pleased that we are going to make progress on both of those \nissues.\n  I hope the substitutes--one, I understand by Senator Hatch, and the \nother by Senators Gramm and Domenici would be ready for us to start \ndebating and discussing. We also plan to have another amendment on \nattorneys' fees, and then what remains, I think we could hopefully get \ntime agreements on the amendments.\n  As we go through this process, one, we don't have a lot of time left; \nand, two, we have our up days and our down days. I suggest that all of \nus try to take and keep a steady stream as we work our way through this \nimportant issue.\n  I thank my friend from Massachusetts for his sincere and very valiant \neffort to try and maintain the comity on both sides of the aisle. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the \nminority leader for their efforts, jointly, with\n\n[[Page S5769]]\n\nthe Senator from Arizona and others. I am certainly appreciative of the \nfact we are able to proceed forward with a couple of votes here. I \nthink this is an important beginning of our efforts to be able to \nreally tie down narrowly some of the most contentious issues and to be \nable to lay out, hopefully, an agenda for the rest of the week which \nwould really enable us to make some progress.\n  As the Senator from Arizona said, there really aren't that many major \nissues. There are some concerns Senators have and there are certainly \namendments out there, some of which I know the Senator from Arizona and \nI are perfectly prepared to accept in the context of improving the \nbill, that we have before the Senate.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2634 to Amendment No. 2437\n\n  (Purpose: To stop illegal drugs from entering the United States, to \nprovide additional resources to combat illegal drugs, and to establish \n           disincentives for teenagers to use illegal drugs)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, at this time, I send the Democratic \nalternative to the desk on behalf of Senator Daschle and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Coverdell \namendment is set aside and the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry] for Mr. Daschle, \n     for himself, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2634 to amendment No. 2437.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time will be equally divided.\n  Mr. KERRY. Just to inform Senators and others about what is happening \nhere, we will vote on the Coverdell amendment and we will also vote on \na Democratic alternative. The Democratic alternative covers many of the \nprovisions of the Coverdell amendment with respect to drugs, beefing up \nour Customs enforcement, beefing up the Coast Guard, providing for \ncapacity to be able to do a better job of drug enforcement, but it does \nso in a way that does not strip from the tobacco legislation the \ncapacity to perform what we set out to perform under the health \nprovisions.\n  We have maintained the minimum expenditures with respect to the \ncounteradvertising and cessation programs and thereby kept a floor of \nthose things we hope to achieve within the original tobacco \nlegislation. I think that is the most important distinction.\n  In addition to that, there are a few other distinctions with respect \nto the needle program. There is a 1-year moratorium rather than a total \nstripping of that provision. In addition to that, there are a few other \ncorrective measures with respect to testing and other aspects.\n  Finally, I might add with respect to the vouchers--because that is, \nobviously, constitutionally and otherwise such a contentious issue \nwithin the Senate--the Democrat alternative provides for the capacity \nfor any victim of a drug-related crime or violent crime within a school \nsystem to be able to be properly transferred to another school, but \nwithout the guise of creating a whole new program with respect to \neducation that would involve both private schools, parochial schools \nand the kind of support structure for those schools that obviously has \ndivided the Senate so much in other legislation. We believe it is a \nmore temperate, reasonable approach to the issue that allows us to do \nthe best of what is in the Coverdell proposal with respect to drugs, \nbut also maintain the best of what is in the tobacco legislation.\n  That is a fundamental summary, if you will, of the distinctions \nbetween the two approaches, both of which will be voted on shortly \nafter the hour of 6 o'clock.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add the Senator from \nDelaware, Senator Biden, as a cosponsor of the alternative.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator \nCoverdell's and Senator Craig's amendment. These two Senators have \nfocused attention on a critical issue for the next generation of \nAmericans.\n  We are here today to discuss the McCain bill, which seeks to combat \nteen smoking. Now, I doubt whether anyone in this Chamber would argue \nwith the notion that teen smoking and use of tobacco products should be \ncurtailed. But I want to focus our attention on the fact that there are \nother arguably more serious problems that our young people are facing \ntoday and seem to be turning a blind eye to.\n  I have been told for months that this antitobacco effort is aimed at \none goal and one goal only. That is, making sure our children don't \nsmoke and stop if they have started. If the real motivation for this \nbill were, in fact, to address the problems facing our young people, \nthen someone please tell me why we are not here today addressing other \nserious problems that teenage Americans are facing--even more serious \nproblems, problems that impact their life in a more direct manner. Why \nare we not dealing with the problem of teenage drug use which has been \non the rise in recent years? Why are we not dealing with the \nfrightening problem of juvenile violence, which is a throwoff from drug \nuse? Why are we not dealing with the problem of teen drinking, with \nalcohol-related fatalities on the rise around American college campuses \nand high schools?\n  Teenage drug use today leads to ruined lives and overdose deaths \nevery single day in this country. Underage alcohol drinking leads to \ndrunken-driving fatalities every single day in this country.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported two-\nthirds of eighth graders have experimented with alcohol and 28 percent \nhave been drunk at least once. Two-thirds of eighth graders have been \ndrunk at least once.\n  A recent study by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse says that \nthe earlier people start drinking, the more likely they are to become \nalcoholics and addicted.\n  Let's put this in the proper perspective. We are debating a $1 \ntrillion bill that is aimed at preventing children from starting to \nsmoke. Yet, how many billions of dollars are we proposing to combat \nthose other ills that plague our children, which are, in my opinion, \nmore direct and more immediate?\n\n  I would like to focus today on the biggest of these problems now \nfacing America's young people, which is the crisis of illegal drugs. \nWhile tobacco use by teenagers is a problem, illegal drug use by \nteenagers is much more than a problem, it is a crisis. And if our \nmandate is to protect our Nation's children, then we must not ignore \nour illicit drug crisis. I believe we should take this opportunity to \naddress the problem of the illegal drug crisis in America.\n  Illegal drugs and drug-related crimes are ripping apart the fiber of \nfamilies and communities, weighing down our education and health care \nsystems, overburdening the resources of law enforcement, prosecutors, \ncourts, and prisons. Drugs are literally changing the nature of the \ncountry our children and grandchildren will inherit. It is a crisis.\n  Drugs are altering the very definition of what it means to be a child \nin this country today. They alter the experiences that children have in \nschool, and they are altering children's perception of the world around \nthem.\n  Drugs are now a pervasive part of what it means to grow up as an \nadolescent in this country. If you are not a teenager who engages in \ndrug use, you will be one who will be confronted by others who are drug \nusers and presented with the temptation.\n  I do not think anyone in this Chamber, as much as they might dislike \ntobacco use, could stand up with a straight face and say the same \nthings about the evils of smoking cigarettes that I have just said \nabout drug use. Drug use is a problem of an entirely different \nmagnitude, and it is unbelievable to me that we are not addressing that \nproblem today.\n  Let's look at the hard numbers that demonstrate the recent rise in \nillegal drug use among teenagers while Congress has continued to ignore \nthe problem--and we have ignored it.\n  Surveys released recently have uniformly shown that drug use is on \nthe rise by our young people. Among\n\n[[Page S5770]]\n\neighth graders--now, these are really children--the proportion using \nillegal drugs in the prior 12 months has increased by 56 percent since \n1992. Now, these are children. Overall teenage drug use has doubled \nsince 1992. One-half of 17-year-olds now say they could buy marijuana \nwithin an hour.\n  Marijuana-related emergency room incidents rose 32 percent last year \nas a direct result of higher drug impurities and marijuana laced with \nPCP.\n  The Drug Abuse Warning Network has data that says that heroin-related \nemergency room episodes increased a whopping 27 percent in 1997. Now, \nthese are heroin-related episodes among teenagers--up 27 percent in 1 \nyear. Cocaine-related episodes increased by 21 percent. We are not \ntalking about the population as a whole; we are talking about \nteenagers.\n  And between 1993 and 1994, the number of overall drug-related \nincidents rose by 17 percent for individuals between the ages of 12 and \n17--12 years old.\n  In 1993, one out of three juveniles detained by police were under the \ninfluence of illicit drugs at the time of their offense, and this is \naccording to statistics from the U.S. Justice Department. This \nrepresents a 25 percent increase in crimes committed by young people--\nteenagers.\n  It is plain to see that the Clinton administration has been asleep at \nthe wheel on the illegal drug problem. The President is focusing much \nmore of their time and energy on the use of tobacco.\n  Just look at what the administration's Office of National Drug \nControl Policy has said about tobacco use by teens versus illegal drugs \nby teens. The drug control strategy of this administration is laid out \nin so-called performance measures of effectiveness. That is a very \nhigh-sounding thing we are going to do. But in this document, the \nadministration discloses that they have more ambitious goals about \nlowering teenage smoking and tobacco use than they do about lowering \nteenage drug use.\n  They state that their goals are to reduce youth tobacco consumption \nby 25 percent by 2002 and by 55 percent in 2007. Now, for drug use, \nthey hope to get down about 20 percent by 2002, which is 5 percent less \nthan tobacco, and 50 percent by 2007--again, 5 percent less than \ntobacco. So it is clear in black and white that the administration's \n10-year national drug control strategy is focused on tobacco and not on \ndrugs.\n  While this President is busy taking on tobacco, a National Guard \ncounterdrug program has been decreased by $32 million since 1997. This \nis the very program that helps local sheriffs, who simply cannot afford \nto own helicopters, planes, and the pilots to go with them. They are \nfighting drugs on a local level.\n  With the President's approach, total smoking will not decrease at \nall; the children will be smoking marijuana and not tobacco. This \nadministration cares more about tobacco use than it does about illegal \ndrugs. In my opinion, this is a serious misplacement of priorities.\n  Let me emphasize that I don't even have faith that what the McCain \nbill proposes to do--supposedly in the name of reducing teenage tobacco \nuse--will even work. It rests on the twin pillars of an advertising ban \nand a price increase in order to accomplish a decrease in teen tobacco \nuse.\n\n  They propose doing away with tobacco advertising, and the sponsors \nargue that all these flashy, colorful tobacco ads cause kids to smoke. \nWell, there has never been, as far as I know, an ad for illegal drugs \nor marijuana in this country; yet, the youth of the Nation are using it \nmore and more every day. They seem to have found out about it without \nit being advertised.\n  Secondly, the McCain bill proposes to raise the price of tobacco \nproducts drastically, from roughly $2 to $5 for a pack of cigarettes, \nand that the youth of this country, the teenagers, are price sensitive. \nThey think that raising the price would cause these teenagers to stop \nsmoking. What it will do is provoke, quickly and surely, a massive \nblack market so that schoolchildren will be able to buy smuggled \ncigarettes out of the back of a truck.\n  I have some more news. If they think raising the price of a pack of \ncigarettes will slow down cigarette smoking, why hasn't drug use been \ntotally eliminated? The price of marijuana and cocaine on the black \nmarket is astronomical.\n  Therefore, the two pillars upon which the McCain bill rests its \nattack on teen smoking--an ad ban and a high price--are already in \nplace with respect to illegal drugs. What have they done there? Not \nanything.\n  Instead of focusing on these flawed approaches to fighting the \nproblem of teen smoking, we should be looking at legislation that \nproposes new and innovative approaches to fight the crisis of illegal \ndrug use by our Nation's young people. The hard facts show that there \nis no mission more vital to our Nation's future than doing more to \nprotect our children and teenagers from the ravages of illegal drugs.\n  Let's not ignore this problem because it is more politically popular \nthese days to be against tobacco and to talk about it. This tobacco \nbill is nothing more than a smokescreen to hide the fact that the \nClinton administration has been out to lunch on the drug war for 6 \nyears.\n  It starts from the top. The President joked about his own use of \ndrugs. But drugs are no laughing matter, and they are destroying \nhundreds of thousands of young people in this country. They are the \nscourge of the schools and playgrounds. This amendment is about the \nsafety and health of the next generation. It is about the future of \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and the remainder of any time I \nmight have.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Senator McCain has said I may yield \nmyself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the \ntobacco bill. As we all know, under the present circumstances, we don't \nseem to be making much progress. On the other hand, I have been here \nlong enough to know that sometimes we go through these phases where we \ncome to situations where we have sort of a partisan battle on how we \nshould proceed, and then finally, after we do that for a while, we \nrecognize that we both ought to sit down and try to reconcile our \ndifferences and join together to make sure we do not let this \nopportunity pass that we have before us, where we could do so much to \nhelp, on the one hand, stop teenagers from starting to smoke and, on \nthe other hand, help those who are addicted to tobacco and do what we \ncan to ensure that they are taken care of.\n  One of the most sticky problems we have is what to do as far as how \nto compensate the victims of tobacco. We tried initially to have a \nsystem set up where the amount of money that would be subject to \nlawsuits and claims would be capped. That was killed with the Gregg-\nLeahy amendment. I have been involved in a number of issues over the \nyears involving these kinds of matters, not the least of which was \nexamining the situation with respect to asbestos, black lung disease, \nand other matters. And it seemed to me and to others that we ought to \nlook at it as an opportunity to find a solution other than through the \ncourt system.\n\n  I am here today to talk about an amendment that Senator Sessions, \nSenator Enzi, and I plan to offer in the Senate--in fact, it has \nalready been placed on file--to see what we can do to try to find a \nmore humane system to solve this very difficult situation. Hours, days, \nand weeks have been spent arguing about liability, per-pack tax levels, \nStates rights, and other issues.\n  But why are we really here?\n  No. 1, to reduce teen smoking; and, most importantly, to assure that \nteens don't start smoking, because we know if they don't start smoking, \nthe odds are they never will smoke. Also, to strengthen the public \nhealth program and to ensure that victims of smoking are compensated \nfairly. That is what I would like to concentrate on today. The \namendment that we have will bring logic to the system of compensating \nindividuals.\n  As I mentioned earlier, throughout my time in Congress I have \nauthored legislation to prevent smoking, supported increasing cigarette \nprices and requiring manufacturers to disclose the\n\n[[Page S5771]]\n\ningredients in cigarettes, and worked to reverse the impact of tobacco \non the health of Americans. In fact, the present bill contains a \nsubstantial amount of the language that came from our committee in \nthese areas. It has been adopted by the McCain bill. We have some very \ngood provisions in the basic bill. We have a foundation to build upon. \nI have done all of these things hoping that together we could end the \nblight that cigarettes have brought to the lives of millions in this \nNation.\n  Any legislation that Congress approves must ensure that families and \nindividuals harmed by tobacco receive compensation in a timely and \nequitable manner. I fear, though, that this legislation we are finally \nconsidering will not achieve that goal. I am sure it won't. That is why \nI am here today.\n  With this bill, States are granted funds to begin to pay the health \ncosts associated with smoking. Individuals, however, are left on their \nown to seek justice through the court system. You can only imagine the \nconsequence of 50 million people bringing lawsuits. That is the number \nof potential claimants that you have. I know many lawyers out there are \nonly all too ready to participate in this action. With up to 40 percent \nof the compensation going directly into their pockets, on the average, \nthe lawyers in this Nation are happy to see this situation occur. But I \nam not sure that is the most equitable and fair way of doing it. \nBillions of dollars are at stake, and millions of people's lives are at \nstake.\n  But if the legal profession benefits, who loses? Those truly \ndeserving of compensation--smokers and their families facing serious \nhealth consequences from smoking--will be left counting pennies. Our \namendment attempts to hand these funds to those Americans who must \nrecover from the tragedy of their addiction, and their families.\n  Our amendment would set up a compensation system designed by a \nbipartisan commission to award compensation to tobacco victims. This is \nnot a situation where blame has to be determined--the tobacco companies \nadmit to the linkage of smoking to illness. All we are concerned about \nhere is how we should compensate.\n  Also, there is a certain logic in one of the problems with bringing \nthe court suits. It is a thing called ``assuming the risk,'' where the \nindividuals have had years of looking at labels which tell them that it \nis a danger to their health. That creates a problem in the tort system \nas to how you award compensation.\n  The asbestos cases, as I mentioned earlier, provide us with an \nexample of what may happen if we rely only on the judicial system to \nresolve the millions of claims against the tobacco manufacturers. As I \nwill show later, it shows you what kind of system came about from the \nasbestos cases because of the horrendous mess that occurred in the \ncourts. In the asbestos situation, only hundreds of thousands of \nlawsuits were brought, and they brought the system to a stoppage. They \ncreated a catastrophe. When you think that tobacco could result in \nmillions of cases, you can only imagine what would happen in the court \nsystem if this were allowed to continue with this as the only option.\n  With asbestos, Federal judges struggled with an overwhelming backlog \nof lawsuits filed across the country on behalf of the asbestos victims. \nMany of these victims contracted fatal lung disease in working with the \nproduct.\n  I add as a side note, because there is somewhat of a linkage here, \nthat those who suffered from asbestosis and smoked ended up with a much \nworse situation. So we even have a linkage in that respect.\n  Many victims died before the courts considered their case. These \npeople never received the compensation they deserved in these cases. We \ncannot let this happen again in the tobacco case.\n  Lawsuits over asbestos claims have been mired in the Federal and \nState courts for over two decades. These lawsuits are few compared to \nthe millions that will arise related to tobacco. In fact, 200,000 \nasbestos cases were filed in which compensation has been paid.\n  Another 200,000 cases are pending, and another 200,000 are projected \nto be filed in the future. Many of the 200,000 claimants who have \nreceived compensation have only received about 10 cents on the dollar \nof what they deserve. It is not getting any better for the remaining \nclaimants.\n  I shudder to think how long victims of tobacco will need to wait to \nmake it through the courts. Must we again allow individuals to die, \nwaiting for their cases to be heard or settlement to be reached?\n  No, and we have the solution. No lengthy depositions, years waiting \nto get to courts, weeks of trial and so on. But first of all, let me \ntalk a little bit about what happened in the asbestos situation.\n  First of all, when the cases were brought the system came pretty much \nto a screeching halt, there were so many cases filed. Then awards were \ngranted, heavy damage awards for the first victims. And what happened? \nThe companies were driven into bankruptcy. Finally, in order to allow \nthose companies to at least continue in business, a trust situation was \nset up so they are run by a trust. A certain amount of the available \nprofits were made available for compensation to victims. However, also, \nto allow you to see how appropriate this kind of system might be in \nthis case, they also were allowed, if they were not happy with \ncompensation through the commission proposal, to sue.\n  In the meantime, which has been a couple of years now that this \nsystem has been in effect, only one person has gone to the court after \ngoing through the compensation commission.\n  Similarly, our amendment will create a commission to review the \nresearch and documents of the tobacco companies that they have long \nkept secret and compile a list of diseases linked to smoking and \ndevelop the compensation that these individuals deserve for their \ninjuries. An individual harmed by smoking can simply apply to the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services for compensation and receive it \nin an expedited manner.\n  Also, we have it worded such that we want to make sure--although we \nare talking billions of dollars here, that could rise up to many, many \nbillions, up to $25 billion that could be held in trust for this \npurpose--we would make sure that those who are most harmed would be \nconsidered first. The compensation may be so huge, as far as all of the \nindividuals who may be affected, that you want to make sure those who \nare permanently disabled or those who are terminally ill would be fully \ncompensated before you get into the lesser harmed individuals.\n  The amendment also gives these individuals the ability to appeal the \ndecision that was reached if they feel it is appropriate.\n  The program is funded by voluntary contributions from the tobacco \nmanufacturers. If they refuse to participate, as was in the original \npart of the bill, they would be subject to the current use of the \ncourts to get the injured parties their just compensation.\n  The method we have developed would put compensating funds in the \nhands of victims and not their lawyers. As the asbestos cases show, \nindividuals received less than 40 cents on the dollar of the \ncompensation for the harm they incurred. The lion's share of the money \nwent to make lawyers very wealthy. Why should we do so again? Our \napproach will avoid costly lawyers' fees and get the compensation to \npeople who deserve it the most.\n  The asbestos cases will also illustrate what will happen if we rely \non lawyers and the courts to strangle the tobacco companies. The \nasbestos companies eventually went bankrupt, as I mentioned earlier, \nbecause of a few earlier judgments that gave claimants such large sums \nof money. Unfortunately, after companies went bankrupt, individuals who \nhad their suits settled or a judgment reached received only 10 cents on \nthe dollar for damages suffered. A majority of the harmed individuals \nreceived almost nothing. In fact, people suffering almost identical \nsymptoms from asbestos exposure received vastly different awards, \ndepending on the jury that heard their case.\n  These lessons outline for me the importance of the approach we are \ntaking to provide proper compensation to tobacco victims. The amendment \nwill allow the claims to be sorted through and the funds distributed in \na timely manner. With this we avoid the huge backlog of cases in our \nstate and federal courts. We grant compensation before the injured \nparties are no longer\n\n[[Page S5772]]\n\nwith us. We ensure that tobacco victims will be given their due without \nlawyers taking a major cut. Finally, all injured parties will be \nguaranteed a source of funds and all similar claims will be treated \nequally.\n  I would strongly urge my colleagues to carefully consider our \namendment as an alternative to insure that individuals harmed by \ntobacco manufacturers will receive the full compensation they deserve \nin a timely and efficient manner. For our country, we cannot allow a \nrepeat of the asbestos catastrophe, and most especially for the people \nthat were harmed by the tobacco manufacturers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the time remaining until 6 \no'clock.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I will ask unanimous consent a \nmemorandum from the National Governors' Association, which is opposed \nto the Coverdell-Craig-Abraham amendment, be printed in the Record.\n  Let me just say the Governors are deeply concerned about the \nfinancing mechanism which violates the financing that they are \nobviously concerned about with respect to the State expenditures on the \ncessation programs and other efforts with respect to the antismoking \neffort.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that a statement of the national \npresident of the Fraternal Order of Police in opposition to the \nCoverdell amendment be printed in the Record.\n  I would just summarize. While they say it has a laudable goal of \naugmenting the ability of the Customs Service to interdict contraband \ncoming across the border, they are deeply concerned about some \nantilabor schemes that strip Federal agents of their rights as \nemployees. It also has significant language with respect to the \nbargaining process which would be changed without a hearing.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that both of those memoranda be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 1998.\n     To: Washington Directors, Health Reps, and State Contacts w/o \n       DC offices.\n     From: Jennifer Baxendell.\n     Subject: Tobacco Amendment.\n\n       The Coverdell-Craig-Abraham anti-drug proposal will be the \n     first amendment voted on next week after the cloture vote is \n     completed. A summary of the amendment is attached.\n       Without entering into the merit of the amendment itself, \n     its financing mechanism violates our principle of opposing \n     any amendment that reduces the pool of $196.5 billion over 25 \n     years reserved for the states. The Coverdell amendment is \n     estimated to cost between $2 and $3 billion annually, which \n     is to be financed through the trust fund. This earmark would \n     be taken off the top of the trust fund, shrinking the amount \n     of money against which the 40% of the revenue reserved for \n     the states would be applied.\n       Please contact your Senate offices again in opposition to \n     reduction of the state settlement pool. The McCain bill \n     provides the federal government with over $320 billion in new \n     tobacco revenues over 25 years with which to finance \n     Washington's prioritized investments.\n       Call me at 202-624-5336 with questions/feed back. Thanks.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 National Legislative Program,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 1998.\n\n Statement of Gilbert G. Gallegos, National President of the Fraternal \n           Order of Police on Coverdell Amendment to S. 1415\n\n       The more than 272,000 rank-and-file members of the \n     Fraternal Order of Police want to make absolutely clear our \n     vehement opposition to language contained in an amendment \n     offered by Senator Coverdell and others to S. 1415, the \n     ``Universal Tobacco Settlement Act.''\n       This amendment, which has the laudable goal of augmenting \n     the ability of the Customs Service to interdict contraband \n     coming across the border, contains an anti-labor scheme to \n     strip Federal agents of their rights as employees and thwart \n     bargaining partnerships between rank-and-file agents and \n     management by giving the Secretary of the Treasury the carte \n     blanche power to nullify collective bargaining agreements.\n       It also gives the Secretary additional retaliatory powers \n     against officers who do not kow-tow to management's every \n     whim by enabling the unheard of power of transferring--\n     permanently--up to five percent (5%) of Customs officers \n     employed to new duty stations. This not only removes \n     experienced interdiction officers--and does so for \n     potentially political reasons--it also uproots families. This \n     is simply unacceptable.\n       Perhaps the most blatantly offensive language in the \n     amendment is the ``sense of Congress'' that collective \n     bargaining undermines the war on drugs at our border. This \n     patently untrue. Is it the sense of Congress then, that the \n     officers who are charged with keeping narcotics out of \n     country, preventing drugs from reaching our neighborhoods and \n     schools, would somehow be parties to agreements that \n     undermine that responsibility? Many of the bargaining issues \n     discussed at the table are critically important to the \n     success of the law enforcement mission--officer safety, hour \n     and wage issues. If Congress wishes to strengthen the ability \n     of our officers to fight drugs on our border, they would do \n     well to endorse and strengthen the commitment of the Treasury \n     Department to agreements reached between labor and management \n     at the bargaining table. This language in amendment does not \n     make any ``sense'' at all.\n       The amendment also includes language which gives the \n     Treasury Department the ability to nullify any agreement that \n     might have been reached if negotiations continue for more \n     than ninety (90) days and impose their own ``last offer.'' \n     This is absurdly unfair. No matter what happens, the Treasury \n     Department will ``win'' in the collective bargaining process, \n     and this amendment will substantially weaken the ability to \n     Customs officers to negotiate on an equal playing field.\n       This amendment contains a poorly concealed attempt to strip \n     away the rights of law enforcement officers, and the \n     Fraternal Order of Police, cannot support Senator Coverdell's \n     proposal unless he strikes the anti-labor language it \n     contains.\n       Law enforcement officers have, arguably, one of the \n     toughest jobs in the nation. They alone are charged with \n     keeping the streets and neighborhoods of this country safe \n     from crime and drugs. Every day, police officers put their \n     lives on the line--life and death decisions are in the job \n     description. To restrict the ability of these officers to sit \n     down and talk with their employers about workplace issues--\n     when the work they do is to prevent drugs from making it into \n     the United States--is counterproductive to the law \n     enforcement mission and common sense.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me summarize, if I may, what the \nDemocrat alternative, the amendment which Senator Daschle has \nsubmitted, seeks to accomplish here. First of all, the alternative \nantidrug amendment does not jeopardize the funding for public health. I \nthink this is critical to understand. The Coverdell amendment will take \nmore than 50 percent of the public health money and strip that away so \nas to deny the capacity of the tobacco legislation to accomplish the \ncessation programs, the State assistance programs, the \ncounteradvertising and other efforts, in order to reduce the number of \nkids smoking.\n  What we seek to achieve in the Daschle alternative is we remove the \nsection in the Coverdell amendment that would have eliminated the \nfloors for funding of public health programs from the tobacco trust \nfund, which would have also diverted that money for other purposes.\n  Second, we include tough money-laundering provisions that provide \ncritical assistance to State and Federal law enforcement in order to \ncombat drug problems by enhancing the Federal prosecutors' ability to \ncombat international money laundering and to seize the assets of drug \nkingpins and others who have engaged in illegal activities, which, I \nmight add, would significantly augment our ability to fight drugs as \nwell as provide additional economic assistance to some of the \nantitobacco efforts. In addition to that, we provide the States with \nadditional funding to drug test, and we provide drug treatment for \ninmates.\n  None of that is in the Coverdell approach. So it is clear, there are \nsignificant differences in how one can do a better job of fighting \ndrugs. We believe the money-laundering provisions in the Democrat \nalternative are significantly stronger than in their approach.\n  In addition, we have what we believe are significantly improved \nversions of some of the antidrug initiatives set forth in the Coverdell \nlegislation without the liabilities carried in the Coverdell amendment. \nFirst of all, there are additional resources for interdiction. There is \nan increased budget for U.S. Customs, increased budget for the Coast \nGuard, and increased budget for the Department of Defense. But, instead \nof grabbing that, robbing Peter to pay Paul, stealing from the trust \nfund, so to speak, and denying us the\n\n[[Page S5773]]\n\nability to accomplish the fundamental goals of the antitobacco \nlegislation, we seek to authorize that from the general revenues, which \nis really a more fair and more thoughtful way, in our judgment, to be \nable to try to deal with the problem of a drug war.\n  We have significant additional measures with respect to drug-free \nborders. We do so without attacking some of the entities that are a \ncritical component of the drug war: Customs agents, police, and others. \nWe increase the civil and criminal penalties for customs violations, \nand we raise the number of border agents by 2003 to 15,000. In other \nwords, 15,000 additional border agents by the year 2003.\n  We give the Customs Service flexibility to address urgent drug \ninterdiction needs, working with the front-line employees to identify \nthe problems and to collaborate in finding effective solutions to those \nurgent needs. The Coverdell approach basically declares war on our own \nagents and begins to try to accomplish a certain ideological agenda \nwith respect to labor unions that we think is inappropriate and \nunnecessary here.\n  We, furthermore, provide $10 million per year out of the general \nrevenues to States that institute voluntary drug testing for teen \ndrivers' license applicants or crack down on drivers who use drugs. So \nwe have a strong provision in our approach to deal with the problem of \ndrug testing for teen drivers.\n  In addition to that, we have a section on drug-free schools, but we \ndo not add the poison-pill provision of school vouchers by the backdoor \nwhich would literally threaten to scuttle the entire tobacco \nlegislation. All of us here know that no issue has been more \ncontentious for a lot of different reasons. It is part of really what \nhas divided the U.S. Senate so significantly and so unfortunately \nthroughout the debate on education.\n  There are many people on our side of the aisle--I know on both sides \nof the aisle--who desperately want to improve the public school system \nand to recognize that we have some very significant problems in the \npublic schools of this country. But increasingly, all we talk about in \nthe Senate are either vouchers or money. We are sort of polarized. We \nare locked into this gridlock of discussion where one side is fighting \nfor vouchers so 1,000 kids may get saved in the school system and the \nother side winds up saying, ``We have to have more money,'' but in \nbetween all of the issues of curricula, standards, testing, finding \ngood principals, hiring another 2 million teachers and how we are going \nto do that, a host of other things get lost.\n  What the Coverdell amendment fundamentally does is take us right back \nto that very narrow debate where all we are going to do in response to \nthe laudable goal of trying to take the victim of a violent crime or of \na drug-related crime and move them to another school, instead of doing \nthat within the public school structure, all of a sudden here is \nanother voucher plan to provide the opportunity for that person to move \nto a parochial school, religious-based school or to a private school. \nIf that were part of some comprehensive program to deal with all the \nschools of this country and the 90 percent of our children who are in \npublic school, perhaps it might meet with less resistance on the floor \nof the Senate. But under the circumstances, it is a backdoor effort \nwithin the tobacco bill to try to do something that the Senate has \nalready struggled with so significantly.\n  Moreover, we create, as does the Coverdell legislation, the same \nfinancial incentives for States from general revenues. Unlike the \nCoverdell amendment, we take it from the general revenues; they take it \nfrom the tobacco trust fund. And we provide an annual report card to \nparents and teachers listing incidents of school violence, weapon \npossession or drug activity, and we also encourage the implementation \nof certain disciplinary policies.\n  In addition to that, we provide $10 million to States for parental \nconsent drug testing of children, as does the Coverdell amendment, but \nwe do that without coercing parents into allowing that testing by \ndenying access to extracurricular activities, such as athletics, for \nthose who are unwilling to subject their children to such testing. We \nthink both from a fairness and commonsense point of view that is more \nin keeping with the spirit of how the relationship between parent and \nschool ought to work.\n  Like the Coverdell amendment, we provide drug-free student loans. We \nrestrict the loans for students convicted of drug possession. We \nrestrict the loans for students convicted of drug trafficking, and just \nas the Coverdell legislation does, we resume loan eligibility on an \nexpedited basis for those students who satisfactorily complete a \nprogram that includes drug testing.\n\n  Just like the Coverdell amendment, we authorize $10 million per year \nin SBA demonstration grants, but unlike the Coverdell amendment, once \nagain, we do not strip the capacity of the tobacco legislation to work. \nWe do not take away the cessation programs or other youth activities \nand youth-access efforts that are contained within the tobacco \nlegislation in an effort to restrict the access of our young people to \ncigarettes.\n  I might add this is, I think, one of the most important things to \nremember when we reflect on what we are trying to achieve here. I used \nto be a prosecutor. I was the chief prosecutor and administrative \nofficer for one of the 10 largest district attorney's offices in the \nNation. I was part of the effort in the years when we created the first \ndrug task forces and we created the first priority prosecution efforts \nand major violator efforts. I have tried cases that have sent people to \njail for the rest of their life. I am proud of that record.\n  I have fought hard in the Senate to continue that kind of, I hope, \nconscientious antidrug effort. So I don't want to be somehow viewed as \nless concerned than my friend here with whom I work on the Foreign \nRelations Committee, on our subcommittee, on the issue of drugs.\n  I don't think we have a legitimate drug war in the United States. I \nhave said that for a number of years. If you don't have adequate \ntreatment, if you don't have adequate education, if you don't have \nadequate enforcement, if you don't have the capacity for swift and \ncertain punishment, if you don't have the ability to put the people in \njail who ought to be or sufficient capacity to keep the ones off the \nstreets who ought to be kept off the streets, you are not serious. But \nyou certainly are not serious if you don't have drug treatment on \ndemand. Only about 26 or 30 percent of all drug addicts in the United \nStates of America get treatment after 20 years of talking about this \nissue. That is not contained sufficiently in this legislation, and it \nought to be.\n  What we have to stop doing is these scatter-shock, helter-skelter \nefforts that do little Band-Aids here and little Band-Aids there and \nsomehow pretend, ``Boy, have we done something to fix the drug war.'' \nWe haven't. Nor is this going to do it. But, most importantly, what it \nis going to do is strip away the ability of the tobacco bill to do what \nit is intended to do, which is to get kids to stop smoking. That is the \ngateway drug to marijuana and ultimately to harder drugs.\n  If we are serious about a drug plan for America, we shouldn't be \ntrying to augment the Coast Guard or augment the Department of Defense \nat the expense of the kids who are at the earliest stage of their life, \nwho we are trying to teach and give the value system and the self-\nesteem and the structure with which to be able to make a decision, not \nto pick up a cigarette. The values that allow a kid and the strength of \ncharacter that comes to a kid, that brings that child to the point of \nnot picking up a cigarette are the same values and the same foundations \nthat help that child decide not to do the other things that peer \npressure forces them toward or that modernity in American life thrusts \non them. So it doesn't make sense to strip away that capacity in this \nbill.\n  The Senator from Georgia will say, ``Well, it doesn't automatically \ndo that; all it does is authorize these numbers.''\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. And that is true. I want to finish the thought and then I \nwill be happy to yield to my friend. It is true all it does is \nauthorize it. We all know what happens when the appropriators \nultimately get those pressures put in front of them, and you have \nDepartment of Defense, Coast Guard or other kinds of antidrug efforts \ncompeting against something that we have never\n\n[[Page S5774]]\n\ndone before in America, which is sufficiently empower our antismoking \nefforts, sufficiently try at that early entry level to keep kids from \nbeing hooked.\n  I respectfully suggest to my colleague, this is well intentioned, and \nI know he is sincere in his passion about wanting to stop drugs and is \ncaring about this, and I agree with him completely that the efforts to \ndate are insufficient. No question about it. But I also believe very \nstrongly that we ought to approach this in a commonsense way.\n  I yield to my friend for a question without losing my right to finish \nmy time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I advise the Senator, of course I have not seen his \namendment and the vote is scheduled at 6. I would like to make a \ncomment, and I ask unanimous consent that I be given up to 10 minutes \nto respond to the remarks the Senator has just characterized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend from Georgia, if I can, I don't \nwant to be the bogeyman with respect to his request, but the leadership \nhas carefully scheduled this because of the expectation of Senators to \nbe in certain places. I know the time was equally divided----\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will happily yield to my friend in a \nmoment. And I would agree to the unanimous consent request for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. But will that be equally divided?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am trying to catch up with you.\n  Mr. KERRY. I might add, we are just trying to catch up with their \nside. The time was equally divided up until now. And the Senator from \nNorth Carolina and the Senator from Vermont both spoke using all of the \ntime of that side. So we are just trying to catch up on our side.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. All right. I ask unanimous consent that we have 15 \nminutes equally divided.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, 15 minutes equally divided. I have no \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. So, Mr. President, the bottom line is, as I said, really \nwhether or not we are going to try to approach this--maybe the Senator \nand I could agree that the goals of our amendment are indeed worthy, \nand he would like to wrap them into one, and we could have one vote \naccepting our amendment. I would like to do that. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. First, let me say that I appreciate that so much of \nthe Coverdell-Craig-Abraham amendment has been wrapped into this \namendment we have just heard described. I have not had a chance to see \nthe amendment. There are some nuances.\n  What the Senator from Massachusetts characterizes as vouchers and \nchoice, I characterize as common sense to handle a child that has been \nthe victim of a crime. And I do not agree that that should be \ncharacterized as a voucher. It does not deal with the needle exchange \npermanently. It only deals with a couple years. But much of the \namendment is the same.\n  So then the core question--they both authorize funding, and, as I \nunderstand it, it is at similar levels. So the question is, what does \nthe authorization fall against? And where are the pressures?\n  The Coverdell-Craig amendment authorizes against a new revenue stream \nwhich comes from an increase in the price of tobacco. The Daschle \namendment--I believe it is the Daschle amendment--from the other side \nauthorizes against the current budget or the caps, so the pressure will \nfall against current programming: education, VA, veterans, all of that. \nThat is where you put the pressure. I put the pressure against the new \nrevenue stream. And I think that is more appropriate and much more \nlikely to happen. I do not think it is near as likely to happen under \nthe Senator's amendment from Massachusetts as it is to happen if this \ntobacco settlement weaves its way through the Congress and there is a \ndrug section in it. It is far more likely to occur than under the \nSenator's amendment.\n  I appreciate the fact that we agree on its importance, that much of \nwhat we have drafted has been embraced. But I think it is far more \nlikely to occur in the manner in which I suggested. And I do not accept \nthe argument that it is misplaced. Most of teenage drug abuse occurs in \nsmoking, smoking marijuana, which is five times more dangerous than \ntobacco.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Would my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Sure.\n  Mr. KERRY. It is an important part of the discussion. I would ask my \ncolleague--they are both smoking. They are both smoking a grown \nsubstance, wrapped in paper, and it requires the same process. But the \nsame ingredients of smoking are the same impact fundamentally that \nrequire counseling, education, and knowledge to build up the sort of \nresistance to peer pressure.\n  I ask my colleague, if that is the purpose of it, why would he not \nwant an increased level of funding to guarantee that they are sort of \nwrapped together? Smoking marijuana and smoking cigarettes are almost \none in the same. They are both a narcotic substance. They both can \nultimately result in great harm to health. Therefore, you want the \ncessation programs, the counteradvertising, et cetera. Why would the \nSenator then strip that capacity away for these other objectives rather \nthan augment those?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. One, as I said a moment ago, I am not very encouraged \nwhere we are because this initiative has fallen poorly against the \ngoals of the Congress and the administration over the last 6 years.\n  The interdiction budget has dropped from over $1 billion in 1991 and \n1992, to under $700 million. It got down to $500 million in 1995. \nFlight hours that are protecting our citizens have dropped from 36,000 \nto 11,000. Ship days have dropped from 4,000 to 1,700 days.\n  We had one experiment recently in the Coast Guard in Puerto Rico that \nkept 350-plus million doses of cocaine off American streets. These are \nall interconnected.\n  The best thing we can have happen is for the child not to get \nensnared into the drug war in the first place. I believe that you \ncannot deal with teenage addiction and separate it from the tobacco \nbill. I just do not think that is the right thing to do.\n  I think they should be embraced together. I think, given the scope, \nthat this is the No. 1 problem. Given the scope of it, the fact that it \nwould be authorized to consume 20 percent of these revenues, it is \nperfectly logical and sound. And there would be a revenue base \ngenerated to do it. I do not see the revenue base standing behind the \ngood Senator. And I equally am admiring of the work that you have done \non this issue. I have respect for it. I just do not think that \namendment which has come late--very late--in response to what we have \nendeavored to do will achieve a new, bold initiative on antinarcotics \nin the United States.\n  I yield back whatever--I do not yield back the time; but I save it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 1 minute 40 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me respond to my friend again. I do not \nthink he absolutely answered my question. What he says is we have to \nhave the interdiction efforts, we have to have an addition for the \nCoast Guard, the military because of the number of hours they are \nflying. I agree with that.\n  I think we have a very serious problem growing in this country with \nrespect to our military because of the increased OPTOUT and OPTEMPO \nversus the pay we are giving them, and the opportunities for time off, \nand so forth. That is a huge issue, and it is growing in the country.\n  But the point is--and I make it again to my friend from Georgia--as a \nformer prosecutor I can remember that there is a threshold level that \nyou can stop drugs coming in, this sort of nuisance level. You can \nraise the price. You can always raise the cost of doing business.\n  But no one I know in the business of law enforcement, no one I know \nwho is serious about the drug effort believes that augmenting \ninterdiction at the expense of the demand side is going to cure the \nproblem.\n  For every 300 tons of whatever that you stop, I promise you, there is \nan airplane that has been constructed with\n\n[[Page S5775]]\n\nphony sides to it or any number of containers on ships, or any means, \nthat the demand will bring those products. They will even manufacture \nthem in this country. They will find a way to get them to people.\n  The key issue is reducing the level of demand. And the demand for a \ncigarette that has tobacco in it is the same demand for the white \nrolled piece of paper that has marijuana in it-- same act, same \ndiscipline, same entryway, entry gate to drugs. Most experts in the \nfield of treatment and demand will tell you that that is the gateway \ndrug.\n  So it seems to me illogical on its face to say we are going to strip \ndown the efforts to get the demand side reduced so we can augment what \nwas going to automatically be increased anyway, which will be increased \ndemand, increased interdiction. And you get caught in this vicious \ncycle where all of our resources keep being allocated to an area that \ndoes not give you as much return as education and treatment. Again, the \nperks are pretty clear on that issue, that if fewer and fewer kids \nstarted in the first place with cigarettes, you would have less and \nless demand, and no pusher can increase the number of people to demand \nthe drugs fast enough to make up for kids who say no. If those kids are \nstrong enough and educated enough and well prepared enough to say no, \nthat is the way we will solve the problem in this country, more than \nany other.\n\n  Again, the Senator from Georgia strips away a significant portion of \nthat. He makes them competitive. It is the wrong way to come at this.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 1 minute 40 \nseconds, and the Senator from Massachusetts controls 4 minutes 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, from 1980 to 1992 drug use among \nteenagers was reduced by two-thirds. It was reduced in great part by \nthe massive interdiction program and much of an education program that \nwas voluntary.\n  My point here is that the amendment we have offered to the tobacco \nbill, which shares an addiction problem with these new revenues, is a \nbold component for drug interdiction and drug education, the very \npoints that the Senator from Massachusetts is making.\n  The proposal he puts to the table is designed very much the same way. \nAs I said, there are nuances that are somewhat different. I think the \nlikelihood of funding for this bold program under the Senator's \namendment is far less--far less. Yes, if it all came about, it would be \naugmented, but there are more than sufficient revenues in the proposal \nwe have on the floor, which is a tax bill, to fund a strong drug \ninterdiction proposal and a strong antismoking proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say to my friend, if the funding is \nso jeopardized, as he suggested it is, then shame on us. Then we are \nnot serious about the drug war. Shame on us.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. We aren't.\n  Mr. KERRY. Then shame on us. We ought to be prepared to do it. But \ndon't do it at the expense of stopping kids from smoking.\n  The Senator just made my argument. The Senator from Georgia said \nbetween 1980 and 1992 we reduced drug use in America by 30 percent. Am \nI correct, the Senator said that?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Sixty-six percent. From 1979 to 1992, it was reduced \nby two-thirds.\n  Mr. KERRY. We reduced drug use in America by two-thirds, according to \nthe Senator from Georgia, between 1979 and 1992.\n  He has just made the argument for not doing what his own amendment \nseeks to do, because if you look at how we reduced that drug use by \ntwo-thirds between 1979 and 1992, it was because Nancy Reagan and the \nReagan administration, to their credit, augmented our outreach efforts, \nour advertising efforts, the counteradvertising. We brought role \nmodels--sports figures and others--into the communities. We had an \naggressive effort in the United States to reach into our communities \nand teach kids not to.\n  That is precisely what this tobacco legislation is seeking to do with \nrespect to cigarettes, and there is no reason in the world that you \ncan't dovetail all of the drug efforts into that so that smoking, \ndrugs, all of it, are dependent on the same disciplines. They are \ndependent on kids being raised with enough awareness of the downside \nand with enough self-esteem and enough structure around them to be able \nto make good decisions.\n  What the Coverdell amendment does is reduce the capacity of kids to \nmake those decisions. If we want to reduce drugs in America by two-\nthirds, we need to do what this tobacco legislation set out to do, and \nI believe we can do that by melding some of what the Senator from \nGeorgia seeks to do. That is what the Democratic alternative seeks to \ndo.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2451\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will vote for the Craig-Coverdell \namendment because I believe that we should move forward with this bill. \nWhile I agree with the thrust of the amendment, I am seriously \nconcerned that all of the revenue to fund this effort will come from \nthe tobacco trust fund.\n  If we are to have legislation that provides for settlement of State \ncases, funding for smoking prevention and cessation, funding for \nresearch, farmer assistance and a tax cut, we must allow for funding \nfor the drug amendment under additional accounts including the violent \ncrime trust fund.\n  Clearly, the President will not sign legislation that does not \nprovide the funding necessary for the basic purposes of this act. So, \nwhile I will support the drug amendment, my vote is to keep the process \nmoving.\n  This is but one wicket in the legislative process and at the end of \nthe day, if we are to have a meaningful bill, we must reconcile the \nvarious demands for trust fund revenues in a manner that will achieve \nthe essential purposes of this bill, and which will best serve the \npublic health and the public interest.\n  Mr. KERRY. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we have now dispensed with the issue of \naddressing the problem of drugs in America. Tomorrow, we will take up \nthe tax cut issue. There will be an amendment on this side of the aisle \nand an amendment on the other side of the aisle.\n  It is our hope that, following that, we will be able to take up the \nsubstitute. There are, I understand, two important substitutes, one by \nthe Senator from Utah, which he has talked about at some length, and \nalso one by perhaps Senator Gramm and Senator Domenici. There is still \nconcern about the issue of attorneys' fees. I would not be surprised if \nthere was another amendment on that issue, and, of course, there is the \nremaining issue of the agriculture section of the bill, which could be \naddressed after cloture, if necessary.\n  Frankly, Mr. President, I don't know of any other major issues that \nare affecting this legislation. I hope that we can not only move \nforward but, at the appropriate time this week, hopefully the majority \nleader can propose a cloture vote so we can bring this issue to a \nclose.\n  All of us are aware that we are in our third week on this \nlegislation. All of us are aware that we have other legislation that we \nneed to address, including very important appropriations bills.\n  I must say that on this day I am pleased with the progress that we \nhave made, and I am pleased that we are going to address the issue of \ntaxes, which is important to Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  So, Mr. President, I say, in the words of the late Mark Twain, the \nreports of the death of this legislation are premature. However, we \ncertainly, by no means, have total confidence that we will reach a \nsuccessful conclusion. But I think those of us who are supporting this \nlegislation can be pleased at the progress we are making at this time. \nAnd it does not in any way mean that we do not have a lot of difficult \nhurdles to get over before we have a final vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me join the Senator from Arizona in simply saying that \nI think this was an important step forward today in a lot of respects. \nNeither the Senator from Arizona nor I want to sort of overly \ncharacterize what it may mean in the total yet, but it does open up the \nopportunity for the Senate to now move to the two remaining, most \nsignificant issues and then lay the groundwork to have, hopefully, an \norder of amendments for the following ones. I think it is not \ninsignificant, therefore.\n  The last week permitted us, frankly, to be able to work quietly \nbehind the scenes to be able to arrive at some understandings about the \nstructure of the tax component of the bill. And while there are two \nalternatives being offered, the fact is that for a week we have \nunderstood that embracing a component of the tax cut in this \nlegislation was not inappropriate--in fact, might not only be a \nnecessary ingredient of passing it but also an important reality for \nthe amounts of money that are being raised in the revenues.\n  So I think we are on a track where we have the ability tomorrow to \nmake again some significant progress. And hopefully, with the \nsubstitutes, then we will have few remaining contentious issues and, \nobviously, some others that we ought to be able to arrive at a \nreasonable understanding about.\n  So my hope is that those Senators who have must-do amendments will \ncertainly inform us of those in the course of the next day or so.\n  I thank my colleague for his cooperation. And I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5768-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President, I would like to just share with those of our \ncolleagues who are watching the floor at this moment a ceremony that I \njust attended, that a number of our colleagues just attended, for the \npromotion of then Colonel Terry Paul to Brigadier General Terry Paul, \nthe U.S. Marine Corps.\n  This is somewhat unusual, because General Paul has been serving as \nthe Marine Corps liaison in the U.S. Senate for almost a decade. He \ncame as a lieutenant colonel, he was promoted to the rank of full \ncolonel, and this afternoon was promoted to the rank of brigadier \ngeneral, where he will move across the Potomac to serve as the \nLegislative Assistant to the Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n  Many generals, officers of the Marine Corps, admirals of the Navy, \nrepresentatives of the Department of Defense, and some of our \ncolleagues in the House and Senate were there, to recognize an \nextraordinary Marine and an extraordinary patriot, someone who has \nworked very, very hard and very, very professionally in a job that many \nof us appreciate.\n  Mr. President, during his nearly 10-year assignment with the Marine \nCorps Liaison Office here in the Senate, General Terry Paul has \nchampioned a number of programs--like the M1A1 tank, the Maritime Pre-\npositioned Forces (MPF), the V-2 Osprey, and the Advanced Amphibious \nAssault Vehicle (AAAV)--that have helped sustain the Corps as the \npremiere expeditionary force in readiness and have helped mold the \nCorps for the twenty-first century.\n\n  To those of us who worked with him, General Paul has been a strong \nadvocate for his beloved Corps.\n  He has poured his heart and soul into every facet of an issue, \nchampioning the best interest of the Corps and the nation, regardless \nof scope or monetary value.\n  He has also never lost sight of the individual Marine--working just \nas hard to secure a piece of gear that would keep a Marine dry during \ninclement\n\n[[Page S5777]]\n\nweather as he would for a multi-million dollar modernization program \nthat enhances the overall capability of the Corps.\n  As the Marine Corps' representative to the United States Senate, \nGeneral Paul has also been instrumental in planning and assisting with \ncountless congressional oversight missions here and abroad.\n  And as the only Senator serving on all three national security \ncommittees, I have personally embarked upon many a mission with General \nPaul.\n  On numerous occasions, I have been grateful for his invaluable \nassistance to me and to other Members of this body on what are \ninevitably grueling visits overseas.\n  General Paul unfailingly represents the Corps and country with great \ncommitment and dedication.\n  Not only does General Paul do his job with extraordinary efficiency, \nwith immense dedication, and with enormous pride, but he also does his \njob with great humor.\n  Whether it's Marine Corps ear-marks in the DOD bill, or racing to an \nairport in Ashgabat at 0-dark-30, or showing us the mettle of the \nMarines at Paris Island, Terry Paul is a consumate professional.\n  In my judgment, no one has better represented the Marine Corps on \nCapitol Hill.\n  And so, Mr. President, it is with high hopes and great appreciation \nthat I wish General Paul godspeed as he embarks upon this new mission.\n  He moves to the Pentagon having contributed greatly to our work \nhere--and having represented the Corps here in the Senate with enormous \nconviction.\n  We will miss him as a regular colleague--or at least an honorary \ncolleague--in the Russell Senate Office Building--but he will be with \nus in spirit as he moves across the river. I look forward to continuing \nto work with him.\n  I will end by saying: to a Marine's Marine, to a man who epitomizes \nthe motto of the Corps--Semper Fidelis, General Terry Paul.\n  And with that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the opportunity \nto recognize the extraordinary service of a very fine Marine and a very \nfine and patriotic American, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join in the very kind remarks of the \nSenator from Virginia concerning Colonel Paul. He has done an \noutstanding job for many, many years and is a man all of us are proud \nof in his service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5776-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5777-S5779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRANSPORTATION EQUITY ACT FOR THE 21ST CENTURY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is a great day for America's drivers, \nrail passengers, and freight haulers. Today, the Transportation Equity \nAct for the 21st Century (TEA21) has been signed into law. TEA21 will \nlead to better, safer, and less congested roads and bridges throughout \nthe country. This extremely important transportation legislation is a \ngreat investment in our nation's future.\n  I applaud my colleagues, in both chambers of Congress, and on both \nsides of the aisle, for passing the Transportation Equity Act by \noverwhelming majorities.\n  Transportation is one of the few issues that Congress deals with that \nclearly and directly impacts every American, every day. That is why it \nwas so imperative that both chambers take swift action on this \nimportant infrastructure bill. Whether driving to work, participating \nin a car pool, taking a commuter train, riding a school bus, hauling \ngoods from one city to the next, or transporting an accident victim to \nthe nearest hospital, Americans depend on safe roads, highways, and \nbridges to get them to their ultimate destination.\n  When the extended Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \n(ISTEA) ran out on May 1, Congress recognized the importance of getting \nthis new reauthorization legislation passed. A number of states could \nhave been in serious jeopardy had Congress waited beyond the Memorial \nDay recess to enact the Transportation Equity Act. Now that the \nPresident has acted on this landmark transportation bill, I am proud \nthat Congress has fulfilled one of our most important responsibilities \nto the American people. Authorizing road and bridge improvements into \nthe next century is a significant accomplishment. This act alone should \ndispel the notion that this Congress has done nothing.\n  The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA21) deals with \na wide range of highway, transit, research, recreational, safety and \nenvironmental policy initiatives. TEA21 is a balanced and effective \ninfrastructure bill that will enhance our nation's roads and highways. \nTEA21 extends and improves upon many of the provisions contained in \nISTEA, helping move America forward into the next century. It furthers \nthe notion of an efficient and integrated national intermodal \ntransportation system. This unified system links America's 161,000 mile \nNational Highway System with state and local roads, ports, trade \ncorridors, and airports. TEA21 is necessary for our nation's \nprosperity.\n  The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century provides a total \nof $216 billion for infrastructure development and improvements. That \nrepresents a 40% boost in transportation spending over current levels. \nThis bill affects every state, every county and every city, providing \nsignificantly more money for the projects around the country that need \nand deserve federal assistance. TEA21 provides $173 billion for \nhighways, $41.3 billion for mass transit, and $1.7 billion for highway \nsafety programs. That translates into an annual highway spending \nincrease of $8 billion and about $2 billion more annually for mass \ntransit. Every year, $10 billion more will be spent on needed \ninfrastructure.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly pleased that the Transportation \nEquity Act, as its title implies, provides more equity than the formula \nallocations provided by ISTEA. Under TEA21, each state is guaranteed to \nreceive at least 90.5 cents for every dollar that its drivers send to \nWashington through the gas pump. As a result, forty-nine states will \nreceive more money, with an average increase of about 44% over their \ncurrent allocation levels. Even Massachusetts, the one state that did \nnot receive a funding increase, will still get back more than it \ncontributes annually to the Highway Trust Fund.\n  Many of the beneficiaries of the Act's minimum guarantee are the \nsouthern, midwestern, and western states commonly referred to as donor \nstates. For years, these states have received far less in highway \nfunding than they contributed in gas tax revenues. While TEA21 doesn't \ncompletely eliminate their donor status, North Carolina, Tennessee, \nGeorgia, Indiana, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arizona, Montana, among other \ndonor states, will for the first time see an overall increase of more \nthan 50% and a return of more than 90 cents on the dollar.\n  My home state of Mississippi, for example, will receive 92 cents. \nThat's a 58% increase over the state's current gas tax return. While \nthis is not a perfect dollar for dollar exchange, it represents \nsignificant progress that will help pave a great number of dirt and \nother substandard roads in Mississippi. In the years to come, I will \ncontinue my efforts to improve the formula allocation for all donor \nstates.\n  Mr. President, TEA21 also re-establishes the covenant with our \nnation's drivers. It insures that each dollar of revenue contributed to \nthe Highway Trust Fund is spent on transportation priorities and not on \nother initiatives. While this bill does not take the Highway Trust Fund \noff-budget, it does guarantee a minimum of $200.5 billion will be spent \nover the next six years on highways, safety, and mass transit programs. \nTEA21 also ensures that Congress fulfills its obligation to live within \nthe Balanced Budget Agreement.\n  TEA21 authorizes bridge repair and improvement projects around the \ncountry. It supports the preservation of national historic covered \nbridges and includes funding that will allow states to retrofit bridges \nso they will be less prone to earthquake damage. Additionally, the bill \nprovides $900 million to replace the decaying Woodrow Wilson Memorial \nBridge, a 35 year old structure that now carries more than twice the \n72,000 vehicles it was built to withstand. At the current rate of \ndeterioration, passenger and freight traffic will be forced to stop in \nseven years. This is\n\n[[Page S5778]]\n\na major crossing on America's East-Coast highway that carries over \n190,000 cars and trucks daily. That is why TEA21 was correct to step \nin.\n  I believe Congress has passed a bill that not only improves and \nenhances America's transportation system, but one that enriches our \nnation's economy and our quality of life. New roads and bridges spur \neconomic development, increase mobility, and foster connectivity. For \neach dollar spent on our nation's infrastructure, society receives an \nexponential financial and social return on this public investment. In \nfact, economist Thomas Hogarty recently concluded that motor vehicle \ntransport yields $6 trillion to $10 trillion in tangible benefits \nannually. That's trillion with a ``t.'' Good roads, good bridges, and \ngood transit systems facilitate the movement of people and supplies \nfrom the suburbs to major metropolitan areas and back, from one region \nof the country to another and from America to across the globe. Aside \nfrom heightening intrastate and interstate travel and trade, \ntransportation improvements also support the creation of better and \nhigher paying jobs. In Mississippi, for example, road work over the \nlast ten years has helped prompt a 34% increase in the state's growth \nrate. I am very excited about the economic prospects for Mississippi \nunder TEA21.\n  Mr. President, passage of the Transportation Equity Act will help \nrepeat Mississippi's success story in each and every state. \nInfrastructure expenditures directly and indirectly support the 10 \nmillion people employed by our nation's transportation and related \nindustries. In fact, Congressional Quarterly recently reported that \nTEA21 will lead to the creation of 400,000 new jobs throughout the \nUnited States.\n  TEA21 will strengthen our trade relationships with neighbors to the \nnorth and south of our nation's borders. TEA21 provides $700 million \nfor trade and border crossings, and supports the continued development \nI-69, an 1,800 mile interstate that will stretch between nine states, \nfrom the Texas border with Mexico to Michigan's border with Canada. \nThis Pan-American roadway, with vital regional connectors, will promote \neconomic development all along its path. Additionally, I-69 will help \nvirtually every state by fostering interstate and international \ncommerce, helping our nation realize the benefits of the North American \nFree Trade Agreement.\n  The Transportation Equity Act is also a bill about safety. It \nprovides over $2 billion for highway safety programs and authorizes \n$650 million in motor carrier safety grants. One of the many important \nreforms in TEA21 is the $500 million seat belt program which provides \nincentive grants to states that increase their seat belt usage or that \nexceed the national average. The Act also takes aim at drunk driving. \nIt provides grants to states that have or adopt the more strict 0.08 \npercent blood-alcohol standard. TEA21 also promotes the development of \nairbags that do a better job of protecting children and smaller adults.\n  One of the issues that I felt very strongly about was the creation of \na program to encourage states to improve their one-call system. As this \nCongress focused on our surface infrastructure, I felt it was important \nto include protections for our underground infrastructure. This took \nthe form of a national call-before-you-dig system used to prevent \naccidents at underground facilities such as telephone, cable and power \nlines, water-maines and pipelines. A number of serious accidents have \nbeen caused by excavation without notice or by inaccurate markings of \nunderground lines. While 49 states have one-call programs, it is widely \nrecognized that many states' systems need to be strengthened.\n  Under TEA21, states that significantly improve their current one-call \nsystems will qualify to receive federal grants. TEA21's one-call \nprovision does not impose a federal mandate or establish a one-size-\nfits-all approach. It merely establishes national goals and offers \nstates that want to participate the opportunity to apply for \nassistance. Decisions on a state's one-call system will still be left \nup to each state. The identification of minimum standards, however, \nwill offer states a guide-post to help them improve their systems \nshould they choose to do so. I believe that this non-prescriptive \napproach to state one-call systems will significantly enhance public \nsafety, minimize disruptions, and improve environmental protection.\n  The Transportation Equity Act is also an environmental bill. It \nestablishes private sector mitigation banks in support of wetlands, and \nstreamlines the environmental review process for transportation \nprojects. Senator Bond and Senator Breaux championed these much needed \nfixes. TEA21 also increases annual funding for the Congestion \nMitigation and Air Quality Program and for Transportation Enhancements \nto $1.5 billion and $630 million respectively. Additionally, the bill \nextends the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, which supports sportfish \nrestoration and boat safety programs, and provides to the fund an \nadditional 1.5 cents per gallon of fuel tax revenues in fiscal year \n2002, and another 2 cents after 2003. Another one of the important \ncompromises achieved in this bill involves the harmonization of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's schedule for regulating regional haze \nand the 2.5 particulate matter standard.\n  This bill also authorizes several transportation research programs \nwhich will help our nation adapt to and utilize constantly changing \ntechnologies that will improve safety, ease congestion, and protect the \nenvironment.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude by thanking our colleagues \nwho were instrumental in crafting and passing this landmark bill. \nFirst, my heartfelt appreciation goes out to Senator John Chafee for \nhis stewardship of this important, responsible, and historic \ntransportation package. I also want to pay special tribute to Senator \nWarner, Senator Baucus, Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, Senator \nD'Amato, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Roth, Senator Moynihan, Senator \nBond, and Senator Nickles because their guidance and leadership proved \nvital to this effort. I also want to recognize Senator Domenici for his \nefforts to ensure that the desired funding levels fell within the \nbudget caps. Without his help, we may well have ended up with a much \nsmaller bill.\n  All of the Senate conferees deserve a great deal of credit for \nbringing this much-needed transportation bill to fruition. Each and \nevery one of them rolled up their sleeves and worked with Congressman \nBud Shuster, Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee, and the House conferees to produce the largest \ninfrastructure bill in U.S. history.\n  Lastly, a number of Senate staff worked long and hard on this bill. \nThey worked many weekends and frequently late into the night. Mr. \nPresident, our colleagues know that staff provide invaluable assistance \nas public policy is formulated. Here they were essential. On behalf of \nour nation's highway users, I would like to thank each of them. I \nbelieve it is important to identify the staff directly involved in \nTEA21.\n  From the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works: Daniel \nCorbett; Albert Dahlberg; Stephanie Daigle; Chris Hessler; Abigail \nKinnison; Ann Loomis; Jason Patlis; Jimmie Powell; Kathy Ruffalo; Tom \nSliter; Ellen Stein; Sharon Tucker; and Linda Willard.\n  From the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation: \nAnn Begeman; Carl Bentzel; Moses Boyd; Lance Bultena; Charlotte Casey; \nTimothy Cook; Penny Dalton; James Drewry; Clyde Hart; Clark LeBlanc; \nJohn Raidt; and Sloan Rappoport.\n  From the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs: \nRobert Drozdowski; Rachel Forward; Loretta Garrison; Steven Harris; \nPeggy Kuhn; Howard Menell; and Joseph Mondello.\n  From the Senate Committee on the Budget: William Hoagland; Brian \nRiley; and Austin Smythe.\n  From the Senate Legislative Counsel: Janine Johnson.\n  The following staff also participated on behalf of their Senator: Rob \nAlexander; Steven Apicella; Mark Ashby; Doug Benevento; Renee Bennett; \nKirsten Beronia; Chad Bradley; Rick Dearborn; Steve Dye; Mike Egan; \nJames English; Tracy Henke; Keith Hennessey; Timothy Hess; Gerry \nGilligan; Chris Jahn; Arnie Kupferman; Adam Lawrence; Stephanie Leger; \nRyan Leonard; Lisa Linnell; James\n\n[[Page S5779]]\n\nMcCarthy; Stephen McMillin; Ashley Miller; Beth Miller; Liz O'Donoghue; \nJustin Oliver; Brigitta Pari; Peter Phipps; Mark Prater; Chris Prins; \nDarla Romfo; Joyce Rechtscheffen; Brad Robinson; Peter Rogoff; Jason \nRupp; Christine Russell; David Russell; Pamela Sellers; Joshua \nSheinkmen; Becky Shipp; Gary Smith; Dave Thompson; Polly Trottenberg; \nJoseph Trujillo; Mitch Warren; Andrew Wheeler; Melissa White; Clay \nWilliams; and Drew Willision.\n  Again, these individuals worked very hard on the Transportation \nEquity Act for the 21st Century and the Senate owes them a debt of \ngratitude for their dedicated service to this legislation.\n  Mr. President, now that President Clinton has signed The \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, our nation has enacted \nthe foundation of our infrastructure for the next millennium. TEA21 \nwill improve interstate and international commerce, stimulate our \neconomy, protect our environment, and foster the use of modern \ntransportation technologies.\n  With TEA21, American's can now look forward to better, safer and less \ncongested roads and bridges throughout the nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5777-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF SENATOR GORDON SMITH'S 100TH PRESIDING HOUR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Owen of Falmouth, Kentucky, who have both been selected as \nPhoenix Award recipients for Small Business Disaster Recovery by the \nU.S. Small Business Administration. The Phoenix Award seeks to \nrecognize outstanding individuals who overcome the odds in the face of \ndisaster.\n  Ruby is the President of Wyatt's Supermarket, Inc., and her daughter \nDixie is the Secretary of this business which has been owned by their \nfamily for over 50 years. Ruby and her late husband Abe started in the \ngrocery business in 1945 by selling food and supplies from the back of \ntheir Studebaker truck throughout the rolling hills of northern \nKentucky. The Wyatt family soon expanded their operation and opened a \nfull service supermarket.\n  The business continued to flourish until a major flood hit Falmouth \nin March 1997. The supermarket Ruby and Dixie had just built only seven \nyears earlier, was devastated by the flood. Ruby, at age 75, and Dixie \ndecided to rebuild the store. In just 66 days, Wyatt's SuperValu \nreopened for business and all 52 employees were rehired. Today, Wyatt's \nSuperValu is the only grocery store serving Pendleton County.\n  Ruby and Dixie's dedication did not end with rebuilding their own \nbusiness. They worked to help secure federal funds to help rebuild the \nsurrounding community in the aftermath of the flood. In addition, Ruby \nand Dixie participated in a fund-raiser with the Coca-Cola Company that \nraised money for the local public library damaged by the flood.\n  There can be no doubt that Ruby and Dixie's drive and determination \nduring the aftermath of the flood is worthy of the Phoenix Award. The \ncommunity of Falmouth is lucky to have two business leaders who are \ndedicated to the well-being of their community. The actions of the \nWyatt family serve as a role model for other business leaders who are \naffected by natural disasters. I congratulate them on their success and \nwish them many future years of success serving the people of northern \nKentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5779-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO THE KENTUCKY SMALL BUSINESS PERSON OF THE YEAR\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Lior S. \nYaron of Louisville, Kentucky, who has been selected as the Kentucky \nSmall Business Person of the Year by the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration.\n  Mr. Yaron is the President and CEO of LSY International, a \ndistribution company in Louisville. He started the company in 1985 in \nNew York and then moved the headquarters to Kentucky. Lior began LSY \nwith a unique idea of marketing General Electric appliances with \nEuropean voltage standards to domestic customers who would be moving \nback to their native country.\n  Mr. Yaron recognized that he was in a position to fill a niche \nmarket. As a result, his customers were able to buy an appliance in the \nU.S. that was designed to work on foreign voltage standards. This \nallowed customers to bring these appliances back to their home country \nwithout having to pay duties, thus providing them with significant \nsavings while also giving them quality home appliances.\n  The success of LSY is also attributed to heavy advertising in \npublications frequently read by foreign nationals. Mr. Yaron relied on \nhis unique advertising to minimize risks associated with selling goods \nthat are only marketable overseas. LSY's innovative way of doing \nbusiness has enabled it to grow and prosper. Sales have increased from \n$600,000 in 1985 to $11,520,460 in 1997. Employees have increased from \nonly two in 1985 to 40 in 1997.\n  And finally, I would like to say that Mr. Yaron's vision and \ninnovation set an example for all small business entrepreneurs. I am \nvery happy that Mr. Yaron is being recognized for all of the hard work \nthat has gone into this successful business. I congratulate him on this \nsignificant accomplishment and am proud that this innovative business \nis based in Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5779-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, on April 18, 1998, this body mourned the \npassing of a distinguished and beloved former colleague, Terry Sanford \nof North Carolina. In the days following Terry's death, I heard many \nmoving tributes to him on this floor. And at his funeral in North \nCarolina, I heard eloquent eulogies and heartfelt testimonials to his \ngreatness. But I have heard no tribute to Terry Sanford more sincere or \nbeautiful than that of Joel Fleishman, who was a good friend to Terry \nSanford and whom I, too, am proud to claim as a friend. Mr. Fleishman's \ntribute evokes the qualities that made Terry Sanford a great\n\n[[Page S5780]]\n\nstatesman and educator, and it reminds us all of the importance of \nprincipled public servants to a republic such as ours.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. \nFleishman's tribute to Terry Sanford be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the tribute was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Terry Sanford\n\n       Dear Margaret Rose, Terry, Betsee, and all members of Terry \n     Sanford's family. Be comforted by the many, many years of \n     exuberantly joyful memories which all of you shared with \n     Terry, as well as by the grandeur of his astonishing gifts to \n     society, all of which will forever bring credit to the \n     Sanford name. One of the greatest privileges of my life, and \n     certainly the greatest shaper of my career, have been my work \n     and friendship with him over 47 years, as well as the warm \n     friendship which you all have given me so generously.\n       Seeing you there, Terry, Jr., brings to mind one of the \n     hallmarks of his way of doing everything. His original sense \n     of humor was no secret to anyone. One time he was meeting \n     with some out-of-state, indeed Northern corporate CEOs in the \n     Governor's office, trying to get them to invest in North \n     Carolina, and he had a call from you, which went, he told me \n     later, as follows: ``Dad, I caught that big turtle that's \n     been giving me trouble in the pond. What should I do with \n     him?'' Deliberately without explaining the question to those \n     in his office, Terry responded to you, ``Well, son, shoot `im \n     and throw `im in the back of the truck. We'll decide what to \n     do with him later.'' The folks in Terry's office turned pale, \n     afraid to ask for fear of what they might learn, and even \n     more than a bit anxious than before about doing business with \n     this good old boy turned New South politician.\n       Over the past 20 years I had occasion to introduce Terry \n     Sanford hundreds of times, mainly when we were jointly \n     trying, alas, to raise money for Duke. I loved regaling the \n     audiences with his achievements and watching him first blush \n     and then riposte with that deadpan, twinkle-in-the-eye humor. \n     He would surely blush and fire back ripostes at what all of \n     us are saying about him today.\n       Terry Sanford was a great-spirited, great-souled man, a man \n     of passion, a man with a conscience that had real bite, a \n     man, above all, who cared about people (really cared!), a man \n     of loyalty. But most of all, Terry Sanford was a creative \n     genius, but a thoroughly practical one, who transformed \n     everything he touched into something finer, better, worthier \n     and more useful to the world. If I had to call him by any \n     single phrase, it would be ``the great transformer.''\n       At a time when most Southern governors were engaged in \n     shameless, vicious race-baiting--and Fritz Hollings of South \n     Carolina and Leroy Collins of Georgia were notorious \n     exceptions to that pattern--Terry Sanford staked his \n     political career on achieving equality of opportunity without \n     regard to race, and thereby transformed public discourse in \n     North Carolina.\n       At a time when, as he entered the governorship, North \n     Carolina ranked next to last--49th--among the states in per \n     capita income, Terry Sanford sparked the transformation of \n     its economy by giving life, energy and momentum to Luther \n     Hodges' and Romeo Guest's dream of a high tech research park \n     as the magnet and engine of North Carolina's technological \n     transformation. He got Jack Kennedy to give the Research \n     Triangle Park the only one of the National Institutes of \n     Health ever located outside of Washington and helped persuade \n     IBM to be the first anchor tenant of the Park. What Sanford \n     got rolling, governors Dan Moore, Bob Scott, Jim Holshouser, \n     Jim Hunt and Jim Martin took to ever greater heights, and now \n     North Carolina is in 32nd place destined to go even higher. \n     Think what moving from 49th to 32nd means for all the people \n     of North Carolina, and what it tells us about the power of \n     enlighted, dedicated political leadership to do good in \n     partnership with non-governmental entities.\n       At a time when government was thought by most people to be \n     capable of solving, and indeed to have a monopoly on solving, \n     all public policy problems by itself, Terry Sanford \n     energetically created policy-shaping and problem-solving \n     partnerships among government at all levels, not-for-profit \n     organizations, foundations and for-profit corporations, \n     pioneering in what is now the fashion--trisectoral public \n     problem-solving. Miracle of miracles, he even began the \n     practice of systematically drawing so-called ``pointy-\n     headed'' academics from their ivory towers into policymaking \n     and administration in government.\n       At a time when Duke University was barely known outside the \n     South, Terry Sanford conceived and launched a plan to let the \n     whole world in on the secret that Duke was one of the best \n     universities in the world. The market test of his success is \n     that the number of applications for undergraduate admission \n     over the fifteen years of his presidency doubled--from 3.7 to \n     8 per place in the class, and went ever further later as a \n     result of the momentum he established, while soaring in \n     quality as well. [He loved to tell the story of President \n     Few's effort to recruit William James' student and fellow \n     Harvard colleague, Professor MacDougald, to the Duke faculty \n     as the first professor of psychology. Professor MacDougald \n     was on sabbatical at Oxford, and Few cabled him the offer, \n     which was financially very attractive, inviting him to join \n     the faculty of Duke in Durham, N.C. He instantly wired back, \n     saying ``I accept; where's Durham?'' Thanks in part to Terry \n     Sanford, everyone now knows where Durham is.]\n       The great transformer!\n       What was his secret? What were the qualities of mind and \n     character that enabled him to achieve these feats?\n       First of all, he genuinely cared about people, about \n     individuals. He was not someone who loved ``the people'' in \n     principle, while disdaining them as individuals.\n       Secondly, he never let things get to him. Over 47 years I \n     knew him to get angry only once. That was when a state \n     trooper on duty at the Governor's Mansion inadvertently let \n     it be known to a reporter that--get this--alcohol was in fact \n     being served at the Mansion, and Terry was furious that his \n     mother might discover that he had an occasional sip!\n       He stuck to his word. Unlike so many persons who occupy \n     political roles, whether as public office-holders or \n     university presidents, Terry Sanford did not change his mind \n     or his tune depending on what those with whom he was talking \n     wanted to hear, or according to the views of those with whom \n     he had most recently met. If he made a decision and committed \n     himself to you, you could count on the fact that he would \n     stick to it, and not be persuaded out of it by the next \n     person with whom he talked.\n       How could he do that? Because he had real values, bedrock \n     values. There was a there there!\n       His fidelity was the inevitable result of the fact that \n     what motivated him in all his actions were the values to \n     which he wholeheartedly committed his life and his entire \n     career. Those values were the lyrical melody his soul sang \n     from his birth to his death on Saturday last, a song which \n     stirred the hearts and minds of the millions who admired, \n     voted for, and followed him in the audacious goals he set for \n     us all. It was those values that led him to do all that he \n     did, and not some ego need to be loved or admired or be \n     constantly in the spotlight.\n       And he served those values with the most amazing energy \n     I've ever encountered in anyone. He was literally \n     indefatigable! It was not only boundless but it was never-\n     ending, showing itself even as he fought the last battle of \n     his life against cancer.\n       One is forced to ask, ``Why?'' Why did Terry Sanford pour \n     so much of himself into his quest for a better society? \n     Anyone must wonder why a rational human being would sacrifice \n     so much of their own life for others. One time, Terry and \n     Bert Bennett were out on the road campaigning with Margaret \n     Rose, and they were all being subjected to the same old cold \n     peas and chicken, and equally tasty rhetoric from local \n     politicians. Margaret Rose was complaining to Bert that \n     Terry was gone from home all the time. Little Terry and \n     Betsee were moaning about missing their father. Bert \n     slipped a note to Terry, which said ``Why do you continue \n     to stay in this business anyway?'' Terry fired back a note \n     with the following words: ``To keep the SOBs out.'' That's \n     a bit more jugular than Edmund Burke's ``All that is \n     required for evil to triumph is for good men to do \n     nothing.''\n       Of course, it was more, a lot more than that.\n       It was the ideals which drove him. I know of no public \n     figure who has demonstrated such consistent fidelity to his \n     ideals over a lifetime as Terry Sanford did. Most of us \n     change as we grow older, get a little more radical, even \n     conservative perhaps, as the case may be. But his devotion to \n     his ideals didn't waver one whit in the 47 years I knew him. \n     What were those ideals?\n       Devotion to democracy, little ``d'' as well as big ``D.'' \n     He always believed from the depth of this being, and always \n     acted on the belief, that the best cure for the ills of \n     democracy is more democracy. He was a relentless, devoted big \n     D Democrat. That is one, as he taught me, whose credo is \n     ``What my dog trees, I'll eat.''\n       Devotion to equality of opportunity for all, irrespective \n     of race, religion and gender. His creed has always been that \n     of the Declaration of Independence--``We hold these truths to \n     be self-evident,''--and by ``self-evident'' he really meant \n     self-evident--``that all men''--and women, he would add--\n     ``are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator \n     with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, \n     liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'' [Until Terry Sanford \n     became president of Duke University, there was a quota on the \n     admission of Jewish students. The day he became president, it \n     was removed.]\n       Devotion to education as the most important means of \n     society's continuing renewal, and of the individual's \n     personal growth and ladder to a better life. Of all the \n     things he was called--and he reveled in the fact that he was \n     called many things good and bad--he was proudest of being \n     called ``the education governor''--not just of North \n     Carolina, although that would surely have satisfied him--but \n     the education governor of the entire United States, probably \n     the first governor of any state in the nation in history to \n     be widely so called. And I'll bet, too, that he is just as \n     proud to have inspired Jim Hunt to aspire to, and indeed to \n     earn, the same proud title.\n       Devotion to the development of leadership--to bringing \n     along young people and nurturing them--as society's single \n     best\n\n[[Page S5781]]\n\n     means of ensuring the future flow of wise, energetic and \n     dedicated leaders required to solve the problems of \n     succeeding generations.\n       As all of us are now gathered in the Duke Chapel to \n     celebrate Terry Sanford's life, think how those four great \n     ideals--devotion to democracy, to equality, to education, and \n     to leadership development--that animated his career have come \n     to combine in the mission of the nearby building and \n     Institute that are honored by his name, and how they bear \n     witness to his devotion to them. A more perfect match could \n     hardly be imagined!\n       In an age when many politicians seem drawn to seek office, \n     like moths to a flame, primarily by a desire for power, fame, \n     and the spotlight, but who use the public interest as a mask \n     and justification for their ambition, Terry Sanford was \n     exactly the opposite. Public service was his end and public \n     office was the means of his service. He was obsessed by \n     fixing what is wrong, making things better, serving the \n     public, and he sought public office as the most effective \n     means for someone with his mix of talents to do so. His \n     ambition was redeemed because it was always yoked to his \n     over-riding, all-consuming, relentless quest for benefiting \n     the public. He was driven by his vision of making things \n     better for all North Carolinians, especially the powerless, \n     the less well off, those who are discriminated against. I \n     said he had a conscience with real bite. He not only preached \n     doing right, but he did right. When the business folks at \n     Duke proposed moving payday for the hourly workers from \n     Friday to Monday, someone wrote and delivered to Terry a note \n     with two verses from Deuteronomy (24:14, 15): ``Thou shalt \n     not wrong a day-laborer who is poor and needy whether of they \n     brethren or of the strangers that are in thy land, in thy \n     gates. On his day shalt thou give him his wage and let not \n     the sun go down on it, for he is poor and setteth his heart \n     upon it; let him not call unto God against thee, and a sin \n     would be upon thee.'' He instantly reversed the change.\n       In another extraordinary respect, Terry Sanford was unique \n     among all those of my acquaintance. He had an unquenchable \n     thirst for ideas from everyone, which led him to seek out \n     persons of all stations and conditions of life with whom to \n     consult about everything that he cared about. His life was a \n     never-ending pursuit of the best ideas from as a wide a \n     circle as possible about how to solve the problems of concern \n     to him, or to them. Unlike so many public figures and \n     university presidents, he was resolutely determined to resist \n     becoming the captive of his long-time friends, his campaign \n     workers, his kitchen cabinet. It goes without saying that he \n     was always loyal to them, and that they had access to him. \n     But that inner circle was perpetually refreshed over the \n     years by hundreds of others whom he sought out and drew in \n     on a continuing basis. He had the most remarkable thirst \n     for new ideas of any man of action I've ever known. That \n     characteristic had to be one of the keys to the many \n     significant innovations for which he is so justly credited \n     all across North Carolina and at Duke University. Honesty \n     requires me to say that not all of the ideas he picked up \n     and decided to run with seemed to me in prospect likely to \n     succeed, but I am struck in retrospect by how many of them \n     did.\n       Another key is the way he recruited, empowered and defended \n     associates. Once he hired or otherwise engaged someone, he \n     turned them loose to carry out their visions, and he backed \n     them to the hilt! If you worked for Terry Sanford, you never \n     had to worry about whether the would come to your aid when \n     you needed it, or protect you from those who opposed what you \n     were trying to do. He simply empowered you with the authority \n     of his office, and he was loyal to you.\n       At least most of the time.\n       My first assignment the day after the victorious second \n     primary, was to drive Margaret Rose home to Fayetteville. Tom \n     Lambeth handed me a set of car keys, and said take the blue \n     Oldsmobile in the parking lot of the Carolina Hotel, which \n     was campaign headquarters. So Margaret Rose and I went out to \n     the car, got in and started to drive away, when she said, \n     ``Why don't we drive around the Mansion just to take a look \n     at where we'll be living next January.'' Of course there was \n     still the general election to win, but Republicans weren't as \n     powerful then as now. So we drove north on MacDowell Street \n     and went all the way around the mansion and then headed south \n     on Wilmington Street. We hadn't gotten two blocks past the \n     Mansion when I heard police sirens behind us. To say that I \n     was petrified is the understatement of the decade. I could \n     see the screaming headlines in the N the next morning: \n     ``Gubernatorial Nominee's Wife and Sanford Aide arrested for \n     speeding.'' I was baffled because I knew we had not been \n     speeding. It was worse. The policeman told me that the car \n     Mrs. Sanford and I were in had just been reported as stolen. \n     So I sheepishly got out of the car, and asked the police to \n     let me make my one phone call. I wasn't about to tell them to \n     whom. I called Tom, who told Terry, whose immediate response \n     was ``Get Margaret Rose out of there as fast as possible, and \n     forget about Joel!'' It turned out that there were two blue \n     Oldsmobiles in the lot, one of which belonged to the hotel \n     manager, and miraculously the Sanford car keys fit his, too. \n     We all had a great laugh when it was over.\n       Our bodies exist, I believe, only so that they can serve as \n     instruments of the spirit that will animate us all if we but \n     allow it to do so. Our bodies are but the means whereby we \n     acquire the materiality to accomplish our visions in the \n     world of the material. The spirit that animated Terry \n     Sanford's body is the same spirit that found expression in \n     the lives and bodies of Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, \n     Abraham Lincoln, Charles Brantley Aycock, Franklin Roosevelt \n     and John F. Kennedy, and although their bodies are long \n     buried, their spirits live on in us. And it was the same \n     spirit, too, that radiated through the body of Frank Porter \n     Graham, in whose U.S. Senate campaign in 1950 Terry Sanford \n     played his first active political role. The only time Tom \n     Lambeth tells me that he ever saw Terry Sanford come close to \n     breaking into tears was when he spoke about what Frank \n     Graham's life had meant to him. Frank Graham's vision was \n     Terry Sanford's vision, too: ``In this land of liberty, for \n     which our fathers died, and for which we would live, work, \n     and give our all, may America become a country in which the \n     highest and the lowest and all the people equally together \n     have the freedom to struggle for the higher freedom of truth, \n     goodness and beauty; where democracy is without vulgarity, \n     excellence is without arrogance, the answer to error is not \n     terror and the response to a difference in color, race, \n     religion, ideas, and economic condition is not \n     discrimination, exploitation, or intimidation.''\n       It is not the body that we are here to bury that is Terry \n     Sanford; what we bury is but the envelope. The real Terry \n     Sanford can never be buried; that is the spirit, vision, \n     energy and compassion that animated that body for eighty \n     years. THAT is the Terry Sanford whom we honor and love, and \n     that can never be interred in the earth from which the body \n     came. As long as his spirit, vision, energy, and compassion \n     animate us, all of us whose lives he stirred to ``burgeon out \n     all that is within us,'' in Governor Aycock's words, the \n     values for which we love and honor Terry Sanford will go on \n     leading us to serve the goals to which he helped inspire us \n     to dedicate our lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5779-5", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5781-S5782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES FOR KING COVE, ALASKA\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I lend my strong support to Senator \nMurkowski and Congressman Young in their efforts to provide better \naccess to emergency medical services for the people of King Cove, \nAlaska. Senator Murkowski's bill, S. 1092, and its companion bill in \nthe House will put an end to the recent string of deaths resulting from \nemergency medical evacuation efforts out of King Cove.\n  King Cove is one of the most prolific fishing communities in the \nnation and has the largest fish processing operation in Alaska. It sits \nat the tip of the Alaska Peninsula, 600 miles southwest of Anchorage in \nthe North Pacific Ocean.\n  King Cove is served by a small dirt runway. The runway has no lights \nand no instrument capability, and has no personnel manning it. It sits \nin a valley between two large mountains. The weather and the \nsurrounding terrain create winds that are described as ``venturi \neffects''--under these conditions the wind can blow in opposite \ndirections at opposite ends of the runway. The winds aloft over the \nrunway create wind shears that have flipped planes and thrown them into \nmountains. King Cove's airstrip is closed roughly one out of every \nthree days, often for many days at a time.\n  Cold Bay also lies on the tip of the Alaska Peninsula. It is a \ncommunity built entirely around the third largest nonmilitary runway in \nthe state. Cold Bay is a ten minute plane ride from King Cove, just on \nthe other side of a wildlife refuge. The main runway at Cold Bay is \nover ten thousand feet long. The crosswind runway is over five thousand \nfeet long. Both are paved. Cold Bay's airport has runway lights and \nsupports full instrument approaches. It is a designated landing site \nfor the space shuttle, and is closed an average of two days a year.\n  The people of King Cove need emergency access to Cold Bay when the \nweather turns bad. Ferry service is not a viable option. The same wind \nthat shuts down King Cove's runway can drive forty foot seas on Cold \nBay. Recently, state officials looking into King Cove ferry service saw \na one hundred twenty foot fishing boat fail to make it into the harbor \nbecause the seas were too rough.\n  The people of King Cove want to build a single lane gravel road to \nCold Bay, but they need an easement through seven miles of federal land \nto do it. Many people who have never been to Alaska don't want to see \nthis road built. They cite the cost of the road, the precedent of \ngranting a right of way, and the availability of other options. What \nthey don't cite is the eleven people who have died in recent years \ntrying to fly out of King Cove.\n\n[[Page S5782]]\n\n  Senator Murkowski's bill does not authorize a single dollar of \nfederal funds to build this road. It merely provides a land exchange in \nwhich the refuge gains five hundred acres of wilderness area.\n  The bill does not establish any precedent with respect to land use in \nwildlife refuges. There are currently 42 miles of road in this refuge, \nabout a third of which are in wilderness areas. The Fish and Wildlife \nService already encourages people to use these roads for bird-watching. \nCongress frequently allows a number of uses in wilderness areas. Just \nlast Congress we allowed the use of all-terrain vehicles in the \nAnaktuvuk Pass land exchange.\n  Some people say that telemedicine is the answer to King Cove's \nemergency medical needs. I am a strong supporter of telemedicine, but I \nknow that it is a diagnostic tool. Once a diagnosis is made, patients \nstill need to get to a hospital. Telemedicine cannot reattach limbs or \nprovide prenatal care.\n  Alaska is used to being micromangaged by Washington, but we will not \nsit by and listen to specious arguments made to raise funds for extreme \nenvironmental groups. We have a simple bill to fix a simple problem, \nand if we don't do it more people will die.\n  The people of King Cove deserve reasonable access to medical \nfacilities. They have made a generous land exchange offer in return for \nthe right of way. I strongly support Senator Murkowski's efforts and \nurge my colleagues to support him as well when the bill comes to the \nfloor. I ask that I be added as a cosponsor to the King Cove Health and \nSafety Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5781-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO THE UNLV GOLF TEAM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to express my congratulations \nto Coach Dwaine Knight, Assistant Coach Dwayne Whalen, and the entire \nUniversity of Nevada-Las Vegas golf team for capturing its first-ever \nNCAA national championship.\n  The UNLV Rebels secured the title after fending off rival Clemson to \nwin the NCAA tournament, which was held in the final week of May at the \nUniversity of Mexico's Championship Golf Course. UNLV easily set a team \ntournament record by shooting a sizzling 34 under (72-hole) par of \n1,118. The previous mark was 23 under par.\n  Prospects for winning the title appeared dim at the beginning of the \nseason. Despite high rankings, the team failed to qualify for the \ntournament in 1997, and lost key players to graduation and the \nprofessional ranks. Some in the media speculated that UNLV could not \nwin the big tournaments. The team has clearly proved its doubters \nwrong.\n  It is interesting to note, however, that the Rebels came in a \ndisappointing 10th in the season's first match and fell dramatically in \nthe rankings. Undeterred, the squad, which includes only one senior, \nbounced back to win seven contests, an NCAA record.\n  Importantly, instead of being laden with highly recruited stars and \noverblown egos that are the trademarks of so many top amateur sports \nprograms, the 1998 Rebels featured a handful of student-athletes with \ntremendous heart and determination. Coach Knight has rightfully stated \nthat the mark of this year's team was its will to do battle. Indeed, \nthe group's desire to persevere and overachieve should be an \ninspiration to all who follow the sport.\n  Bob Hope once said that if you watch a game, it's fun. If you play \nit, it's recreation. If you work at it, it's golf. Plain and simple, \nthe Rebels' tremendous success can be traced to their commitment to \nhard work. And, I might add, their hard work doesn't stop on the \ngreens. In fact, the team is comprised of model student-athletes, young \nmen who understand their first priority is academics. Their commitment \nto the sport is matched only by their commitment to the classroom.\n  I am particularly proud to report that the team earned a very \nrespectable grade point average of 3.1 in the fall semester and 3.4 in \nthe spring term. Moreover, they are true sportsmen in the sense that \nthey represent themselves with class and good character.\n  The Rebels' success is something in which Nevadans can take great \npride. In fact in southern Nevada, where the population increases by a \nthousand a week, where a new, spectacular course seems to open every \nmonth, and where the sun shines bright 300 hundred days a year, golf \nhas emerged as nothing short of a sensation. The success of the UNLV \nteam certainly contributes to the sport's popularity in southern \nNevada.\n  Today, I applaud team members Jeremy Anderson, Chris Berry, Daron \nDorsey, Charley Hoffman, Scott Lander, Bill Lunde, Christian Thornley, \nMorten Vidhoj, Scott Wingfield, the coaching staff, as well as the \nloyal fans, supportive community and UNLV, on the squad's amazing \nsuccess. The UNLV golf team's hard work and great accomplishments have \nmade Nevadans very proud, and I wish team members continued success in \nall their endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5782-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting one treaty, \na withdrawal, and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5782-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT CONCERNING THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO WEAPONS OF \n          MASS DESTRUCTION--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 137\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 204 of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)) and section 401(c) of the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)), I transmit herewith a 6-month \nreport on the national emergency declared by Executive Order 12938 of \nNovember 14, 1994, in response to the threat posed by the proliferation \nof nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons (``weapons of mass \ndestruction'') and of the means of delivering such weapons.\n                                                  William J.

The ICCA is one of \nthe foremost initiatives highlighted in my Administration's \nInternational Crime Control Strategy, which I announced on May 12, \n1998. The proposed legislation would substantially improve the ability \nof U.S. law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute \ninternational criminals, seize their money and assets, intercept them \nat our borders, and prevent them from striking at our people and \ninstitutions.\n  Advances in technology, the resurgence of democracy, and the lowering \nof global political and economic barriers have brought increased \nfreedom and higher living standards to countries around the world, \nincluding our own. However, these changes have also provided new \nopportunities for international criminals trafficking in drugs, \nfirearms, weapons of mass destruction, and human beings, and engaging \nin fraud, theft, extortion, and terrorism.\n  In response to these formidable threats to the American people, I \nhave directed the Departments of Justice, State, and the Treasury, as \nwell as the\n\n[[Page S5783]]\n\nFederal law enforcement and intelligence communities, to intensify \ntheir ongoing efforts to combat international crime. In order to carry \nout this mandate most effectively, the many departments and agencies \ninvolved need the additional tools in the proposed ICCA that will \nenhance Federal law enforcement authority in several key areas, close \ngaps in existing laws, and facilitate global cooperation against \ninternational crime.\n  The ICCA's provisions focus on seven essential areas to improve the \nFederal Government's ability to prevent, investigate, and punish \ninternational crimes and criminals:\n\n\n  (1) investigating and punishing acts of violence committed against \n                            americans abroad\n\n  --Broadens existing criminal law to authorize the investigation and \n    punishment of organized crime groups who commit serious criminal \n    acts against Americans abroad. (Current law generally requires a \n    link to terrorist activity.)\n  --Provides jurisdiction in the United States over violent acts \n    committed abroad against State and local officials while in other \n    countries on official Federal business.\n\n\n           (2) strengthening u.s. air, land, and sea borders\n\n  --Increases penalties for smugglers who endanger Federal law \n    enforcement officials seeking to interdict their activities, \n    introducing the Federal criminal offense of ``portrunning'' (i.e., \n    evading border inspections, often through the use of force).\n  --Addresses gaps in current law relating to maritime drug \n    interdiction operations, introducing the criminal offense of \n    failing to stop (``heave to'') a vessel at the direction of a Coast \n    Guard or other Federal law enforcement official seeking to board \n    that vessel.\n  --Provides clear authority to search international, outbound letter-\n    class mail if there is reasonable cause to suspect that the mail \n    contains monetary instruments, drugs, weapons of mass destruction, \n    or merchandise mailed in violation of several enumerated statutes \n    (including obscenity and export control laws).\n  --Broadens the ability to prosecute criminals smuggling goods out of \n    the United States.\n\n\n           (3) denying safe haven to international fugitives\n\n  --Authorizes the extradition, in certain circumstances, of suspected \n    criminals to foreign nations in two separate cases not covered by a \n    treaty: (1) when the United States has an extradition treaty with \n    the nation, but the applicable treaty is an outdated ``list'' \n    treaty that does not cover the offense for which extradition is \n    sought; and (2) when the United States does not have an extradition \n    treaty with the requesting nation.\n  --Provides for exclusion from the United States of drug traffickers \n    and their immediate family members and of persons who attempt to \n    enter the United States in order to avoid prosecution in another \n    country.\n\n\n    (4) seizing and forfeiting the assets of international criminals\n\n  --Expands the list of money laundering ``predicate crimes'' to \n    include certain violent crimes, international terrorism, and \n    bribery of public officials, thus increasing the availability of \n    money laundering enforcement tools.\n  --Broadens the definition of ``financial institution'' to include \n    foreign banks, thereby closing a loophole involving criminally \n    derived funds laundered through foreign banks doing business here.\n  --Provides new tools to crack down on businesses illegally \n    transmitting money, and to investigate money laundering under the \n    Bank Secrecy Act.\n  --Toughens penalties for violations of the International Emergency \n    Economic Powers Act.\n  --Criminalizes attempted violations of the Trading With the Enemy \n    Act.\n\n\n        (5) Responding to Emerging International Crime Problems\n\n  --Enhances enforcement tools for combating arms trafficking, \n    including requiring ``instant checks'' of the criminal history of \n    those acquiring explosive materials from Federal licensees and \n    clarifying Federal authority to conduct undercover transactions \n    subject to the Arms Export Control Act for investigative purposes.\n  --Addresses the increasing problem of alien smuggling by authorizing \n    the forfeiture of the proceeds and all instrumentalities of alien \n    smuggling.\n  --Cracks down on the international shipment of ``precursor \n    chemicals'' used to manufacture illicit drugs, primarily by \n    authorizing the Drug Enforcement Administration to require \n    additional ``end-use'' verification.\n  --Provides extraterritorial jurisdiction for fraud involving credit \n    cards and other ``access devices,'' which cost U.S. businesses \n    hundreds of millions of dollars every year.\n  --Authorizes wiretapping for investigations of felony computer crime \n    offenses.\n\n\n                    (6) Promoting Global Cooperation\n\n  --Expands the authority of U.S. law enforcement agencies to share the \n    seized assets of international criminals with foreign law \n    enforcement agencies.\n  --Provides new authority, applicable in cases where there is no \n    mutual legal assistance treaty provision, to transfer a person in \n    United States Government custody to a requesting country \n    temporarily for purposes of a criminal proceeding.\n\n\n  (7) Streamlining the Investigation and Prosecution of International \n                          Crime in U.S. Courts\n\n  --Authorizes the Attorney General to use funds to defray translation, \n    transportation, and other costs of State and local law enforcement \n    agencies in cases involving fugitives or evidence overseas.\n  --Facilitates the admission into evidence in U.S. court proceedings \n    of certain foreign government records.\n\n  The details of this proposal are described in the enclosed section-\nby-section analysis. I urge the prompt and favorable consideration of \nthis legislative proposal by the Congress.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend chapter 45 of title 28, United States Code, \nto authorize the Administrative Assistant to the Chief Justice to \naccept voluntary services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                  supreme court volunteer legislation\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, year after year, millions of people flock \nto Washington D.C. to visit the seat of American government. They come \nfrom every state of the union and most of the nations of the Earth to \nview for themselves the workings of the oldest democracy in the world. \nThis city, through its historic edifices, tells the story of our \nnation. I am grateful for the thousands of professionals and volunteers \nwho help to share that story with all who come to hear it.\n  Over one million of these visitors come to the Supreme Court Building \neach year. They come to see, experience, and learn about the workings \nof American justice. Meeting this large demand can be taxing on the \nresources of the Court. To satisfy this need, without adding an undue \nburden to the budget, the Court has asked Congress to enact legislation \npermitting volunteers from the Supreme Court Historical Society to \nconduct public tours of the Supreme Court building.\n  This legislation will provide the Court with the same benefits that \nhave recently been extended to the Congress. Currently, 35 volunteers \nfrom the Capitol Guide Service assist Capitol visitors by providing \nhistorical perspective and insight. I have been told by the Capitol \nGuide Service that the influx of volunteers, allowed by legislation in \nthe 104th Congress, enabled them to increase the volume of their tours \nof the Capitol by approximately twenty-five percent. Moreover, it \nprovided the personnel necessary to expand their service to the \nexterior of the Capitol. Guides positioned outside the Capitol help \ndirect visitors and provide information about the historic external \narchitecture of this building. The use of volunteers has improved the \nexperience of citizens visiting the Capitol grounds.\n  The proposed legislation, like that covering congressional \nvolunteers, will have no adverse fiscal impact, nor will it displace \nany Supreme Court employees. The legislation will, however, \ndramatically improve the ability of the Supreme Court to educate the \npublic about this distinctly American institution.\n  I believe that upon passage of this legislation, all Americans who \nvisit our seat of Justice will appreciate the expanded services made \navailable by its enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, and Ms. Moseley-\n        Braun):\n  S. 2145. A bill to modernize the requirements under the National \nManufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 and \nto establish a balanced consensus process for the development, \nrevision, and interpretation of Federal construction and safety \nstandards for manufactured homes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                  manufactured housing improvement act\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I introduce a bipartisan bill \nwith my colleagues, Senators John Rockefeller and Carol Moseley-Braun. \nEntitled the ``Manufactured Housing Improvement Act,'' (MHIA) this bill \nis designed to modernize the requirements under the National \nManufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 and \nto establish a balanced consensus process for the development, \nrevision, and interpretation of Federal construction and safety \nstandards for manufactured homes.\n  Many do not realize that the manufactured homes of today are \ncompletely different from those of twenty or even ten years ago. They \nalso do not realize that this is the fastest growing segment of the \nhousing industry, and that it accounts for one out of every three new \nsingle family homes sold. Between 1980 and 1990, the industry \nexperienced a 60 percent growth in market share, and last year set a \ntwenty year sales record. There are good consumer-oriented reasons for \nthis tremendous growth--manufactured housing offers quality and \naesthetically pleasing housing at an average cost of $37,300, excluding \nthe land. Today, manufactured housing has lowered the threshold to the \nAmerican Dream of home ownership for millions of Americans, including \nfirst-time home buyers, senior citizens, young families, and single \nparents.\n  At a time when home ownership is becoming harder for the average \nAmerican to attain, and with more than 5.3 million Americans paying \nmore than 50 percent of their incomes on rent, I believe it is \nimperative to update the laws that regulate the private sector solution \nto affordable housing. In order for the manufactured housing industry \nto remain competitive, Congress must modernize the National \nManufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974.\n  My bill would do just that. MHIA would establish a consensus \ncommittee that would submit recommendations to the Secretary of Housing \nand Urban Development (HUD) for developing, amending and revising both \nthe Federal Manufactured Home Construction\n\n[[Page S5788]]\n\nand Safety Standards. This provision will allow the manufactured \nhousing industry to update and create applicable building codes and \nstandards just like other participants in the housing industry. In \naddition, the committee would be authorized to interpret the standards, \nthereby eliminating confusion and uncertainty in the market place.\n  The Manufactured Housing Improvement Act would authorize the \nSecretary of HUD to use industry labeling fees for the administration \nof the consensus committee and the hiring of additional HUD staff. The \nSecretary of HUD would also be authorized to use industry label fees to \npromote the availability and affordability of manufactured housing.\n  This legislation is a very significant step forward in that both the \nManufactured Housing Institute and the Manufactured Housing Association \nfor Regulatory Reform endorse this legislation. The industry \nparticipants have modernized the quality and technology of manufactured \nhousing. Congress must now modernize the laws that regulate an industry \nthat provides affordable housing and contributes more than $23 billion \nannually to our nation's economy.\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I join today with Senator \nShelby to introduce legislation intended to strengthen the manufactured \nhousing industry. Manufactured housing provides a major source of \naffordable housing for American families and seniors. This industry \nrepresents almost 30 percent of new single-family homes sold in the \nUnited States. In my state of West Virginia, manufactured housing \nrepresents more than 60 percent of new homes.\n  Manufactured housing should play a strong role to increase the \navailability of affordable housing. This issue will be especially \nimportant to seniors. According to a recent national survey, 45 percent \nof households living in manufactured homes are headed by a person more \nthan 50 years old.\n  Manufactured housing is affordable housing, and it is the fastest \ngrowing type of housing nationally. The average cost of a new \nmanufactured home without land in 1997 was $38,400. Even with land and \ninstallation fees, this cost is well below the typical costs of a newly \nconstructed site-built home.\n  But this industry faces challenges. Unlike other housing, \nmanufactured housing is regulated by the 1974 National Manufactured \nHousing Construction and Safety Standards Act by the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, (HUD). Because of reform in HUD \nmanagement, the federal officials overseeing manufactured housing have \ndeclined from a staff of 34 to only eight. This decline in staff has \noccurred at the same time that the industry has grown. Unfortunately, \ndue to a lack of staff, HUD cannot keep pace with the need to update \nthe code on a consistent basis and timely manner. For example, there \nare new nationally recognized standards for fire protection prepared by \nthe National Fire Protection Association and endorsed by the National \nInstitute for Standards and Technology (NIST). However, there is no \nindication that HUD is ready to act on using these new standards to \nupgrade its codes for manufactured housing. In fact, between 1989 and \n1996, a consensus committee has made 140 suggestions to HUD about \nchanges for the federal codes on manufactured housing. More than 80 of \nthese provisions are still pending in the Department.\n  In 1990, Congress established a National Commission on Manufactured \nHousing and pushed the commission to forge a consensus on key issues \nfor this important industry. Unfortunately that effort collapsed in \n1994.\n  This legislation is a new effort to address the challenges facing the \nindustry. Introduction of the bill is just a first step. We all \nunderstand that the legislative process is designed to seek a consensus \nand improve legislation. I believe that we must work hard to forge a \nconsensus between the industry and the consumers. This will be a \nchallenge, but the potential rewards can be great for both sides. The \nindustry can win and prosper with a more effective, streamlined \nregulatory process that keeps pace with improvements and standards. \nConsumers will win if safety standards and regulations are adopted more \nefficiently, such as the pending fire safety standards. Also, if the \nindustry can use newer standards to provide better housing, \nmanufactured housing could be designed to meet a wider variety of needs \nincluding modules for assisted living and stack able units for urban \nsites.\n  My hope is that all sides will see this legislation as an opportunity \nto come together and develop a new, improved program for manufactured \nhousing. Affordable housing is a major issue for families and \ncommunities. Manufactured housing is playing a key role in affordable \nhousing, but more could and should be done. To achieve success, we need \nto develop a bipartisan, consensus approach. We need to help the \nindustry and assure consumers that safety and standards will be \nretained and improved, not weakened. This is worth our combined effort \nto provide more affordable housing.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 2146. A bill to provide for the exchange of certain lands within \nthe State of Utah; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              UTAH SCHOOLS AND LANDS EXCHANGE ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, nearly 2 years ago, President Clinton \nannounced, from the South Rim of the Grand Canyon, the formation of the \ncountry's newest national monument, the Grand Staircase-Escalante \nMonument in southern Utah.\n  Because of the clandestine manner by which the Administration made \nthis decision and planned its announcement, what should have been cause \nfor celebration among Utahns resulted in feelings of exploitation and \nabuse. Public trust in our federal government reached an all time low \nin southern Utah, and many wounds inflicted then still exist today.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation, along with my colleague Senator \nBennett, which, if passed, will help restore trust in our government \nand assist the healing process among our rural citizens in Utah.\n  The Utah Schools and Lands Exchange Act of 1998 codifies a recently \nsigned agreement brokered by the Secretary of Interior, Bruce Babbitt, \nand Utah Governor Michael Leavitt to exchange Utah School Trust lands \nlocated within Utah's national parks, monuments, recreation areas, and \nforests for cash and federal assets in other parts of Utah. The \ncollaboration that should have taken place prior to the establishment \nof the Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument has finally taken place to \nmitigate one of the severest impacts of that presidential declaration.\n  This agreement is the result of a lengthy and somewhat fragile \nnegotiation, which included such critical issues as achieving the \neffective management of the public's land, preserving the environment, \nand consummating a fair and equitable exchange between the federal \ngovernment and the State of Utah. The result is a mutually beneficial \nexchange of state and federal property that deserves the support and \napproval of the Congress.\n  As my colleagues may recall, when Utah achieved statehood in 1896, a \nnumber of sections within each township were set aside for the support \nof the common schools. By law, these lands, known as School Trust \nLands, are to be managed in the best possible way to generate revenue \nfor Utah's school children. Several western states have a similar \nrevenue plan for their public school systems.\n  Utah's checkerboard pattern of land owernship--squares of federal, \nstate, and private land intermingled throughout the state--has \nhistorically created difficulties between the federal and state \ngovernments. Conflicts of interest between federal and state land \nmanagers became more obvious and divisive as national parks, forests, \nor monuments were created.\n  When federal land is set aside or designated as a national park, \nforest, or monument in Utah, our School Trust Lands are captured within \ntheir boundaries. In effect, the state loses its ability to generate \nrevenues from these lands because they have been surrounded by lands in \na specially protected designation. By 1990, over 200,000 acres of \nschool trust land were isolated within federal designations.\n  In 1993, Congress passed legislation I sponsored along with other \ndelegation members--the Utah Schools and Lands Improvement Act of 1993, \nP.L. 103-93--\n\n[[Page S5789]]\n\nto help resolve this land management situation. But implementation has \nbeen unsatisfactory. There have been endless arguments over appraisals \nand literally millions of dollars in expenses to the state for legal \nand research activities. For this reason alone, the legislation we are \nintroducing today is necessary.\n  During his announcement to establish the Grand Staircase-Escalante \nNational Monument, President Clinton voiced his firm commitment that \nUtah's school children would not be negatively affected by the creation \nof the Monument. In other words, those School Trust Lands captured \nwithin the Monument's boundaries would be withdrawn and made fully \navailable, and thus profitable, for the benefit of Utah's public \neducation system. The principal purpose of this bill is to put the \nbipartisan, federal-state negotiated agreement into effect and to \nensure that the President's promise to protect Utah's school children \ndoes not ring hollow. This is accomplished in several ways.\n  First, as I mentioned, this bill will transfer approximately 350,000 \nacres of School Trust Lands that are located within Utah monuments, \nrecreations areas, national parks, and forests, to the federal \ngovernment. These lands are similar in nature to the adjacent federal \nlands and are deserving of the same designation and special management \nconsiderations as their federal neighbors. This exchange harmonizes the \nland ownership pattern within Utah's national parks, forests and \nmonuments, thus eliminating any competing management objectives within \nthese designations. The American people will be greatly benefited once \nthe entire acreage within a park or forest is federal land.\n  Let me assure my colleagues that those lands to be acquired by the \nfederal government are just as extraordinary as the adjacent federal \nlands.\n  For example, this acreage includes: Eye of the Whale Arch, located in \nArches National Park; the Perfect Ruin (an Anasazi ruin) and the Jacob \nHamblin Arch of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area; several hundred \nfoot red rock cliffs located within in the Grand Staircase-Escalante \nNational Monument; and the high mountain alpine area in the Wasatch-\nCache National Forest known as Franklin Basin. It includes many other \nexciting natural wonders, such as ancient Native American rock art \npanels in Dinosaur National Monument and unique geologic formations of \nthe Waterpocket Fold within Capitol Reef National Park.\n  Our proposal will protect these and other precious land forms by \ntransferring their ownership to the federal government.\n  For its part, the State of Utah will receive $50,000,000 in cash \npreviously set aside in the 103rd Congress for P.L. 103-93. This money \nhas already been appropriated and thus there is no budgetary impact \ncaused by this bill. An additional $13,000,000 produced from unleased \ncoal sales will also be forthcoming to the State. These funds will all \nbe deposited to the Utah Permanent School Fund for the benefit of \nUtah's current and future school children.\n  In addition, under the terms of the agreement, the State will gain \naccess to 160 million tons of coal, 185 billion cubic feet of coal bed \nmethane resources, 139,000 acres of land and minerals located in nine \nUtah counties, and a variety of minerals including limestone, tar \nsands, oil, and gas.\n  Coal reserves the state will receive include the Mill Fork Tract and \nNorth Horn Tract in Emery County; the West Ridge Tract in Carbon \nCounty; and the Muddy Creek and Dugout Canyon Tracts located in both \nCarbon and Emery Counties.\n  The coal bed methane resources acquired by the state are situated in \nthe Ferron Field, located in Carbon and Emery counties, and totals \n58,000 acres.\n  Finally, the agreement provides for additional state acquisitions, \nincluding limestone deposits, oil and gas properties, and Tar Sands, \nand several properties identified in 1993 will be transferred to state \ncontrol: the Blue Mountain Telecommunication Site, located in Uintah \nCounty, and the Beaver Mountain ski resort in Cache County.\n  Mr. President, in closing let me mention one important point \nregarding the Babbitt-Leavitt agreement to be effectuated by the \nlegislation we are introducing today. The entire exchange is of \napproximately equal value. This is a delicately structured package that \nincludes an exchange of state lands for federal assets. Each party to \nthe agreement recognizes this fact, which is the glue keeping this \nagreement together.\n  And, while protecting the interests of both the State of Utah and the \nfederal government, the agreement and the bill also protect existing \nstakeholders, such as the affected local governments and the valid \nexisting rights of permittees, such as ranchers and mining leases. As I \nmentioned earlier, the important fact to keep in mind is there is no \nimpact to the federal budget from this legislation.\n  Mr. President, Secretary Babbitt and Governor Leavitt have achieved \nan historic agreement that is truly remarkable. The State of Utah has \nbeen trying to exchange School Trust Lands captured within federal \nreservations for decades, thus allowing these lands to be profitably \nutilized for the benefit of Utah's school children. We now have an \nopportunity through this agreement to reach this worthwhile goal.\n  I hope that the Senate will seriously review this agreement and this \nlegislation will add its support with little, if any, alteration. I \nbelieve this proposal is necessary and will provide substantial benefit \nto the people of Utah and the citizens of this country.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator \nHatch in introducing the Utah School Lands Exchange Act. This \nlegislation is the result of months of negotiations between the Utah \nSchool and Institutional Trust Administration (SITLA), the Governor of \nUtah and the Secretary of Interior.\n  Utah is a mosaic of land ownership and the federal government is the \nlargest landlord. With 22 million acres under BLM management alone, \neight million acres under the United States Forest Service and another \nthree million in National Parks and Monuments, public lands issues \ncommand considerable attention in my state. This is complicated by the \n1894 Enabling Act which created a checkerboard pattern of state \nownership among federal lands, intermingling five sections of state \nlands in every township. The federal government and the state of Utah \nhave been trying to resolve the thorny issue of how to manage or \ndispose of these trust lands for well over a half century now. My \nfather attempted to bring some resolution to the issue when he served \nin this body more than forty years ago.\n  In 1993, after extensive negotiations, Congress passed P.L. 103-93 \nwhich set in motion a process to exchange lands out of Utah's National \nParks and Forest lands for other parcels within the state. The process \nwas marginally successful at best, due to the complex process of \nappraisals and arbitration established by the legislation. Of the 500 \nplus parcels identified in that exchange over five years ago, less than \nforty have actually been exchanged to date. The trust lands issue was \nfurther complicated by the creation of the Grand Staircase-Escalante \nNational Monument in September of 1996. Without going into details, \n176,000 acres of School Trust Lands were locked up by the creation of \nthe Monument. President Clinton promised to use his office to \nfacilitate the prompt exchange of these lands. Most Utahns were \nskeptical that this would actually happen. In fact, SITLA and the Utah \nAssociation of Counties filed suit over the creation of the Grand \nStaircase-Escalante National Monument.\n  Now, nearly two years later, the Clinton Administration has reached a \nhistoric agreement with the Governor of Utah and SITLA to exchange \n376,000 acres of state lands for 138,000 acres of federal lands. This \nagreement fulfills the President's commitment to the schoolchildren of \nUtah and reduces the uncertainty over the future management of the \nMonument. I hope my colleagues understand that it is in the best \ninterest of the federal government to exchange these lands promptly.\n  This proposal benefits the school children of Utah as well as the \nvisitors and users of public lands. In exchange for lands encumbered \nwithin parks, forests and the Monument, the state of Utah will receive \njust compensation in the form of mineral assets, comparable lands \nwithin the state and a sizable cash payment. These assets will be \nadministered by the State Institutional\n\n[[Page S5790]]\n\nTrust Lands Administration for the improvement of public education in \nUtah. In that context, we must support this agreement. We have a \nresponsibility to help SITLA fulfill its mandate and utilize these \nlands for the greatest benefit to the children of Utah. Without this \nexchange, these lands, despite their significant mineral potential, \nwill remain unproductive.\n  At a time of competing interests and lack of consensus regarding land \nuse in Utah, this is a step in the right direction. I believe that the \nagreement reached between the state and the Department of Interior \nbridges the gap that has existed for decades. While some interests are \nnot totally satisfied, I believe the legislation we are introducing \ntoday is a fair and equitable agreement. I am also confident that the \nCommittee will listen closely to those parties and make a good-faith \neffort to resolve any lingering concerns.\n  I appreciate the good work of my colleague Senator Hatch, Governor \nLeavitt and Secretary Babbitt, as well as our colleagues in the House. \nI am confident that we will see a resolution to this longstanding \ndebate in the 105th Congress. I urge my colleagues to support this bill \nand bring this issue to closure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 2147. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na deduction for two-earner married couples, to allow self-employed \nindividuals a 100-percent deduction for health insurance costs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      marriage penalty tax relief\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to introduce \nlegislation to encourage family and work and to facilitate the purchase \nof affordable health insurance by self-employed individuals.\n  It is no secret to many married Americans that the tax code often \npenalizes marriage. An estimated 21 million American couples with two \nbreadwinners pay more than if they had remained single and filed \nseparate tax returns--an average of nearly $1,400 more.\n  The marriage penalty is justifiably one of the most unpopular aspects \nof our tax system, second only to the complexity of the tax code. The \nfederal government should be encouraging family and work, not \ndiscouraging them through disincentives in the tax code or any other \narea of public policy.\n  The bill I am introducing today would significantly reduce the added \ntax burden that many middle and lower income couples face when both \nspouses work. It will do so by providing an above-the-line 20 percent \ndeduction against the earnings of the lesser earning spouse. The 20 \npercent deduction would be phased out between family adjusted gross \nincomes of $50,000 and $60,000. It would also be applied against the \ncalculation of earned income for the purpose of determining eligibility \nfor the Earned Income Credit, increasing the size of these refundable \ncredits for a large number of families with incomes between $10,000 and \n$30,000. Finally, the bill would accelerate the date at which health \ninsurance costs incurred by the self-employed become fully deductible. \nThis is necessary to place farmers and small businessmen and women on \nthe same footing as large, established companies when they purchase \nhealth insurance.\n  Congress has wrestled with the marriage penalty problem several times \nduring the past century in an attempt to reconcile two goals that \ncannot always be satisfied simultaneously in the context of a \nprogressive tax system. The first is to ensure that a couple's total \ntax is the same, irrespective of the breakdown of earnings between \nspouses. The second is to ensure that couples will be taxed the same \nirrespective of whether they are married or still single.\n  Before 1969, the tax code treated married couples as if they were \ncomposed of two single individuals. This avoided penalties on marriage, \nbut it created higher rates on single taxpayers than married couples in \ncases in which one spouse earned all or most of the couple's income. \nJoint returns were computed by applying the normal rates to one-half of \nthe couple's aggregate taxable income and multiplying the resulting \namount by two. Single taxpayers' returns were computed by applying the \nnormal rates to the full taxable income, causing a greater amount of \nthe income to be taxed at a higher marginal rate.\n  When Congress acted in 1969 to redress the perceived inequity to \nsingle taxpayers, it created the modern-day marriage penalty by causing \nsome married couples who file a joint return to pay more tax than would \ntwo single persons with the same total income. Congress based its \naction on the assumption that a married couple's expenses are lower \nthan those of two single persons having separate households.\n  The time has come to reexamine this tradeoff, which was made nearly \nthirty years ago. Doing so, however, will require us to confront hard \nbudgetary realities. Complete elimination of the marriage penalty \nwithout also eliminating the marriage bonus would cost an estimated $29 \nbillion per year, a sum that is far in excess of what can be afforded \nwhile maintaining our commitment to a balanced budget and the use of \nbudget surpluses for Social Security reform. While the drive to pay \ndown the national debt and save Social Security will make comprehensive \nreform of the marriage penalty difficult any time soon, more targeted \nefforts are not only possible, they are the right thing to do.\n  We have an historic opportunity to redress the unjustified added tax \nburden we place on some married couples without undermining our \ncommitment to pass an effective national tobacco policy and enact \nreforms to save Social Security. My bill would sharply reduce the \nmarriage tax penalty for most couples with incomes of less than $60,000 \nat a fraction of the budgetary cost of other marriage penalty tax \nproposals, such as that offered by Senator Gramm of Texas to increase \ndeductions for all married couples. The reason is that these other \nproposals fail to distinguish between couples who incur a penalty and \nthose who enjoy a marriage bonus. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that about 29 million families, those in which one spouse \nearns much more than the other, currently pay less than if they had \nfiled single returns--an average of $1,300 less. Senator Gramm's \nproposal and others like it dilute the amount of tax relief they are \nable to deliver to penalized couples by providing just as much of a tax \ncut to couples who receive a bonus.\n  By targeting its tax relief more directly on the couples who \nexperience a marriage penalty, my bill would reduce this penalty far \nmore for most families with incomes below $60,000 than competing \napproaches. For Example, in the case of a couple making $35,000, split \n$20,000 and $15,000 between the two spouses, my proposal would provide \nan additional tax deduction of $3,000 (i.e., 15% of $15,000). This is \nover twice as much marriage penalty tax relief as could be provided at \na comparable cost by a proposal to increase the deduction for all joint \nfilers. Similarly, for a couple making $50,000 divided evenly between \nthe two spouses, my bill would provide a $5,000 deduction (20% of \n$25,000), representing more than three times as much tax as a proposal \nthat costs the same but extends a supplemental deduction to all married \ncouples.\n  We simply do not have the luxury of applying tax relief \nindiscriminately if we are to make good on our other commitments, \nwhether they be passage of an effective tobacco bill that reduces youth \nsmoking or preservation of budget surpluses for the difficult task of \nshoring up the financing of the Social Security system. The legislation \nI introduce today is aimed at demonstrating that we can reconcile our \ncompeting priorities. We can do right by married couples incurring a \ntax penalty and farmers and small businesses who must purchase their \nown health insurance at the same that we do right by our children and \nour growing population of seniors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2147\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect religious liberty; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n              THE RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PROTECTION ACT of 1998\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the first freedom guaranteed in the Bill of \nRights is the freedom to believe and to put those beliefs into practice \nas we think right, without government interference. This promise of \nfreedom of worship is, for many, this country's founding principle--the \npilgrims' reason for braving thousands of miles of dark and dangerous \nseas, and countless privations once here. The Constitutional guarantee \nof the free exercise of religion for all has been a beacon to the world \nthroughout our history.\n  In America, priests should not be punished for declining to violate \nthe confidence of the confessional to turn state's evidence against \nreligious confessors. In America, the ability of citizens to hold \nprivate Bible studies in their own homes or the freedom of synagogues \nand churches to locate near their members should not be left entirely \nto the whims of local zoning boards. Congregants of any faith should \nnot be told by the government who they can and cannot have as religious \nleaders and teachers. No, not in America.\n  Last year, when the Supreme Court struck down part of the Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act in the case of City of Boerne versus Flores \n(117 S.Ct. 2157 (1997))--an Act that sought to redress a threat to \nreligious liberty of the Court's own making--we who value the free \nexercise of religion vowed we would rebuild our coalition and craft a \nsolution which appropriately defers to the Court's decision. Well, we \nhave done so, and we are ready to move forward.\n  We introduce today legislation that uses the full extent of our \npowers to make government cognizant of and solicitous of the freedom of \neach American to serve his or her concept of God. Where adjustment in \ngeneral rules can possibly be made to accommodate this most basic \nliberty, it ought and must be made. As our government exists to \nguarantee such freedoms, government should only in the rarest instances \nitself infringe on this most basic and foundational freedom.\n  We have worked together across party lines and with a coalition of \ntruly remarkable breadth to fashion federal legislation to protect \nreligious liberty that is consistent with both the vision of the \nFramers of the First Amendment and the ruling of the current Supreme \nCourt about Congress' power to legislate in this area.\n  The legislation that we introduce today will subject to strict \nscrutiny laws that substantially burden religious exercise in those \nareas within legitimate federal reach through either the commerce or \nspending powers, and provides procedural helps to ensure a full day in \ncourt for believers who must litigate to vindicate Free Exercise claims \nin areas of predominantly state jurisdiction. The legislation seeks to \nprotect religious activity even in the face of general legislative \nrules that make that worship difficult or impossible through \nunawareness, insensitivity, or hidden hostility\n  We believe we have constructed legislation that can merit the support \nof all who value the free exercise of religion, our first freedom. We \ncommend it to our colleagues in the Congress, and to all those who wish \nto keep the Framers' promise of religious freedom alive for all \nAmericans of all faiths.\n  Mr. President, I commend this important legislation to my colleagues \nfor their support. It is backed by an unprecedented coalition ranging \nfrom Focus on the Family, Family Research Council, and the Southern \nBaptist Convention to People for the American Way and the ACLU. I also \nask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and an explanatory \nsection by section analysis be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2148\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Religious Liberty Protection \n     Act of 1998''.\n\n[[Page S5792]]\n\n     SEC. 2. PROTECTION OF RELIGIOUS EXERCISE.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--Except as provided in subsection (b), a \n     government shall not substantially burden a person's \n     religious exercise--\n       (1) in a program or activity, operated by a government, \n     that receives Federal financial assistance; or\n       (2) in or affecting commerce with foreign nations, among \n     the several States, or with the Indian tribes;\n\n     even if the burden results from a rule of general \n     applicability.\n       (b) Exception.--A government may substantially burden a \n     person's religious exercise if the government demonstrates \n     that application of the burden to the person--\n       (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental \n     interest; and\n       (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that \n     compelling governmental interest.\n       (c) Funding Not Affected.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to authorize the United States to deny or withhold \n     Federal financial assistance as a remedy for a violation of \n     this Act.\n       (d) State Policy Not Commandeered.--A government may \n     eliminate the substantial burden on religious exercise by \n     changing the policy that results in the burden, by retaining \n     the policy and exempting the religious exercise from that \n     policy, or by any other means that eliminates the burden.\n       (e) Definitions.--As used in this section--\n       (1) the term ``government'' means a branch, department, \n     agency, instrumentality, subdivision, or official of a State \n     (or other person acting under color of State law);\n       (2) the term ``program or activity'' means a program or \n     activity as defined in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 606 of \n     the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d-4a); and\n       (3) the term ``demonstrates'' means meets the burdens of \n     going forward with the evidence and of persuasion.\n\n     SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT OF THE FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE.\n\n       (a) Procedure.--If a claimant produces prima facie evidence \n     to support a claim of a violation of the Free Exercise \n     Clause, the government shall bear the burden of persuasion on \n     all issues relating to the claim, except any issue as to the \n     existence of the burden on religious exercise.\n       (b) Land Use Regulation.--\n       (1) Limitation on land use regulation.--No government shall \n     impose a land use regulation that--\n       (A) substantially burdens religious exercise, unless the \n     burden is the least restrictive means to prevent substantial \n     and tangible harm to neighboring properties or to the public \n     health or safety;\n       (B) denies religious assemblies a reasonable location in \n     the jurisdiction; or\n       (C) excludes religious assemblies from areas in which \n     nonreligious assemblies are permitted.\n       (2) Full faith and credit.--Adjudication of a claim of a \n     violation of this subsection in a non-Federal forum shall be \n     entitled to full faith and credit in a Federal court only if \n     the claimant had a full and fair adjudication of that claim \n     in the non-Federal forum.\n       (3) Nonpreemption.--Nothing in this subsection shall \n     preempt State law that is equally or more protective of \n     religious exercise.\n       (4) Nonapplication of Other Portions of this Act.--Section \n     2 does not apply to land use regulation.\n\n     SEC. 4. JUDICIAL RELIEF.\n\n       (a) Cause of Action.--A person may assert a violation of \n     this Act as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and \n     obtain appropriate relief against a government. Standing to \n     assert a claim or defense under this section shall be \n     governed by the general rules of standing under article III \n     of the Constitution.\n       (b) Attorneys' Fees.--Section 722(b) of the Revised \n     Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1988(b)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``the Religious Liberty Protection Act of \n     1998,'' after ``Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993,''; \n     and\n       (2) by striking the comma that follows a comma.\n       (c) Prisoners.--Any litigation under this Act in which the \n     claimant is a prisoner shall be subject to the Prison \n     Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (including provisions of law \n     amended by that Act).\n       (d) Liability of Governments.--\n       (1) Liability of states.--A State shall not be immune under \n     the 11th amendment to the Constitution from a civil action, \n     for a violation of the Free Exercise Clause under section 3, \n     including a civil action for money damages.\n       (2) Liability of the united states.--The United States \n     shall not be immune from any civil action, for a violation of \n     the Free Exercise Clause under section 3, including a civil \n     action for money damages.\n\n     SEC. 5. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Religious Belief Unaffected.--Nothing in this Act shall \n     be construed to authorize any government to burden any \n     religious belief.\n       (b) Religious Exercise Not Regulated.--Nothing in this Act \n     shall create any basis for regulation of religious exercise \n     or for claims against a religious organization, including any \n     religiously affiliated school or university, not acting under \n     color of law.\n       (c) Claims to Funding Unaffected.--Nothing in this Act \n     shall create or preclude a right of any religious \n     organization to receive funding or other assistance from a \n     government, or of any person to receive government funding \n     for a religious activity, but this Act may require government \n     to incur expenses in its own operations to avoid imposing a \n     burden or a substantial burden on religious exercise.\n       (d) Other Authority To Impose Conditions on Funding \n     Unaffected.--Nothing in this Act shall--\n       (1) authorize a government to regulate or affect, directly \n     or indirectly, the activities or policies of a person other \n     than a government as a condition of receiving funding or \n     other assistance; or\n       (2) restrict any authority that may exist under other law \n     to so regulate or affect, except as provided in this Act.\n       (e) Effect on On Other Law.--Proof that a religious \n     exercise affects commerce for the purposes of this Act does \n     not give rise to any inference or presumption that the \n     religious exercise is subject to any other law regulating \n     commerce.\n       (f) Severability.--If any provision of this Act or of an \n     amendment made by this Act, or any application of such \n     provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be \n     unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act, the amendments \n     made by this Act, and the application of the provision to any \n     other person or circumstance shall not be affected.\n\n     SEC. 6. ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE UNAFFECTED.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect, \n     interpret, or in any way address that portion of the first \n     amendment to the Constitution prohibiting laws respecting an \n     establishment of religion (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Establishment Clause''). Granting government funding, \n     benefits, or exemptions, to the extent permissible under the \n     Establishment Clause, shall not constitute a violation of \n     this Act. As used in this section, the term ``granting'', \n     used with respect to government funding, benefits, or \n     exemptions, does not include the denial of government \n     funding, benefits, or exemptions.\n\n     SEC. 7. AMENDMENTS TO RELIGIOUS FREEDOM RESTORATION ACT.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--Section 5 of the Religious Freedom \n     Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb-2) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1), by striking ``a State, or subdivision \n     of a State'' and inserting ``a covered entity or a \n     subdivision of such an entity'';\n       (2) in paragraph (2), by striking ``term'' and all that \n     follows through ``includes'' and inserting ``term `covered \n     entity' means''; and\n       (3) in paragraph (4), by striking all after ``means,'' and \n     inserting ``an act or refusal to act that is substantially \n     motivated by a religious belief, whether or not the act or \n     refusal is compulsory or central to a larger system of \n     religious belief.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 6(a) of the Religious \n     Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb-3(a)) is \n     amended by striking ``and State''.\n\n     SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act--\n       (1) the term ``religious exercise'' means an act or refusal \n     to act that is substantially motivated by a religious belief, \n     whether or not the act or refusal is compulsory or central to \n     a larger system of religious belief;\n       (2) the term ``Free Exercise Clause'' means that portion of \n     the first amendment to the Constitution that proscribes laws \n     prohibiting the free exercise of religion and includes the \n     application of that proscription under the 14th amendment to \n     the Constitution; and\n       (3) except as otherwise provided in this Act, the term \n     ``government'' means a branch, department, agency, \n     instrumentality, subdivision, or official of a State, or \n     other person acting under color of State law, or a branch, \n     department, agency, instrumentality, subdivision, or official \n     of the United States, or other person acting under color of \n     Federal law.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n Religious Liberty Protection Act of 1998--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1. This section provides that the title of the Act \n     is the Religious Liberty Protection Act of 1998.\n       Section 2. Section 2(a) tracks the substantive language of \n     the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, providing that \n     government shall not substantially burden a person's \n     religious exercise, and applies that language to cases within \n     the spending power and the commerce power. Section 2(b) also \n     tracks RFRA. It states the compelling interest exception to \n     the general rule that government may not substantially burden \n     religious exercise.\n       Section 2(a)(1) specifies the spending power applications. \n     The bill applies to programs or activities operated by a \n     government and receiving federal financial assistance. \n     ``Government'' is defined in Sec. 2(e)(1) to include persons \n     acting under color of state law. In general, a private-sector \n     grantee acts under color of law only when the government \n     retains sufficient control that ``the alleged infringement of \n     federal rights [is] `fairly attributable to the State.' '' \n     Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830, 838 (1982). Private-\n     sector grantees not acting under color of law are excluded \n     from the bill for multiple reasons: because it is difficult \n     to foresee the consequences of applying the bill to such a \n     diverse range of organizations, because applying the bill to \n     religious organizations would create conflicting rights under \n     the same statute and might restrict religious liberty rather \n     than protect it, and because the free exercise of religion \n     has historically been protected primarily against government \n     action and this bill is not designed to change that.\n\n[[Page S5793]]\n\n       Section 2(a)(2) applies the bill to religious exercise in \n     or affecting commerce among the States, with foreign nations, \n     or with the Indian tribes. The language is unqualified and \n     exercises the full constitutional limit of the commerce \n     power, whatever that may be. The provision is tautologically \n     constitutional; to the extent that the commerce power does \n     not reach some religious activities, the bill does not reach \n     them either. To the extent that this leaves some religious \n     exercise outside the protections of the bill, that is an \n     unavoidable consequence of constitutional limitations on \n     Congressional authority.\n       Section 2(c) prevents any threat of withholding all federal \n     funds from a program or activity. The exclusive remedies are \n     set out in Sec. 4.\n       Section 2(d) emphasizes that this bill does not require \n     states to pursue any particular public policy or to abandon \n     any policy, but that each State is free to choose its own \n     means of eliminating substantial burdens on religious \n     exercise.\n       Section 2(e) contains definitions for purposes of Sec. 2.\n       The definition of ``government'' in Sec. 2(e)(1) tracks \n     RFRA, except that the United States and its agencies are \n     excluded. The United States remains subject to the \n     substantially identical provisions of RFRA and need not be \n     included here.\n       Section 2(e)(2) incorporates part of the definition of \n     ``program or activity'' from Title VI of the Civil Rights Act \n     of 1964--the part that describes programs and activities \n     operated by governments. This definition ensures that federal \n     regulation is confined to the program or activity that \n     receives federal aid, and does not extend to everything a \n     state does. The constitutionality of the Title VI definition \n     has not been seriously questioned.\n       The definition of ``demonstrates'' in Sec. 2(e)(3) is taken \n     verbatim from RFRA.\n       Section 3. This section enforces the Free Exercise Clause \n     as interpreted by the Supreme Court. Section 3(a) provides \n     generally that if a complaining party produces prima facie \n     evidence of a free exercise violation, the government then \n     bears the burden of persuasion on all issues except burden on \n     religious exercise.\n       This provision applies to any means of proving a free \n     exercise violation recognized under judicial interpretations. \n     See generally Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City \n     of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520 (1993); Employment Division v. \n     Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990). Thus, if the claimant shows a \n     burden on religious exercise and prima facie evidence of an \n     anti-religious motivation, government would bear the burden \n     of persuasion on the question of motivation. If the claimant \n     shows a burden on religious exercise and prima facie evidence \n     that the burdensome law is not generally applicable, \n     government would bear the burden of persuasion on the \n     question of general applicability. If the claimant shows a \n     burden on religion and prima facie evidence of a hybrid \n     right, government would bear the burden of persuasion on the \n     claim of hybrid right. In general, where there is a burden on \n     religious exercise and prima facie evidence of a \n     constitutional violation, the risk of nonpersuasion is to be \n     allocated in favor of protecting the constitutional right.\n       Section 3(b) provides prophylactic rules to prevent \n     violations of the Court's constitutional tests as applied to \n     land use regulation. Land use regulation is administered \n     through highly individualized processes, often without \n     generally applicable rules. These individualized processes \n     are conducive to discrimination that is difficult to prove in \n     any individual case, but there appears to be a pattern of \n     religious discrimination when large numbers of cases are \n     examined. Section 3(b)(1) provides that land use regulation \n     may not substantially burden religious exercise, except where \n     necessary to prevent substantial and tangible harm, that \n     jurisdictions may not deny religious assemblies a reasonable \n     location somewhere within each jurisdiction, and that \n     religious assemblies may not be excluded from areas where \n     nonreligious assemblies are permitted.\n       Subsection 3(b)(2) guarantees a full and fair adjudication \n     of land use claims under subsection (b). Procedural rules \n     before land use authorities may vary widely; any procedure \n     that permits full and fair adjudication of the federal claim \n     would be entitled to full faith and credit in federal court. \n     But if, for example, a zoning board with limited authority \n     refuses to consider the federal claim, does not provide \n     discovery, or refuses to permit introduction of evidence \n     reasonably necessary to resolution of the federal claim, \n     its determination would not be entitled to full faith and \n     credit in federal court. And if in such a case, a state \n     court confines the parties to the record from the zoning \n     board, so that the federal claim still can not be \n     effectively adjudicated, the state court decision would \n     not be entitled to full faith and credit either.\n       Subsection 3(b)(3) provides that equally or more protective \n     state law is not preempted. Subsection 3(b)(4) provides that \n     Sec. 2 shall not apply to land use cases. The more detailed \n     standards of Sec. 3(b) control over the more general language \n     of Sec. 2.\n       Section 4. This section provides remedies for violations. \n     Sections 4(a) and (b) track RFRA, creating a cause of action \n     for damages, injunction, and declaratory judgment, creating a \n     defense to liability, and providing for attorneys' fees.\n       Section 4(c) subjects prisoner claims to the Prison \n     Litigation Reform Act. This permits meritorious prisoner \n     claims to proceed while effectively discouraging frivolous \n     claims; prisoner claims generally dropped nearly a third in \n     one year after the Prison Litigation Reform Act. Crawford-El \n     v. Britton, 66 U.S.L.W. 4311, 4317 n.18 (May 4, 1998).\n       Section 4(d)(1) overrides the states' Eleventh Amendment \n     immunity in cases in which the claimant shows a violation of \n     the Free Exercise Clause, enforced under Sec. 3. Section \n     4(d)(2) waives the sovereign immunity of the United States in \n     the same cases. This override of state immunity and waiver of \n     federal immunity do not apply to statutory claims under \n     Sec. 2.\n       Section 5. This section states several rules of \n     construction designed to clarify the meaning of all the other \n     provisions. Section 5(a) tracks RFRA, providing that nothing \n     in the bill authorizes government to burden religious belief. \n     Section 5(b) provides that nothing in the bill creates any \n     basis for regulating or suing any religious organization not \n     acting under color of law. These two subsections serve the \n     bill's central purpose of protecting religious liberty, and \n     avoid any unintended consequence of reducing religious \n     liberty.\n       Sections 5(c) and 5(d) were carefully designed to keep this \n     bill neutral on all disputed questions about government \n     financial assistance to religious organizations and religious \n     activities. Section 5(c) states neutrality on whether such \n     assistance can or must be provided at all. Section 5(d) \n     states neutrality on the scope of existing authority to \n     regulate private entities as a condition of receiving such \n     aid. Section 5(d)(1) provides that nothing in the bill \n     authorizes additional regulation of such entities; \n     Sec. 5(d)(2), in an abundance of caution, provides that \n     existing regulatory authority is not restricted except as \n     provided in the bill. Agencies with authority to regulate the \n     receipt of federal funds retain such authority, but their \n     specific regulations may not substantially burden religious \n     exercise without compelling justification.\n       Section 5(e) provides that proof that a religious exercise \n     affects commerce for purposes of this bill does not give rise \n     to an inference or presumption that the religious exercise is \n     subject to any other statute regulating commerce. Different \n     statutes exercise the commerce power to different degrees, \n     and the courts presume that federal statutes do not regulate \n     religious organizations unless Congress manifested the intent \n     to do so. NLRB v. Catholic Bishop, 440 U.S. 490 (1990).\n       Section 5(f) states that each provision and application of \n     the bill shall be severable from every other provision and \n     application.\n       Section 6. This section is taken verbatim from RFRA. It is \n     language designed to state neutrality on all disputed issues \n     under the Establishment Clause.\n       Section 7. This section amends RFRA to delete any \n     application to the states and to leave RFRA applicable only \n     to the federal government. Section 7(a)(3) amends the \n     definition of ``religious exercise'' in RFRA to clarify that \n     religious exercise need not be compulsory or central to a \n     larger system of religious belief.\n       Section 8. This section defines important terms used \n     throughout the Act.\n       Section 8(1) defines ``religious exercise'' to clarify two \n     issues that had divided courts under RFRA: religious exercise \n     need not be compulsory or central to a larger system of \n     religious belief.\n       Section 8(2) defines ``Free Exercise Clause'' to include \n     the First Amendment clause, which binds the United States, \n     and also the incorporation of that clause into the Fourteenth \n     Amendment, which binds the States.\n       Section 8(3) defines ``government'' to include both state \n     and federal entities and persons acting under color of either \n     state or federal law. This tracks the RFRA definition. The \n     free exercise enforcement provisions of Sec. 3 and the \n     remedies provisions of Sec. 4 supplement RFRA, and these \n     provisions are subject to the rules of construction in \n     Sec. 5; each of these sections applies to both state and \n     federal governments. This definition does not apply in \n     Sec. 2, which has its own definition that reaches only state \n     entities and persons acting under color of state law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 2149. A bill to transfer certain public lands in northeastern \nNevada; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n           the northeastern nevada public lands transfer act\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to introduce The Northeastern \nNevada Public Lands Transfer. This Act provides for the transfer of \nFederal land to the Cities of Wendover, Carlin, and Wells and the Town \nof Jackpot, all in Elko County, Nevada.\n  Mr. President, the rural communities in northeastern Nevada, are \ngrowing. For example, in 1997, the City of West Wendover was certified \nas Nevada's fastest growing city. These communities are surrounded by \nFederal lands, with every little private land available for expansion \nand growth. In addition, because over 71 percent of the land in Elko \nCounty is in Federal ownership, these local governments do not have the \nresources to just go out and buy more land.\n\n[[Page S5794]]\n\n  Mr. President, the property being conveyed in this Act has been \ndetermined to be important to the industrial, commercial, residential, \ninfrastructure, and recreational needs of the citizens of Elko County. \nConveying these lands in one transaction provides the county certainty \nabout its future, which will allow it to diversify its economy and \ndevelop these properties in a planned and orderly manner.\n  Mr. President, Elko County has valid concerns about its future. The \ngaming and tourism industry is the primary employer, and every \nindication is that it will remain healthy. However, an economy, based \non a single industry, bears an inherent risk of failure.\n  Mr. President, the City of West Wendover, in conjunction with the \nNorth Eastern Development Authority, has recently completed a \ncountywide Economic Development Plan, which emphasizes the importance \nof economic diversification as its primary goal. This plan promotes \nquality development which enhances the quality of life for Elko County \nresidents. West Wendover, Nevada has currently spent $100,000 for the \nEnvironmental Assessment and the Baseline Assessment, an Air Force \nprerequisite for land conveyance. In addition, the West Wendover City \nCouncil and the Nevada Rural Development Authority have indicated that \nthey are committed to working together to ensure that economic \ndevelopment in the area is accomplished through a logical, well \nconsidered development plan.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the Northeastern \nNevada Public Lands Transfer Act to be printed in the Record.\n\n                                S. 2149\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Northeastern Nevada Public \n     Lands Transfer Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National Bone \nMarrow Registry Reauthorization Act of 1998. Transplantation of bone \nmarrow is a procedure that offers hope to patients and their families \nand has saved the lives of many patients with leukemia and other life \nthreatening conditions. As a physician, I know first-hand the heartache \nof waiting for a donor, and how the gift of bone marrow can change a \npatient's life. Of patients needing bone marrow transplants, 70% do not \nhave a family member with matching bone marrow. These patients must \nrely on an unrelated donor. The National Marrow Donor Registry helps \npatients needing a bone marrow transplant find that unrelated donor \nwith matching bone marrow.\n  Since its inception in 1987, the National Marrow Donor Program has \ngrown to include more than 3 million volunteers willing to donate bone \nmarrow to an unrelated patient. The program has facilitated over 6,500 \nmarrow transplants around the world. The annual number of transplants \nrose from 840 in 1994 to over 1,280 in 1997.\n  This bill is companion legislation to H.R. 2202, introduced by \nCongressman Bill Young which has 218 co-sponsors. Congressman Bill \nYoung helped found the National Marrow Donor Program and has long been \na champion of bone marrow transplantation. The companion House bill was \nunanimously voice voted out of the House Commerce Committee on May 14 \nand was unanimously passed by the House of Representatives on May 19, \n1998. This kind of bipartisan\n\n[[Page S5795]]\n\nsupport stems from the enormous need for this program. In this short \nlegislative year, it is a must-pass bill.\n  The statutory authority for the legislation expired in 1994. An Act \nreauthorizing both the solid organ and bone marrow programs passed the \nSenate in 1996, but failed to pass the House.\n  This bill is the result of a collaborative effort by the House and \nSenate to reauthorize the National Bone Marrow Registry. In April, \nduring National Organ and Tissue Donor Awareness Week, the Senate Labor \nSubcommittee on Public Health and Safety and the House Commerce \nSubcommittee on Health and Environment held a joint hearing on \nincreasing bone marrow donation and transplantation. During the \nhearing, we heard from patients and their families, including testimony \nfrom Robert Wedge, a young man who continues to wait for a matching \ndonor to be found. Robert's brother, Cornell, is a member of my staff. \nOur office has partnered with his loving family and the Congressional \nBlack Caucus to hold a bone marrow drive here in Congress. We also \nheard from a father whose son's life was saved by a bone marrow \ntransplant. We heard from professionals involved in the operation of \nthe program, and the message throughout the hearing was consistent. The \nneed for bone marrow donation is urgent, and we must continue to \naddress the unique issues surrounding recruitment and transplantation \nof bone marrow among minorities.\n  The National Bone Marrow Registry clearly helps save lives. However, \nthere is room for improvement in recruitment of donors and in the \nservices provided to patients needing transplant.\n  Racial and ethnic minority populations are underrepresented in the \nRegistry. The registry is working to increase the number of racial and \nethnic minority donors. Today, the Registry includes more than 700,000 \nminority volunteers, a growth of almost 150%. However, more potential \ndonors are needed before the probability of a match for a minority \npatient is comparable to that of a patient who is not a minority. This \nbill addresses the need for increasing the number and availability of \nminority donors. By directing special attention to informational and \neducational activities to recruit minority donors, including African \nAmericans, Hispanics, Asians, Native Americans, and those of mixed \nracial heritage, the registry will increase the number of potential \ndonors and help save lives.\n  To help patients and their families with the search for a bone marrow \ndonor, the bill also establishes an Office of Patient Advocacy. The \noffice will provide information to patients about the search process, \nthe costs of the transplants, and patient outcomes at different \ntransplant centers, and will also help resolve difficulties with the \ntransplant process.\n  To facilitate donation, the bill will provide services for those \nvolunteering as potential donors. Activities will help keep the \nregistry of donors up-to-date, and case-management services will be \nprovided to those donors who may be suitably matched to a patient \nneeding bone marrow.\n  Bone marrow transplantation is a proven life-saving procedure. In \nrecent years, the same type of blood cells used in transplants have \nbeen found in the umbilical cord after a baby is delivered. Using cells \nfrom umbilical cords may provide an alternative source of cells, but \nmany questions, including those of ethics and safety, need to be \nanswered. In 1996, the National Institutes of Health began a five-year, \nmulti-center study to see if the use of umbilical cord blood cells is a \nsafe and effective alternative to bone marrow transplantation for \nchildren and adults with a variety of cancers, blood diseases, and \ngenetic disorders. The ongoing study includes a review of the data \nthroughout the investigation.\n  The current bill does not include the use of umbilical cord blood \ncells, but the report language for the House bill includes a request \nthat the Secretary of Health and Human Services keep the appropriate \nCongressional Subcommittees informed of advances in knowledge about the \nuses of blood cells from umbilical cords. If the study addresses the \nconcerns about the use of blood cells from umbilical cords, we can then \nproceed to address possible expansion of the Registry to include this \nsource of blood cells.\n  The bill also proposes a significant increase in funds to carry out \nthe activities for recruitment and retention of potential donors, and \nfor the patients needing transplants and their families. As I noted \nearlier, the current authorization expired in 1994. The bill proposes \nauthorization of the program at $18 million (an increase from $15.27 \nmillion appropriated in fiscal year 1998).\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation today and \nencourage my fellow Senators to support this life-saving program. I \nhope my colleagues will pass this legislation quickly, so that we can \nsend it to the President for signature this year. I also want to note \nthat this bill has unanimous support from the National Institutes of \nHealth, the Health Resources Services Administration, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, the National Marrow Donor Program, the Red Cross, and \nthe American Association of Blood Banks. Others have voiced their \nsupport as well, and this simply underscores the importance of this \nprogram, and this legislation. Thank you, Mr. President, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2150\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act takes effect October 1, 1998, or upon the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, whichever occurs later.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Frist \non this important legislation, which is strongly supported by the \nClinton Administration, patient groups, and the American Association of \nBlood Banks.\n  The National Marrow Donor Program was established in 1986 to meet the \nneed for a single large, nationwide registry of bone marrow donors. For \nthose facing the diagnosis of leukemia or other life-threatening \ndiseases, the registry can literally save their lives.\n  Of particular importance is the need for identifying potential donors \nfor African Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, and Native \nAmericans, since each individual's likelihood of finding a matching \ndonor, apart from family members, is higher in the individual's racial \nor ethnic group. By cooperation with international registries and \ntargeted campaigns to increase the representation of minorities, the \nNMDP has made remarkable progress in improving the likelihood that \npatients of every racial and ethnic group can find suitable donors.\n  Through skillful work and commitment, the NMDP has grown rapidly in \nrecent years. It now maintains a registry of over three million \nvolunteer bone marrow donors. The very important work of the registry \nmust be continued. Its success in identifying matching donors and \nrecipients is bringing the miracle of better health to families across \nthe country. Congress has a responsibility to support this critical \nwork.\n  In fact, this reauthorization is long overdue, and I hope that \nCongress will act expeditiously so that the National Marrow Donor \nProgram can continue its life-saving work.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Coats, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n        Helms, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Grams, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Bond, Mr. \n        Enzi, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. Coverdell):\n  S. 2151. A bill to clarify Federal law to prohibit the dispensing or \ndistribution of a controlled substance for the purpose of causing, or \nassisting in causing, the suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing of any \nindividual; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                Lethal Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, today I rise, along with Senators Lott, \nCoats, Inhofe, Helms, Murkowski, Grams of Minnesota, Faircloth, Bond, \nEnzi, Sessions, Hagel, and Coverdell to introduce the Lethal Drug Abuse \nPrevention Act of 1998. This legislation will clarify that physicians \nentrusted by the federal government with the authority to prescribe and \ndispense controlled substances may not abuse that authority by using \nthem in assisted suicides. It also strongly reaffirms that physicians \nshould use federally controlled substances for the legitimate medical \npurpose of relieving pain and discomfort.\n  Last year, Congress passed the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction \nAct of 1997 without a dissenting vote in the Senate and by an \noverwhelming margin of 398-16 in the House. The President signed the \nbill, saying it ``will allow the Federal Government to speak with a \nclear voice in opposing these practices,'' and warning that ``to \nendorse assisted suicide would set us on a disturbing and perhaps \ndangerous path.''\n  The distribution of narcotics and other dangerous drugs is prohibited \nby federal law under the Controlled Substances Act. Under this law \nphysicians may get a special federal license from the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration (DEA), called a DEA registration, that allows them to \nprescribe these federally controlled drugs for ``legitimate medical \npurposes.'' This was confirmed last November in a letter by Thomas \nConstantine, Administrator of the DEA, who concluded that ``delivering, \ndispensing or prescribing a controlled substance with the intent of \nassisting a suicide would not be under any current definition a \nlegitimate medical purpose.''\n  It is important to understand that while physicians receive their \nlicense to practice medicine from state medical boards, they receive \nthis separate DEA registration to prescribe controlled substances from \nthe federal DEA. Each time a doctor orders a controlled substance they \nmust fill our a form in triplicate and one copy goes to the DEA. \nPhysicians must be prepared to explain to DEA officials their use of \nthese drugs, and they lose their registration and even risk criminal \npenalties if they prescribe such drugs for any reason but ``Legitimate \nmedical purposes.''\n  On June 5, Attorney General Janet Reno issued a decision which \noverturned the DEA ruling. According to the Attorney General, the \nControlled Substances Act does not restrict the use of federally \ncontrolled dangerous drugs for the purpose of assisted suicide. It is \nfor this reason I am introducing this legislation.\n  I have long been a strong advocate of states' rights and the limited \nrole of the federal government, so let me make clear what this \nlegislation does. It simply clarifies that the dispensing of controlled \nsubstances for the purpose of assisted suicide is prohibited under \nlongstanding federal law, the Controlled Substance Act.\n  This is not the first time the federal government has acted to ensure \nthat federally regulated drugs are not used for purposes that violate \nfederal law. The current Administration is committed to enforcing \nfederal prohibitions on the use of marijuana, despite state referenda \nthat seeks to legitimize such use for what some see as medicinal use. \nBy the same token, one state's referendum rescinding local criminal \npenalties for assisting a suicide does not magically transform a lethal \nact into a legitimate medical practice within the meaning of federal \nlaw.\n\n[[Page S5798]]\n\n  Congress cannot remain silent now. Congress acted with one voice to \nensure that no federal program, facility or employee is involved in \nassisted suicide. Enactment of the Lethal Drug Abuse Prevention Act of \n1998 will ensure that federal authorization to prescribe DEA-regulated \ndrugs does not include the authority to prescribe such drugs to cause a \npatient's death.\n  I urge my colleagues to support and swiftly enact this urgently \nneeded legislation.\n  Mr President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows\n\n                                S. 2151\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lethal Drug Abuse Prevention \n     Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the use of certain narcotics and other dangerous drugs \n     is generally prohibited under the Controlled Substances Act;\n       (2) under the Controlled Substances Act and implementing \n     regulations, an exception to this general prohibition permits \n     the dispensing and distribution of certain controlled \n     substances by properly registered physicians for legitimate \n     medical purposes;\n       (3) the dispensing or distribution of controlled substances \n     to assist suicide is not a legitimate medical purpose and \n     should not be construed to be permissible under the \n     Controlled Substances Act;\n       (4) the dispensing or distribution of certain controlled \n     substances for the purpose of relieving pain and discomfort \n     is a legitimate medical purpose under the Controlled \n     Substances Act and physicians should not hesitate to dispense \n     or distribute them for that purpose when medically indicated; \n     and\n       (5) for the reasons set forth in section 101 of the \n     Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801), the dispensing and \n     distribution of controlled substances for any purpose, \n     including that of assisting suicide, affects interstate \n     commerce.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide explicitly that Federal law is not intended \n     to license the dispensing or distribution of a controlled \n     substance with a purpose of causing, or assisting in causing, \n     the suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing of any individual; \n     and\n       (2) to encourage physicians to prescribe controlled \n     substances as medically appropriate in order to relieve pain \n     and discomfort, by reducing unwarranted concerns that their \n     registration to prescribe controlled substances will thereby \n     be put at risk, if there is no intent to cause a patient's \n     death.\n\n     SEC. 3. LETHAL DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION.\n\n       (a) Denial of Registration.--Section 303 of the Controlled \n     Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 823) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``(i) Denial of Registration.--The Attorney General shall \n     determine that registration of an applicant under this \n     section is inconsistent with the public interest if--\n       ``(1) during the 5-year period immediately preceding the \n     date on which the application is submitted under this \n     section, the registration of the applicant under this section \n     was revoked under section 304(a)(4); or\n       ``(2) the Attorney General determines, based on clear and \n     convincing evidence, that the applicant is applying for the \n     registration with the intention of using the registration to \n     take any action that would constitute a violation of section \n     304(a)(4).''.\n       (b) Suspension or Revocation of Registration.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 304(a) of the Controlled \n     Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 824(a)) is amended--\n       (A) by redesignating paragraphs (4) and (5) as paragraphs \n     (5) and (6), respectively; and\n       (B) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following:\n       ``(4) has intentionally dispensed or distributed a \n     controlled substance with a purpose of causing, or assisting \n     in causing, the suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing of any \n     individual, except that this paragraph does not apply to the \n     dispensing or distribution of a controlled substance for the \n     purpose of relieving pain or discomfort (even if the use of \n     the controlled substance may increase the risk of death), so \n     long as the controlled substance is not also dispensed or \n     distributed for the purpose of causing, or assisting in \n     causing, the death of an individual for any reason;''.\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--Section 304(a)(5) of the \n     Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 824(a)(5)) (as \n     redesignated by paragraph (1) of this subsection) is amended \n     by inserting ``other'' after ``such''.\n       (c) Pain Relief.--Section 304(c) of the Controlled \n     Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 824(c)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(c) Before'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(c) Procedures.--\n       ``(1) Order to show cause.--After any hearing under \n     paragraph (2), and before''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Medical review board on pain relief.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Attorney General shall by regulation \n     establish a board to be known as the Medical Review Board on \n     Pain Relief (referred to in this subsection as the `Board').\n       ``(B) Membership.--The Attorney General shall appoint the \n     members of the Board--\n       ``(i) from among individuals who, by reason of specialized \n     education or substantial relevant experience in pain \n     management, are clinical experts with knowledge regarding \n     standards, practices, and guidelines concerning pain relief; \n     and\n       ``(ii) after consultation with the American Medical \n     Association, the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative \n     Medicine, the National Hospice Organization, the American \n     Geriatrics Society, and such other entities with relevant \n     expertise concerning pain relief, as the Attorney General \n     determines to be appropriate.\n       ``(C) Duties of board.--\n       ``(i) Hearing.--If an applicant or registrant claims that \n     any action (or, in the case of a proposed denial under \n     section 303(i)(2), any potential action) that is a basis of a \n     proposed denial under section 303(i), or a proposed \n     revocation or suspension under subsection (a)(4) of this \n     section, is an appropriate means to relieve pain that does \n     not constitute a violation of subsection (a)(4) of this \n     section, the applicant or registrant may seek a hearing \n     before the Board on that issue.\n       ``(ii) Findings.--Based on a hearing under clause (i), the \n     Board shall make findings regarding whether the action at \n     issue is an appropriate means to relieve pain that does not \n     constitute a violation of subsection (a)(4).

manufacturers with low base \n     incidence percentages.--With respect to a manufacturer which \n     begins to manufacture a tobacco product after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act or a manufacturer for which the \n     baseline level as measured by the annual performance survey \n     is equal to or less than the de minimis level described in \n     paragraph (4), the base incidence percentage is the de \n     minimis level, and the required percentage reduction in \n     underage use for a type of tobacco product with respect to a \n     manufacturer for a year shall be deemed to be the number of \n     percentage points necessary to reduce the actual percent \n     prevalence of young individuals identifying a brand of such \n     tobacco product of such manufacturer as the usual brand \n     smoked or used for such year to the de minimis level.\n       (6) Surcharge amount.--\n       (A) In general.--If the Secretary determines that the \n     required percentage reduction in use of a type of tobacco \n     product has not been achieved by such manufacturer for a \n     year, the Secretary shall impose a surcharge on such \n     manufacturer under this paragraph.\n       (B) Amount.--The amount of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge for a type of tobacco product for a year under this \n     paragraph is $1,000, multiplied by the number of young \n     individuals for which such firm is in noncompliance with \n     respect to its target reduction level.\n       (C) Determination of number of young individuals.--For \n     purposes of subparagraph (B) the number of young individuals \n     for which a manufacturer is in noncompliance for a year shall \n     be determined by the Secretary from the annual performance \n     survey and shall be calculated based on the estimated total \n     number of young individuals in such year and the actual \n     percentage prevalence of young individuals identifying a \n     brand of such tobacco product of such manufacturer as the \n     usual brand smoked or used in such year as compared to such \n     manufacturer's target reduction level for the year.\n       (7) De minimis rule.--The Secretary may not impose a \n     surcharge on a manufacturer for a type of tobacco product for \n     a year if the Secretary determines that actual percent \n     prevalence of young individuals identifying that \n     manufacturer's brands of such tobacco product as the usual \n     products smoked or used for such year is less than 1 percent.\n       (g) Surcharges To Be Adjusted for Inflation.--\n       (1) In general.--Beginning with the fourth calendar year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, each dollar amount \n     in the tables in subsections (e)(2), (e)(3), and (f)(6)(B) \n     shall be increased by the inflation adjustment.\n       (2) Inflation adjustment.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     the inflation adjustment for any calendar year is the \n     percentage (if any) by which--\n       (A) the CPI for the preceding calendar year, exceeds\n       (B) the CPI for the calendar year 1998.\n       (3) CPI.--For purposes of paragraph (2), the CPI for any \n     calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for \n     all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.\n       (4) Rounding.--If any increase determined under paragraph \n     (1) is not a multiple of $1,000, the increase shall be \n     rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.\n       (h) Method of Surcharge Assessment.--The Secretary shall \n     assess a surcharge for a specific calendar year on or before \n     May 1 of the subsequent calendar year. Surcharge payments \n     shall be paid on or before July 1 of the year in which they \n     are assessed. The Secretary may establish, by regulation, \n     interest at a rate up to 3 times the prevailing prime rate at \n     the time the surcharge is assessed, and additional charges in \n     an amount up to 3 times the surcharge, for late payment of \n     the surcharge.\n       (i) Business Expense Deduction.--Any surcharge paid by a \n     tobacco product manufacturer under this section shall not be \n     deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense or \n     otherwise under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (j) Appeal Rights.--The amount of any surcharge is \n     committed to the sound discretion of the Secretary and shall \n     be subject to judicial review by the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, based on the \n     arbitrary and capricious standard of section 706(2)(A) of \n     title 5, United States Code. Notwithstanding any other \n     provisions of law, no court shall have authority to stay any \n     surcharge payments due the Secretary under this Act pending \n     judicial review.\n       (k) Responsibility for Agents.--In any action brought under \n     this subsection, a tobacco product manufacturer shall be held \n     responsible for any act or omission of its attorneys, \n     advertising agencies, or other agents that contributed to \n     that manufacturer's responsibility for the surcharge assessed \n     under this section.\n\n     SEC. 205.

manufacturers with low base \n     incidence percentages.--With respect to a manufacturer which \n     begins to manufacture a tobacco product after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act or a manufacturer for which the \n     baseline level as measured by the annual performance survey \n     is equal to or less than the de minimis level described in \n     paragraph (4), the base incidence percentage is the de \n     minimis level, and the required percentage reduction in \n     underage use for a type of tobacco product with respect to a \n     manufacturer for a year shall be deemed to be the number of \n     percentage points necessary to reduce the actual percent \n     prevalence of young individuals identifying a brand of such \n     tobacco product of such manufacturer as the usual brand \n     smoked or used for such year to the de minimis level.\n       (6) Surcharge amount.--\n       (A) In general.--If the Secretary determines that the \n     required percentage reduction in use of a type of tobacco \n     product has not been achieved by such manufacturer for a \n     year, the Secretary shall impose a surcharge on such \n     manufacturer under this paragraph.\n       (B) Amount.--The amount of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge for a type of tobacco product for a year under this \n     paragraph is $1,000, multiplied by the number of young \n     individuals for which such firm is in noncompliance with \n     respect to its target reduction level.\n       (C) Determination of number of young individuals.--For \n     purposes of subparagraph (B) the number of young individuals \n     for which a manufacturer is in noncompliance for a year shall \n     be determined by the Secretary from the annual performance \n     survey and shall be calculated based on the estimated total \n     number of young individuals in such year and the actual \n     percentage prevalence of young individuals identifying a \n     brand of such tobacco product of such manufacturer as the \n     usual brand smoked or used in such year as compared to such \n     manufacturer's target reduction level for the year.\n       (7) De minimis rule.--The Secretary may not impose a \n     surcharge on a manufacturer for a type of tobacco product for \n     a year if the Secretary determines that actual percent \n     prevalence of young individuals identifying that \n     manufacturer's brands of such tobacco product as the usual \n     products smoked or used for such year is less than 1 percent.\n       (g) Surcharges To Be Adjusted for Inflation.--\n       (1) In general.--Beginning with the fourth calendar year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, each dollar amount \n     in the tables in subsections (e)(2), (e)(3), and (f)(6)(B) \n     shall be increased by the inflation adjustment.\n       (2) Inflation adjustment.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     the inflation adjustment for any calendar year is the \n     percentage (if any) by which--\n       (A) the CPI for the preceding calendar year, exceeds\n       (B) the CPI for the calendar year 1998.\n       (3) CPI.--For purposes of paragraph (2), the CPI for any \n     calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for \n     all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.\n       (4) Rounding.--If any increase determined under paragraph \n     (1) is not a multiple of $1,000, the increase shall be \n     rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.\n       (h) Method of Surcharge Assessment.--The Secretary shall \n     assess a surcharge for a specific calendar year on or before \n     May 1 of the subsequent calendar year. Surcharge payments \n     shall be paid on or before July 1 of the year in which they \n     are assessed. The Secretary may establish, by regulation, \n     interest at a rate up to 3 times the prevailing prime rate at \n     the time the surcharge is assessed, and additional charges in \n     an amount up to 3 times the surcharge, for late payment of \n     the surcharge.\n       (i) Business Expense Deduction.--Any surcharge paid by a \n     tobacco product manufacturer under this section shall not be \n     deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense or \n     otherwise under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (j) Appeal Rights.--The amount of any surcharge is \n     committed to the sound discretion of the Secretary and shall \n     be subject to judicial review by the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, based on the \n     arbitrary and capricious standard of section 706(2)(A) of \n     title 5, United States Code. Notwithstanding any other \n     provisions of law, no court shall have authority to stay any \n     surcharge payments due the Secretary under this Act pending \n     judicial review.\n       (k) Responsibility for Agents.--In any action brought under \n     this subsection, a tobacco product manufacturer shall be held \n     responsible for any act or omission of its attorneys, \n     advertising agencies, or other agents that contributed to \n     that manufacturer's responsibility for the surcharge assessed \n     under this section.\n\n     SEC. 205.

CONSTRUCTION OF CURRENT REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The final regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary in the August 28, 1996, issue of the Federal \n     Register (62 Red. Reg. 44615-44618) and codified at part 897 \n     of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are hereby deemed \n     to be lawful and to have been lawfully promulgated by the \n     Secretary under chapter IX and section 701 of the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by this Act, and not \n     under chapter V of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. \n     The provisions of part 897 that are not in effect on the date \n     of enactment of this Act shall take effect as in such part or \n     upon such later date as determined by the Secretary by order. \n     The Secretary shall amend the designation of authority in \n     such regulations in accordance with this subsection.\n       (b) Limitation on Advisory Opinions.--As of the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the following documents issued by the \n     Food and Drug Administration shall not constitute advisory \n     opinions under section 10.85(d)(1) of title 21, Code of \n     Federal Regulations, except as they apply to tobacco \n     products, and shall not be cited by the Secretary or the Food \n     and Drug Administration as binding precedent.\n       (1) The preamble to the proposed rule in the document \n     entitled ``Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution \n     of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco Products to Protect \n     Children and Adolescents'' (60 Fed. Reg. 41314-41372 (August \n     11, 1995)).\n       (2) The document entitled ``Nicotine in Cigarettes and \n     Smokeless Tobacco Products is a Drug and These Products Are \n     Nicotine Delivery Devices Under the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act;; (60 Fed. Reg. 41453-41787 (August 11, 1995)).\n       (3) The preamble to the final rule in the document entitled \n     ``Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of \n     Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect Children and \n     Adolescents'' (61 Fed. Reg. 44396-44615 (August 28, 1996)).\n       (4) The document entitled ``Nicotine in Cigarettes and \n     Smokeless Tobacco is a Drug and These Products are Nicotine \n     Delivery Devices Under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic \n     Act; Jurisdictional Determination;; (61 Fed. Reg. 44619-45318 \n     (August 28, 1996)).\n\n              TITLE II--REDUCTIONS IN UNDERAGE TOBACCO USE\n\n                        Subtitle A--Underage Use\n\n     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Reductions in the underage use of tobacco products are \n     critically important to the public health.\n       (2) Achieving this critical public health goal can be \n     substantially furthered by increasing the price of tobacco \n     products to discourage underage use if reduction targets are \n     not achieved and by creating financial incentives for \n     manufacturers to discourage youth from using their tobacco \n     products.\n       (3) When reduction targets in underage use are not achieved \n     on an industry-wide basis, the price increases that will \n     result from an industry-wide assessment will provide an \n     additional deterrence to youth tobacco use.\n       (4) Manufacturer-specific incentives that will be imposed \n     if reduction targets are not met by a manufacturer provide a \n     strong incentive for each manufacturer to make all efforts to \n     discourage youth use of its brands and ensure the \n     effectiveness of the industry-wide assessments.\n\n     SEC. 202. PURPOSE.\n\n       This title is intended to ensure that, in the event that \n     other measures contained in this Act prove to be inadequate \n     to produce substantial reductions in tobacco use by minors, \n     tobacco companies will pay additional assessments. These \n     additional assessments are designed to lower youth tobacco \n     consumption in a variety of ways: by triggering further \n     increases in the price of tobacco products, by encouraging \n     tobacco companies to work to meet statutory targets for \n     reductions in youth tobacco consumption, and providing \n     support for further reduction efforts.\n\n     SEC. 203.

The \n     determination shall be based on the annual percent prevalence \n     of the use of tobacco products, for the industry as a whole \n     and of particular manufacturers, by young individuals (as \n     determined by the surveys conducted by the Secretary) for the \n     year involved as compared to the base incidence percentages.\n       (c) Confidentiality of Data.--The Secretary may conduct a \n     survey relating to tobacco use involving minors. If the \n     information collected in the course of conducting the annual \n     performance survey results in the individual supplying the \n     information or described in it to be identifiable, the \n     information may not be used for any purpose other than the \n     purpose for which it was supplied unless that individual (or \n     that individual's guardian) consents to its use for such \n     other purpose. The information may not be published or \n     released in any other form if the individual supplying the \n     information or described in it is identifiable unless that \n     individual (or that

manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use of a type of \n     tobacco product of a manufacturer) from the annual \n     performance survey.\n       (2) Criteria for deeming point estimates correct.--Point \n     estimates under paragraph (1)(E) are deemed conclusively to \n     be correct and accurate for calculating actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of tobacco product of a particular manufacturer) \n     for the purpose of measuring compliance with percent \n     reduction targets and calculating surcharges provided that \n     the precision of estimates (based on sampling error) of the \n     percentage of young individuals reporting use of a type of \n     tobacco product (or, in the case of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge, the use of a type of tobacco product of a \n     manufacturer) is such that the 95-percent confidence interval \n     around such point estimates is no more than plus or minus 1 \n     percent.\n       (3) Survey deemed correct, proper, and accurate.--A survey \n     using the methodology required by this subsection is deemed \n     conclusively to be proper, correct, and accurate for purposes \n     of this Act.\n       (4) Secretary may adopt different methodology.--The \n     Secretary by notice and comment rulemaking may adopt a survey \n     methodology that is different than the methodology described \n     in paragraph (1) if the different methodology is at least as \n     statistically precise as that methodology.\n       (e) Industry-wide Non-attainment Surcharges.--\n       (1) Secretary to determine industry-wide non-attainment \n     percentage.--The Secretary

among manufacturers.--A tobacco \n     product manufacturer shall be liable under this subsection to \n     one or more other manufacturers if the plaintiff tobacco \n     product manufacturer establishes by a preponderance of the \n     evidence that the defendant tobacco product manufacturer, \n     through its acts or omissions, was responsible for a \n     disproportionate share of the non-attainment surcharge as \n     compared to the responsibility of the plaintiff manufacturer.\n       (6) Exemptions for small manufacturers.--\n       (A) Allocation by market share.--The Secretary shall make \n     such allocations according to each manufacturer's share of \n     the domestic cigarette or domestic smokeless tobacco market, \n     as appropriate, in the year for which the surcharge is being \n     assessed, based on actual Federal excise tax payments.\n       (B) Exemption.--In any year in which a surcharge is being \n     assessed, the Secretary shall exempt from payment any tobacco \n     product manufacturer with less than 1 percent of the domestic \n     market share for a specific category of tobacco product \n     unless the Secretary finds that the manufacturer's products \n     are used by underage individuals at a rate equal to or \n     greater than the manufacturer's total market share for the \n     type of tobacco product.\n       (f) Manufacturer-specific Surcharges.--\n       (1) Required percentage reductions.--Each manufacturer \n     which manufactured a brand or brands of tobacco product on or \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act shall reduce the \n     percentage of young individuals who use such manufacturer's \n     brand or brands as their usual brand in accordance with the \n     required percentage reductions described under subsections \n     (b) (with respect to cigarettes) and (c) (with respect to \n     smokeless tobacco).\n       (2) Application to less popular brands.--Each manufacturer \n     which manufactured a brand or brands of tobacco product on or \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act for which the \n     base incidence percentage is equal to or less than the de \n     minimis level shall ensure that the percent prevalence of \n     young individuals who use the manufacturer's tobacco products \n     as their usual brand remains equal to or less than the de \n     minimis level described in paragraph (4).\n       (3) New entrants.--Each manufacturer of a tobacco product \n     which begins to manufacture a tobacco product after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act shall ensure that the percent \n     prevalence of young individuals who use the manufacturer's \n     tobacco products as their usual brand is equal to or less \n     than the de minimis level.\n       (4) De minimis level defined.--The de minimis level is \n     equal to 1 percent prevalence of the use of each \n     manufacturer's brands of tobacco product by young individuals \n     (as determined on the basis of the annual performance survey \n     conducted by the Secretary) for a year.\n       (5) Target reduction levels.--\n       (A) Existing manufacturers.-- For purposes of this section, \n     the target reduction level for each type of tobacco product \n     for a year for a manufacturer is the product of the required \n     percentage reduction for a type of tobacco product for a year \n     and the manufacturers base incidence percentage for such \n     tobacco product.\n       (B) New manufacturers; manufacturers with low base \n     incidence percentages.--With respect to a manufacturer which \n     begins to manufacture a tobacco product after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act or a manufacturer for which the \n     baseline level as measured by the annual performance survey \n     is equal to or less than the de minimis level described in \n     paragraph (4), the base incidence percentage is the de \n     minimis level, and the required percentage reduction in \n     underage use for a type of tobacco product with respect to a \n     manufacturer for a year shall be deemed to be the number of \n     percentage points necessary to reduce the actual percent \n     prevalence of young individuals identifying a brand of such \n     tobacco product of such manufacturer as the usual brand \n     smoked or used for such year to the de minimis level.\n       (6) Surcharge amount.--\n\n[[Page S5828]]\n\n       (A) In general.--If the Secretary determines that the \n     required percentage reduction in use of a type of tobacco \n     product has not been achieved by such manufacturer for a \n     year, the Secretary shall impose a surcharge on such \n     manufacturer under this paragraph.\n       (B) Amount.--The amount of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge for a type of tobacco product for a year under this \n     paragraph is $1,000, multiplied by the number of young \n     individuals for which such firm is in noncompliance with \n     respect to its target reduction level.\n       (C) Determination of number of young individuals.--For \n     purposes of subparagraph (B) the number of young individuals \n     for which a manufacturer is in noncompliance for a year shall \n     be determined by the Secretary from the annual performance \n     survey and shall be calculated based on the estimated total \n     number of young individuals in such year and the actual \n     percentage prevalence of young individuals identifying a \n     brand of such tobacco product of such manufacturer as the \n     usual brand smoked or used in such year as compared to such \n     manufacturer's target reduction level for the year.\n       (7) De minimis rule.--The Secretary may not impose a \n     surcharge on a manufacturer for a type of tobacco product for \n     a year if the Secretary determines that actual percent \n     prevalence of young individuals identifying that \n     manufacturer's brands of such tobacco product as the usual \n     products smoked or used for such year is less than 1 percent.\n       (g) Surcharges To Be Adjusted for Inflation.--\n       (1) In general.--Beginning with the fourth calendar year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, each dollar amount \n     in the tables in subsections (e)(2), (e)(3), and (f)(6)(B) \n     shall be increased by the inflation adjustment.\n       (2) Inflation adjustment.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     the inflation adjustment for any calendar year is the \n     percentage (if any) by which--\n       (A) the CPI for the preceding calendar year, exceeds\n       (B) the CPI for the calendar year 1998.\n       (3) CPI.--For purposes of paragraph (2), the CPI for any \n     calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for \n     all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.\n       (4) Rounding.--If any increase determined under paragraph \n     (1) is not a multiple of $1,000, the increase shall be \n     rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.\n       (h) Method of Surcharge Assessment.--The Secretary shall \n     assess a surcharge for a specific calendar year on or before \n     May 1 of the subsequent calendar year. Surcharge payments \n     shall be paid on or before July 1 of the year in which they \n     are assessed. The Secretary may establish, by regulation, \n     interest at a rate up to 3 times the prevailing prime rate at \n     the time the surcharge is assessed, and additional charges in \n     an amount up to 3 times the surcharge, for late payment of \n     the surcharge.\n       (i) Business Expense Deduction.--Any surcharge paid by a \n     tobacco product manufacturer under this section shall not be \n     deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense or \n     otherwise under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (j) Appeal Rights.--The amount of any surcharge is \n     committed to the sound discretion of the Secretary and shall \n     be subject to judicial review by the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, based on the \n     arbitrary and capricious standard of section 706(2)(A) of \n     title 5, United States Code. Notwithstanding any other \n     provisions of law, no court shall have authority to stay any \n     surcharge payments due the Secretary under this Act pending \n     judicial review.\n       (k) Responsibility for Agents.--In any action brought under \n     this subsection, a tobacco product manufacturer shall be held \n     responsible for any act or omission of its attorneys, \n     advertising agencies, or other agents that contributed to \n     that manufacturer's responsibility for the surcharge assessed \n     under this section.\n\n     SEC. 205.

One month \n     after the end of the calendar year, the Secretary shall make \n     a final determination of each tobacco product manufacturer's \n     applicable base amount payment obligation.\n       (3) Calculation of tobacco product manufacturer's share of \n     annual payment.--The share of the annual payment apportioned \n     to a tobacco product manufacturer shall be equal to that \n     manufacturer's share of adjusted units, taking into account \n     the manufacturer's total production of such units sold in the \n     domestic market. A tobacco product manufacturer's share of \n     adjusted units shall be determined as follows:\n       (A) Units.--A tobacco product manufacturer's number of \n     units shall be determined by counting each--\n       (i) pack of 20 cigarettes as 1 adjusted unit;\n       (ii) 1.2 ounces of moist snuff as 0.75 adjusted unit; and\n       (iii) 3 ounces of other smokeless tobacco product as 0.35 \n     adjusted units.\n       (B) Determination of adjusted units.--Except as provided in \n     subparagraph (C), a smokeless tobacco product manufacturer's \n     number of adjusted units shall be determined under the \n     following table:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               For units:                Each unit shall be treated as:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNot exceeding 150 million              70% of a unit\nExceeding 150 million                  100% of a unit\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       (C) Adjusted units determined on total domestic \n     production.--For purposes of determining a manufacturer's \n     number of adjusted units under subparagraph (B), a \n     manufacturer's total production of units, whether intended \n     for domestic consumption or export, shall be taken into \n     account.\n       (D) Special rule for large manufacturers.--If a tobacco \n     product manufacturer has more than 200 million units under \n     subparagraph (A), then that manufacturer's number of adjusted \n     units shall be equal to the total number of units, and not \n     determined under subparagraph (B).\n       (E) Smokeless equivalency study.--Not later than January 1, \n     2003, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a report \n     detailing the extent to which youths are substituting \n     smokeless tobacco products for cigarettes. If the Secretary \n     determines that significant substitution is occurring, the \n     Secretary shall include in the report recommendations to \n     address substitution, including consideration of modification \n     of the provisions of subparagraph (A).\n       (e) Computations.--The determinations required by \n     subsection (d) shall be made and certified by the Secretary \n     of Treasury.

For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``base \n     volume'' means 80 percent of the number of units of taxable \n     domestic removals and taxed imports of cigarettes in calendar \n     year 1997, as reported to the Secretary of the Treasury. For \n     purposes of this subsection, the term ``actual volume'' means \n     the number of adjusted unites as defined in section \n     402(d)(3)(A).\n\n     SEC. 404.

TAX TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS.\n\n       All payments made under section 402 are ordinary and \n     necessary business expenses for purposes of chapter 1 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for the year in which such \n     payments are made, and no part thereof is either in \n     settlement of an actual or potential liability for a fine or \n     penalty (civil or criminal) or the cost of a tangible or \n     intangible asset or other future benefit.\n\n     SEC. 406.

APPLICATION; PREEMPTION.\n\n       (a) Application.--The provisions of this title govern any \n     tobacco claim in any civil action brought in an State, \n     Tribal, or Federal court, including any such claim that has \n     not reached final judgment or final settlement as of the date \n     of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Preemption.--This title supersedes State law only to \n     the extent that State law applies to a matter covered by this \n     title. Any matter that is not governed by this title, \n     including any standard of liability applicable to a \n     manufacturer, shall be governed by any applicable State, \n     Tribal, or Federal law.\n       (c) Criminal Liability Untouched.--Nothing in this title \n     shall be construed to limit the criminal liability of tobacco \n     product manufacturers, retailers, or distributors, or their \n     officers, directors, employees, successors, or assigns.\n\n     SEC. 703. RULES GOVERNING TOBACCO CLAIMS.\n\n       (a) General Causation Presumption.--In any civil action to \n     which this title applies brought involving a tobacco claim, \n     there shall be an evidentiary presumption that nicotine is \n     addictive and that the diseases identified as being caused by \n     use of tobacco products in the Center for Disease Control and \n     Prevention Reducing the Health Consequences of Smoking: 25 \n     Years of Progress: A Report of the Surgeon General (United \n     States Public Health Service 1989), The Health Consequences \n     of Smoking: Involuntary Smoking, (USPHS 1986); and The Health \n     Consequences of Using Smokeless Tobacco, (USPHS 1986), are \n     caused in whole or in part by the use of tobacco products, \n     (hereinafter referred to as the ``general causation \n     presumption''), and a jury empaneled to hear a tobacco claim \n     shall be so instructed.

This general causation presumption shall in no way \n     affect the ability of the defendant to introduce evidence or \n     argument which the defendant would otherwise be entitled to \n     present under the law of the State or Tribe in which the \n     tobacco claim was brought to rebut the general causation \n     presumption, or with respect to general causation, specific \n     causation, or alternative causation, or to introduce any \n     other evidence or argument which the defendant would \n     otherwise be entitled to make.\n       (b) Actions Against Participating Tobacco Product \n     Manufacturers.--In any civil action brought involving a \n     tobacco claim against participating tobacco product \n     manufacturers, as that term is defined in title XIV, the \n     provisions of title XIV apply in conjunction with the \n     provisions of this title.\n\n TITLE VIII--TOBACCO INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS AND EMPLOYEE \n                       PROTECTION FROM REPRISALS\n\n     SEC. 801.

TOBACCO PRODUCT MANUFACTURER EMPLOYEE PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Prohibited Acts.--No tobacco product manufacturer may \n     discharge, demote, or otherwise discriminate against any \n     employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, \n     benefits, or privileges of employment because the employee \n     (or any person acting under a request of the employee)--\n       (1) notified the manufacturer, the Commissioner of Food and \n     Drugs, the Attorney General, or any Federal, State, or local \n     public health or law enforcement authority of an alleged \n     violation of this or any other Act;\n       (2) refused to engage in any practice made unlawful by such \n     Acts, if the employee has identified the alleged illegality \n     to the manufacturer;\n\n[[Page S5841]]\n\n       (3) testified before Congress or at any Federal or State \n     proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed provision) of \n     such Acts;\n       (4) commenced, caused to be commenced, or is about to \n     commence or cause to be commenced a proceeding under such \n     Acts, or a proceeding for the administration or enforcement \n     of any requirement imposed under such Acts;\n       (5) testified or is about to testify in any such \n     proceeding; or\n       (6) assisted or participated, or is about to assist or \n     participate, in any manner in such a proceeding or in any \n     other manner in such a proceeding or in any other action to \n     carry out the purposes of such Acts.\n       (b) Employee Complaint.--\n       (1) Any employee of a tobacco product manufacturer who \n     believes that he or she has been discharged, demoted, or \n     otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of \n     subsection (a) of this section may, within 180 days after \n     such violation occurs, file (or have any person file on his \n     or her behalf) a complaint with the Secretary alleging such \n     discharge, demotion, or discrimination. Upon receipt of such \n     a complaint, the Secretary shall notify the person named in \n     the complaint of its filing.\n       (2)(A) Upon receipt of a complaint under paragraph (1) of \n     this subsection, the Secretary shall conduct an investigation \n     of the violation alleged in the complaint. Within 30 days \n     after the receipt of such complaint, the Secretary shall \n     complete such investigation and shall notify in writing the \n     complainant (and any such person acting in his or her behalf) \n     and the person alleged to have committed such violation of \n     the results of the investigation conducted under this \n     paragraph. Within 90 days after the receipt of such \n     complaint, the Secretary shall (unless the proceeding on the \n     complaint is terminated by the Secretary on the basis of a \n     settlement entered into by the Secretary and the person \n     alleged to have committed such violation) issue an order \n     either providing the relief prescribed in subparagraph (B) of \n     this paragraph or denying the complaint. An order of the \n     Secretary shall be made on the record after notice and the \n     opportunity for a hearing in accordance with sections 554 and \n     556 of title 5, United States Code. Upon the conclusion of \n     such a hearing and the issuance of a recommended decision \n     that the complaint has merit, the Secretary shall issue a \n     preliminary order providing the relief prescribed in \n     subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, but may not order \n     compensatory damages pending a final order. The Secretary may \n     not enter into a settlement terminating a proceeding on a \n     complaint without the participation and consent of the \n     complainant.\n       (B) If, in response to a complaint under paragraph (1) of \n     this subsection, the Secretary determines that a violation of \n     this paragraph has occurred, the Secretary shall order the \n     person who committed such violation to (i) take affirmative \n     action to abate the violation, and (ii) reinstate the \n     complainant to his or her former position together with \n     compensation (including back pay), terms, conditions, and \n     privileges of his or her employment. The Secretary may order \n     such person to provide compensatory damages to the \n     complainant. If an order is issued under this subparagraph, \n     the Secretary, at the request of the complainant, shall \n     assess the person against whom the order is issued a sum \n     equal to the aggregate amount of all costs and expenses \n     (including attorneys' and expert witness fees) reasonably \n     incurred (as determined by the Secretary), by the complainant \n     for, or in connection with, the bringing of the complaint \n     upon which the order is issued.\n       (3)(A) The Secretary shall dismiss a complaint filed under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, and shall not conduct the \n     investigation required under paragraph (2) of this \n     subsection, unless the complainant has made a prima facie \n     showing that any behavior described in subsection (a) of this \n     section was a contributing factor in the unfavorable \n     personnel action alleged in the complaint.\n       (B) Notwithstanding a finding by the Secretary that the \n     complainant has made the showing required by subparagraph (A) \n     of this paragraph, no investigation required under paragraph \n     (2) of this subsection shall be conducted if the manufacturer \n     demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would \n     have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the \n     absence of such behavior. Relief may not be ordered under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection if the manufacturer \n     demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would \n     have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the \n     absence of such behavior.\n       (C) The Secretary may determine that a violation of \n     subsection (a) of this section has occurred only if the \n     complainant has demonstrated that any behavior described in \n     subsection (a) of this section was a contributing factor in \n     unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.\n       (c) Judicial Review.--\n       (1) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order \n     issued under subsection (a) of this section may obtain review \n     of the order in the United States court of appeals for the \n     circuit in which the violation, with respect to which the \n     order was issued, allegedly occurred. The petition for review \n     must be filed within 60 days after the issuance of the \n     Secretary's order. Judicial review shall be available as \n     provided in chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. The \n     commencement of proceedings under this subsection shall not, \n     unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the \n     Secretary's order.\n       (2) An order of the Secretary with respect to which review \n     could have been obtained under paragraph (1) of this \n     subsection shall not be subject to judicial review in any \n     criminal or civil proceeding.\n       (d) Noncompliance.--Whenever a person has failed to comply \n     with an order issued under subsection (b)(2) of this section, \n     the Secretary may file a civil action in the United States \n     district court for the district in which the violation \n     occurred to enforce such order. In actions brought under this \n     subsection, the district courts shall have jurisdiction to \n     grant all appropriate relief, including injunctive relief and \n     compensatory and exemplary damages.\n       (e) Action to Ensure Compliance.--\n       (1) Any person on whose behalf an order was issued under \n     subsection (b)(2) of this section may commence a civil action \n     to require compliance with such order against the person to \n     whom such order was issued. The appropriate United States \n     district court shall have jurisdiction to enforce such order, \n     without regard to the amount in controversy or the \n     citizenship of the parties.\n       (2) The court, in issuing any final order under this \n     subsection, may award costs of litigation (including \n     reasonable attorneys' and expert witness fees) to any party \n     whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.\n       (f) Enforcement.--Any non-discretionary duty imposed by \n     this section shall be enforceable in a mandamus proceeding \n     brought under section 1361 of title 28, United States Code.\n       (g) Applicability to Certain Employees.--Subsection (a) of \n     this section shall not apply with respect to any employee \n     who, acting without direction from the manufacturer (or the \n     agent of the manufacturer) deliberately causes a violation of \n     any requirement of this Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq), or any other law or \n     regulation relating to tobacco products.\n       (h) Effect on Other Laws.--This section shall not be \n     construed to expand, diminish, or otherwise affect any right \n     otherwise available to an employee under Federal or State law \n     to redress the employee's discharge or other discriminatory \n     action taken by a tobacco product manufacturer against the \n     employee.\n       (i) Posting.--The provisions of this section shall be \n     prominently posted in any place of employment to which this \n     section applies.\n\n       TITLE IX--PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF TOBACCO INDUSTRY DOCUMENTS\n\n     SEC. 901.

Such a determination shall be \n     made by a majority of the panel, in writing, and shall be \n     subject to judicial review as specified in this title. All \n     such determinations shall be made solely on consideration of \n     the subject document and written submissions from the person \n     claiming that the document is privileged or protected by \n     trade secrecy and from any person\n\n[[Page S5843]]\n\n     seeking disclosure of the document.

Any decision of the panel shall be final \n     unless judicial review is sought under section 906. In the \n     event that judicial review is so sought, the panel's decision \n     shall be stayed pending a final judicial decision.\n\n     SEC. 906. APPEAL OF PANEL DECISION.\n\n       (a) Petition; Right of Appeal.--Any person may obtain \n     judicial review of a final decision of the panel by filing a \n     petition for review with the United States Court of Appeals \n     for the Federal Circuit within 60 days after the publication \n     of such decision in the Federal Register. A copy of the \n     petition shall be transmitted by the Clerk of the Court to \n     the panel. The panel shall file in the court the record of \n     the proceedings on which the panel based its decision \n     (including any documents reviewed by the panel in camera) as \n     provided in section 2112 of title 28, United States Code. \n     Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall have \n     exclusive jurisdiction to affirm or set aside the panel's \n     decision, except that until the filing of the record the \n     panel may modify or set aside its decision.\n       (b) Additional Evidence and Arguments.--If the any party \n     applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence \n     respecting the decision being reviewed and shows to the \n     satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence or \n     arguments are material and that there were reasonable grounds \n     for the failure to adduce such evidence or arguments in the \n     proceedings before the panel, the court may order the panel \n     to provide additional opportunity for the presentation of \n     evidence or arguments in such manner and upon such terms as \n     the court deems proper. The panel may modify its findings or \n     make new findings by reason of the additional evidence or \n     arguments and shall file with the court such modified or new \n     findings, and its recommendation, if any, for the \n     modification or setting aside of the decision being reviewed.\n       (c) Standard of Review; Finality of Judgments.--The panel's \n     findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the \n     record taken as a whole, shall be conclusive. The court shall \n     review the panel's legal conclusions de novo. The judgment of \n     the court affirming or setting aside the panel's decision \n     shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the \n     United States upon certiorari or certification, as provided \n     in section 1254 of title 28, United States Code.\n       (d) Public Disclosure After Final Decision.--Within 30 days \n     after a final decision that a document, as redacted by the \n     panel or in its entirety, is not protected from disclosure by \n     a claim of attorney-client privilege, attorney work product, \n     or trade secret protection, the panel shall direct that the \n     document be made available to the Commissioner of Food and \n     Drugs under section 903(a). No Federal, Tribal, or State \n     court shall have jurisdiction to review a claim of attorney-\n     client privilege, attorney work product, or trade secret \n     protection for a document that has lawfully been made \n     available to the public under this subsection.\n       (e) Effect of Non-disclosure Decision on Judicial \n     Proceedings.--The panel's decision that a document is \n     protected by attorney-client privilege, attorney work \n     product, or trade secret protection is binding only for the \n     purpose of protecting the document from disclosure by the \n     Depository. The decision by the panel shall not be construed \n     to prevent a document from being disclosed in a judicial \n     proceeding or interfere with the authority of a court to \n     determine whether a document is admissible or whether its \n     production may be compelled.\n\n     SEC. 907. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n       The disclosure process in this title is not intended to \n     affect the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure or \n     any Federal law which requires the disclosure of documents or \n     which deals with attorney-client privilege, attorney work \n     product, or trade secret protection.\n\n     SEC. 908. PENALTIES.\n\n       (a) Good Faith Requirement.--Each tobacco product \n     manufacturer shall act in good faith in asserting claims of \n     privilege or trade secret protection based on fact and law. \n     If the panel determines that a tobacco product manufacturer \n     has not acted in good faith with full knowledge of the truth \n     of the facts asserted and with a reasonable basis under \n     existing law, the manufacturer shall be assessed costs, which \n     shall include the full administrative costs of handling the \n     claim of privilege, and all attorneys' fees incurred by the \n     panel and any party contesting the privilege. The panel may \n     also impose civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation if \n     it determines that the manufacturer acted in bad faith in \n     asserting a privilege, or knowingly acted with the intent to \n     delay, frustrate, defraud, or obstruct the panel's \n     determination of privilege, attorney work product, or trade \n     secret protection claims.\n       (b) Failure to Produce Document.--A failure by a tobacco \n     product manufacturer to produce indexes and documents in \n     compliance with the schedule set forth in this title, or with \n     such extension as may be granted by the panel, shall be \n     punished by a civil penalty of up to $50,000 per violation. A \n     separate violation occurs for each document the manufacturer \n     has failed to produce in a timely manner. The maximum penalty \n     under this subsection for a related series of violations is \n     $5,000,000. In determining the amount of any civil penalty, \n     the panel shall consider the number of documents, length of \n     delay, any history of prior violations, the ability to pay, \n     and such other matters as justice requires. Nothing in this \n     title shall replace or supersede any criminal sanction under \n     title 18, United States Code, or any other provision of law.\n\n     SEC. 909.

The Castano Civil \n     Actions shall be dismissed with full reservation of the \n     rights of individual class members to pursue claims not based \n     on addiction or dependency in civil actions, as defined in \n     section 1417(2), in accordance with this Act.

SUBSTANTIAL NON-ATTAINMENT OF REQUIRED REDUCTIONS.\n\n       (a) Action by Secretary.--If the Secretary determines under \n     title II that the non-attainment percentage for any year is \n     greater than 20 percentage points for cigarettes or smokeless \n     tobacco, then the Secretary shall determine, on a brand-by-\n     brand basis, using data that reflects a 1999 baseline, which \n     tobacco product manufacturers are responsible within the 2 \n     categories of tobacco products for the excess. The Secretary \n     may commence an action under this section against the tobacco \n     product manufacturer or manufacturers of the brand or brands \n     of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products for which the \n     non-attainment percentage exceeded 20 percentage points.\n       (b) Procedures.--Any action under this section shall be \n     commenced by the Secretary in the United States District \n     Court for the District of Columbia within 90 days after \n     publication in the Federal Register of the determination that \n     the non-attainment percentage for the tobacco product in \n     question is greater than 20 percentage points. Any such \n     action shall be heard and determined by a 3-judge court under \n     section 2284 of title 28, United States Code.\n       (c) Determination by Court.--In any action under this \n     section, the court shall determine whether a tobacco product \n     manufacturer has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence \n     that it--\n       (1) has complied substantially with the provisions of this \n     Act regarding underage tobacco use, of any rules or \n     regulations promulgated thereunder, or of any Federal or \n     State laws regarding underage tobacco use;\n       (2) has not taken any material action to undermine the \n     achievement of the required percentage reduction for the \n     tobacco product in question; and\n       (3) has used its best efforts to reduce underage tobacco \n     use to a degree at least equal to the required percentage \n     reductions.\n       (d) Removal of Annual Aggregate Payment Limitation.--Except \n     as provided in subsections (e) and (g), if the court \n     determines that a tobacco product manufacturer has failed to \n     make the showing described in subsection (c) then sections \n     1411 and 1412 of this Act do not apply to the enforcement \n     against, or the payment by, such tobacco product manufacturer \n     of any judgment or settlement that becomes final after that \n     determination is made.\n       (e) Defense.--An action under this section shall be \n     dismissed, and subsection (d) shall not apply, if the court \n     finds that the Secretary's determination under subsection (a) \n     was unlawful under subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of \n     section 706(2) of title 5, United States Code. Any judgments \n     paid under section 1412 of this Act prior to a final judgment \n     determining that the Secretary's determination was erroneous \n     shall be fully credited, with interest, under section 1412 of \n     this Act.\n       (f) Review.--Decisions of the court under this section are \n     reviewable only by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari \n     granted upon the petition of any party. The applicability of \n     subsection (d) shall be stayed during the pendency of any \n     such petition or review.\n       (g) Continuing Effect.--Subsection (d) shall cease to apply \n     to a tobacco product manufacturer found to have engaged in \n     conduct described in subsection (c) upon the later of--\n       (1) a determination by the Secretary under section 201 \n     after the commencement of action under subsection (a) that \n     the non-attainment percentage for the tobacco product in \n     question is 20 or fewer percentage points; or\n       (2) a finding by the court in an action filed against the \n     Secretary by the manufacturer, not earlier than 2 years after \n     the determination described in subsection (c) becomes final, \n     that the manufacturer has shown by a preponderance of the \n     evidence that, in the period since that determination, the \n     manufacturer--\n\n[[Page S5861]]\n\n       (A) has complied with the provisions of this Act regarding \n     underage tobacco use, of any rules or regulations promulgated \n     thereunder, and of any other applicable Federal, State, or \n     local laws, rules, or regulations;\n       (B) has not taken any action to undermine the achievement \n     of the required percentage reduction for the tobacco product \n     in question; and\n       (C) has used its best efforts to attain the required \n     percentage reduction for the tobacco product in question.\n\n     A judgment or settlement against the tobacco product \n     manufacturer that becomes final after a determination or \n     finding described in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection \n     is not subject to subsection (d). An action under paragraph \n     (2) of this subsection shall be commenced in the United \n     States District Court for the District of Columbia, and shall \n     be heard and determined by a 3-judge court under section 2284 \n     of title 28, United States Code. A decision by the court \n     under paragraph (2) of this subsection is reviewable only by \n     the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari granted upon the \n     petition of any party, and the decision shall be stayed \n     during the pendency of the petition or review. A \n     determination or finding described in paragraph (1) or (2) of \n     this subsection does not limit the Secretary's authority to \n     bring a subsequent action under this section against any \n     tobacco product manufacturer or the applicability of \n     subsection (d) with respect to any such subsequent action.\n\n     SEC. 1410. PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.\n\n       If the Secretary, in consultation with the Commissioner of \n     Food and Drugs, the Surgeon General, the Director of the \n     Center for Disease Control or the Director's delegate, and \n     the Director of the Health and Human Services Office of \n     Minority Health determines at any time that a tobacco product \n     manufacturer's actions or inactions with respect to its \n     compliance with the Act are of such a nature as to create a \n     clear and present danger that the manufacturer will not \n     attain the targets for underage smoking reduction, the \n     Secretary may bring an action under section 1409 seeking the \n     immediate suspension of the tobacco product manufacturer's \n     annual limitation cap on civil judgments. If the court \n     determines that the Secretary has proved by clear and \n     convincing evidence that the subject manufacturer's actions \n     or inactions are of such a nature that they present a clear \n     and present danger that the manufacturer will not attain the \n     targets for underage smoking reduction, the court may suspend \n     the subject manufacturer's annual limitation cap on civil \n     judgments.\n\n     SEC. 1411.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Reductions in the underage use of tobacco products are \n     critically important to the public health.\n       (2) Achieving this critical public health goal can be \n     substantially furthered by increasing the price of tobacco \n     products to discourage underage use if reduction targets are \n     not achieved and by creating financial incentives for \n     manufacturers to discourage youth from using their tobacco \n     products.\n       (3) When reduction targets in underage use are not achieved \n     on an industry-wide basis, the price increases that will \n     result from an industry-wide assessment will provide an \n     additional deterrence to youth tobacco use.\n       (4) Manufacturer-specific incentives that will be imposed \n     if reduction targets are not met by a manufacturer provide a \n     strong incentive for each manufacturer to make all efforts to \n     discourage youth use of its brands and ensure the \n     effectiveness of the industry-wide assessments.\n\n     SEC. 202. PURPOSE.\n\n       This title is intended to ensure that, in the event that \n     other measures contained in this Act prove to be inadequate \n     to produce substantial reductions in tobacco use by minors, \n     tobacco companies will pay additional assessments. These \n     additional assessments are designed to lower youth tobacco \n     consumption in a variety of ways: by triggering further \n     increases in the price of tobacco products, by encouraging \n     tobacco companies to work to meet statutory targets for \n     reductions in youth tobacco consumption, and providing \n     support for further reduction efforts.\n\n     SEC. 203. GOALS FOR REDUCING UNDERAGE TOBACCO USE.\n\n       (a) Goals.--As part of a comprehensive national tobacco \n     control policy, the Secretary, working in cooperation with \n     State, Tribal, and local governments and the private sector, \n     shall take all actions under this Act necessary to ensure \n     that the required percentage reductions in underage use of \n     tobacco products set forth in this title are achieved.\n       (b) Required Reductions for Cigarettes.--With respect to \n     cigarettes, the required percentage reduction in underage \n     use, as set forth in section 204, means--\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   Required Percentage Reduction as a Percentage\n               Calendar Year After Date of Enactment                  of Base Incidence Percentage in Underage\n                                                                                   Cigarette Use\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYears 3 and 4                                                                                         15 percent\nYears 5 and 6                                                                                         30 percent\nYears 7, 8, and 9                                                                                     50 percent\nYear 10 and thereafter                                                                                60 percent\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       (c) Required Reductions for Smokeless Tobacco.--With \n     respect to smokeless tobacco products, the required \n     percentage reduction in underage use, as set forth in section \n     204, means--\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   Required Percentage Reduction as a Percentage\n               Calendar Year After Date of Enactment                  of Base Incidence Percentage in Underage\n                                                                               Smokeless Tobacco Use\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYears 3 and 4                                                                                       12.5 percent\nYears 5 and 6                                                                                         25 percent\nYears 7, 8, and 9                                                                                     35 percent\nYear 10 and thereafter                                                                                45 percent\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n     SEC. 204. LOOK-BACK ASSESSMENT.\n\n       (a) Annual Performance Survey.--Beginning no later than \n     1999 and annually thereafter the Secretary shall conduct a \n     survey, in accordance with the methodology in subsection \n     (d)(1), to determine--\n       (1) the percentage of all young individuals who used a type \n     of tobacco product within the past 30 days; and\n       (2) the percentage of young individuals who identify each \n     brand of each type of tobacco product as the usual brand of \n     that type smoked or used within the past 30 days.\n       (b) Annual Determination.--The Secretary shall make an \n     annual determination, based on the annual performance survey \n     conducted under subsection (a), of whether the required \n     percentage reductions in underage use of tobacco products for \n     a year have been achieved for the year involved. The \n     determination shall be based on the annual percent prevalence \n     of the use of tobacco products, for the industry as a whole \n     and of particular manufacturers, by young individuals (as \n     determined by the surveys conducted by the Secretary) for the \n     year involved as compared to the base incidence percentages.\n       (c) Confidentiality of Data.--The Secretary may conduct a \n     survey relating to tobacco use involving minors. If the \n     information collected in the course of conducting the annual \n     performance survey results in the individual supplying the \n     information or described in it to be identifiable, the \n     information may not be used for any purpose other than the \n     purpose for which it was supplied unless that individual (or \n     that individual's guardian) consents to its use for such \n     other purpose. The information may not be published or \n     released in any other form if the individual supplying the \n     information or described in it is identifiable unless that \n     individual (or that individual's guardian) consents to its \n     publication or release in other form.\n       (d) Methodolgy.--\n       (1) In general.--The survey required by subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (A) be based on a nationally representative sample of young \n     individuals;\n       (B) be a household-based, in person survey (which may \n     include computer-assisted technology);\n       (C) measure use of each type of tobacco product within the \n     past 30 days;\n       (D) identify the usual brand of each type of tobacco \n     product used within the past 30 days; and\n       (E) permit the calculation of the actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of tobacco product of a manufacturer) based on the \n     point estimates of the percentage of young individuals \n     reporting use of a type of tobacco product (or, in the case \n     of the manufacturer-specific surcharge,\n\n[[Page S5871]]\n\n     the use of a type of tobacco product of a manufacturer) from \n     the annual performance survey.\n       (2) Criteria for deeming point estimates correct.--Point \n     estimates under paragraph (1)(E) are deemed conclusively to \n     be correct and accurate for calculating actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of tobacco product of a particular manufacturer) \n     for the purpose of measuring compliance with percent \n     reduction targets and calculating surcharges provided that \n     the precision of estimates (based on sampling error) of the \n     percentage of young individuals reporting use of a type of \n     tobacco product (or, in the case of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge, the use of a type of tobacco product of a \n     manufacturer) is such that the 95-percent confidence interval \n     around such point estimates is no more than plus or minus 1 \n     percent.\n       (3) Survey deemed correct, proper, and accurate.--A survey \n     using the methodology required by this subsection is deemed \n     conclusively to be proper, correct, and accurate for purposes \n     of this Act.\n       (4) Secretary may adopt different methodology.--The \n     Secretary by notice and comment rulemaking may adopt a survey \n     methodology that is different than the methodology described \n     in paragraph (1) if the different methodology is at least as \n     statistically precise as that methodology.\n       (e) Industry-wide Non-attainment Surcharges.--\n       (1) Secretary to determine industry-wide non-attainment \n     percentage.--The Secretary shall determine the industry-wide \n     non-attainment percentage for cigarettes and for smokeless \n     tobacco for each calendar year.\n       (2) Non-attainment surcharge for cigarettes.--For each \n     calendar year in which the percentage reduction in underage \n     use required by section 203b) is not attained, the Secretary \n     shall assess a surcharge on cigarette manufacturers as \n     follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    If the non-attainment percentage is:          The surcharge is:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNot more than 5 percent                     $80,000,000 multiplied by\n                                             the

reduction in underage use \n     required by section 203c) is not attained, the Secretary \n     shall assess a surcharge on smokeless tobacco product \n     manufacturers as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    If the non-attainment percentage is:          The surcharge is:\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNot more than 5 percent                     $8,000,000 multiplied by the\n

liability; joint and several liability.--\n     Liability for any surcharge imposed under subsection (e) \n     shall be--\n       (A) strict liability; and\n       (B) joint and several liability--\n       (i) among all cigarette manufacturers for surcharges \n     imposed under subsection (e)(2); and\n       (ii) among all smokeless tobacco manufacturers for \n     surcharges imposed under subsection (e)(3).\n       (5) Surcharge liability among manufacturers.--A tobacco \n     product manufacturer shall be liable under this subsection to \n     one or more other manufacturers if the plaintiff tobacco \n     product manufacturer establishes by a preponderance of the \n     evidence that the defendant tobacco product manufacturer, \n     through its acts or omissions, was responsible for a \n     disproportionate share of the non-attainment surcharge as \n     compared to the responsibility of the plaintiff manufacturer.\n       (6) Exemptions for small manufacturers.--\n       (A) Allocation by market share.--The Secretary shall make \n     such allocations according to each manufacturer's share of \n     the domestic cigarette or domestic smokeless tobacco market, \n     as appropriate, in the year for which the surcharge is being \n     assessed, based on actual Federal excise tax payments.\n       (B) Exemption.--In any year in which a surcharge is being \n     assessed, the Secretary shall exempt from payment any tobacco \n     product manufacturer with less than 1 percent of the domestic \n     market share for a specific category of tobacco product \n     unless the Secretary finds that the manufacturer's products \n     are used by underage individuals at a rate equal to or \n     greater than the manufacturer's total market share for the \n     type of tobacco product.\n       (f) Manufacturer-specific Surcharges.--\n       (1) Required percentage reductions.--Each manufacturer \n     which manufactured a brand or brands of tobacco product on or \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act shall reduce the \n     percentage of young individuals who use such manufacturer's \n     brand or brands as their usual brand in accordance with the \n     required percentage reductions described under subsections \n     (b) (with respect to cigarettes) and (c ) (with respect to \n     smokeless tobacco).\n       (2) Application to less popular brands.--Each manufacturer \n     which manufactured a brand or brands of tobacco product on or \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act for which the \n     base incidence percentage is equal to or less than the de \n     minimis level shall ensure that the percent prevalence of \n     young individuals who use the manufacturer's tobacco products \n     as their usual brand remains equal to or less than the de \n     minimis level described in paragraph (4).\n       (3) New entrants.--Each manufacturer of a tobacco product \n     which begins to manufacture a tobacco product after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act shall ensure that the percent \n     prevalence of young individuals who use the manufacturer's \n     tobacco products as their usual brand is equal to or less \n     than the de minimis level.\n       (4) De minimis level defined.--The de minimis level is \n     equal to 1 percent prevalence of the use of each \n     manufacturer's brands of tobacco product by young individuals \n     (as determined on the basis of the annual performance survey \n     conducted by the Secretary) for a year.\n       (5) Target reduction levels.--\n       (A) Existing manufacturers.-- For purposes of this section, \n     the target reduction level for each type of tobacco product \n     for a year for a manufacturer is the product of the required \n     percentage reduction for a type of tobacco product for a year \n     and the manufacturers base incidence percentage for such \n     tobacco product.\n       (B) New manufacturers; manufacturers with low base \n     incidence percentages.--With respect to a manufacturer which \n     begins to manufacture a tobacco product after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act or a manufacturer for which the \n     baseline level as measured by the annual performance survey \n     is equal to or less than the de minimis level described in \n     paragraph (4), the base incidence percentage is the de \n     minimis level, and the required percentage reduction in \n     underage use for a type of tobacco product with respect to a \n     manufacturer for a year shall be deemed to be the number of \n     percentage points necessary to reduce the actual percent \n     prevalence of young individuals identifying a brand of such \n     tobacco product of such manufacturer as the usual brand \n     smoked or used for such year to the de minimis level.\n       (6) Surcharge amount.--\n       (A) In general.--If the Secretary determines that the \n     required percentage reduction in use of a type of tobacco \n     product has not been achieved by such manufacturer for a \n     year, the Secretary shall impose a surcharge on such \n     manufacturer under this paragraph.\n       (B) Amount.--The amount of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge for a type of tobacco product for a year under this \n     paragraph is $1,000, multiplied by the number of young \n     individuals for which such firm is in noncompliance with \n     respect to its target reduction level.\n       (C) Determination of number of young individuals.--For \n     purposes of subparagraph (B) the number of young individuals \n     for which a manufacturer is in noncompliance for a year shall \n     be determined by the Secretary from the annual performance \n     survey and shall be calculated based on the estimated total \n     number of young individuals in such year and the actual \n     percentage prevalence of young individuals identifying a \n     brand of such tobacco product of such manufacturer as the \n     usual brand smoked or used in such year as compared to such \n     manufacturer's target reduction level for the year.\n       (7) De minimis rule.--The Secretary may not impose a \n     surcharge on a manufacturer for a type of tobacco product for \n     a year if the Secretary determines that actual percent \n     prevalence of young individuals identifying that \n     manufacturer's brands of such tobacco product as the usual \n     products smoked or used for such year is less than 1 percent.\n       (g) Surcharges To Be Adjusted for Inflation.--\n       (1) In general.--Beginning with the fourth calendar year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, each dollar amount \n     in the tables in subsections (e)(2), (e)(3), and (f)(6)(B) \n     shall be increased by the inflation adjustment.\n       (2) Inflation adjustment.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     the inflation adjustment for any calendar year is the \n     percentage (if any) by which--\n       (A) the CPI for the preceding calendar year, exceeds\n       (B) the CPI for the calendar year 1998.\n       (3) CPI.--For purposes of paragraph (2), the CPI for any \n     calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for \n     all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.\n       (4) Rounding.--If any increase determined under paragraph \n     (1) is not a multiple of $1,000, the increase shall be \n     rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.\n       (h) Method of Surcharge Assessment.--The Secretary shall \n     assess a surcharge for a specific calendar year on or before \n     May 1 of the subsequent calendar year. Surcharge payments \n     shall be paid on or before July 1 of the year in which they \n     are assessed.

For purposes of this paragraph, the term ``base \n     volume'' means 80 percent of the number of units of taxable \n     domestic removals and taxed imports of cigarettes in calendar \n     year 1997, as reported to the Secretary of the Treasury. For \n     purposes of this subsection, the term ``actual volume'' means \n     the number of adjusted unites as defined in section \n     402(d)(3)(A).\n\n     SEC. 404.

TAX TREATMENT OF PAYMENTS.\n\n       All payments made under section 402 are ordinary and \n     necessary business expenses for purposes of chapter 1 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for the year in which such \n     payments are made, and no part thereof is either in \n     settlement of an actual or potential liability for a fine or \n     penalty (civil or criminal) or the cost of a tangible or \n     intangible asset or other future benefit.\n\n     SEC. 406.

TOBACCO PRODUCT MANUFACTURER EMPLOYEE PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Prohibited Acts.--No tobacco product manufacturer may \n     discharge, demote, or otherwise discriminate against any \n     employee with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, \n     benefits, or privileges of employment because the employee \n     (or any person acting under a request of the employee)--\n       (1) notified the manufacturer, the Commissioner of Food and \n     Drugs, the Attorney General, or any Federal, State, or local \n     public health or law enforcement authority of an alleged \n     violation of this or any other Act;\n       (2) refused to engage in any practice made unlawful by such \n     Acts, if the employee has identified the alleged illegality \n     to the manufacturer;\n       (3) testified before Congress or at any Federal or State \n     proceeding regarding any provision (or proposed provision) of \n     such Acts;\n       (4) commenced, caused to be commenced, or is about to \n     commence or cause to be commenced a proceeding under such \n     Acts, or a proceeding for the administration or enforcement \n     of any requirement imposed under such Acts;\n       (5) testified or is about to testify in any such \n     proceeding; or\n       (6) assisted or participated, or is about to assist or \n     participate, in any manner in such a proceeding or in any \n     other manner in such a proceeding or in any other action to \n     carry out the purposes of such Acts.\n       (b) Employee Complaint.--\n       (1) Any employee of a tobacco product manufacturer who \n     believes that he or she has been discharged, demoted, or \n     otherwise discriminated against by any person in violation of \n     subsection (a) of this section may, within 180 days after \n     such violation occurs, file (or have any person file on his \n     or her behalf) a complaint with the Secretary alleging such \n     discharge, demotion, or discrimination. Upon receipt of such \n     a complaint, the Secretary shall notify the person named in \n     the complaint of its filing.\n       (2)(A) Upon receipt of a complaint under paragraph (1) of \n     this subsection, the Secretary shall conduct an investigation \n     of the violation alleged in the complaint. Within 30 days \n     after the receipt of such complaint, the Secretary shall \n     complete such investigation and shall notify in writing the \n     complainant (and any such person acting in his or her behalf) \n     and the person alleged to have committed such violation of \n     the results of the investigation conducted under this \n     paragraph. Within 90 days after the receipt of such \n     complaint, the Secretary shall (unless the proceeding on the \n     complaint is terminated by the Secretary on the basis of a \n     settlement entered into by the Secretary and the person \n     alleged to have committed such violation) issue an order \n     either providing the relief prescribed in subparagraph (B) of \n     this paragraph or denying the complaint. An order of the \n     Secretary shall be made on the record after notice and the \n     opportunity for a hearing in accordance with sections 554 and \n     556 of title 5, United States Code. Upon the conclusion of \n     such a hearing and the issuance of a recommended decision \n     that the complaint has merit, the Secretary shall issue a \n     preliminary order providing the relief prescribed in \n     subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, but may not order \n     compensatory damages pending a final order. The Secretary may \n     not enter into a settlement terminating a proceeding on a \n     complaint without the participation and consent of the \n     complainant.\n       (B) If, in response to a complaint under paragraph (1) of \n     this subsection, the Secretary determines that a violation of \n     this paragraph has occurred, the Secretary shall order the \n     person who committed such violation to (i) take affirmative \n     action to abate\n\n[[Page S5885]]\n\n     the violation, and (ii) reinstate the complainant to his or \n     her former position together with compensation (including \n     back pay), terms, conditions, and privileges of his or her \n     employment. The Secretary may order such person to provide \n     compensatory damages to the complainant. If an order is \n     issued under this subparagraph, the Secretary, at the request \n     of the complainant, shall assess the person against whom the \n     order is issued a sum equal to the aggregate amount of all \n     costs and expenses (including attorneys' and expert witness \n     fees) reasonably incurred (as determined by the Secretary), \n     by the complainant for, or in connection with, the bringing \n     of the complaint upon which the order is issued.\n       (3)(A) The Secretary shall dismiss a complaint filed under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection, and shall not conduct the \n     investigation required under paragraph (2) of this \n     subsection, unless the complainant has made a prima facie \n     showing that any behavior described in subsection (a) of this \n     section was a contributing factor in the unfavorable \n     personnel action alleged in the complaint.\n       (B) Notwithstanding a finding by the Secretary that the \n     complainant has made the showing required by subparagraph (A) \n     of this paragraph, no investigation required under paragraph \n     (2) of this subsection shall be conducted if the manufacturer \n     demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would \n     have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the \n     absence of such behavior. Relief may not be ordered under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection if the manufacturer \n     demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would \n     have taken the same unfavorable personnel action in the \n     absence of such behavior.\n       (C) The Secretary may determine that a violation of \n     subsection (a) of this section has occurred only if the \n     complainant has demonstrated that any behavior described in \n     subsection (a) of this section was a contributing factor in \n     unfavorable personnel action alleged in the complaint.\n       (c) Judicial Review.--\n       (1) Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order \n     issued under subsection (a) of this section may obtain review \n     of the order in the United States court of appeals for the \n     circuit in which the violation, with respect to which the \n     order was issued, allegedly occurred. The petition for review \n     must be filed within 60 days after the issuance of the \n     Secretary's order. Judicial review shall be available as \n     provided in chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code. The \n     commencement of proceedings under this subsection shall not, \n     unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the \n     Secretary's order.\n       (2) An order of the Secretary with respect to which review \n     could have been obtained under paragraph (1) of this \n     subsection shall not be subject to judicial review in any \n     criminal or civil proceeding.\n       (d) Noncompliance.--Whenever a person has failed to comply \n     with an order issued under subsection (b)(2) of this section, \n     the Secretary may file a civil action in the United States \n     district court for the district in which the violation \n     occurred to enforce such order. In actions brought under this \n     subsection, the district courts shall have jurisdiction to \n     grant all appropriate relief, including injunctive relief and \n     compensatory and exemplary damages.\n       (e) Action to Ensure Compliance.--\n       (1) Any person on whose behalf an order was issued under \n     subsection (b)(2) of this section may commence a civil action \n     to require compliance with such order against the person to \n     whom such order was issued. The appropriate United States \n     district court shall have jurisdiction to enforce such order, \n     without regard to the amount in controversy or the \n     citizenship of the parties.\n       (2) The court, in issuing any final order under this \n     subsection, may award costs of litigation (including \n     reasonable attorneys' and expert witness fees) to any party \n     whenever the court determines such award is appropriate.\n       (f) Enforcement.--Any non-discretionary duty imposed by \n     this section shall be enforceable in a mandamus proceeding \n     brought under section 1361 of title 28, United States Code.\n       (g) Applicability to Certain Employees.--Subsection (a) of \n     this section shall not apply with respect to any employee \n     who, acting without direction from the manufacturer (or the \n     agent of the manufacturer) deliberately causes a violation of \n     any requirement of this Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and \n     Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq), or any other law or \n     regulation relating to tobacco products.\n       (h) Effect on Other Laws.--This section shall not be \n     construed to expand, diminish, or otherwise affect any right \n     otherwise available to an employee under Federal or State law \n     to redress the employee's discharge or other discriminatory \n     action taken by a tobacco product manufacturer against the \n     employee.\n       (i) Posting.--The provisions of this section shall be \n     prominently posted in any place of employment to which this \n     section applies.\n\n       TITLE IX--PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF TOBACCO INDUSTRY DOCUMENTS\n\n     SEC. 901. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the American tobacco industry has made claims of \n     attorney-client privilege, attorney work product, and trade \n     secrets to protect from public disclosure thousands of \n     internal documents sought by civil litigants;\n       (2) a number of courts have found that these claims of \n     privilege were not made in good faith; and\n       (3) a prompt and full exposition of tobacco documents \n     will--\n       (A) promote understanding by the public of the tobacco \n     industry's research and practices; and\n       (B) further the purposes of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 902. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       This title applies to all tobacco product manufacturers.\n\n     SEC. 903. DOCUMENT DISCLOSURE.\n\n       (a) Disclosure to the Food and Drug Administration.--\n       (1) Within 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     each tobacco product manufacturer shall submit to the Food \n     and Drug Administration the documents identified in \n     subsection (c), including documents for which trade secret \n     protection is claimed, with the exception of any document for \n     which privilege is claimed, and identified in accordance with \n     subsection (b). Each such manufacturer shall provide the \n     Administration with the privilege and trade secret logs \n     identified under subsection (b).\n       (2) With respect to documents that are claimed to contain \n     trade secret material, unless and until it is finally \n     determined under this title, either through judicial review \n     or because time for judicial review has expired, that such a \n     document does not constitute or contain trade secret \n     material, the Administration shall treat the document as a \n     trade secret in accordance with section 708 of the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 379) and the \n     regulations promulgated thereunder. Nothing herein shall \n     limit the authority of the Administration to obtain and use, \n     in accordance with any provision of the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, \n     any document constituting or containing trade secret \n     material. Documents and materials received by the \n     Administration under this provision shall not be obtainable \n     by or releasable to the public through section 552 of title \n     5, United States Code, or any other provision of law, and the \n     only recourse to obtain these documents shall be through the \n     process established by section 905.\n       (3) If a document depository is not established under title \n     XIV, the Secretary shall establish by regulation a procedure \n     for making public all documents submitted under paragraph (1) \n     except documents for which trade secret protection has been \n     claimed and for which there has not been a final judicial \n     determination that the document does not contain a trade \n     secret.\n       (b) Separate Submission of Documents.--\n       (1) Privileged Trade Secret Documents.--Any document \n     required to be submitted under subsection (c) or (d) that is \n     subject to a claim by a tobacco product manufacturer of \n     attorney-client privilege, attorney work product, or trade \n     secret protection shall be so marked and shall be submitted \n     to the panel under section 904 within 30 days after its \n     appointment. Compliance with this subsection shall not be \n     deemed to be a waiver of any applicable claim of privilege or \n     trade secret protection.\n       (2) Privilege and trade secret logs.--\n       (A) In general.--Within 15 days after submitting documents \n     under paragraph (1), each tobacco product manufacturer shall \n     submit a comprehensive log which identifies on a document-by-\n     document basis all documents produced for which the \n     manufacturer asserts attorney-client privilege, attorney \n     work-product, or trade secrecy. With respect to documents for \n     which the manufacturer previously has asserted one or more of \n     the aforementioned privileges or trade secret protection, the \n     manufacturer shall conduct a good faith de novo review of \n     such documents to determine whether such privilege or trade \n     secret protection is appropriate.\n       (B) Organization of log.--The log shall be organized in \n     numerical order based upon the document identifier assigned \n     to each document. For each document, the log shall contain--\n       (i) a description of the document, including type of \n     document, title of document, name and position or title of \n     each author, addressee, and other recipient who was intended \n     to receive a copy, document date, document purpose, and \n     general subject matter;\n       (ii) an explanation why the document or a portion of the \n     document is privileged or subject to trade secret protection; \n     and\n       (iii) a statement whether any previous claim of privilege \n     or trade secret was denied and, if so, in what proceeding.\n       (C) Public inspection.--Within 5 days of receipt of such a \n     log, the Depository shall make it available for public \n     inspection and review.\n       (3) Declaration of compliance.--Each tobacco product \n     manufacturer shall submit to the Depository a declaration, in \n     accordance with the requirements of section 1746 of title 28, \n     United States Code, by an individual with responsibility for \n     the de novo review of documents, preparation of the privilege \n     log, and knowledge of its contents. The declarant shall \n     attest to the manufacturer's compliance with the requirements \n     of this subsection pertaining to the review of documents and \n     preparation of a privilege log.\n       (c) Document Categories.--Each tobacco product manufacturer \n     shall submit--\n       (1) every existing document (including any document subject \n     to a claim of attorney-client privilege, attorney work \n     product, or trade secret protection) in the manufacturer's \n     possession, custody, or control relating, referring, or \n     pertaining to--\n\n[[Page S5886]]\n\n       (A) any studies, research, or analysis of any possible \n     health or pharmacological effects in humans or animals, \n     including addiction, associated with the use of tobacco \n     products or components of tobacco products;\n       (B) the engineering, manipulation, or control of nicotine \n     in tobacco products;\n       (C) the sale or marketing of tobacco products;\n       (D) any research involving safer or less hazardous tobacco \n     products;\n       (E) tobacco use by minors; or\n       (F) the relationship between advertising or promotion and \n     the use of tobacco products;\n       (2) all documents produced by any tobacco product \n     manufacturer, the Center of Tobacco Research or Tobacco \n     Institute to the Attorney General of any State during \n     discovery in any action brought on behalf of any State and \n     commenced after January 1, 1994;\n       (3) all documents produced by any tobacco product \n     manufacturer, Center for Tobacco Research or Tobacco \n     Institute to the Federal Trade Commission in connection with \n     its investigation into the ``Joe Camel'' advertising campaign \n     and any underage marketing of tobacco products to minors;\n       (4) all documents produced by any tobacco product \n     manufacturers, the Center for Tobacco Research or the Tobacco \n     Institute to litigation adversaries during discovery in any \n     private litigation matters;\n       (5) all documents produced by any tobacco product \n     manufacturer, the Center for Tobacco Research, or the Tobacco \n     Institute in any of the following private litigation matters:\n       (A) Philip Morris v.

The panel may modify its findings or \n     make new findings by reason of the additional evidence or \n     arguments and shall file with the court such modified or new \n     findings, and its recommendation, if any, for the \n     modification or setting aside of the decision being reviewed.\n       (c) Standard of Review; Finality of Judgments.--The panel's \n     findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the \n     record taken as a whole, shall be conclusive. The court shall \n     review the panel's legal conclusions de novo. The judgment of \n     the court affirming or setting aside the panel's decision \n     shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the \n     United States upon certiorari or certification, as provided \n     in section 1254 of title 28, United States Code.\n       (d) Public Disclosure After Final Decision.--Within 30 days \n     after a final decision\n\n[[Page S5887]]\n\n     that a document, as redacted by the panel or in its entirety, \n     is not protected from disclosure by a claim of attorney-\n     client privilege, attorney work product, or trade secret \n     protection, the panel shall direct that the document be made \n     available to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs under section \n     903(a).

The decision by the panel shall not be construed \n     to prevent a document from being disclosed in a judicial \n     proceeding or interfere with the authority of a court to \n     determine whether a document is admissible or whether its \n     production may be compelled.\n\n     SEC. 907. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n       The disclosure process in this title is not intended to \n     affect the Federal Rules of Civil or Criminal Procedure or \n     any Federal law which requires the disclosure of documents or \n     which deals with attorney-client privilege, attorney work \n     product, or trade secret protection.\n\n     SEC. 908. PENALTIES.\n\n       (a) Good Faith Requirement.--Each tobacco product \n     manufacturer shall act in good faith in asserting claims of \n     privilege or trade secret protection based on fact and law. \n     If the panel determines that a tobacco product manufacturer \n     has not acted in good faith with full knowledge of the truth \n     of the facts asserted and with a reasonable basis under \n     existing law, the manufacturer shall be assessed costs, which \n     shall include the full administrative costs of handling the \n     claim of privilege, and all attorneys' fees incurred by the \n     panel and any party contesting the privilege. The panel may \n     also impose civil penalties of up to $50,000 per violation if \n     it determines that the manufacturer acted in bad faith in \n     asserting a privilege, or knowingly acted with the intent to \n     delay, frustrate, defraud, or obstruct the panel's \n     determination of privilege, attorney work product, or trade \n     secret protection claims.\n       (b) Failure to Produce Document.--A failure by a tobacco \n     product manufacturer to produce indexes and documents in \n     compliance with the schedule set forth in this title, or with \n     such extension as may be granted by the panel, shall be \n     punished by a civil penalty of up to $50,000 per violation. A \n     separate violation occurs for each document the manufacturer \n     has failed to produce in a timely manner. The maximum penalty \n     under this subsection for a related series of violations is \n     $5,000,000. In determining the amount of any civil penalty, \n     the panel shall consider the number of documents, length of \n     delay, any history of prior violations, the ability to pay, \n     and such other matters as justice requires. Nothing in this \n     title shall replace or supersede any criminal sanction under \n     title 18, United States Code, or any other provision of law.\n\n     SEC. 909.

A \n     determination or finding described in paragraph (1) or (2) of \n     this subsection does not limit the Secretary's authority to \n     bring a subsequent action under this section against any \n     tobacco product manufacturer or the applicability of \n     subsection (d) with respect to any such subsequent action.\n\n     SEC. 1410.

PURPOSES AND GOALS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to create \n     incentives to achieve reductions in the percentage of \n     children who use tobacco products and to ensure that, in the \n     event that other measures contained in this Act prove to be \n     inadequate to produce substantial reductions in tobacco use \n     by minors, tobacco companies will pay additional assessments. \n     These additional assessments are designed to lower youth \n     tobacco consumption in a variety of ways, including by \n     triggering further increases in the price of tobacco \n     products, by encouraging tobacco companies to work to meet \n     statutory targets for reductions in youth tobacco \n     consumption,\n\n[[Page S5989]]\n\n     and by providing support for further reduction efforts.\n       (b) Goals.--As part of a comprehensive national tobacco \n     control policy, the Secretary, working in cooperation with \n     State, Tribal, and local governments and the private sector, \n     shall take all actions under this Act necessary to ensure \n     that the required performance objectives for percentage \n     reductions in underage use of tobacco products set forth in \n     this title are achieved.\n\n     SEC. 203.

The information may not be \n     published or released in any other form if the individual \n     supplying the information, or described in the information, \n     is identifiable unless that individual (or that individual's \n     guardian) consents to its publication or release in other \n     form.\n       (e) Methodology.--\n       (1) In general.--The survey required by subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (A) be based on a nationally representative sample of young \n     individuals;\n       (B) measure use of each type of tobacco product within the \n     past 30 days;\n       (C) identify the usual brand of each type of tobacco \n     product used within the past 30 days; and\n       (D) permit the calculation of the actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of the tobacco products of a manufacturer) based on \n     the point estimates of the percentage of young individuals \n     reporting use of a type of tobacco product (or, in the case \n     of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use of a type of \n     the tobacco products of a manufacturer) from the annual \n     performance survey.\n       (2) Criteria for deeming point estimates correct.--Point \n     estimates under paragraph (1)(D) are deemed conclusively to \n     be correct and accurate for calculating actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of the tobacco products of a manufacturer) for the \n     purpose of measuring compliance with percent reduction \n     targets and calculating surcharges provided that the \n     precision of estimates (based on sampling error) of the \n     percentage of children reporting use of a type of tobacco \n     product (or, in the case of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge, the use of a type of the tobacco products of a \n     manufacturer) is such that the 95 percent confidence interval \n     around such point estimates is no more than plus or minus 1 \n     percent.\n       (3) Survey deemed correct, proper, and accurate.--A survey \n     using the methodology required by this subsection is deemed \n     conclusively to be proper, correct, and accurate for purposes \n     of this Act.\n       (4) Secretary may adopt different methodology.--The \n     Secretary by notice and comment rulemaking may adopt a survey \n     methodology that is different than the methodology described \n     in paragraph (1) if the different methodology is at least as \n     statistically precise as that methodology.\n       (f) Additional Measures.--In order to increase the \n     understanding of youth tobacco product use, the Secretary \n     may, for informational purposes only, add additional measures \n     to the survey under subsection (a), conduct periodic or \n     occasional surveys at other times, and conduct surveys of \n     other populations such as young adults. The results of such \n     surveys shall be made available to manufacturers and the \n     public to assist in efforts to reduce youth tobacco use.\n       (g) Technical Adjustments.--The Secretary may make \n     technical changes in the manner in which surveys are \n     conducted under this section so long as adjustments are made \n     to ensure that the results of such surveys are comparable \n     from year to year.\n\n     SEC. 204. PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Baseline Level.--The baseline level for each type of \n     tobacco product, and for each manufacturer with respect to \n     each type of tobacco product, is the percentage of children \n     determined to have used such tobacco product in the first \n     annual performance survey (in 1999).\n       (b) Industry-Wide Non-Attainment Assessments.--For the \n     purpose of determining industry-wide non-attainment \n     assessments, the performance objective for the reduction of \n     the percentage of children determined to have used each type \n     of tobacco product is the percentage in subsection (d) as \n     measured from the baseline level for such type of tobacco \n     product.\n       (c) Performance Objectives for Existing Manufacturers.--\n     Each existing manufacturer shall have as a performance \n     objective the reduction of the percentage of children \n     determined to have used each type of such manufacturer's \n     tobacco products by at least the percentage specified in \n     subsection (d) as measured from the baseline level for such \n     manufacturer for such product.\n       (d) Required Percentage Reductions.--The reductions \n     required in this subsection are as follows:\n       (1) In the case of cigarettes--\n       (A) with respect to the third and fourth annual performance \n     surveys, 20 percent;\n       (B) with respect to the fifth and sixth annual performance \n     surveys, 40 percent;\n       (C) with respect to the seventh, eighth, and ninth annual \n     performance surveys, 55 percent; and\n       (D) with respect to the 10th annual performance survey and \n     each annual performance survey thereafter, 67 percent.\n       (2) In the case of smokeless tobacco--\n       (A) with respect to the third and fourth annual performance \n     surveys, 12.5 percent;\n       (B) with respect to the fifth and sixth annual performance \n     surveys, 25 percent;\n       (C) with respect to the seventh, eighth, and ninth annual \n     performance surveys, 35 percent; and\n       (D) with respect to the 10th annual performance survey and \n     each annual performance survey thereafter, 45 percent.\n       (e) Report on Further Reductions.--The Secretary shall \n     report to Congress by the end of 2006 on the feasibility of \n     further reduction in underage tobacco use.\n       (f) Performance Objective Relative to the De Minimis \n     Level.--If the percentage of children determined to have used \n     a type of the tobacco products of an existing manufacturer in \n     an annual performance survey is equal to or less than the de \n     minimis level, the manufacturer shall be considered to have \n     achieved the applicable performance objective.\n       (g) Performance Objectives for New Manufacturers.--Each new \n     manufacturer shall have as its performance objective \n     maintaining the percentage of children determined to have \n     used each type of such manufacturer's tobacco products in \n     each annual performance survey at a level equal to or less \n     than the de minimis level for that year.\n       (h) De Minimis Level.--The de minimis level shall be 1 \n     percent of children for the applicable year.\n\n     SEC. 205.

less than the de minimis level, the \n     non-attainment percentage (for purposes of paragraph (2) or \n     (3)) shall be equal to the number of percentage points by \n     which the percentage of children who used the manufacturer's \n     tobacco products of the applicable type exceeds the de \n     minimis level.\n       (d) Surcharges To Be Adjusted for Inflation.--\n       (1) In general.--Beginning with the fourth calendar year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, each dollar amount \n     in the tables in subsections (b)(2), (b)(3), (c)(2), and \n     (c)(3) shall be increased by the inflation adjustment.\n       (2) Inflation adjustment.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     the inflation adjustment for any calendar year is the \n     percentage (if any) by which--\n       (A) the CPI for the preceding calendar year; exceeds\n       (B) the CPI for the calendar year 1998.\n       (3) CPI.--For purposes of paragraph (2), the CPI for any \n     calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for \n     all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.\n       (4) Rounding.--If any increase determined under paragraph \n     (1) is not a multiple of $1,000, the increase shall be \n     rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.\n       (e) Method of Surcharge Assessment.--The Secretary shall \n     assess a surcharge for a specific calendar year on or before \n     May 1 of the subsequent calendar year. Surcharge payments \n     shall be paid on or before July 1 of the year in which they \n     are assessed. The Secretary may establish, by regulation, \n     interest at a rate up to 3 times the prevailing prime rate at \n     the time the surcharge is assessed, and additional charges in \n     an amount up to 3 times the surcharge, for late payment of \n     the surcharge.\n       (f) Business Expense Deduction.--In order to maximize the \n     financial deterrent effect of the assessments and surcharges \n     established in this section, any such payment shall not be \n     deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense or \n     otherwise under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (g) Procedures.--In assessing price increase assessments \n     and enforcing other measures under this section, the \n     Secretary shall have in place procedures to take into account \n     the effect that the margin of error of the annual performance \n     survey may have on the amounts assessed to or measures \n     required of such manufacturers.\n       (h) Other Products.--The Secretary shall promulgate \n     regulations establishing performance objectives for the \n     reduction of the use by children of other products made or \n     derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption if \n     significant percentages of children use or begin to use such \n     products and the inclusion of such products as types of \n     tobacco products under this subtitle would help protect the \n     public health. Such regulations shall contain provisions, \n     consistent with the provisions in this subtitle applicable to \n     cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, for the application of \n     assessments and surcharges to achieve reductions in the \n     percentage of children who use such products.\n       (i) Appeal Rights.--The amount of any surcharge is \n     committed to the sound discretion of the Secretary and shall \n     be subject to judicial review by the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, based on the \n     arbitrary and capricious standard of section 706(2)(A) of \n     title 5, United States Code. Notwithstanding any other \n     provisions of law, no court shall have authority to stay any \n     surcharge payments due the Secretary under this Act pending \n     judicial review.\n       (j) Responsibility for Agents.--In any action brought under \n     this subsection, a tobacco product manufacturer shall be held \n     responsible for any act or omission of its attorneys, \n     advertising agencies, or other agents that contributed to \n     that manufacturer's responsibility for the surcharge assessed \n     under this section.\n\n     SEC. 206.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Reductions in the underage use of tobacco products are \n     critically important to the public health.\n       (2) Achieving this critical public health goal can be \n     substantially furthered by increasing the price of tobacco \n     products to discourage underage use if reduction targets are \n     not achieved and by creating financial incentives for \n     manufacturers to discourage youth from using their tobacco \n     products.\n       (3) When reduction targets in underage use are not achieved \n     on an industry-wide basis, the price increases that will \n     result from an industry-wide assessment will provide an \n     additional deterrence to youth tobacco use.\n       (4) Manufacturer-specific incentives that will be imposed \n     if reduction targets are not met by a manufacturer provide a \n     strong incentive for each manufacturer to make all efforts to \n     discourage youth use of its brands and insure the \n     effectiveness of the industry-wide assessments.\n\n     SEC. 202. PURPOSES AND GOALS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to create \n     incentives to achieve reductions in the percentage of \n     children who use tobacco products and to ensure that, in the \n     event that other measures contained in this Act prove to be \n     inadequate to produce substantial reductions in tobacco use \n     by minors, tobacco companies will pay additional assessments. \n     These additional assessments are designed to lower youth \n     tobacco consumption in a variety of ways, including by \n     triggering further increases in the price of tobacco \n     products, by encouraging tobacco companies to work to meet \n     statutory targets for reductions in youth tobacco \n     consumption,\n\n[[Page S5989]]\n\n     and by providing support for further reduction efforts.\n       (b) Goals.--As part of a comprehensive national tobacco \n     control policy, the Secretary, working in cooperation with \n     State, Tribal, and local governments and the private sector, \n     shall take all actions under this Act necessary to ensure \n     that the required performance objectives for percentage \n     reductions in underage use of tobacco products set forth in \n     this title are achieved.\n\n     SEC. 203. ANNUAL PERFORMANCE SURVEYS.\n\n       (a) Annual Performance Survey.--Beginning not later than \n     1999 and annually thereafter the Secretary shall conduct a \n     survey, in accordance with the methodology in subsection \n     (e)(1), to determine for each type of tobacco product--\n       (1) the percentage of all children who used such type of \n     tobacco product within the past 30 days; and\n       (2) the percentage of children who identify each brand of \n     each type of tobacco product as the usual brand of the type \n     smoked or used within the past 30 days.\n       (b) Use of Product.--A child shall be considered to have \n     used a manufacturer's tobacco product if the child identifies \n     the manufacturer's tobacco product as the usual brand of \n     tobacco product smoked or used by the child within the past \n     30 days.\n       (c) Separate Types of Products.--For purposes of this \n     subtitle (except as provided in subsection 205(h)), \n     cigarettes and smokeless tobacco shall be considered separate \n     types of tobacco products.\n       (d) Confidentiality of data.--The Secretary may conduct a \n     survey relating to tobacco use involving minors. If the \n     information collected in the course of conducting the annual \n     performance survey results in the individual supplying the \n     information, or described in the information, being \n     identifiable, the information may not be used for any purpose \n     other than the purpose for which it was supplied unless that \n     individual (or that individual's guardian) consents to its \n     use for such other purposes. The information may not be \n     published or released in any other form if the individual \n     supplying the information, or described in the information, \n     is identifiable unless that individual (or that individual's \n     guardian) consents to its publication or release in other \n     form.\n       (e) Methodology.--\n       (1) In general.--The survey required by subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (A) be based on a nationally representative sample of young \n     individuals;\n       (B) measure use of each type of tobacco product within the \n     past 30 days;\n       (C) identify the usual brand of each type of tobacco \n     product used within the past 30 days; and\n       (D) permit the calculation of the actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of the tobacco products of a manufacturer) based on \n     the point estimates of the percentage of young individuals \n     reporting use of a type of tobacco product (or, in the case \n     of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use of a type of \n     the tobacco products of a manufacturer) from the annual \n     performance survey.\n       (2) Criteria for deeming point estimates correct.--Point \n     estimates under paragraph (1)(D) are deemed conclusively to \n     be correct and accurate for calculating actual percentage \n     reductions in underage use of a type of tobacco product (or, \n     in the case of the manufacturer-specific surcharge, the use \n     of a type of the tobacco products of a manufacturer) for the \n     purpose of measuring compliance with percent reduction \n     targets and calculating surcharges provided that the \n     precision of estimates (based on sampling error) of the \n     percentage of children reporting use of a type of tobacco \n     product (or, in the case of the manufacturer-specific \n     surcharge, the use of a type of the tobacco products of a \n     manufacturer) is such that the 95 percent confidence interval \n     around such point estimates is no more than plus or minus 1 \n     percent.\n       (3) Survey deemed correct, proper, and accurate.--A survey \n     using the methodology required by this subsection is deemed \n     conclusively to be proper, correct, and accurate for purposes \n     of this Act.\n       (4) Secretary may adopt different methodology.--The \n     Secretary by notice and comment rulemaking may adopt a survey \n     methodology that is different than the methodology described \n     in paragraph (1) if the different methodology is at least as \n     statistically precise as that methodology.\n       (f) Additional Measures.--In order to increase the \n     understanding of youth tobacco product use, the Secretary \n     may, for informational purposes only, add additional measures \n     to the survey under subsection (a), conduct periodic or \n     occasional surveys at other times, and conduct surveys of \n     other populations such as young adults. The results of such \n     surveys shall be made available to manufacturers and the \n     public to assist in efforts to reduce youth tobacco use.\n       (g) Technical Adjustments.--The Secretary may make \n     technical changes in the manner in which surveys are \n     conducted under this section so long as adjustments are made \n     to ensure that the results of such surveys are comparable \n     from year to year.\n\n     SEC. 204. PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Baseline Level.--The baseline level for each type of \n     tobacco product, and for each manufacturer with respect to \n     each type of tobacco product, is the percentage of children \n     determined to have used such tobacco product in the first \n     annual performance survey (in 1999).\n       (b) Industry-Wide Non-Attainment Assessments.--For the \n     purpose of determining industry-wide non-attainment \n     assessments, the performance objective for the reduction of \n     the percentage of children determined to have used each type \n     of tobacco product is the percentage in subsection (d) as \n     measured from the baseline level for such type of tobacco \n     product.\n       (c) Performance Objectives for Existing Manufacturers.--\n     Each existing manufacturer shall have as a performance \n     objective the reduction of the percentage of children \n     determined to have used each type of such manufacturer's \n     tobacco products by at least the percentage specified in \n     subsection (d) as measured from the baseline level for such \n     manufacturer for such product.\n       (d) Required Percentage Reductions.--The reductions \n     required in this subsection are as follows:\n       (1) In the case of cigarettes--\n       (A) with respect to the third and fourth annual performance \n     surveys, 20 percent;\n       (B) with respect to the fifth and sixth annual performance \n     surveys, 40 percent;\n       (C) with respect to the seventh, eighth, and ninth annual \n     performance surveys, 55 percent; and\n       (D) with respect to the 10th annual performance survey and \n     each annual performance survey thereafter, 67 percent.\n       (2) In the case of smokeless tobacco--\n       (A) with respect to the third and fourth annual performance \n     surveys, 12.5 percent;\n       (B) with respect to the fifth and sixth annual performance \n     surveys, 25 percent;\n       (C) with respect to the seventh, eighth, and ninth annual \n     performance surveys, 35 percent; and\n       (D) with respect to the 10th annual performance survey and \n     each annual performance survey thereafter, 45 percent.\n       (e) Report on Further Reductions.--The Secretary shall \n     report to Congress by the end of 2006 on the feasibility of \n     further reduction in underage tobacco use.\n       (f) Performance Objective Relative to the De Minimis \n     Level.--If the percentage of children determined to have used \n     a type of the tobacco products of an existing manufacturer in \n     an annual performance survey is equal to or less than the de \n     minimis level, the manufacturer shall be considered to have \n     achieved the applicable performance objective.\n       (g) Performance Objectives for New Manufacturers.--Each new \n     manufacturer shall have as its performance objective \n     maintaining the percentage of children determined to have \n     used each type of such manufacturer's tobacco products in \n     each annual performance survey at a level equal to or less \n     than the de minimis level for that year.\n       (h) De Minimis Level.--The de minimis level shall be 1 \n     percent of children for the applicable year.\n\n     SEC. 205. MEASURES TO HELP ACHIEVE THE PERFORMANCE \n                   OBJECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Annual Determination.--Beginning in 2001, and annually \n     thereafter, the Secretary shall, based on the annual \n     performance surveys conducted under section 203, determine if \n     the performance objectives for each type of tobacco product \n     under section 204 has been achieved and if each manufacturer \n     has achieved the applicable performance objective under \n     section 204. The Secretary shall publish in the Federal \n     Register such determinations and any appropriate additional \n     information regarding actions taken under this section.\n       (b) Industry-Wide Non-Attainment Assessments.--\n       (1) Industry-wide non-attainment percentage.--The Secretary \n     shall determine the industry-wide non-attainment percentage, \n     if any, for cigarettes and for smokeless tobacco for each \n     calendar year.\n       (2) Non-attainment assessment for cigarettes.--For each \n     calendar year in which the performance objective under \n     section 204(b)

surcharges imposed under paragraph (3).\n       (5) Surcharge liability among manufacturers.--A tobacco \n     product manufacturer shall be liable under this subsection to \n     one or more other manufacturers if the plaintiff tobacco \n     product manufacturer establishes by a preponderance of the \n     evidence that the defendant tobacco product manufacturer, \n     through its acts or omissions, was responsible for a \n     disproportionate share of the non-attainment surcharge as \n     compared to the responsibility of the plaintiff manufacturer.\n       (6) Exemptions for small manufacturers.--\n       (A) Allocation by market share.--The Secretary shall \n     allocate the assessments under this subsection according to \n     each manufacturer's share of the domestic cigarette or \n     domestic smokeless tobacco market, as appropriate, in the \n     year for which the surcharge is being assessed, based on \n     actual Federal excise tax payments.\n       (B) Exemption.--In any year in which a surcharge is being \n     assessed, the Secretary shall exempt from payment any tobacco \n     product manufacturer with less than 1 percent of the domestic \n     market share for a specific category of tobacco product \n     unless the Secretary finds that the manufacturer's products \n     are used by underage individuals at a rate equal to or \n     greater than the manufacturer's total market share for the \n     type of tobacco product.\n       (c) Manufacturer-Specific Surcharges.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Secretary determines that the \n     required percentage reduction in use of a type of tobacco \n     product has not been achieved by a manufacturer for a year, \n     the Secretary shall impose a surcharge on such manufacturer \n     under this paragraph.\n       (2) Cigarettes.--For each calendar year in which a \n     cigarette manufacturer fails to achieve the performance \n     objective under section 204(c), the Secretary shall assess a \n     surcharge on that manufacturer in an amount equal to the \n     manufacturer's share of youth incidence for cigarettes \n     multiplied by the following surcharge level:\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     If the non-attainment percentage for the manufacturer is:

purposes \n     of this subsection, the them ``manufacturer's share of youth \n     incidence'' means--\n       (A) for cigarettes, the percentage of all youth smokers \n     determined to have used that manufacturer's cigarettes; and\n       (B) for smokeless tobacco products, the percentage of all \n     youth users of smokeless tobacco products determined to have \n     used that manufacturer's smokeless tobacco products.\n       (5) De minimis levels.--If a manufacturer is a new \n     manufacturer or the manufacturer's baseline level for a type \n     of tobacco product is less than the de minimis level, the \n     non-attainment percentage (for purposes of paragraph (2) or \n     (3)) shall be equal to the number of percentage points by \n     which the percentage of children who used the manufacturer's \n     tobacco products of the applicable type exceeds the de \n     minimis level.\n       (d) Surcharges To Be Adjusted for Inflation.--\n       (1) In general.--Beginning with the fourth calendar year \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, each dollar amount \n     in the tables in subsections (b)(2), (b)(3), (c)(2), and \n     (c)(3) shall be increased by the inflation adjustment.\n       (2) Inflation adjustment.--For purposes of paragraph (1), \n     the inflation adjustment for any calendar year is the \n     percentage (if any) by which--\n       (A) the CPI for the preceding calendar year; exceeds\n       (B) the CPI for the calendar year 1998.\n       (3) CPI.--For purposes of paragraph (2), the CPI for any \n     calendar year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for \n     all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.\n       (4) Rounding.--If any increase determined under paragraph \n     (1) is not a multiple of $1,000, the increase shall be \n     rounded to the nearest multiple of $1,000.\n       (e) Method of Surcharge Assessment.--The Secretary shall \n     assess a surcharge for a specific calendar year on or before \n     May 1 of the subsequent calendar year. Surcharge payments \n     shall be paid on or before July 1 of the year in which they \n     are assessed. The Secretary may establish, by regulation, \n     interest at a rate up to 3 times the prevailing prime rate at \n     the time the surcharge is assessed, and additional charges in \n     an amount up to 3 times the surcharge, for late payment of \n     the surcharge.\n       (f) Business Expense Deduction.--In order to maximize the \n     financial deterrent effect of the assessments and surcharges \n     established in this section, any such payment shall not be \n     deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense or \n     otherwise under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (g) Procedures.--In assessing price increase assessments \n     and enforcing other measures under this section, the \n     Secretary shall have in place procedures to take into account \n     the effect that the margin of error of the annual performance \n     survey may have on the amounts assessed to or measures \n     required of such manufacturers.\n       (h) Other Products.--The Secretary shall promulgate \n     regulations establishing performance objectives for the \n     reduction of the use by children of other products made or \n     derived from tobacco and intended for human consumption if \n     significant percentages of children use or begin to use such \n     products and the inclusion of such products as types of \n     tobacco products under this subtitle would help protect the \n     public health. Such regulations shall contain provisions, \n     consistent with the provisions in this subtitle applicable to \n     cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, for the application of \n     assessments and surcharges to achieve reductions in the \n     percentage of children who use such products.\n       (i) Appeal Rights.--The amount of any surcharge is \n     committed to the sound discretion of the Secretary and shall \n     be subject to judicial review by the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, based on the \n     arbitrary and capricious standard of section 706(2)(A) of \n     title 5, United States Code. Notwithstanding any other \n     provisions of law, no court shall have authority to stay any \n     surcharge payments due the Secretary under this Act pending \n     judicial review.\n       (j) Responsibility for Agents.--In any action brought under \n     this subsection, a tobacco product manufacturer shall be held \n     responsible for any act or omission of its attorneys, \n     advertising agencies, or other agents that contributed to \n     that manufacturer's responsibility for the surcharge assessed \n     under this section.\n\n     SEC. 206.

Mr. president, I rise today to congratulate the \nUniversity of Maryland women's lacrosse team on winning their fourth \nconsecutive national championship by beating the number one-ranked \nUniversity of Virginia, 11-5. Simply put, this is unprecedented in the \nhistory of women's lacrosse. The Maryland women's lacrosse team is the \nonly team in NCAA Division I history to accomplish this remarkable \nfeat. As the Senator for Maryland, I couldn't be more proud.\n  Because lacrosse is the unofficial state sport of Maryland, the \nTerrapins' championship is especially sweet for people in my home \nstate. You see, in Maryland, we love our lacrosse, and it seems like \nthe Maryland women's lacrosse team always comes through for us. This \nyear, Maryland made its 15th ninth consecutive NCAA Final Four \nappearance, advanced to the championship game for the fifth consecutive \nyear, played its record-setting 29th tournament game, won its record-\nsetting 21st tournament game, won its fifth national championship in \nthe last seven years, and won its record-setting 21st tournament game, \nwon its fifth national championship in the last seven years, and won \nits seventh national championship overall.\n  Five Terps were named to the NCAA All-Tournament team, including \nCollege Lacrosse USA Division I Woman Player of the Year Sascha \nNewmarch, Kathleen Lund, Alex Kahoe, Tonia Porras, and Cathy Nelson, \nwho was honored as the tournament MVP. The Terps were led by head coach \nCindy Timchal, who has a 203-51 career record and is the third-\nwinningest coach in women's lacrosse history. Too often, women's sports \ngo unnoticed. However, every single member of this fabulous team \ndeserves to be recognized--not only for their championship, but for \nexemplifying what college athletics are all about.\n  Mr. President, I'm sure you can see why Maryland is so proud of its \nTerrapins. Like so many lacrosse fans in my home state, I can't wait \nuntil next season.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5991-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5991-S5992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HAMPTON HIGH SCHOOL OF ALLISON PARK PENNSYLVANIA\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, on May 2 through May 4, 1998, \nmore than 1200 students from across the nation came to Washington, DC, \nto compete in the national finals of the ``We the People. . . The \nCitizens and the Constitution'' program. I am proud to announce that \nthe class from Hampton High School of Allison Park represented \nPennsylvania. These young scholars worked diligently to reach the \nnational finals by winning local competitions in Pennsylvania, and \nultimately won the Northeastern States Regional Award.\n  The distinguished members of the class representing Pennsylvania \nwere: Angela Ambrose, Rebecca Amrhein, Aren Bierkan, Christine Brady, \nHeather Gahagan, Emily Huie, Jessica Kiefer, Lauren Klemens, Jessica \nLin, Rina Mansukhani, Lauren Montgomery, Laura Ostapenko, Andrew \nScharff, Christian Spearline, Courtney Vetter and Katrina Werger.\n  I would also like to recognize their teacher, Mrs. Tara O'Brien, who \ndeserves much credit for the success of the class. The district \ncoordinator, Ms. Jennie-Lynn Knox, and the state coordinator, Ms. \nChristine Crist, also contributed much time and effort to help the \nclass reach the national finals.\n  The ``We the People. . . The Citizen and the Constitution'' program \nis the most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The three day national competition simulates a \ncongressional hearing whereby students are given the opportunity to\n\n[[Page S5992]]\n\ndemonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend \npositions on relevant historical and contemporary constitutional \nissues. The simulated congressional hearing consists of oral \npresentations by the students before panels of judges.\n  Administered by the Center for Civic Education, the ``We the People. \n. .'' program has provided curricular materials at upper elementary, \nmiddle, and high school levels for more than 75,000 teachers and 24 \nmillion students nationwide. Members of Congress and their staff \nenhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with \nteachers and students.\n  The ``We the People. . .'' program is designed to help students \nachieve a reasoned commitment to the fundamental values and principles \nthat bind Americans together as a people. The program also fosters \ncivic dispositions, traits of public and private sector character \nconducive to effective and responsible participation in politics and \ngovernment.\n  I congratulate these constitutional experts from Hampton High School \nfor their success in the ``We the People. . .'' competition and commend \nthem for their great achievement of winning the Northeastern Regional \nAward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5991-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VIOLENCE IN KOSOVO\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my grave \nconcern, and that of my constituents, regarding the escalating violence \nin Kosovo. Fighting between Serbs and the majority ethnic-Albanian \npopulation in Kosovo has been on-going since Kosovo was declared to be \npart of Serbia in 1989.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the safety of ethnic \nAlbanians, many of whom have been murdered or forced to flee their \nhomes by the ethnically-motivated attacks by the minority-Serb \npopulation. I am also concerned that this latest round of ethnic \nfighting in the Balkans could reignite unrest throughout the region.\n  The fighting intensified in late February of this year, and has been \nspiraling across Kosovo ever since. During the weekend of February 28 \nalone, approximately 30 people were killed there. When ethnic Albanians \nmarched in the provincial capital of Pristina to protest these \nkillings, they were met by Serb riot police armed with water cannon, \nclubs, and tear gas.\n  Since this latest wave of fighting began, a total of more than 200 \nethnic Albanians, including women and children, have been killed, and \nmore than 10,000 have fled into neighboring Albania. In early March, 22 \nmembers of the Jashari family were massacred on their farm in Prekaz. \nDuring the last weekend in May, at least 39 people were killed. These \nare but a few examples of the senseless bloodshed that has occurred in \nKosovo during the last three months.\n  Day after day, the world is witness to this brutal fighting through \ntelevision and print media coverage of the events in Kosovo. We saw the \npictures from the massacre at Prekaz. We have seen soldiers in \nhelicopters shooting at people trying to flee across the border into \nAlbania. These pictures have an eerie resemblance to those from Bosnia, \nRwanda, and other places where ethnic fighting has occurred in this \ndecade.\n  The latest wave of fighting in Kosovo has been marked by an increase \nin violence and militancy. There is no question that there have been \ncasualties on both sides of this conflict. What is troubling, however, \nis that very few of these casualties have been combatants fighting for \ntheir cause. Instead, the majority of the dead have been innocent \ncivilians, many of them women and children. And most of these civilians \nhave been killed simply because they happened to be Albanian.\n  I am pleased that the United States has contributed funding to the \nYugoslav War Crimes Tribunal to begin an investigation into the \ninvolvement of Serbian forces in the violence in Kosovo.\n  I am also pleased that U.S. envoys Richard Holbrooke and Robert \nGelbard, who traveled to the region last month, have been able to bring \nthe two sides to the table to discuss their differences.\n  I was pleased that the first round of talks between Yugoslav \nPresident Slobodan Milosevic and Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, \nwhich took place on May 15, opened a dialogue between the ethnic \nAlbanians and the Serb government in Belgrade.\n  I was also hopeful that the May 29 meeting between President Clinton \nand Mr. Rugova would bolster attempts to reach a diplomatic solution to \nthis on-going crisis.\n  Unfortunately, the promise of the May 15 talks has been followed by \ncontinuing violence and attacks on civilians by the Serbian police and \nmilitary. Today, the United States joined the European Union in issuing \na ban on all new investment in Serbia and by freezing the assets of the \nMilosevic government. The U.S. had delayed the implementation of these \nsanctions prior to the May 15 talks, but now there is little choice but \nto impose these sanctions. I hope that these sanctions will help to \nstem the violence and bring the two sides back to the table.\n  The leaders on all sides of this conflict should not allow the \nescalating violence to derail plans for negotiations. While there \nremain many issues to resolve, I believe that only through continuing \nnegotiations can a sustainable settlement be ironed out. I hope that \npeople on all sides of this conflict are able to put aside their \nfeelings of nationalism and ethnic pride and work together to achieve a \npeaceful solution to this situation before more innocent blood is shed, \nand before the fighting spreads into other areas of the \nBalkans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5992-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SUBMITTING CHANGES TO THE BUDGET RESOLUTION AGGREGATES AND \n                  APPROPRIAITONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATION\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.

Their problems have become his problems, as he passionately \nadvocated their causes. Using his vast knowledge of zoning and land use \nlaw, Don has provided significant services to churches, synagogues and \nother non-profit institutions throughout the Metropolitan Detroit area. \nHe has been recognized by these appreciative clients for the zeal with \nwhich he has furthered their interests, often taking no compensation \nfor his work.\n  Don Barris has been a generous benefactor of the Wayne State \nUniversity Law School. He provided the funds for a student lounge named \nafter his late wife, Miriam, and has contributed substantial resources \nto expand the Law School's computer laboratory. The Donald E. Barris \nTrial Practice Fund was established at the Law School by his law firm \nto honor his legal talents and many contributions to Wayne State.\n  It is a pleasure to recognize and honor Donald E. Barris, a great \nlawyer and a great humanitarian, on the occasion of his 80th \nbirthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5992-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECOGNITION OF SUSAN CARLSON\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I take a moment today to express my \ngratitude and offer my congratulations to Susan Carlson, the First Lady \nof the State of Minnesota.\n  Susan Carlson will be honored tonight with a Leadership Award from \nthe National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome for her work as the \nCo-Chair of the Governor's Task Force on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. \nThrough the efforts of Mrs. Carlson, Minnesota is one of the first \nstates to put in place a comprehensive plan to prevent Fetal Alcohol \nSyndrome and improve the quality of life for those already affected by \nFetal Alcohol Syndrome.\n  As we all know, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is perhaps the most \npreventable contributor to our nation's ever-increasing health care \ncosts. Low-birth weights, which lead to health complications for \ninfants, developmental disabilities, and learning disabilities \nrepresent the tragic results of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. \nClearly, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is preventable and we spare a great \ndeal of future pain by educating expectant mothers and their families \nabout the risks associated with alcohol during pregnancy. In its \ncampaign to eliminate Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, the National Organization \non Fetal Alcohol Syndrome combines national and community-based \nawareness and educational programs with resource and referral \nclearinghouses.\n  Mr. President, again, I congratulate and thank Mrs. Carlson for her \nefforts. Minnesotans are fortunate to have her leadership on the \nimportant issue of preventing Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5993-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO U.S. ATTORNEY ALAN D. BERSIN\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nAlan Bersin, a valued colleague and extraordinary public servant. \nDuring his four and half years as United States Attorney for the \nSouthern District of California, the office became one of the premier \nprosecutorial offices in the country. Under Alan Bersin's leadership \nthe caseload was transformed from one dominated by misdemeanor \nprosecutions to the largest number of felony prosecutions in the \nnation.\n  As the chief law enforcement officer along the most populous sector \nof the Southwest Border with Mexico, Alan Bersin has made border \nenforcement his highest priority, and is perhaps best known for his \nwork as the Attorney General's Special Representative for Southwest \nBorder Issues. He was appointed to the position in October 1995 at a \ntime when the government was seeking new leadership and energy to deal \nwith the proliferation of illegal activity along the southwest border \nwhich had become the principal corridor for smuggling of aliens and \ndrugs into the country. Alan Bersin targeted for prosecution the large \ndrug distributors and cartels on both sides of the border, and the \nrepeat border crossers with felony records. He also coordinated \nresources in a manner never before attempted. Largely as a result of \nthese strategic approaches, crime in the Southern District of \nCalifornia decreased 40 percent during Alan Bersin's tenure.\n  Shortly after taking office in 1994, Alan Bersin reached an historic \naccord with the San Diego District Attorney whereby the county, for the \nfirst time in San Diego history, prosecuted drug smuggling case which \nhad a San Diego nexus. This has resulted in a dramatic increase in \nborder drug smuggling prosecutions that is unprecedented, and has \nallowed the federal government to use its unique resources such as wire \ntap authority, to focus on the more serious violators. Alan Bersin also \nhelped create a Specialized Drug Enforcement Operation in Imperial \nValley which served as a prime trafficking route of the Mexican drug \ncartels. The special enforcement unit involves 17 federal, state and \nlocal drug-related law enforcement agencies, the California National \nGuard and the Department of Defense. Alan Bersin's ability to bring \ntogether enforcement agencies at all levels to cooperate in a number of \nsuccessful enforcement initiatives has been praised by local, state and \nfederal law enforcement leaders. Also, his ability to coordinate with \nour neighbor to the South has been most extraordinary. He worked \ntirelessly to bridge the cultural and political divide in a way that \nenabled both countries to see that it was in their best interests to \nfind areas of mutual concern and work together to the maximum extent \nfeasible, even though there are other areas on which we will continue \nto disagree.\n  As the patterns of illegal migration changed in response to increased \nlaw enforcement personnel and resources, criminal activity moved to new \nareas along the border. Under Alan Bersin's leadership both countries \nimplemented collaborative programs to prevent criminal activity and to \napprehend criminals who oftentimes preyed upon undocumented aliens. \nAlan Bersin also oversaw the creation of a civil rights working group \ncomprised of federal law enforcement, immigrant rights' advocacy groups \nfrom San Diego and Tijuana, the Mexican Consulate in San Diego, the \nU.S. Consulate in Tijuana and the United States Attorney's Office to \nbring to the table all those affected by or involved in the enforcement \nof civil rights laws. The group provides assistance to investigators in \nlocating evidence on both sides of the border to prove allegations of \nabuse. Other innovative programs launched during Alan Bersin's tenure \ninclude helping to establish a Binational Environmental Laboratory to \nfacilitate the investigation and prosecution of environmental cases in \nMexico and the U.S.\n  Mexico is not the only sovereignty with whom Alan Bersin negotiated \nwell and successfully. At a time when Indian gaming was becoming an \nenormously difficult and controversial issue in California, and aspects \nof the issue were being litigated in both state and federal courts, \nAlan Bersin managed to maintain a level playing field on a government \nto government basis between the State of California and the Native \nAmerican tribes of San Diego County.\n  Finally, in addition to the official law enforcement achievements \nduring the last four years, Alan Bersin has added a new dimension to \npublic service. By example and by encouragement, he has increased \nenormously the involvement of his staff in community projects, ranging \nfrom training programs to mentoring and public outreach. His commitment \nto the community will continue as he begins a new career as \nSuperintendent of Schools for the San Diego Unified School District. I \nam confident he will bring to that position the same vision, inspiring \nleadership and commitment which made him such an outstanding United \nStates Attorney. He has brought great credit to his office, to the \nJustice Department and to the nation. Congratulations Alan, and best \nwishes for every success as Superintendent of the San Diego Unified \nSchool District.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5993-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5993-S5994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    POLITICAL TRANSITION IN NIGERIA\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to note the death of \nNigeria's\n\n[[Page S5994]]\n\nmilitary ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, yesterday in Abuja, the capital city \nof Nigeria. Although the circumstances surrounding his death remain \nunclear, it is my hope that his death will provide an opportunity for a \nnew era in Nigeria.\n  As the Ranking Democrat of the Senate Subcommittee on Africa, I have \nlong been concerned about the collapsing economic and political \nsituation in Nigeria. Nigeria, with its rich history, abundant natural \nresources and wonderful cultural diversity, has the potential to be an \nimportant regional leader. But, sadly, it has squandered that potential \nand the good will of the world with repressive policies, human rights \nabuses and corruption, all of which proliferated during Abacha's \ntenure.\n  Although there was no clear line of succession, Nigeria's top \nmilitary leaders met into the night yesterday to select Gen. Abdulsalam \nAbubukar as the new head of state. We do not know much about Gen. \nAbubukar, but we know that he has an historic opportunity to effect \nreal political change for the country.\n  Last month, I introduced the Nigerian Democracy and Civil Society \nEmpowerment Act (S. 2102). The provisions of my bill include benchmarks \ndefining what would constitute an open political process in Nigeria. I \ncall on Gen. Abubukar to implement as soon as possible some of these \nimportant changes, such as the repeal of the repressive decrees enacted \nunder Abacha's rule, so that genuine reform can finally take place in \nNigeria. The new leadership should demonstrate respect for the rights \nof all Nigerians to express their views. Most importantly, Gen. \nAbubukar should take advantage of this opportunity to immediately move \ntoward free and fair elections and unconditionally release all \npolitical prisoners, including the winner of the annulled 1993 \nelections, Chief Moshood K.O. Abiola.\n  Abacha's death should represent not just a change in leadership, but \nought to result in real change for the average Nigerian.\n  Finally, I believe the United States should take a clear and public \nstand to demonstrate its support for a clear transition to civilian \nrule in Nigeria. Now is the time for the United States to make \nunequivocally clear that the military should exercise restraint in the \nnear and long term, begin to build bridges to the pro-democracy forces, \nand do everything possible to end the current political crisis and \nrestore legitimacy to the Nigerian government.\n  I urge the Administration to communicate these sentiments quickly to \nNigeria's new leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5993-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JUNE SALANDER\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJune Salander of Rutland, Vermont. On May 9, 1998 June Salander \ncelebrated her bat mitzvah at the remarkable age of 89. Mrs. Salander \nis a dear neighbor, mentor, and friend from my days growing up in \nRutland, Vermont. It is believed she is the oldest Rutlander to \ncelebrate a bat mitzvah. Over a hundred people attended the ceremony, \none of many indicators of the inspiration she is to her family, \nfriends, community, and faith.\n  Born in 1908 in Poland, June Salander came to America in 1920 to New \nYork City with her family via Ellis Island. In 1941 she married her \nhusband and moved to Vermont where she has resided ever since. In her \nmany years as a citizen of Rutland she has been an active member of the \ncommunity. She has served as a volunteer at the Rutland Jewish Center, \nas a Hebrew School teacher, and at the Rutland Hospital with the Grey \nLadies.\n  In addition to filling the role as a bedrock member of her community \nshe has also filled many stomachs with her famous cooking. Her strudel \nis legendary throughout the area and to the many people traveling \nthrough who she has opened her home to over the years. Her strudel \nrecipe was even featured in a cookbook containing Jewish recipes honed \nin the United States. I can personally attest to the greatness of June \nSalander's cooking as I was able to eat breakfast at the Salanders when \nI was growing up as a boy on Kingsley Avenue in Rutland. She continues \nto teach cooking informally and will appear on a cooking video that \nwill air on PBS in the near future.\n  Perhaps her most admirable quality is the energy she continues to \ndisplay as she reaches her golden years. For some it means an idle time \nin their life but not for June Salander. When she was sixty-two she \nreceived her real estate license and remained active until recently. \nShe picked up tennis when she was seventy-three and played for almost \nten years. This fall she will travel all the way to Israel to attend \nthe wedding of a niece.\n  I am glad my wife Liz was able to attend June's bat mitzvah on that \nSaturday and pass on our well wishes to June. I also wish her well as \nshe approaches her ninetieth birthday on June 28, 1998. Mr. President, \nI would like to publicly recognize June's upstanding citizenship and \nthe inspiration she is to the rest of us as she continues to embrace \nlife into her nineties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5994-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO JACQUELYN BENSON AND ALEXANDER KAUFMAN 1998 UNITED STATES \n                         PRESIDENTIAL SCHOLARS\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Jacquelyn Benson and Alexander Kaufman of New Hampshire for \nbeing named 1998 United States Presidential Scholars.\n  Jacquelyn Benson is a student at Winnacunnet High School in Hampton \nFalls, New Hampshire, and has been active in her school's National \nHonor Society and Art Department. Jacquelyn plays the piano, is \ncurrently working on a book of fiction, and plans to attend \nNortheastern University in the fall. She chose Ms. Toni Talas as her \nmost influential teacher.\n  Alexander Kaufman is also a 1998 Presidential Scholar. As a student \nat Phillips Exeter Academy in Dover, New Hampshire, Alexander has \nexcelled in writing and math and was the editor of the school's poetry \njournal. He is also active in environmental issues and will be \nattending Harvard University in the fall. Alexander selected the late \nFrederick Tremallo as his most influential teacher.\n  The United States Presidential Scholars Program was established in \n1964, by Executive Order of President Johnson, to recognize and honor \nsome of our nation's most distinguished graduating high school seniors. \nEach year, the White House Commission on Presidential Scholars selects \nup to 141 Scholars on the basis of their accomplishments in many areas: \nacademic and artistic success, scholarship, leadership, and involvement \nin school and community. The Commission invites the students to \nWashington, DC, to be honored for their accomplishments during National \nRecognition Week.\n  The Scholars, as guests of the Commission, along with their families \nand the teachers whom the Scholars have chosen as the ``most \ninfluential'' in their academic and artistic endeavors, will be \ninvolved in many activities while in Washington, DC. They will \nparticipate in informative panel discussions, a ceremony sponsored by \nthe White House, a reception and art exhibit of the work by Scholars in \nthe Visual Arts at the National Museum for American Art, and an evening \nat the Kennedy Center featuring performances by the Scholars in the \nPerforming Arts.\n  As a former teacher and school board chairman, I recognize the \nchallenges involved in providing students a quality education. \nCongratulations to Jacquelyn and Alexander for their distinguished \nrecognition. I am pleased they have been recognized for their success \nand it is with great pleasure that I represent them in the United \nStates Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5994-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5994-S5995]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO MRS.

I join Grace's family, \nfriends, and co-workers in thanking her for a job well done!\n  Grace was born on July 29, 1910 in Deer Lodge, Montana. She was one \nof nine children. Early on, here family moved to the Canton Valley \noutside of Townsend, Montana. She married Carter Babcock in 1930. They \nbecame\n\n[[Page S5995]]\n\nthe proud parents of two girls, Marilyn and Joyce. In 1941, the family \nmoved to Helena. Although Carter died in 1970, Grace kept the family \ngoing.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nfallen hero. His name is Donald Bodette and he passed away last August \n10th after a long battle with cancer. However, his legacy lives on and \nhe will be honored on June 14th at the Dodge Development Center in \nRutland.\n  Don retired from the Marine Corps in 1968 and received a Purple Heart \nfor wounds sustained in Vietnam. For those of us who knew Don, This \ninformation was a well kept secret. He was never inclined to tell you \nabout his heroics. He did tell war stories as a way to draw other \nVietnam Veterans out of their isolation. Don's theory was a very simple \none and is the premise used today to help Vietnam Veterans worldwide--\ndiscussing traumatic war experiences with another veteran with a \nsimilar experience is the best way to heal.\n  An article in The Rutland Herald on August 12, 1997 announced that \nDonny had passed away, at age 48, at the VA hospital in White River \nJunction. As I read, I was struck by some of the tales recounted by his \nfellow veterans. Three of Don's best friends, Jake Jacobsen, Albert \nTrombley and Clark Howland, talked about meeting Don through a \nnewspaper ad that only said, ``Vietnam Veterans, we need to talk.'' \nAccording to Trombley, ``He didn't have any master plan. He would stop \nand look for people, he would put advertisements in the paper to get \nveterans to come out, and once he found one or two, they would find two \nor three. He got all around the state of Vermont.''\n  In the late 1970s, Don was instrumental in shaping the course of a \nfledgling organization known as the Vietnam Veterans of America (VA). \nHe believed that the VA should be more than an activist group, and Don \nwas so successful in his efforts to establish local chapters that \nRutland, Vermont boasts the first VA chapter in the country. According \nto Jake Jacobsen, ``Donny and I never worried about membership. If \nwe're good enough, they'll want to join us.''\n  Don helped found the Veterans Assistance Office (VAO) in Rutland \nsixteen years ago. It was designed as a non-profit community based \norganization to support veterans in a variety of different ways. The \nVAO still serves in that capacity today. The VAO's current director, \nClark Howland, says of Bodette, ``I owe him a lot. He helped an unknown \nnumber. I'd say it would run in the thousands of veterans. And what \nwe're doing now is just to carry on for what Donny started.''\n  Farewell Don. Your legacy of service will live on through your \nselfless acts that improved the lives of countless Vermont \nveterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5995-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5995-S5997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CBO COST ESTIMATE--S. 1275\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI.

The estimate has since been received and I ask that it be \nprinted in the Record for the information of the Senate.\n  The cost estimate follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 1998.\n     Hon. Frank H.

The CBO staff contacts are John R. \n     Righter (for federal costs), Marc Nicole (for the state and \n     local impact), and Ralph Smith (for the private-sector \n     impact).\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n       Enclosure.\n     S. 1275--Northern Mariana Islands Covenant Implementation Act\n       Summary: S. 1275 would amend the covenant act between the \n     United States and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands (CNMI), a territory of the United States, to reform \n     the immigration laws of CNMI, It also would establish a \n     special committee to set minimum wage rates by industry \n     within CNMI. The estimated cost of S. 1275 depends on whether \n     the Attorney General would elect to apply the provisions of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to CNMI. If the \n     Attorney General (AG) decided not to apply the INA, CBO \n     estimates that, on average, implementing S. 1275 would \n     increase annual costs by less than $500,000, subject to \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts. If the AG did apply \n     the INA, as modified for CNMI by S. 1275, CBO estimates that, \n     subject to appropriation of the necessary amounts, \n     implementing S. 1275 would increase costs--mostly at the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)--by less than \n     $500,000 in fiscal year 1999 and a total of between $7 \n     million and $8 million over the 1999-2003 period.\n       In addition to the increase in discretionary costs, S. 1275 \n     also could affect direct spending if the AG applies the INA \n     to CNMI; consequently, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply. \n     CBO estimates, however, that any change in direct spending \n     would have no significant net budgetary impact each year.\n       S. 1275 contains intergovernmental mandates as defined in \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) because the bill \n     would preempt the immigration and minimum wage laws of CNMI. \n     CBO estimates that the costs of such mandates would not be \n     significant and that the threshold for intergovernmental \n     mandates established in UMRA ($50 million in 1996, adjusted \n     annually for inflation) would not be exceeded.\n       S. 1275 contains private-sector mandates as defined in \n     UMRA. Section 2 would impose a mandate on employers by \n     limiting the number of temporary alien workers who could be \n     legally present in CNMI. Section 3 would impose a mandate on \n     employers by increasing the minimum wage which they would be \n     required to pay their employees; the amount of the \n     mandated increases in wages would be determined by an \n     industry committee established as a result of enactment of \n     this legislation. CBO cannot determine whether the direct \n     cost to employers of those mandates would exceed the $100 \n     million inflation-adjusted annual threshold specified in \n     UMRA.\n       Description of the bill's major provisions: Within one year \n     of enactment, S. 1275 would require that the AG determine \n     whether CNMI possesses the institutional capacity to \n     administer its own system of immigration control, consistent \n     with minimum safeguards selected by the AG, and the will and \n     commitment to enforce the system of immigration control. \n     During this period, the bill would limit the number of \n     temporary alien workers on CNMI to the number of individuals \n     present at the date of enactment. If the AG determines that \n     CNMI has both the institutional capacity and the commitment, \n     then the INA would not take effect, although the bill would \n     require that the AG make a new determination every three \n     years thereafter.\n       If the AG determines that CNMI lacks either the \n     institutional capacity or the political will to enforce its \n     own system of immigration control, the bill would require \n     that\n\n[[Page S5996]]\n\n     the Department of Justice (DOJ) develop a program to phase-in \n     the INA, as modified for CNMI by S. 1275, over a period of no \n     more than 10 years. The transition period would begin six \n     months after the AG's determination. The program would \n     include procedures for issuing visas to nonimmigrant \n     temporary alien workers, family-sponsored immigrants, and \n     employment-based immigrants. S. 1275 would allow CNMI to \n     request that the federal government exempt certain family-\n     sponsored and employment-based immigrant visas from certain \n     limitations established by the INA.\n       For temporary alien workers who would not otherwise be \n     eligible for admission into CNMI, S. 1275 would require that \n     DOL establish and administer a system for issuing a \n     decreasing number of annual permits to employers allowing \n     them to hire such individuals during the transition period. \n     The bill would authorize DOL to charge employers a fee for \n     the permits; however, DOL could only use amounts collected \n     from such fees to the extent authority was provided in \n     advance by appropriations. To allow for the admission of \n     temporary alien workers, the bill would authorize the \n     Department of State to issue nonimmigrant visas.\n       To help implement the INA, S. 1275 would require that DOL \n     and the Department of the Interior (DOI) develop a program to \n     assist employers in hiring employees who are citizens of the \n     U.S. or the freely associated states (Federated States of \n     Micronesia, Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the \n     Republic of Palau). The bill also would authorize DOL and DOJ \n     to establish and maintain operations in the CNMI. Within five \n     and one-half years of enactment, the bill would require that \n     the President report to the Congress on the effectiveness of \n     the Administration's efforts to implement the INA in CNMI.\n       In addition to the provisions affecting immigration \n     control, S. 1275 would establish a special committee to \n     determine minimum wage rates by industry for CNMI. The CNMI \n     committee would be modeled after similar committees \n     established in American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin \n     Islands. The committee would review wage rates once each \n     biennium until such rates are equal to the minimum wage of \n     the United States. In setting each rate, the bill would \n     require that the committee consider the effect of the change \n     on the industry's level of employment. In any event, S. 1275 \n     would limit the amount of any annual increase to 50 cents.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     cost of S. 1275 depends on whether the AG would require that \n     the INA be applied to CNMI. On the one hand, if the AG \n     decides not to apply the INA, we estimate that implementing \n     the bill would increase annual costs, on average, by less \n     than $500,000, subject to appropriation of the necessary \n     amounts.\n       On the other hand, if the AG decides to apply the INA, we \n     estimate that, subject to appropriation of the necessary \n     amounts, implementing S. 1275 would increase costs by a total \n     of between $7 million and $8 million over the fiscal year \n     1999-2003 period. In addition, beginning in fiscal year 2000, \n     S. 1275 would decrease net direct spending by less than \n     $500,000 each year.\n       The estimated budgetary impact of the bill is shown in the \n     following table. The costs of this legislation fall within \n     budget functions 800 (general government), 750 \n     (administration of justice), 500 (education, training, \n     employment, and social services), and 150 (international \n     affairs).\n\n                [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   1999    2000    2001    2002    2003\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n   COST IF THE IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT IS NOT APPLIED TO CNMI\n \nSpending subject to\n appropriation:\n    Estimated authorization        (\\1\\)   (\\1\\)   (\\1\\)   (\\1\\)   (\\1\\)\n     level......................\n    Estimated outlays...........

The amounts necessary \n     will depend on whether the INA is applied to CNMI.\n     Estimated cost if the Justice Department does not apply the \n         INA to CNMI\n       The increase in costs from not applying the INA would \n     result primarily from establishing the special committee to \n     determine minimum wage rates for CNMI. Based on information \n     from DOL, we estimate that the committee would cost between \n     $500,000 and $1 million every two years, or less than \n     $500,000, on average, each year. In addition, DOJ would incur \n     minor costs in fiscal years 1999 and 2002 to review CNMI's \n     system of immigration control.\n     Estimated cost if the Justice Department applies the INA to \n         CNMI\n       S. 1275 could result in additional costs if the AG applies \n     the INA to CNMI. The bill also could reduce direct spending \n     under this scenario; however, CBO estimates that the net \n     reduction in direct spending would total less than $500,000 a \n     year.\n       Immigration and Naturalization Service.--The increase in \n     costs from applying the INA would result primarily from the \n     INS administering the INA in CNMI, including the cost to \n     relocate and hire the necessary personnel to handle \n     immigration inspections, investigations, adjudications, and \n     deportations. Based on information provided by the INS, we \n     estimate that applying the INA would gradually increase its \n     annual costs from about $500,000 in fiscal year 2000 to about \n     $3 million in fiscal year 2003. That estimate assumes that \n     the INS would phase in its operations over several years, \n     eventually stationing around 40 people on CNMI. (By \n     comparison, the INS currently spends about $5.7 million \n     annually to station 82 employees on nearby Guam, another U.S. \n     territory that has a considerably larger population than does \n     CNMI, although its population is situated on a single \n     island.) According to the INS, about half of the estimated \n     costs would be financed from the collection of additional \n     user fees, which could be spent without further \n     appropriation. The other half of costs, which we estimate \n     would increase from less than $500,000 in fiscal year 2000 to \n     about $1.5 million in fiscal year 2003, would be subject to \n     availability of appropriated funds.\n       Other Agencies.--Under this scenario, DOL would incur costs \n     to issue permits to certain employers. Based on information \n     provided by DOL, CBO estimates that implementing the permit \n     system would not affect DOL's budget in fiscal year 1999 but \n     would increase its costs by several hundred thousand dollars \n     a year in 2000 through 2003. In addition, we estimate that \n     DOL would collect an equivalent amount of permit fees each \n     year, which would decrease direct spending. (The department \n     would not be able to spend receipts from the new fees without \n     appropriation.)\n       According to DOI, the federal government already is \n     providing technical assistance to CNMI, and thus, the \n     provision requiring that it and DOL assist employers in CNMI \n     would not significantly increase federal costs. In addition, \n     DOL and DOJ already have some personnel stationed in CNMI and \n     would increase their personnel anyway to implement the INA. \n     Thus, CBO estimates that authorizing the agencies to \n     establish and maintain operations in CNMI would have no \n     budgetary impact in this case.\n       Finally, based on information provided by the Department of \n     State, we estimate that, subject to available funds, \n     implementing S. 1275 would increase its annual costs by less \n     than $100,000 in fiscal year 2000 and by between $100,000 and \n     $200,000 a year in 2001 through 2003. Those amounts would \n     cover the costs to add one to two officers overseas to \n     process the additional visas that would result under S. 1275.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act specifies procedures for \n     legislation affecting direct spending and receipts. Pay-as-\n     you-go procedures would apply to S. 1275 because the bill \n     could affect direct spending if the AG applies the INA to \n     CNMI. In that case, we estimate that enacting S. 1275 would \n     gradually increase the amount of offsetting receipts \n     collected by the INS from less than $500,000 in fiscal year \n     2000 to about $1.5 million in fiscal year 2003. Because the \n     INS could spend such receipts without further appropriation, \n     the provision would have no net impact on direct spending.\n       If the INA is applied, S. 1275 also would allow DOL to \n     collect fees from issuing permits to certain businesses \n     operating in CNMI. According to DOL, it would charge fees at \n     a rate that would cover its costs to issue the permits. We \n     estimate that enacting S. 1275 could increase offsetting \n     receipts by less than $500,000 a year.\n       Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal governments: \n     S. 1275 contains intergovernmental mandates as defined in \n     UMRA because the bill would preempt the immigration and \n     minimum wage laws of CNMI. (CNMI would be considered a state \n     for the purposes of UMRA). Section 2 of the bill would \n     preempt the immigration laws of CNMI. Section 3 of the bill \n     would preempt the minimum wage laws of CNMI and would require \n     employers, including governmental employers, to increase the \n     minimum wage that they would pay their employees. The amount \n     of the mandated increase in wages would determined by a \n     special industry committee but could not be more than 50 \n     cents per year. Based on information from DOI and CNMI, CBO \n     estimates that the costs of complying with these mandates \n     would not be significant because the number of public \n     employees affected by the bill would be limited and because \n     the change in the workload of the Commonwealth's immigration \n     staff would be small.\n       Estimated impact on the private sector: S. 1275 contains \n     private-section mandates as defined in UMRA. Section 2 would \n     impose a mandate on employers by limiting the number of \n     temporary alien workers who could be legally present in CNMI. \n     Section 3 would impose a mandate on employers by increasing \n     the minimum wage which they would be required to pay their \n     employees; the amount of the mandated increases in wages \n     would be determined by an industry committee established as a \n     result of enactment of this legislation. CBO cannot determine \n     whether the direct cost to employers of those mandates would \n     exceed the $100 million inflation-adjusted annual threshold \n     specified in UMRA.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: John R.

Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for \ntheir support of my legislation, S. 1531 and S. 1532, introduced on \nbehalf of the towns of Tremont and East Boothbay, Maine. S. 1531 \ndeauthorizes certain portions of the navigational project for Bass \nHarbor, and S. 1532 deauthorizes the final portions of East Boothbay \nHarbor.\n  Bass Harbor has the greatest concentration of fishing boats on Mt. \nDesert Island and all mooring spaces are currently full, with a long \nwaiting list to obtain future moorings. When the townspeople approached \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to obtain a permit for expansion, they \nwere told that no improvements could be made until the federal project \narea boundary was moved to the proper location by legislative action. I \nwas happy to do this on their behalf. The Selectmen, Town Manager, and \nHarbor Committee will now be working with the Corps and the State in \nanticipation of having the harbor dredged, which last occurred in 1966, \nso that they may make space available for more and larger boats.\n  S. 1532 deauthorizes the remainder of the federal navigational \nproject at Boothbay Harbor. The current marina owners purchased the \nformer shipbuilding yard in East Boothbay in 1993 and have since turned \nit into a full service marina. In the process of getting all the \npermits together for further economic development, the marina \ndiscovered that parts of the harbor, while no longer used as such, were \nstill deemed a federal navigation project created back in 1913, when \nmine sweepers and other ships were being built there for World War I. \nBecause part of the federal navigation project is still considered \nactive, the Corps told the town that nothing could be done in the water \nuntil the entire area was deauthorized. My bill takes care of this \nfinal deauthorization, the rest of which was accomplished in the last \nreauthorization of Water Resources Development Act, but the coordinates \nwere ultimately found to be inaccurate. This legislation, with the \nassistance of the Corps, addresses that small section still requiring \ndeauthorization.\n  I am especially pleased for the towns of Tremont and East Boothbay, \nwith whom I have worked in the long deauthorization process, so as to \nallow them to continue with much needed harbor development. I want to \nthank Senator Chafee and his Environment and Public Works Committee for \nmoving these bills out of committee and to the Senate floor. When \npassed by the House and signed into law, the bills will allow the towns \nto get on with much needed economic development in their harbors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5997-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \ntreaty transmitted to the Senate on June 9, 1998 by the President of \nthe United States: Inter-American Convention Against Illicit \nManufacturing and Trafficking of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and \nOther Related Materials (Treaty Document No. 105-49); I further ask \nthat the treaty be considered as having been read the first time; that \nit be referred, with accompanying papers, to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations and ordered to be printed; and that the President's message \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  With a view to receiving the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, I transmit herewith the Inter-American Convention Against \nthe Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, \nExplosives, and Other Related Materials (the ``Convention''), adopted \nat the Special Session of the General Assembly of the Organization of \nAmerican States (OAS) at Washington on November 13, 1997. The \nConvention was signed by the United States and 28 other OAS Member \nStates on November 14, 1997, at the OAS Headquarters in Washington. So \nfar, 31 States have signed the Convention and one (Belize) has ratified \nit. In addition, for the information of the Senate, I transmit the \nreport of the Department of State with respect to the Convention.\n  The Convention is the first multilateral treaty of its kind in the \nworld. The provisions of the Convention are explained in the \naccompanying report of the Department of State. The Convention should \nbe an effective tool to assist in the hemispheric effort to combat the \nillicit manufacturing and trafficking in firearms, ammunition, \nexplosives, and other related materials, and could also enhance the law \nenforcement efforts of the States Parties in other areas, given the \nlinks that often exist between those offenses and organized criminal \nactivity, such as drug trafficking and terrorism.\n  The Convention provides for a broad range of cooperation, including \nextradition, mutual legal assistance, technical assistance, and \nexchanges of information, experiences, and training, in relation to the \noffenses covered under the treaty. The Convention also imposes on the \nParties an obligation to criminalize the offenses set forth in the \ntreaty if they have not already done so. The Convention will not \nrequire implementing legislation for the United States.\n  This treaty would advance important U.S. Government interests, and \nwould enhance hemispheric security by obstructing the illicit flow of \nweapons to criminals such as terrorists and drug traffickers. In \naddition, ratification of this Convention by the United States would be \nconsistent with, and give impetus to, the active work being done by the \nUnited States Government on this subject in other fora, such as the \nUnited Nations, the P-8 Group, and the OAS Inter-American Drug Abuse \nControl Commission (CICAD).\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Convention, and that it give its advice and consent to \nratification.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, June 9, 1998.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/09/senate-section/article/S5998-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JUNE 10, 1998\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.
