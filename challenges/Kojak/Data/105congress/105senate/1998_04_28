Mr. President, this morning the front page of the \nWashington Post has an article that says, ``Interest Rate Fears Drive \nStocks Down.'' The article makes the point that the Dow Jones average \ntumbled 147 points yesterday. And John Berry, in the\n\n[[Page S3666]]\n\nPost, who writes a fair amount about the Fed and about economic news, \nsays the analysts on Wall Street indicate there was a strong concern by \ninvestors that the long-running bull market might be nearing a peak and \nthat the Federal Reserve Board is looking at the potential of \nincreasing interest rates.\n  It is interesting to me that it is a front page story that the stock \nmarket is down 147 points. The fact is the Dow Jones industrial average \nis nearly 9,000. It is a stock market that has increased dramatically. \nWe have had up days of 70 points, 90 points, 120 points. It is not \nsurprising that we will have downturns in the market of 140 points or \nmore when you have a market that is over 9,000 in the Dow Jones \nindustrial average.\n  But what surprises me is the notion somehow that the Federal Reserve \nBoard somewhere behind closed doors at a March 19 meeting indicated \nthat, gee, they were concerned that the economy was growing too fast \nand that maybe American workers are making too much money. They are \nconcerned that maybe too many people in this country are employed.\n  There is no amount of good news that will not give the economists \ndown in the Fed a bellyache for a week or two. There is no amount of \ngood news that does not cause them great concern. ``Gosh, the economy \nis doing well, so we better have a heartache about how well the economy \nis doing.'' It is interesting to me that the Fed has been consistently \nwrong. I know there are people in this Chamber who will stand up and \nsay, the Fed ought to be credited with the good economic news in this \ncountry. In fact, just the opposite is the case.\n  The Fed has been consistently wrong about this economy. They \nindicated time after time after time that if unemployment ever went \nbelow 6 percent we were going to be in huge trouble, we were going to \nsee the new fires of inflation stoke up. Well, unemployment went below \n6 percent and has stayed below 6 percent. We have not seen new waves of \ninflation. The Federal Reserve Board has just missed the fact that the \nglobal economy has put downward pressure on wages in this country.\n  But having said that, the Federal Reserve Board now has short-term \ninterest rates higher than it ought to be, higher historically than it \nshould be by a full half a percent. This means the prime rate is higher \nthan it ought to be and higher than it historically would be given the \nrate of inflation of well over 1 percent at this point. Yet, they are \ntalking about maybe increasing interest rates down at the Federal \nReserve Board.\n  What on Earth can they be thinking? I mean, if the job of the Federal \nReserve Board is to simply slow down the economy, my uncle can do that. \nThere are five or six people in my hometown who can do that. We do not \nhave to pay them a lot of money to do that. What can they be thinking? \nToo many people are working? We are starting to see maybe some \nincreases in some salaries at the bottom of the economic scale?\n  I would say to the Federal Reserve Board, if you have a lot of time \non your hands, take off those gray coats you wear from those gray suits \nyou wear to work every day and start thinking about bank mergers. Maybe \nstart thinking of what the CEOs make at the top--not workers at the \nbottom, and wonder what it does to the economy.\n\n  The Fed should be talking about the biggest bank mergers in the \nhistory of this country. What does it mean for consumers that all of \nthe biggest banks of this country are getting together and deciding \nthere is so much romance going on in the financial industry and they \nwould like to marry up?\n  The Federal Reserve keeps a list down there called the ``too-big-to-\nfail'' list. That is a list of the biggest banks in the country that \nwill never be allowed to fail because the consequences of their failure \nwould be too catastrophic for the economy. So they have the too-big-to-\nfail list.\n  As more and more banks merge, of course, that list gets bigger, and \nit means the risks of the merger will be borne by the American \ntaxpayer. So this monopoly game played by American giants passes off \nits risk to the American taxpayer.\n  So I say to the Federal Reserve Board, if you have lots of time on \nyour hands, don't sit around scratching your heads and increasing \ninterest rates, when the short-term Federal funds rate is already \nhigher than is justified, given the rate of inflation. Start thinking \nabout what these bank mergers do to the American economy. Start asking \nyourself why--if you keep a list that is called ``too-big-to-fail,'' \nwhy in this economy do family farmers out there face a risk of serious \nfinancial problems right now? And they seem to be, in the eyes of the \nFed, and others, too small to matter? Why is it that some are too big \nto fail and others, who are critical of this country's success, somehow \ntoo small to matter?\n  I would just say to the Fed--when I read this story this morning, I \nwondered again about those we hire to do monetary policy and who think \nabout economic policy. What they can be thinking about when they \nsuggest--and have now for about 3 years--that any good economic news in \nthis country is somehow a step backwards.\n  I just ask the Fed to understand this economy is doing quite well, \nnotwithstanding the Fed's advice. And there is no justification--none--\nfor this Federal Reserve Board to be considering increasing interest \nrates.\n  The Federal funds rate at the moment is historically higher than it \nshould be, given the rate of inflation. If they take any action at the \nFed, it ought to be to decrease the Federal funds rate to where it \nought to be, given the current rate of inflation which, incidentally, \nis almost nonexistent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/28/senate-section/article/S3665-8", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3666-S3667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE AGENDA OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Now, Mr. President, just a couple final points.\n  The agenda of the Senate--I was talking here about the agenda of the \nFederal Reserve Board, something I do not control. I guess the same is \nprobably true with respect to the agenda of the Senate, because the \nmajority leader controls the agenda of the Senate. He determines what \nto bring to the floor of the Senate for debate, and the agenda for the \nU.S. Senate is a very important agenda.\n\n  In front of us in the coming weeks I hope will be the following \npieces of legislation, some of which are already very, very late. The \nso-called highway bill or ISTEA bill which is very important. It should \nhave been passed last year. It is now in conference. We need to get \nthat and get it done. It is important for this country, an investment \nof roads and infrastructure.\n  The tobacco bill. We have just passed a tobacco bill out of the \nSenate Commerce Committee. It should be ready to come to the floor of \nthe Senate. I hope it is done sooner rather than later. A supplemental \ndisaster bill--that bill has been passed for some while, and the Senate \nis now in conference. In fact, I am a conferee. We will have a \nconference at 2 o'clock this afternoon. That ought to be done. There is \nno excuse, especially with respect to the disaster funds, for further \ndelay. That ought not sit there waiting. This Congress has a \nresponsibility to get that work done and bring it to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Another important issue that we want brought to the floor of the \nSenate as soon as possible is the Patients Bill of Rights, which deals \nwith managed care and the abuses that are occurring in managed care in \nthis country.\n  Those are just a handful of bills we want to be brought to the Senate \nfloor soon. Some of them have already been through the Senate and have \nbeen languishing in conference. The highway bill, for example, the \nsupplemental disaster bill, others, need to come to the floor so we can \nmake some progress on them.\n  I ask the majority leader and all others on both sides of the aisle \nin the Senate that we do our work and do it on time and tell the \nAmerican people that things like investment in infrastructure, building \nroads, repairing bridges, and the kind of things done in this important \nhighway bill get done on time. They were supposed to have been done \nlast year. It is now getting towards May of this year. It is in \nconference. A very, very important piece of legislation. I hope it is \nbrought to the floor of the Senate soon.\n  One more point. The tobacco legislation is very important. Some, I \nknow, want to stall on that legislation, but we reported it out of the \nCommerce Committee under the leadership of Senator McCain. That piece \nof legislation, I think, because of the short year that we were \ninvolved with that piece\n\n[[Page S3667]]\n\nof legislation, should be brought to the floor of the Senate as soon as \npossible. The later that it is brought to the floor of the Senate, the \nless likely it is that Congress will get its work done on the tobacco \nbill. I ask the majority leader, bring the tobacco bill to the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate, and let's get it done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, I will yield myself such time as I may \nconsume for opening comments and then reserve some time for others on \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. President, we are, as the Senate and the country now know, \ndebating the issue of whether or not the Senate will advise and consent \nto the President's signature on a proposal to bring three more nations \ninto the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n  While I was not present yesterday in this Chamber, I did watch some \nof the debate that unfolded yesterday, and I think the debate is taking \na good course of action. The debate yesterday was a good debate. I hope \nthat the debate today will continue along those lines. In other words, \nwhat I mean by that is not just people giving a speech and then walking \noff the floor but where we can actually engage one another in asking \nand answering questions about the implications of the NATO treaty.\n  So I hope that will be the course of action during the Senate's \nresponsibility to advise and consent here.\n  Mr. President, I want to make some extended remarks about the whole \npicture of NATO expansion, but I will just talk very briefly right now \nabout the amendment I sent to the desk.\n  Basically, I think one of the most important issues facing us on NATO \nexpansion is what it is going to cost, what it will cost the taxpayers \nof this country. So what I have sent to the desk is an amendment that \nwill hopefully clear this up a little bit and provide for an accurate \naccounting of all of the expenses incident to the expansion of the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization. And I will have more to say about \nthat a little bit later.\n  Concerns about the extension of our military obligations--and let's \nagain be frank about this; NATO is a military alliance--have been \nvoiced by Senators and interest groups, academics across the political \nspectrum, and when the voices expressing caution include Republicans \nand Democrats and progressives and conservatives, libertarians and \nothers, such a diverse opposition may be a sign that we ought to really \nact very deliberately and deliberatively on this issue. So I am glad \nthe debate has finally begun, and as I said, I am delighted with the \ncourse of action in the debate.\n  At the outset, I hope the Senate would not simply rubber stamp this \nbill that we have before us. We have a constitutional responsibility to \nboth advise and consent on treaties. This is a responsibility that is \ntaken seriously by every Senator and ought to because, as you know, \nunder our Constitution a treaty overrides the Constitution. So anytime \nwe advise and consent on a treaty, we are advising and consenting on a \ndocument that basically overrides much of our Constitution. So we have \nto be very careful about this.\n  There are important issues to consider in NATO expansion--\nburdensharing, command and coordination, responses to real and \nperceived threats, even the basic questions of mission and scope of the \norganization itself. They are not simple questions that lend themselves \nto a simple, sound bite debate. These questions and their answers will \nshape for better or worse our defense and foreign policy options for \ndecades to come.\n  There is no doubt that NATO has been one of the greatest military \nalliance success stories in our Nation's history. And, again, at the \noutset we have to ask the question. Here is an organization founded in \n1949 shortly after the end of the Second World War--the Second World \nWar in this century--when 12 countries signed the North Atlantic treaty \nto establish the military alliance known as NATO.\n  Now, let's face it. The reason for NATO was the Soviet Union.  The \nreason for being in that alliance, and also to preserve the nations of \nEurope together, was to preclude any possibility of cross-border \nexcursions by European countries. The treaty had as its goal ``to unite \ntheir efforts for collective defense and the preservation of peace and \nsecurity in Europe.''\n\n  Four nations have been added. Spain, the most recent, joined in 1982. \nSo, again, it has been a success. It has kept the peace in Europe for \nnearly 50 years, both by deterring aggression by the Warsaw Pact and by \nencouraging cooperation between its members.\n  I must say, due to the commitment of its members and the leadership \nof the United States, NATO has largely fulfilled the reason for its \nvery birth--the demise of the Soviet Union. So we have to, I think, at \nthe outset, say, if something was born because of the Soviet Union and \nit has succeeded, what,\n\n[[Page S3668]]\n\nthen, are the reasons not only for continuing it but for expanding it? \nAnd, subsequently, are there better and other ways in which we can \nfulfill other goals, such as democracy, economic progress, market-based \neconomies, and integration of the countries of Europe into one economic \nentity?\n  So, what role will NATO play in a new century? And what is the cost \ngoing to be in financial terms? And what is the cost going to be in \nother less tangible areas, like the potential for strained relations \nwith nonmember nations? Or what will the cost be in a dangerous \nrollback, perhaps, of nuclear arms control and nonproliferation \nprogress made since the end of the cold war?\n  By the administration's own admission, ``Enlargement will take place \nin a European security environment in which there is no current threat \nof large-scale conventional aggression and where any such threat would \ntake years to develop.'' This is from the administration's own \nadmission. There is no current threat and any threat would take years \nto develop. In response to questions from many Senators, the \nadministration reiterated this point when they wrote, ``Current members \nand prospective new members face no imminent threat of attack.''\n  This seems to be one of the few issues on NATO expansion where we can \nfind wide consensus. There is no large-scale external threat, including \nRussia. They just don't exist. The administration's expectation for the \nrole of an expanded NATO include:\n  No. 1, helping to deter future threats; No. 2, expanding our \ncollective defense capabilities to respond to both traditional and \nnontraditional security challenges; and, No. 3, helping to support and \nstabilize emerging democracies. I agree that these are goals that the \nUnited States should pursue. They are worthwhile goals. But again I \nask, is NATO the proper framework in which to accomplish these goals?\n  Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have legitimate concerns \nabout protecting their borders and their national sovereignty. After \nall, they persevered through a century of invasions and decades of \noutside control by a large and powerful neighbor. But, again, let me \nalso say that I remember when I happened to be in Moscow shortly after \nthe Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet Union was breaking up, I \nremember one of the Russian Members of the Duma telling me that, ``You \nthink you were the victims of the Soviet Union. You think Europe was \nthe victim of the Soviet Union,'' he said. ``We Russians were the \nbiggest victims of the Communist Soviet Union.''\n  So we have to think about it in that context also; of Russia, and of \nthem coming out from underneath the yoke of a Soviet Communist empire. \nThink about Russia, also, in terms of its history, when it has gone, \nalso, through a century of invasions and decades of control by a power \nnot necessarily of Russian being.\n  I learned a lot about what countries in this region had endured. Last \nyear I attended the dedication of the National Czech and Slovak Museum \nin Cedar Rapids, IA.\n  It is interesting. I was there with President Clinton and Ambassador \nMadeleine Albright, who was then-Ambassador to the United Nations, \nPresident Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic, and President Kovac of \nthe Republic of Slovakia.\n  Again, these people of these nations have shown a commitment and \nresilience to the democratic ideals during the economic and political \ntransition. They are working in concert with the community of nations \nand peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, in Iraq also. I want to commend \nand recognize their efforts. That is all well and good. But is that a \nreason to expand NATO?\n  I am not convinced it is the most appropriate vehicle that we can use \nto get the goals of security, stability, political reform, and economic \nintegration with the West sought by these newly free countries.\n  I am really worried we are buying into a mentality that has its roots \nin the cold war, and not the mentality that is looking ahead to the \nnext century. Yes, it is true that Europe has sustained decades, almost \na century, of warfare, invasions, domination and oppression by the \npeople of Eastern Europe. This approach to foreign policy would be \nappropriate if the world climate was similar to what it was, say, \nbefore World War II. But the world has changed.\n  To those who say that, well, we can have another cross-border \ninvasion by a country in Europe against another country, even the \nadministration admits this is not going to happen. This would not \nhappen for years. It would take years for anything like this to \ndevelop. You are not about to see any headlines exclaiming that Russian \ntroops are marching toward Poland or Czechoslovakia.\n  The czars are gone. The Third Reich is gone. Germany is united as a \ndemocracy. Again, we need to reorient ourselves to the realities of the \n21st century where the security threats are not czars and Hitlers and \npeople like that, but are more likely to be rogue nations, \ninternational terrorists, and, as we have seen again in Europe, \ninternal ethnic clashes.\n  For example, the security threat of most concern to Europe now is \nBosnia and Kosovo. There is also the so-called nontraditional threat--\nterrorism, chemical, biological weapons. Again, we need to consider, is \nNATO the best way to deal with these challenges? But my primary concern \nnow, and with this amendment, is the cost.\n  In February of 1997, the administration estimated the total cost of \nbetween $27 to $35 billion, of which the U.S. share would be $1.5 to $2 \nbillion.\n  In December, NATO released their own study with the astonishingly low \ntotal cost estimate of $1.5 billion. Well, then the Clinton \nadministration revised their initial projections down to reflect the \nNATO estimate of $1.5 billion.\n  Some would argue that comparing these numbers is like comparing \napples and oranges--I heard that--because of the different assumptions \nand scenarios. But I would argue that is exactly the point. We do not \nhave any consensus or concrete ideas on what posture NATO will take in \nthe future and at what cost.\n  I have a chart here that shows basically the varying cost estimates \nso we get an idea of just how widely divergent they are. NATO, as I \nsaid, estimates $1.5 billion. The Clinton administration initially, as \nI said, came in last year--a year ago--at $27 to $35 billion. Now the \nadministration says it is $1.5 billion. They just picked up the NATO \nestimate. CBO has given us a range of $21 to $125 billion. The Rand \nCorporation says it is $10 to $110 billion.\n  As I said, the first Clinton administration estimate was $27 billion \nto $35 billion--to $1.5 billion. So we go from $1.5 billion to $125 \nbillion.\n  Where is it? How much of this will the U.S. taxpayers have to pick \nup? The GAO issued a report late last fall, the title of which explains \nmy concerns and the reason for this amendment. It says, ``NATO \nEnlargement Cost Implications for the United States Remain Unclear.''\n  Now, much of the uncertainty is because--a quote from the  GAO \nreport--``It will not be until June of 1998 that NATO will make \ndecisions about whether or how much to increase the common budgets \nwhich would then be shared among current and new members. Until this \nhas been done, the implications for the U.S. contributions to NATO's \ncommon budgets will be unclear.''\n\n  Now, again, this is one reason why several other Senators and I asked \nfor a delay in voting on NATO expansion. I felt and some others felt \nthat we should have delayed this until this summer. We are not going to \nget this NATO estimate until at least June of this year. So why should \nwe be voting on a blank check for the American taxpayer before we have \nthe data? What is the rush? Why could we not wait until this summer \nuntil we get the NATO decisions on how much they want to increase their \ncommon budgets?\n  The same GAO report went on to discuss the financing for commonly \nfunded items, such as the needed infrastructure to send reinforcements \nto new allies in times of crisis, communications systems, or \ninteroperability with NATO's air defense system. None has been agreed \nto yet. None of it has been agreed upon yet.\n  Again, from the GAO report: ``Whether they will be financed within \nexisting budgets or by increasing the size of NATO's common budgets \nwill not be determined until June of 1998.''\n\n[[Page S3669]]\n\n  That is from the GAO report.\n  I am hopeful that the managers of the bill would engage with us in \ndiscussing why we would go ahead with this before we have this data \nthat NATO will come up with in June of 1998. So that is a missing piece \nof the puzzle right there.\n  Another piece of the puzzle we are missing is how new members are to \naddress their military shortfalls. The countries' force goals will not \nbe set again until this spring. In other words, we are without a plan \nto address the force goals and the price tag associated with it.\n  Again, I and others are uncomfortable signing the American taxpayers' \nnames to a potentially ballooning blank check, so that is a second part \nof this puzzle that I believe is missing.\n  The GAO concluded that while DOD's key assumptions were reasonable, \ntheir ``cost estimates'' are speculative. ``NATO enlargement could \nentail costs in addition to those included in DOD's estimate, including \ncosts for assistance to enhance the PFP or other bilateral assistance \nfor countries not invited to join NATO in July 1997.''\n  So, in other words, it is not just those countries invited to join. \nWhat about the cost for assistance and other vital assistance for all \nof the other countries not invited to join in July 1997?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Wouldn't the Senator acknowledge the example he just gave \nhas nothing to do with any commitment that is being undertaken by the \nexpansion of NATO now? It is unrelated. We may or may not through the \nprogram which the opponents of expansion constantly point to--the \nPartnership for Peace, as what we should have stuck with--we may or may \nnot do that. But passage of the expansion of NATO for these three \ncountries in no way affects the point of whether or not we give \nassistance to Romania or we give assistance to any other country \nquestioned. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well----\n  Mr. BIDEN. I respectfully suggest the answer is yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, wait a second. I do not think the answer is yes. \nWhat GAO said is NATO enlargement could entail costs in addition to \nthose countries in the Partnership for Peace, for example,  others who \nmay not be invited to NATO but because of the enlargement of NATO there \nmay be other costs incidental and associated with it. That is what they \nare saying.\n\n  Does the Senator say absolutely there will be no other costs \nassociated to PFP countries when NATO is enlarged?\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, the answer is I am saying there \nis no obligation we undertake. The Senator sits on the Appropriations \nCommittee. The Senator will have to make an individual judgment as each \nof the items come before him whether he wishes to do it.\n  For example, we are going to have, and right now the President has \nsent up within the last 3 months a request for additional equipment for \nTurkey, additional military equipment for Greece. Now, they have \nnothing to do with our common budget in NATO, zero.\n  Now, the Senator sits on the Appropriations Committee. He can come to \nthe floor, and on foreign military sales of those countries, he can say \nno, we don't want to do that, and we can vote against it. It is \nirrelevant. It has nothing to do with whether or not Poland is a member \nof NATO or the Czech Republic is a member of NATO.\n  What the Defense Department means, I respectfully suggest, is the \nfollowing; that with NATO, with the additional three countries in NATO, \nwe may conclude that our defenses would be further enhanced, \nbilaterally enhanced, U.S. interests enhanced if we gave more money, \nmore for military sales to Romania or to the Baltics or somewhere else. \nBut it has nothing to do--nothing to do, zero--with whether or not we \nexpand NATO. Zero, nothing.\n  The Senator from Virginia is on the floor, a strong opponent of \nexpansion. He knows that the Armed Services Committee has no obligation \nto send foreign military sales which we subsidize to Greece or Turkey, \nyet he votes for it. But it has nothing to do with NATO, zero. Nothing \nto do with NATO, zero. It is not part of NATO's common budget, common \nbudget.\n  The only thing, I respectfully suggest to my colleague, that we are \ncommitting ourselves to with the expansion of NATO is that we will \ncontinue to participate roughly 25 percent of the cost of the common \nbudget of NATO. The things that the DOD referenced and what my friend \nfrom Iowa is talking about have zero to do with the common budget.\n  There is a chart here, ``budget cost-sharing formula, in percentage \nof total NATO common budget.'' I will later in the day go into great \ndetail, because I think one of the great misnomers here is how the NATO \nis funded. I am not speaking to my friend from Iowa, who knows this \narea very well because he serves on the Appropriations Committee. But \nmany of us who do not serve on the Appropriations Committee or Armed \nServices Committee don't necessarily understand the details of how the \nNATO budget is constructed. There are three common budgets. I will not \ngo into it now. But they are the things that all 16 NATO nations reach \ninto their pockets and pay for. They are not the national budgets.\n  The national budget, my friend on the authorizing committee--both my \nfriends stand here on the Armed Services Committee--in the national \nbudget we decide whether or not out of our military budget we are going \nto help Greece beyond the common budget, whether we are going to help \nTurkey beyond the common budget, whether we are going to help Chile \nbeyond the common budget, whether we will spend money in Korea beyond, \nand it has nothing to do with the common budget of NATO.\n  So what happens here is we are taking great big apples and putting \nthem in baskets of small oranges. We talk about mixing apples and \noranges. The reason why the numbers, which I will go into in great \ndetail later, range from $125 billion to $1.5 billion is that we are \ncounting the wrong things.\n  So the issue here, and we will get a chance to talk about this in \ndetail, what is NATO's--and I know my friend from Virginia knows this \nwell--what is the common budget of NATO? And what are we committing \nourselves to spend in addition to what we are now spending on the \ncommon budget of NATO because these three countries  are going to be \nadded--if they are added, if we prevail?\n\n  So, that is the issue. With all due respect, my friend is mixing \napples and oranges here when he refers to the DOD saying we might in \nthe future decide to spend more money. It has nothing to do with any \nobligation we are taking on as a consequence of expanding NATO.\n  I thank my colleague. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to respond, but I yield to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa controls the time and \nthe time has been running on his side.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I had 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct; the Senator has 35 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  First, I want to say what a pleasure it is to sit and listen to a \nwell-informed presentation on a very important amendment. Indeed, I \nwill, in the course of the day, engage in another detailed colloquy \nwith my friend on this.\n  I point out when you mention the Armed Services Committee, \nauthorizing committee, I think the Senator should reconsider. It is \nyour committee, the Foreign Relations Committee, that authorizes the \nlevel of assistance on matters like this, as opposed to the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. A small matter, but I wanted to make----\n  Mr. BIDEN. We are so accustomed to other committees stealing our \njurisdiction that it was a slip of the tongue.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is well-taken. At every opportunity the Armed Services \nCommittee will do that.\n  Your question is correct, but I say to my good friend that while \nthere is no fixed-in-law obligation for an increased contribution on \nbehalf of the United States to these three potential new members, there \nis, indeed, a moral, and\n\n[[Page S3670]]\n\nit seems to me that that moral obligation will come into play very \nstrongly. If for any reason their economies cannot support their \nquotient of final costs allocated among the three, I am certain the \nUnited States would be a participant in picking it up.\n  Mr. BIDEN. On my time, if I may respond, if I can take 3 minutes--and \nI guess it is not just my time but the time controlled by the majority \nhere--if I can have 3 minutes to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend, one of the things the \nArmed Services Committee has been very jealous of, rightfully so, even \nthough foreign military sales fall within the Foreign Relations \nCommittee purview, when we argued in the Foreign Relations Committee, \nsome of us, against some foreign military sales, the Armed Services \nCommittee members and staff have often come to us and said, ``Joe, do \nyou know what you are doing?'' If you don't let Lockheed or Marietta \nMartin sell that particular item subsidized to the Germans or to the \nGreeks or to the Spaniards or to whomever, do you know what you are \ndoing? You are just subsidizing the French because they will sell them \na Mirage; they will sell this, they will sell that.\n  When we make these judgments on foreign military sales, they are \njudgments that are not only made in terms of what we believe to be our \nsecurity interest, but when we fail to participate in that, we find \nthat we lose part of our infrastructure because we find that, as a \nlecture I received many times on the floor from Armed Services \nCommittee members, we lose the competitive advantage to those foreign \nmilitary sales merchants in France, in England, wherever else.\n  So what we are talking about is the independent judgment of whether \nor not we may, in the future conclude, as we have in the past, that in \naddition to our contribution to the common military budget, in order to \nkeep peace in the Aegean, we have supplied in addition to that common \nNATO budget, we have supplied additional moneys or subsidies to Greece \nor to Turkey or Denmark. We have done it for almost all of the 15 \nmembers.\n  What the amendment of my friend here would do is something \nrevolutionary. It would say that we will redefine what NATO's common \nbudget is as it relates to the United States. We now would have to \ninclude as part of the economic budget any of the following: foreign \nmilitary financing under the Arms Control Export Act, transfers of \nexcess defense articles, emergency drawdowns or no-cost leases of U.S. \nequipment or subsidies or loan guarantees, which would in effect give \nveto power over our interests with the other 15 NATO nations. The \nreason we give a veto power is because if we draw down, if we have to \ndraw down from a 25 percent foreign military sales, we can't then pay \nour common budget that is owed to NATO because we have agreed. If we \ndon't do that, then NATO says ``Woe, woe, you are not engaging in cost \nsharing.''  And that, in turn, means that they can veto whether or not \nas a practical matter we decide it is in our national interest to sell \nCobra helicopters to the Greeks. My time is up.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I think the Senator is making my point. My \nfriend from Delaware is making my point. We are limited to 25 percent \nof the common budgets. All of the cost estimates we keep hearing about \nonly deal with the common budgets. We don't talk about the national \nbudget. What my amendment says is what is good for one side ought to be \ngood for the other. We are not mixing the two. We are applying a good, \nsound principle. If 25 percent is good for the common budgets, it ought \nto be good for the national budgets. That is what my amendment says. It \nsays to the American people, look, you are right, we don't know what it \nis going to cost us in the future. The Senator just stated that. He \nsaid that we don't know what it may cost us in the future.\n  What this amendment says is that at no time will the portion of the \nnational budgets of these countries or any other new members of NATO be \nmore than 25 percent, so that if some cost comes in at $10 billion, our \nshare, the share of the American people, will be no more than 25 \npercent. The other nations of NATO will have to kick in their \nproportionate share, also.\n  That is why I drafted this amendment. People don't understand the \ndifference between the common budgets and the national budgets. We keep \nhearing from the Clinton administration that this is only going to cost \nus $400 million--as I pointed out, we already promised as much as \n$1.069 billion in loans and subsidies to Eastern and Central Europe--\nbecause they are talking about the common budgets, not about the \nnational budgets of these countries. The Senator from Delaware is \nexactly right. My amendment seeks to say that no more than 25 percent \nof those would be paid for by the American taxpayers. I would think the \nSenator would support that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield. He wants written into law in \nthe passage of the amendment to the Washington treaty a commitment that \nthe United States national budget will now and forever not exceed 25 \npercent of all the money we decide to spend in the European theater. I \ncan't imagine the Senator from Virginia supporting that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, with all due respect, I don't think the \nSenator read my amendment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I have read it in detail.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is talking about the subsidy. It is not talking about \nwhat we spend ourselves in terms of our own military. It is talking \nabout what subsidy we provide to these countries.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Is that not out of our national budget? Is that not out of \nour national defense budget?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, out of our taxpayer dollars, subsidies to those \ncountries. But it has nothing to do with our military expenditures for \nour nation's forces stationed in Europe.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it clearly does. It says that if we want to \n``take a tank off the shelf,'' as they say, which comes right now out \nof the Defense Department budget, and we want to give that tank to \nTurkey, or to Greece, or to Germany, it says that tank can't be given \nif in fact we have already met our obligation of 25 percent under the \ncommon budget because it would exceed 25 percent. So he is limiting--\nlimiting in perpetuity--the amount of money we can spend out of our \nnational budget.\n  Look, this is apples and oranges again. We say with NATO, here is the \ndeal: We are going to pay 25 percent of all the moneys that directly \nrelate to NATO. We do not say we are only going to keep 25 percent of \nthe total amount of money we spent at 25 percent if, in addition, we \ndecide we want to help, as we have over the last 30 years, Greece. If \nthis had been the law in the last 20 years, the military aid that we \nhave given to Greece and Turkey would have eaten up our share of what \nwe agreed to do in the common budget. So in Aviano, Italy, the national \nbudget of the country of Italy pays for that Air Force base. But if we \nare going to build a runway to land NATO planes on, or Italy comes back \nand says, wait a minute, even though that is on an Italian air base for \nwhich we pay for all the infrastructure, if you want to lengthen the \nrunway to accommodate NATO planes, the other 15 members of NATO have to \nkick in to pay for it. If it costs $10 to extend the runway, we take \nout $2.50 and pay the 25 percent. But if we have already given $2.50 \noff the shelf to Greece, we don't have any money, we are prohibited by \nlaw from being able to do this.\n\n  This is hamstringing our national defense budget, unrelated to NATO. \nIt is a little like my saying that we are not going to spend anymore \nmoney on education than what we now spend on title VII. So if we want \nto pass, as I do, and did, the subsidy for IRAs for private schools, \nthat would have to come out of the ceiling for all title VII, which was \na billion dollars. We would have to find $300 million out of that \nbillion dollars, which means you don't have enough money to meet the \nobligation you have agreed to, separate and apart for decisions \nindependent of NATO considerations. You know, the rest of NATO has not \nwanted to support Greece. We stepped in and said, OK, notwithstanding \nthat NATO doesn't want to support Greece beyond the NATO common budget, \nwe are going to step in and give them the following\n\n[[Page S3671]]\n\nsubsidies, or the following military equipment off our shelf, out of \nour national budget, out of our pocket.\n  Now, if we deal with any NATO nation, and we conclude that we want to \nengage in foreign military sales with them, unrelated to NATO, if we \nwant to convince the French--which we never could--to stop flying \nMirage aircraft in their national air force and fly F-15s, we could not \ndo that. And so this is a profound change in national defense policy \nthat, with all due respect, has nothing to do with NATO. If you want to \ncap all U.S. spending as it relates from the Euros to the Atlantic at \n25 percent, fine, do it; but understand that you are making a profound \nforeign policy judgment that has nothing to do with whether or not \nPoland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary are members of NATO.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will get back to this amendment. I \nrespectfully suggest that the Senator from Delaware, again, is making \nmy point in two ways. What the Senator from Delaware has said is that \nthe costs of the taxpayers of this country are going to increase in the \nfuture. We don't know how much, but that is what he said. It is going \nto increase. Listen carefully--\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, with all due respect, I did not say it is \ngoing to increase. It would be up to the Senate and the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. After a treaty is signed. And keep in mind, treaties \noverride the Constitution of the United States. Once those decisions \nare made, we are going to have to meet, as the Senator from Virginia \nsaid, our moral obligations.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Moral obligations--\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will let me finish, I never interrupted \nhim.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator is correct. I apologize.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I think the arguments, if I might respectfully say \nso, of the Senator from Delaware are arguments that we would have heard \non the Senate floor in the 1950s and the 1960s and the 1970s. The \nSenator's arguments pertain to a world that no longer exists in Europe. \nThe Senator talks about Greece, that if this amendment had been in \neffect 30 years ago, 40 years ago, we could not have done in Greece \nwhat we did. The Senator is right. But this is not 40 years ago.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thought I heard the distinguished Senator \nsay that treaties override the Constitution of the United States.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Portions.\n  Mr. BYRD. Did I hear him correctly?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Portions.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, treaties don't override the Constitution of the United \nStates. Under the Constitution, treaties are a part of the law of the \nland, the supreme law of the land. They don't override the Constitution \nof the United States.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will not argue constitutional principles with the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope the Senator will take that out of his written \nspeech.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will not argue constitutional principles with the \nSenator from West Virginia, I know that. But treaties under--I forget \nthe article--treaties become the law of the land.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes; but they don't override the Constitution.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Under the Constitution, they become the law of the land.\n  Mr. BYRD. They become part of the supreme law of the land. I thank \nthe Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the correction of the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Back to my point; the Senator from Delaware is right. If this \namendment had been in effect 40 years ago, we couldn't have been in \nGreece. But that was during the cold war. That is when we were facing \nthe Soviet Union. That is when we were facing, if I might say to the \nSenator from Delaware, facing a Europe that was on its knees, busted, \nbroke, basically decapitated from World War II. There is no way that \nthey could have done it on their own. That is why I say with this whole \nNATO argument that it just seems to me we are arguing about a world \nthat existed 50 years ago. The Senator from Delaware in his impassioned \npleas is arguing for a situation that no longer exists. Europe is \npowerful. Europe is wealthy, and the nations' GNPs are going up. There \nis no Soviet Union. There is no external threat like Greece was facing. \nEurope has been rebuilt. The cold war is over. Let's look ahead.\n  What I am saying is that I don't believe, in the context of a Europe \nthat we see now and in the foreseeable future, that our taxpayers ought \nto be liable for the national costs anymore in excess of what they are \nliable right now for the common costs. That is what this amendment \nsays. Very simply, it says very forthrightly, ``Any future United \nStates subsidy of the national expenses of Poland, Hungary, or the \nCzech Republic to meet its NATO commitments, including the assistance \ndescribed in subparagraph (c), may not exceed 25 percent of all \nassistance provided to that country by all NATO members.''\n  When it comes to tanks, planes, or anything else, of course, we can \nstill sell them. They can still buy from us. But our subsidy to this \nnational effort cannot be more than 25 percent of the total amount of \nsubsidies by all of the countries for that national effort----\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. But I am losing a lot of time; if the Senator would \nhelp me by yielding back some time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Where you don't go back 50 years--for example, if the \nSenator's amendment had been in place, we probably could not have \namended the conventional forces in Europe. In 1991, it became clear--\nthe wall came down in 1989--we had to amend the conventional forces \namendment. We renegotiated that agreement. The flank agreement in the \nSenate was an amendment. It was passed in Russia in the Duma as well. \nWhat we said was that we had to give up a number of pieces of \nequipment, thousands of pieces of equipment, but because Greece and \nTurkey were on the southern flank of NATO and because we still were \nconcerned about instability in the region, we still wanted force \nstructure there, we had to call for a cascading down. We took all of \nthe equipment that we were giving up, thousands of pieces, and we just \ngave them to the Greeks and the Turks. It was in our national interest \nto do so.\n  Had the Senator's amendment been in place, the cost of all of those \npieces of equipment would have to have been computed and added up, and \nthen reduced from the 25 percent ceiling that was allowed to be spent \nby the United States on the common budget of the NATO. That had nothing \nto do with the cold war; it had to do with reality. It had to do with \nthe arms control agreement. That arms control agreement would have done \none of two things. It would not be able to have been negotiated and \nsigned by us because we would not have been able to have that force \nstructure on the southern flank, or we would have had to go in arrears \nto our commitment of saying 25 percent of the common budget of NATO.\n  That is a contemporary example. That went on from 1991 to 1996. It is \na further example of how well-intended but dangerous this amendment is.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I respond to the Senator from Delaware. Again, \nwhat he is basically arguing for is giving a blank check to the \nAmerican people. I disagree with the Senator on the point that he just \nsaid about conventional structure. We are talking about three \ncountries. My amendment only mentions three countries. It mentions \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. It is just those three \ncountries that we are talking about and about their national costs. \nThere may be other arrangements in Europe. There may be other \nstructures in which we are engaged that are not covered by this \namendment.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am talking only about subsidies to the national \nmilitary budgets, the national expenses of those three countries to \nmeet their national commitments.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Just those three?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is all.\n  Mr. BIDEN. This in no way limits our ability to give aid or \nassistance to any other country in NATO. So we are going to say that \nyou three guys can come in, but we are going to promise that we are \nnever going to give you assistance, but we will maybe give assistance \nto Greece, Turkey, Germany, France and England.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right. Exactly. Why is that? Because England, \nFrance,\n\n[[Page S3672]]\n\nand all of these countries' forces are modernized. They are fully \nintegrated into NATO. Those are the three countries that are going to \nhave a lot of money for interoperability, command, communications, \nforce structures. That is where the money is going to go. I didn't want \nto say anything about the other countries. I don't think it is \nnecessary for these other countries because we are not going to be \ninvolved in that kind of expenditure. That is why I limited it \nspecifically to those three countries and why I respectfully demur from \nthe Senator's comments that we could not be involved in other aspects \nof NATO beyond the 25 percent. We absolutely could. That is why I want \nto focus on those three countries only because that is where the money \nis going to be spent for force structure and modernization. I don't \nbelieve we ought to give a blank check.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Wouldn't we, if we accept the amendment of the \nSenator from Iowa, then be relegating Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic second class citizenship in NATO?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't believe so. I think all we are saying is that the \nother members of NATO have to be as fully involved financially in \nupgrading and modernizing their force structure as the taxpayers of \nthis country. I basically would submit that this amendment is more \ninclusive. It is saying to our partners in NATO that we are in this \ntogether; don't just stick the American taxpayer with the bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. One other question.\n  It seems to me, as we look at the numbers that the Senator is \npresenting, $125 billion versus $1.5 billion, and changing \ncircumstances, I would remind the Senate that the $125 billion was \npredicated on the Congressional Budget Office based upon an invasion by \nRussian forces of Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic, and that it \nwould require the full advanced positioning of the U.S. military. If \nthat were to occur, those numbers are probably right. The much reduced \nnumber of $1.5 billion is a reflection, according to the GAO, of the \ncurrent political situation and, therefore, isn't an accurate estimate.\n  But I would say this: I don't think we should hamstring now our \nability as the Senate and as the Congress to respond to whatever things \nmight occur. But it seems to me, we would be doing just that if we were \nto accept the Harkin amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might, if I could restate what the \nSenator is trying to achieve with his amendment, is simply to say when \nNATO establishes the military requirements of three new nations, the \ncosts associated with each of the nations and their ability to reach \nthat requirement, the U.S. States taxpayer will pay no more than 25 \npercent of that cost, and 75 percent is then to be allocated among the \nremainder of the nations. It is as simple as that in clear English \nlanguage.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. That says it very clearly and very \neloquently, and I think brings the point home again. I say to the \nmanager of the bill that when you talk about $1.5 billion, that is one \nof the common costs. That is why we are trying to reach out and find \nout what these other costs associated with it are. These NATO's costs, \nas I have pointed out, we have already allocated over $1 billion \nourselves of taxpayer dollars for this.\n\n  I also say in response to the comments of the Senator from Delaware \nabout what happens in the future that, if there is an emergency or \nsomething happens where you have changed circumstances, I would respond \nwith the same enjoinder that he gave to this Senator; that is, I \nbelieve it is important now to limit our taxpayers' exposure rather \nthan a blank check. If there is an emergency in the future, if \nsomething does happen, yes, the Appropriations Committee will respond. \nThe Foreign Relations Committee and the authorizing committee will \nrespond. The Armed Services Committee in their capacity as authorizing \ncommittee will respond. The appropriators will respond. It is better to \naddress it at that point rather than giving a blank check now and just \nsort of letting it go. I think from a budgetary standpoint, from the \nstandpoint of protecting our taxpayer dollars better, we limit it now, \nand then, if there is an emergency, fine, we can come up with the money \nand finance the emergency.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield. If in fact this logic makes \nsense, I don't know why we would produce an amendment that says right \nnow we spend--I don't know the exact national budget. My friend from \nVirginia may know how much we spend on defense right now in the United \nStates of America on our total defense budget. I will make up a number. \nLet's say it is $300 billion. Why don't we attach an amendment right \nnow and say that we will not spend more than $300 billion on defense, \nperiod? Why don't we do that? It is the same logic. Let's tell the \nAmerican taxpayers now we are limiting what they are going to spend on \ndefense. We will do it now. We will limit it to that number, not just \nin Europe but all over the world. Tell them that right now. If there is \nan emergency, we can come back.\n  This is the same man, whom I respect enormously, who argued \nstrenuously, and he argued on the same issue of a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget.\n  Why not set a number? Defense spending cannot increase at all. We can \npass it now, unless we come along and by a two-thirds vote in this body \nagree to spend more money on defense. That is what we are doing here \nrelative to these three countries. That is what we are doing for \nEurope. Why don't we do it for the all of the national defense \nbudget? If it doesn't make sense for the whole national defense budget, \nI respectfully suggest it makes zero sense to do it in Europe for these \nthree countries.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could clarify, the funds the Senator \nis talking about come out of the Department of State budget, not the \ndefense budget.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let's set the State Department budget.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is important in this debate that we begin to establish \na few fundamentals with some correctness. The defense budget will be \naround $260 billion to $270 billion, but it does not contain the funds \nto which my distinguished colleague is now referring.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, let's set the State Department \nbudget then, freeze that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I didn't hear the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the categories all come out of the State Department \nbudget, then let's say let's freeze the State Department budget. \nNothing can go up in the State Department budget, period. Freeze it, \njust like we are going to freeze it here. Why not do that? And if an \nemergency comes along, we can change our mind.\n  It is not a way to do business, I respectfully suggest.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 13 minutes 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sure the Senator will yield me some more off his \ntime, because I have been so yielding to him.\n  I think the analogy that the Senator from Delaware uses is totally \nwrong. Let me provide, I think, a more correct one. This amendment in \nno way limits how much total defense dollars we can provide to these \nthree countries--not at all. It simply says, whatever their national \nbudget, we will only pay 25 percent. So the Senator's analogy that we \nare somehow going to cap defense spending is not right.\n  A better analogy, if I might say to my friend from Delaware, is this. \nWe do have a defense budget in the United States. It is $260 billion. \nLet's say that for national emergency reasons, or whatever threat might \ncome up, we have to increase it to $300 billion a year. But what we are \ngoing to do is tax the citizens of Delaware for half of it, and then we \nwill spread the other half among the other 49 States of the Union. That \nis the more correct analogy as to what my amendment seeks to do.\n  Now, certainly we would not say to the citizens of Delaware, ``We are \ngoing to increase the defense budget. You have to pick up 50 percent of \nthe total.'' No. We would spread it out, make everybody pay a fair, \nproportionate share. That is what my amendment says. My amendment in no \nway limits the total amount of defense money spent on these three \ncountries.\n\n[[Page S3673]]\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wonder if I might yield myself time \nfrom the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will yield the floor and let others use \ntheir own time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wonder if, having discussed with the \nSenator from Oregon, I might yield myself time from his time so as not \nto deprive the Senator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa yields the floor?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am sorry. Mr. President, I yielded the floor and \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa has been very generous in \nyielding his own time. I wanted to make a brief statement and then pose \ntwo questions on what I take to be not just hypotheticals but real life \nprobabilities.\n  I followed the discussion on a particular element of the budget, \nwhether State Department or defense. I don't think that is right on \npoint to what is being said here. I think the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Iowa is saying that American subsidy, as it were, of the national \nexpenses of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to meet their NATO \ncommitments should not be more than 25 percent of all assistance \nprovided to each of those countries by all NATO members.\n  Let me lead into the questions that I want to ask the Senator from \nIowa. The Senator from Iowa has said that his purpose in offering this \namendment is to protect the taxpayers of America from incurring a \nliability greater than this 25 percent; that is, 25 percent of all \nassistance provided to each of these three countries by all NATO \nmembers. But I am concerned that there are some consequences in his \namendment, perhaps unintended, which in fact not only do not protect \nthe taxpayers of the United States but may hurt them, and certainly may \nhurt their security. And I want to describe two situations and then ask \nthe Senator from Iowa if he would respond.\n  The 25 percent number is one that has some currency--no pun \nintended--in NATO circles about the American share. So it is not the 25 \npercent that I think troubles those of us who oppose this amendment. It \nis what the Senator from Iowa is including within the 25 percent in \nsubsection (C) of his amendment, and I go particularly to this and I \nread from the amendment.\n\n       The assistance referred to in (A)(iii) above includes (1) \n     Foreign Military Financing under the Arms Export Control Act.\n\n  So here is the circumstance I am concerned about being covered here. \nAt sometime in the future--next year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years--one of \nthese three countries, the Czech Republic, Hungary, or Poland, decides \nthat they, as part of their participation in NATO, their responsibility \nfor their own defense, want to acquire certain modern military \nequipment systems.\n  My concern is that by squeezing foreign military financing under the \nArms Export Control Act--which is to say the credits that our \nGovernment gives to facilitate the sale of weapons systems by American \nmanufacturers to foreign purchasers--we are going to block our defense \ncompanies from having a chance to compete equally with other foreign \ndefense manufacturers to try to sell to the Czech Republic, Hungary, \nand Poland. Because the credits will be included within the 25 percent, \nand the effect of that will not be to protect American taxpayers, it \nwill be to hurt American defense workers, whose products will not be \nable to be sold to these three countries.\n\n  So, I ask my friend from Iowa, is it not true, if the amendment he \nhas submitted is agreed to, that we will limit credits for foreign \nmilitary sales to these three countries and therefore limit the \nopportunity of American defense manufacturers to sell to these three \ncountries, meaning that they will be pushed to buy from other producers \nelsewhere in the world?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will respond to my friend, if he will yield.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I do.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, this amendment does not preclude \nincreased subsidies as long as we only pay our fair share. That is the \npoint I was making prior to the Senator's comments.\n  But, again, is the Senator arguing that, again, this is going to cost \na lot more than the $400 million that the administration has \nsuggested--that this could really balloon in the years ahead? That is \nwhat I am concerned about. What is this going to cost? We are told it \nis only going to cost us $400 million. But now I hear the Senator \nsaying maybe, if a country there decides to buy some expensive military \nhardware, we will want to jump in and subsidize our sales, so, \ntherefore, we don't give it? I mean, nothing is given? It is not free; \nthe taxpayers pay for it. And that bothers me. It doesn't preclude the \nsale of weapons; it just means it must be a fair share.\n  Again, I probably agree with the Senator that my amendment would \npreclude the kind of giveaway programs that cost our taxpayers a lot of \nmoney in order to maybe help one of these countries modernize to the \npoint where they may not need it. But as long as it is free to them and \ncosts our taxpayers, why not give it to them?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I appreciate the response of the Senator from Iowa, \nbecause I do believe the response confirms my concern that one of the \neffects of passage of this amendment will be to apply what I consider \nto be an arbitrary cap--which is to say a 25 percent cap--on all \nAmerican expenditures related to the assistance provided to these NATO \ncountries.\n  Here is why I am concerned about that and why it does bother me. \nThere are two different categories of expense. One is the direct amount \nwe are contributing--common expenses, if you will--the $400 million \nthat the Senator from Iowa refers to, to enlarge NATO to these \ncountries. I do not consider the credits given to facilitate the sale \nof American military equipment to these countries in that same \ncategory. These are not giveaways. These are, in a long-established \nprogram, quite similar to what we do through the Export-Import Bank in \nother areas, or OPIC in other areas, to facilitate American companies' \nability to sell their products abroad, creating or sustaining more jobs \nfor American workers here at home.\n  So, my initial concerns are confirmed. I think the effect of this \namendment, if adopted, would be to limit the ability of American \ncompanies to compete equally with foreign manufacturers of comparable \nweapons systems to sell them to these three countries, and the losers \nin that would be the workers in defense companies all around America. \nSo these export credits are not giveaways. Yes, it may take the budget, \nthe possible spending, somewhat above the $400 million, but that is a \ndifferent category. The $400 million, if you will, is a grant. This is \na little bit like giving a bit of a subsidy so you can sell a multiple \nof many times more and create jobs for American workers.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The Senator from Iowa forthrightly responded, as he always \ndoes, that if we wanted to sell Poland, like we sell Greece or Germany \nor anyone else, a piece of American-made military equipment, as long as \nwe did not subsidize more than 25 percent of what that was, then we \ncould sell it.\n  I wonder, why in God's name would the French Government agree to come \nup with money for Poland to allow them to buy an American jet instead \nof a French jet? Why would they possibly do that? And does this not \ngive a veto, a veto on the part of other NATO nations, over American \nforeign military sales? Because unless they come up with 75 percent of \nwhat any subsidy would be, why would they possibly do that?\n  Is it not true--the Senator is on the Armed Services Committee--is it \nnot true that one of the core debates in NATO beyond burdensharing has \nbeen who gets to sell NATO the equipment, whether they fly Mirages--\nwhether NATO planes are Mirages or whether they are American made \naircraft? Every other European country in NATO has been saying, ``You \nAmericans get too much of an advantage.'' Every time we talk about \nburdensharing, don't they come back and say, ``Yes, but you don't get \nit; you get to make all that money and get all those jobs because you \nare supplying the equipment that all the NATO uses''?\n\n[[Page S3674]]\n\n  So why in the Lord's name would we give a veto power over the ability \nof American manufacturers and American employees to keep their jobs to \nthe French and the Germans and the Brits?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator raises a very good question. For me, at \nleast, there is no good answer to that. That is why I say I believe \nthat this may be an unintended consequence of the amendment that the \nSenator from Iowa has put forward. There is very spirited competition \namong the member countries of NATO in arms sales and arms purchases by \nNATO.\n  For instance, right now there is a great issue about the Joint Stars \nProgram, a remarkable air surveillance of ground activity system in \nwhich we had an original requirement of 19 planes; assuming that NATO \nwould buy 6, we would pay for 13. Our military says these are \nextraordinarily valuable. They are going to be critical in future \nwarfare. We have already used them in Bosnia before we thought we would \nhave to. Our allies in NATO decided last fall that they didn't want to \nbuy the six from us, they wanted to try to make them themselves. So \nthere is very spirited competition that goes on among the NATO members \nfor NATO acquisitions, let alone to other countries.\n  I do want to say one word additionally on this point. The credits \nthat are given for foreign military financing under the Arms Export \nControl Act are not literally spending; they are more in the form of a \nguarantee. I don't have the exact information before me, because I \ndidn't realize we were going to get into this point this morning. I \ndon't believe that the taxpayers have actually spent very much money on \nthese credits. They are a form of a guarantee to facilitate these \nsales.\n  Anyway, bottom line, I leave this part of the debate with a confirmed \nconcern, which deepens my opposition to the amendment, that one of the \nunintended consequences--or consequences of this amendment, if it \npasses, would be to hamstring, to tie up, to put a cap on the ability \nof American companies and workers to compete with foreign companies and \nworkers to sell these three systems that they may want to acquire in \nthe future.\n  Mr. President, I would like to go on and pose a second question to my \nfriend from Iowa. Let me describe a different kind of fact \ncircumstance.\n  One of the reasons I am so strongly supporting the enlargement of \nNATO to these three countries is that it will help us--it will share \nour burden, to be as specific as I can. NATO, as we continue our \nhistoric mission of providing for the collective defense of the member \nstates, will face threats, as it has both within their territories and \noutside. We have seen it in Bosnia. I suspect, as others do, that we \nwill be threatened increasingly from the south of NATO, not from the \neast, because Russia is now our ally and our partner--Partner for \nPeace, as we say--in that specific program. And I am struck by what \nthese three new members can add to NATO's military capacity.\n  First off, and most explicitly, they will add 200,000 troops. And not \njust the troops, but I think what we will find, because these new \nmembers will have the enthusiasm of new membership, perhaps even a \ngreater willingness to be involved in sharing the burden that would \notherwise fall exclusively on the United States of America in \nresponding to threats to the security of NATO and its member states, \nincluding our own security.\n  Let me give a specific example. Hungary has been of great help to us \nalready in Bosnia, giving us a base from which we can launch or source \nso much of our activity in Bosnia. But let me come to a much more \nspecific and recent point. A short while ago, we were on the edge of \nmilitary action against Iraq again, because the Iraqis wouldn't allow \nus, or the United Nations inspectors, access to their facilities, \naccording to the post-gulf-war promises that they had made. And that \nconflict, for now--I am afraid not forever, but for now--has been \navoided. But the record will show that during the period of time \nleading up to the possibility of military action against Iraq, these \nthree countries--Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic--made \nunswervingly clear that they were prepared to stand by us.\n  Let me be very blunt about this, undiplomatically blunt. They were \nmuch more supportive of military action against Iraq, much more willing \nto commit forces and materiel, much more convinced of the common threat \nthat an uninspected Iraq posed to them, as well as to us, than some of \nour longest term and foremost allies in NATO. There is no secret here. \nThe French were particularly reluctant about military activity against \nIraq.\n\n  So what I want to pose now is another fact situation. Let us say in \nthe next half year--we all hope this does not happen, but we can feel \nit building in Iraq again. Mr. Butler, of UNSCOM, of the U.N. group \ncharged with inspecting in Iraq to guarantee that weapons of mass \ndestruction have been eliminated, has said in the last week or two \nthat, yes, the inspectors gained access to Saddam Hussein's palaces, \nbut as far as I interpret his statements, the Iraqis cleared out the \npalaces, let the inspectors in, the inspectors naturally found \nnothing--there was a lot of time that passed--the inspectors went out, \nand now the Iraqis say, ``That's it. Lift the sanctions.''\n  Mr. Butler, steadfast, honorable, independent, says, ``Hey, we don't \nhave affirmative proof as required under the post-gulf war agreements \nthat the Iraqis are not developing chemical and biological weapons.''\n  So let us go forward a few months, and the conflict grows, the \ndisagreement grows, the Iraqis refuse to allow U.N. inspectors in, and \nwe are on the edge of military conflict again, and as we hope it will \nnot happen, in fact there is a decision to launch a military action, \nand in this we ask and receive the support of our allies in Hungary, \nPoland and the Czech Republic.\n  I know I am speeding up the schedule a little bit because they will \nnot in that timeframe have acceded to NATO membership. So let us take \nit forward a year or two or three. They want to help us in an \ninternational conflict. And the one in the gulf is most likely. To \nfacilitate their aid to us, we have to invoke exactly the sections of \nlaw that the Senator from Iowa includes in his amendment under the 25-\npercent cap--transfers of excess defense articles under section 516 of \nthe Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, emergency drawdowns of our \nequipment to give to them no cost leases of U.S. equipment. All of this \nis not to throw it away but because they can share our burden. They can \nsend troops to be with ours. But they may need some assistance, \nmateriel assistance that we would normally draw down from.\n  So perhaps this has been a longer way than necessary to say that my \nconcern is, these additional sections of this law would prevent the \nUnited States from, in a crisis such as the one I have described, or \nGod forbid a larger one, where the soldiers, the military forces of \nthese three countries were ready to share the burden of the United \nStates in defense, in fact the 25-percent cap would say, you cannot do \nit, you cannot help them help us.\n  That is not only in the most limited and technical sense such a \nresult in the interest of the taxpayers of the United States, it \ncertainly is not in the interest of the security of the United States \nor in the interests of the well-being of the military of the United \nStates, without assistance from countries like this, to have to \nshoulder more of the burden.\n  So I ask my friend from Iowa, is it not true that these sections of \nthis amendment would limit the ability of the United States to draw \ndown, to transfer articles, to enter into no-cost leases of U.S. \nequipment to these three countries in a time of crisis, in which we \nwould very much want them to be helping us with our assistance?\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is the Senator then saying that the cost of this is going \nto escalate greatly in the future, that it is not $400 million, it is \ngoing to be something much above that because we are going to subsidize \na lot of sales? Is that what the Senator is saying?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator. What I am saying is that from the \nbest estimates I have seen, the American contribution to the common \ncosts of NATO will be limited to the $400 million. But there will be \nother cases in our self-interest, such as the ones I have mentioned, \nwhere there is an international crisis and we will want to\n\n[[Page S3675]]\n\ndraw down, to give no-cost leases to Hungary, Poland and the Czech \nRepublic to help us so we incur less damage and less direct costs \nourselves that I am afraid this amendment would limit. I consider that \na very separate category than in the contribution we make to the common \ncosts of NATO enlargement.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator would yield further.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator talks about prices. Again, with all due \nrespect, when a crisis happens, Congress responds. Again, just from a \nbudgeting standpoint, from being perhaps a little tightfisted with \ntaxpayer dollars, and not giving sort of a blank check and saying, \n``Fill it in,'' I think by having a cap on these costs, a national cost \nthat I propose equivalent to what we do in our common costs, that it \nprecludes a kind of runaway giveaway.\n  It is like, OK, Hungary wants to upgrade their capabilities in a \ncertain area, so we say, ``Oh, wonderful. You need not the $1.98 \nversion, you need the $100 version.'' But Congress says, ``We can't \nafford the $100 version.'' We say, ``Not to worry. We'll give it to \nyou. That will be one of our grants. We will subsidize it, and you will \nget ours.''\n  Again, I must respectfully say to my friend from Connecticut, this is \na whole new vineyard, this debate about jobs. I thought this was about \ndemocracy and markets and peacekeeping. Now we are talking about jobs. \nI find this debate now is veering off course a little bit.\n  To answer the question as forthrightly as I can, yes, I am saying \nthat if one of these three countries want the $1.98 version, we could \ngive up a 25-percent subsidy for that. We would not come in with a $100 \nversion and say taxpayers are going to pay for the whole thing. Yes, \nthat is exactly what I mean.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Iowa. I will say a brief word \nor two more and then yield to the Senator from Oregon.\n  What I fear from the amendment is that the effect of the amendment \nwill be to limit our ability to sell cost-effective items to these \nthree governments, not just the ones that the Senator may consider to \nbe bloated in expense. And more to the point of the second example that \nI have asked him about, I think it will have the unintended consequence \nof shackling us in our attempt to benefit from the willingness of these \nthree countries to assist us in a time of international crisis.\n  I want to make a final point about the comment that the Senator made \nin passing that this is about, the NATO enlargement debate is about \nprinciple, not about jobs in America. I respectfully, loosely \nparaphrase there.\n  In my opinion, as I tried to indicate yesterday, this debate really \nis about a principle, about the principle of freedom that was secured \nand won in the cold war and that we now, in my opinion, have a moral \nobligation to ratify that victory in the freedom won by countries like \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, countries that suffered during \nthe cold war and the long years of Soviet Communist domination, to \nwelcome them into this military alliance which is based on the \nprinciple of freedom, also on collective defense.\n  I know that there are some who have said that what drives this \ndebate, what drives the move for NATO enlargement is the yearning by \nAmerican military contractors for more sales in Central or Eastern \nEurope. I must say, I am on the Armed Services Committee and I have not \nhad a single comment--I have contact on a regular basis with \nrepresentatives of defense companies, and I have not had a single one \nof them say a single word to me about NATO enlargement.\n  But that having been said, and looking realistically, the potential \nsales here are quite modest as a proportion of overall military sales \nthroughout the world, particularly within the United States with the \nPentagon as the purchaser. But if these three countries want and need \nto purchase new military equipment, why would we want to limit the \nability of American companies to sell American made products to them? \nSo, no, the debate overall is not about American workers; it is about \nthe principle of freedom and collective defense, and the promotion of \npeace and stability on the European Continent, which is what NATO has \ndone so greatly for almost 50 years and will do more broadly in the \nyears ahead if we enlarge it.\n\n  Way down on the list of effects is the possibility that there might \nbe a few sales of American-made equipment to these countries. I fear \nthat the unintended consequence of this amendment would be to limit \nthose sales and, in that sense, to give an unusual and surprising \ncompetitive advantage to military contractors abroad, particularly in \nEurope, perhaps even in Russia or China, as well.\n  I thank my friend from Iowa for what I hope has been an illuminating \ndialog and for the directness and eloquence of his own participation.\n  I thank my friend from Oregon for yielding me this time. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I was once asked by a mother in a \ntown meeting I had in Oregon why her son or daughter should put his or \nher life at risk for a Hungarian or Pole or Czech through the expansion \nof NATO. I think it sometimes helps to think in human terms like that. \nMy answer to her was that the surest way not to put her son's or \ndaughter's life at risk was, in fact, to expand NATO.\n  It is a very troubled area in world history. In a tough neighborhood, \ngood fences make for better neighbors. I have fought to expand NATO \nbecause I think to leave the vacuum, to leave muddled ``international \nspeak'' out there at the border was a mistake.\n  I think the answer I gave to that mother can also be given to my \nfriend from Iowa. The Senator is concerned about the bill going up. I \nam concerned about that, too, but I think the surest way that the bill \nnot go up is to expand NATO. I think if we did not expand NATO, and the \nworst kinds of scenarios you could construct actually occurred, we \nwould be spending far more than $1.5 billion--whether Poland, Hungary \nand the Czech Republic were in NATO or not because I don't think this \ntime we would stand idly by. I certainly hope we would not.\n  So the surest way, I think, we can assure the American taxpayer that \nSenator Harkin is rightly concerned that we won't spend $125 billion to \nexpand NATO, is to define the terms of the future, not just react to \nthem, make them, expand NATO, make this commitment, and I believe it \nmeans we will not be spending the kind of excesses that I also fear \nwith the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will respond with a couple of things.\n  First of all, I have to ask again the question: Can these three \nmembers, these three nations, can they afford membership in NATO or can \nthey not? Can they afford to bear the burden or can they not? We have \nbeen told they can. One of the requirements for membership is they can \npay the tab. These three nations have stated over and over they could \nafford it.\n  Now I am hearing, wait a minute, no, maybe they can't, because now we \nwill have to give them a lot of subsidies to buy weapons systems. Well, \nif that is the case, then do they have the economic strength to join \nNATO? It seems like we cannot have it both ways. If they have the \neconomic strength, why do they need all the subsidies? If they don't, \nare they really capable of joining NATO?\n  Secondly, yes, I am concerned about these types of giveaway programs \nand loans and grants. I say to my friend from Connecticut, we have--I \nhave been on the Defense Appropriations Committee for several years \nnow, and I have been in some aviation things going back almost 20 \nyears, both in the House and the Senate. I say to my friend from \nConnecticut, we have always been faced with other countries \nsubsidizing, in many cases more than we ever subsidized our arms \nmanufacturers.\n  So how do we beat them? We beat them because we make the \nbest products. We have the best quality. No one can match our aircraft. \nNo one can match our weapons systems. No one can match not only the \nquality but the kind of support infrastructure that we can provide for \nthose weapons systems. So other countries might have to subsidize \ntheirs a little bit more, but only\n\n[[Page S3676]]\n\nbecause they cannot match us in those areas. So we have been quite \ncapable of competing and winning in the world market our share of \ndefense items in the past. I do not think that will change in the \nfuture.\n\n  So in the last decade we have written off or forgiven over $10 \nbillion in default of loans on military-related items on this. I think, \nagain, we have to be very careful about this. We are told it will only \ncost us $400 million, but now what I hear is no, that is only for the \ncommon costs. This could go up and up and up and up, subsidy after \nsubsidy after subsidy.\n  Then we hear that is only if there is a crisis. Fine. If there is a \ncrisis we will address it then. But even the administration has said \nany threat to Europe to these nations is not imminent and would take \nyears to develop. So we are not facing something that might happen in \nthe next few months or even in the next couple of years or so, even \naccording to the administration's own admission.\n  Therefore, I submit once more, Mr. President, that to keep the costs \ndown, to be honest with the taxpayers of this country, what my \namendment says is what is good for the common costs--that is, we limit \nour involvement to 25 percent--that we should limit the 25 percent, for \nsubsidies for all of those national costs, also. That is all this \namendment does. My friend from Oregon, my amendment does not stop NATO \nexpansion. It simply says no longer will our taxpayers simply pick up \nthe tab.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, with all respect for my friend \nfrom Iowa, I believe the Harkin amendment attempts to strangle NATO's \nexpansion because it cannot prevent NATO expansion. This amendment \nplaces unreasonable restrictions on expenditures by limiting our \nassistance to new NATO members to 25 percent of all assistance provided \nto these countries by current NATO members.\n  I urge my colleagues to read carefully the resolution of ratification \nthat we have before us. Condition two requires the President to certify \nthat the United States is under no obligation to subsidize the national \nexpenses necessary for Poland, Hungary, or the Czech Republic, to meet \nthose countries' NATO commitments.\n  Let me be clear on this point. In signing the Protocols of Accession \nwith these three countries, the United States has not signed up to foot \nthe bill for their membership in NATO, and Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic understand that it is ultimately their responsibility to \nmake the necessary improvements to their military structures.\n  Now, my friend from Iowa knows that in the past, the U.S. Congress \nhas authorized and appropriated funds for countries in Central and \nEastern Europe to assist in their efforts to meet the criteria for NATO \nmembership.\n  Approving this resolution, however, in no way restricts the \ncongressional prerogative to make this decision on an annual basis. In \nother words, why draw an arbitrary line now? We are going to do this on \na regular basis anyway as circumstances change.\n  If in the future years we determine that Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic do not warrant or do not need the U.S. assistance, we \nwill not authorize and appropriate it. I trust that future Congresses \nwill be able to make this decision based on the circumstances in their \ntime and will not need artificial percentages to dictate how our \nassistance should be appropriated.\n  I also confess concern about the signal that would be sent if the \nSenate adopted the Harkin amendment. Does approval of this amendment \nmean that the United States would only need NATO 25 percent of the time \nno matter what our security interests may be? Does it mean that the \nUnited States is interested in only 25 percent of NATO's activities, \nexercises, and planning processes? Does it mean that the United States \nwould participate in just 25 percent of NATO operations despite any \npotential threat posed to the alliance? I think these questions \ndemonstrate why arbitrary ceilings simply do not belong.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that we allow the Congress to make funding \ndecisions based on our foreign policy interests and that we reject any \neffort to tie our assistance to countries in Central and Eastern Europe \nto that provided by our NATO allies. I, therefore, urge my colleagues \nto oppose the Harkin amendment, which I do today.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to briefly touch on an issue the \nSenator from Connecticut mentioned, and that is lobbying by defense \ncontractors.\n  At the outset, I want to say that I have not been contacted by any \neither. I don't know that my staff has; at least they haven't told me \nthat. I respond by reading from an article that appeared in the New \nYork Times on March 30, which I obviously got off the Internet, in \nwhich the writer of the article went on to say that ``The chief vehicle \nof support for NATO expansion is a group called `The U.S. Committee to \nExpand NATO'.'' The president of that innocent-sounding group is Bruce \nJackson, director of strategic planning for Lockheed, a vice president \nfor Lockheed for strategic planning.\n  Mr. President, again, a lot of these people have been championing \nNATO membership for these countries. He quoted me as saying that ``This \nmay amount to `a Marshall Plan' for defense contractors who are \nchomping at the bit to sell weapons and make profits.'' Well, I am a \nDemocrat, and it says, ``A top Republican aide joked that the arms \nmakers were so eager for NATO expansion, we will probably be giving \nlandlocked Hungary a new navy.'' Those are just musings and comments by \nvarious and sundry people.\n  Again, this gets back to the question of whether or not we are going \nto ask the taxpayers of this country to provide subsidies over, above, \nand beyond what they kind of have been told in terms of NATO expansion \nas to what the costs would be. Yes, if these countries are going to \nupgrade their weapons system, sure. Do I want our defense contractors \nto be in there to provide them the necessary resources they need for \ndefense? Absolutely. But do I want them there when the taxpayers say--\nas I pointed out to my friend from Connecticut, which we have seen so \noften in the past, for one of those countries may say that we need a \ncertain system and it cost $1.98. Since there is no limit on the \nsubsidies, one of our contractors could come in and say: You don't need \nthe $1.98 one, you need the $100 version. Hungry, Poland, or the Czech \nRepublic may say: We can't afford that. The contractor may say: Not to \nworry. You see, under the situation we have now, the U.S. taxpayers \nwill provide the subsidy for it and you can go ahead and have it.\n  Once again, our taxpayers are stuck with it. I think that is the \nnormal course. If there is a crisis, as has been stated many times, \nwell, this would hamstring us in terms of a crisis. Again, I point out \nthat no one is saying there is any imminent threat of any crisis at \nall. The administration says that for years ahead Russia is no threat. \nSo if, in fact, a crisis comes up in the future--in the distant \nfuture--we have time to react, we have time on both the authorizing \ncommittee and on the appropriating committee to make changes, to make \nsure these countries have the adequate and necessary defense \ncapabilities to defend themselves. But to just give a blank check now, \nI think, is wrong. I think it will cost the taxpayers of this country \nuntold billions of dollars, unless we put the same cap on our subsidies \nfor national expenses that we have on the common costs.\n\n  We have agreed with our fellow member nations in NATO that on the \ncommon costs we would provide about 25 percent. I see no reason why \nthat same logic cannot prevail and be used to cap our exposure on the \nnational costs. In fact, I have gotten an idea this morning that I may \noffer another amendment to this bill, and that is to get other member \ncountries of NATO to also agree that their subsidies, their proportion \nof the national costs, would not exceed what their proportion is under \nthe common costs. Now, we cannot force them to do that, but it seems to \nme that should be one of the negotiating principles that we would use \nwith other countries when they want to expand and enlarge NATO. In \nfact, it kind of comes as a surprise to me that\n\n[[Page S3677]]\n\nwe did not do that in the beginning. If we really want honest \naccounting, and we want the European countries that are quite wealthy \nnow to bear their fair share of the costs, it seems to me that we \nshould have insisted in the beginning that the same proportionality \nthat pertains to the common costs should pertain to the national costs. \nTo me, this is a gaping hole, and the first place to close it is here \nwith this bill, by saying that the United States will provide no more \nthan its 25-percent share of those national costs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve my time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I wonder if the Senator from Washington will yield up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Certainly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to respond briefly to two \npoints. One is on the question of the involvement of the American \ndefense industry in this debate. The Senator from Iowa cited a news \narticle indicating that a group called the U.S. Committee to Expand \nNATO, headed by a gentleman involved in the defense industry--honestly, \nI don't know the facts about that committee at all, but I have seen \nsome advertisements they have placed. But what I want to do is \nsuggest--and I know the Senator from Iowa didn't mean to say this in \nquoting the article--that the support for NATO enlargement is quite \nbroad. It is enormous. It goes well beyond this one organization headed \nby this one man. There are a host of military and veterans' \norganizations that I think support this because they have learned the \nlessons. They feel enlarging NATO is one of the rewards, if you will, \nfor their service over the long years of the cold war. It was one of \nthe goals they aspired to--to free the captive nations and let them \nbecome part of the community of freedom-loving nations. AMVETS supports \nNATO enlargement, as do the American Legion Association, U.S. Army \nJewish War Veterans, Marine Corps League, National Guard Association, \nReserve Officers Association, Veterans of Foreign Wars \nAssociation, and, in addition, a host of civic policy and political \norganizations, including, interestingly, the Council of State \nGovernments, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, a host of State legislative \nbodies, including my own State senate in Connecticut that spoke on \nbehalf of enlargement;\n\n  A true rainbow coalition of ethnic organizations, American ethnic \norganizations, many of whom have members who have family ties to the \npeople who have suffered for almost five decades, four decades anyway, \nunder Soviet Communist domination, are now thrilled that their family \nand friends can enjoy the blessings of liberty and want to affirm that \nopportunity by membership in NATO;\n  Many business and labor organizations, including the AFL-CIO, support \nthe enlargement of NATO. So this is a very broad-based organizational \neffort, much beyond one group;\n  A remarkable number of high-level officials have signed a statement \nof support of NATO enlargement; former Vice Presidents Quayle and \nMondale; former Secretaries of State Baker, Christopher, Eagleburger, \nHaig, Rodgers, Shultz, Kissinger, and Vance. I believe that is every \nliving former Secretary of State;\n  Former National Security Advisers Allen, Brzezinski, Lake, McFarland, \nand Powell;\n  Former Secretaries of Defense Carlucci, Cheney, Clifford, Perry, and \nRumsfeld.\n  It is a remarkable, broad coalition, much beyond one person whose \naffiliation may be the defense industry and an organization that I \npresume is much larger than that.\n  The second and final point that I want to make is I want to draw on \nsomething that the Senator from Oregon said, and it helps me to make a \npoint about what I believe to be one of the unintended, certainly \nundesirable, consequences if we should adopt the Harkin amendment, \nwhich I hope we will not. The Senator from Oregon has occasionally held \ntown meetings in Oregon. He has asked about NATO enlargement. Do we \nwant to send your sons? How will you respond to the question of why \nwould you send your sons to defend Budapest or Warsaw or Prague?\n  One of the effects of enlarging NATO is in effect quite the opposite, \nwhich is to bring the military forces, 200,000 strong, into the common \neffort to defend NATO and its member states from security threats to it \nand them. That involves a scenario that I suggested earlier that may \noccur in the Middle East around Iraq and other trouble spots around the \nworld. What I am confident of is there will be an enthusiasm and a \nsteadfastness to participate among these three new members that we \ndon't always find, frankly, among the other members who have been with \nus from the beginning.\n  The question could almost be turned. That is, expanding NATO holds \nthe prospect that Hungarian soldiers, Czech soldiers, and Polish \nsoldiers will be sent to trouble spots in the world and not require \nAmerican soldiers to be sent, certainly not in the same numbers. I \nbelieve that one of the consequences of this amendment putting an \narbitrary 25 percent cap on American involvement here will be to make \nit impossible for us to draw down supplies and equipment to offer \nassistance to those soldiers of these three countries when they share \nour burden and place less of a burden on our military and on those who \nwear the American uniform.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, 10 days ago in a column appearing in the \nWashington Post, Charles Krauthammer wrote:\n\n       By ruling Central Europe out of bounds to Russia, NATO \n     expansion takes one of this century's fatal temptations off \n     the table. It is the easiest U.S. foreign policy call of the \n     decade.\n\n  Why is it the easiest foreign policy call of the decade? Because the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization for 50 years has preserved the peace \nof Europe and the peace of the United States. As a result of the North \nAtlantic Treaty Organization, the Soviet Union literally ceased to \nexist. All of this was accomplished by a military alliance that never \nwas required to fight or to sacrifice its young men and women in a \nmilitary conflict within the bounds of that organization.\n  Why did the North Atlantic Treaty Organization come into existence in \nthe first place? Because the first half of this century showed that \nboth world wars began in Central Europe because of the weakness, the \ninstability, the unsettled nature of the former empires and the then \nnational states in that part of Europe, occupied almost wholly by the \nSoviet Union at the end of World War II. The West could only be \ndefended by a military organization of which the United States was a \npart. Behind the magnificent defensive line, the parapets, built by the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization, Western Europe became free, \ndemocratic, and prosperous.\n  During that 50 years, we and the Western Europeans invested not an \ninconsiderable amount of money in communicating those ideas of freedom \nto the people of Central and Eastern Europe through the Voice of \nAmerica and other such organizations. It is clear now that nothing was \ndesired by the people of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary more \nthan to join the free and prosperous countries of Western Europe. \nPartly because of our efforts through NATO, partly because of our \neconomic success, and partly from their growing dedication to freedom, \nthey freed themselves--they freed themselves--from the Soviet Union. \nThe Soviet Union disappeared and became Russia, a country still \nunstable, a country with candidates for President in the year 2000 who \nwould desire nothing more than the restoration of the old Soviet Union.\n  So the rationale of the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization is to say, no; these countries freed by their own efforts \nand our own efforts will stay freer. They will be to us as Germany and \nFrance and Normandy have been for the last half century. What history \nteaches us is that a political vacuum filled with weakness and \nirresolution is a temptation to an aggressor. Countries a part of the \nNorth\n\n[[Page S3678]]\n\nAtlantic Treaty Organization were not such a temptation, even at the \nheight of the power of the Soviet Union.\n  Accession to NATO is as close to a guarantee as we can possibly come \nof the fact that our sons and daughters will not die in Warsaw or in \nPrague or in Budapest any more than they were required to do so in Oslo \nor in Paris in the course of the last half century.\n  Mr. President, this is the easiest foreign policy call of the decade. \nThe North Atlantic Treaty Organization will lend strength to us, a \ncontribution to our own defense, but most importantly the security of \ncountries that have not been secure that want to join us in prosperity \nand in safety as they have in freedom.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Iowa is simply another attempt to \nmake these members second-class members. We have already stated that we \nmade no commitment at all, a zero commitment, to subsidize the national \nexpenses for these countries. How much, if any, we subsidize them in \nthe future is a decision that can and should be made in the future and \nnot in the course of this debate.\n  Even more mischievous, in my view, Mr. President, are amendments to \nsay that there will be no further expansion, that we will leave a \nvacuum unless certain preconditions are made. For more than 50 years \nthe United States of America refused to recognize the annexation of the \nBaltic republics by the Soviet Union. When their cause was deemed to be \na hopeless cause by almost everyone, they, too, have freed themselves. \nThey, too, want at some future date to be a part of NATO. They, too, \ncreate a vacuum at the present time in the power structure of Central \nand of Eastern Europe.\n  To pass an amendment that is likely to be proposed by another of my \ncolleagues that singles them out as being countries we will not want to \ndefend or be a part of without special circumstances, in my view, is \nsimply an engraved invitation to some future Russian Government to say: \nWe're coming back in; we don't care about your desire for freedom. \nYou're a part of us whether you like it or not. And, look, the \nAmericans have in effect in the Senate said that's OK.\n  That is the essence of instability and of uncertainty, not only for \nthe nations immediately involved but for all of us.\n  Certainty created through 50 years by the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization is the best guarantor of peace. I am convinced we should \nreject all limiting amendments, admit these three nations, and judge in \nthe future what additional nations should be admitted to NATO--nations, \nin my opinion, consisting of all of those that become real democracies, \nreal free market countries, with a real desire not only to be a part of \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization but to contribute their own \nstrength to it.\n  We should reject the Harkin amendment. We should grant the accession \nof the three countries before us at the present time without further \nconditions, and in the good faith that their accession will strengthen \npeace, strengthen their democracy, and strengthen our own security.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto address the Senate as if in morning business past the agreed upon \ntime of 12:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the moment I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I realize we only have a minute or two \nbefore the unanimous consent order kicks in which ends discussion at \n12:45, but let me say for the record that one of the aspects of the \namendment that we are considering and will be voting on when we come \nback from our caucus luncheons, the Harkin amendment, deals with \nrequiring excess military materiel transferred to any NATO country--in \nthis case, the three new members--to be counted against our common \nbudget.\n  I did not have these numbers before, but I want to put them in the \nRecord now. The Senator from Iowa has contended that we provide aid \nonly to the less well off countries in NATO, and he implied they are \nthe only ones we have given this excess military equipment to. Most \npeople don't know what we are talking about here, so let me make it \nclear. Here are the facts.\n  In fiscal year 1996, we provided excess defense articles to the \nfollowing countries: Denmark, Germany, Greece, Portugal, and Turkey, \nfor a total value of $55 million. In fiscal year 1997, these excess \narticles went to the United Kingdom, Norway, Spain, and Turkey; value: \n$113 million. And my friend from Iowa, if his amendment passes, would \nsay we can continue to spend taxpayers' money for what we believe is in \nour national interest to give excess items to other NATO countries, not \npart of our NATO requirement but our individual judgment, but we could \nnot do the same for Poland, the Czech Republic, or Hungary. I think \nthat would a serious mistake. If he wishes to do that and ``save the \ntaxpayers' money,'' why not have his amendment say no excess military \narms could go to any NATO country? Why single out for this second-class \ntreatment the three new countries?\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Delaware. His statement is a very \nimportant contribution to this debate on NATO, and I appreciate the \nfact that not only is he giving the Senate information but the great \njob the Senator is doing on this issue here for these many days. I am \nvery appreciative.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. There is no one more qualified, in my view, in the Senate \nthan the Senator from Delaware, on this issue especially, but other \nforeign policy issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/28/senate-section/article/S3667-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3678-S3680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY'S CAMPAIGN OF DIVERSION\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, much has been said and written about the \ntobacco bill approved by the Senate Commerce Committee 19 to 1, three \nweeks ago.\n  The Senate will soon have an opportunity to debate, offer amendments \nand vote on tobacco legislation. I know the Senate can and must work \ncooperatively and without partisanship, as we have on the Commerce \nCommittee, to improve the measure, and assure that it serves the public \nhealth interests of our nation--most particularly our children.\n  The Commerce Committee measure is a bipartisan bill that was \ndeveloped in consultation with the attorneys general, the \nadministration and the public health representatives including Dr. \nKoop, Dr. Kessler, and Matt Myers of the National Center for Tobacco \nFree-Kids.\n  It's a comprehensive bill aimed at dramatically reducing youth \nsmoking. Every living Surgeon General has signed a letter to Congress \nurging us to pass comprehensive legislation this year to address what \nis our nation's number one public health problem.\n  The tobacco industry is now embarked on a campaign of diversion to \nchange the subject from health and children. They are trying to take \nattention away from the facts, and use specious ``buzz word'' attacks \nto kill a bill they know might actually stop kids from smoking and \nreduce their ability to lock teens in as lifetime smokers.\n  So, Mr. President, this is about money--the tobacco industry's \nmoney--and the lengths they'll go to make more, including lieing to \nCongress, manipulating nicotine to hook customers and marketing to \nkids.\n  Mr. President, I would like to quote recent newspaper items \nresponding to the industry's attacks and regarding new evidence of the \nprevalence of smoking among minority children as reported in the \nWashington Post. First, from USA Today:\n\n       Some, ever eager for some raw meat, were sucked right in by \n     the rhetoric. But before you believe it, pause a moment for \n     one little bit of truth: Everything the industry is railing \n     against today it agreed to in some form just 10 months ago. \n     Here's the rundown:\n\n[[Page S3679]]\n\n       Big tax boost. Half a trillion dollars. That's how much \n     those greedy lawmakers want to take from smokers. And a \n     disproportionate amount would come from poor people because \n     they smoke more.\n       But wait a minute. Where were these brave champions of the \n     downtrodden last June? Ooops. They were signing a settlement \n     deal with a group of state attorneys general to dig $400 \n     billion from smokers' pockets. The AGs and congress sought \n     high prices to discourage smoking, particularly in the teen \n     years when most smokers start. The poor? Flip the tax idea \n     around. Imagine what the reaction would be to a plan that \n     lowered their costs in order to lure them into a deadly \n     habit.\n       Big government. Standing athwart the onward march of big \n     government, tobacco executives now warn that ``Washington \n     wants to create 17 new bureaucracies.'' Memories of \n     Clintoncare dance in their heads.\n       Just don't pay any attention to the fact that 10 months ago \n     these same executives were whipping big government on. The \n     June settlement gave the Food and Drug Administration a 30% \n     boost in its budget, the feds new powers to ban indoor \n     smoking, and on and on.\n       Ad restrictions. Why those do-gooders in Washington even \n     want to strip the industry of its First Amendment rights by \n     sharply restricting advertising. No human images, no color \n     ads, and so on. Yet somehow all this was perfectly fine with \n     the industry last June.\n       Tobacco farmers. Congress' plan would put hundreds, if not \n     thousands, of tobacco farmers out of work. The Senate bill \n     does set aside some $28 billion in a trust fund to help \n     growers and their communities dislocated by the cut in \n     smoking rates. Guess how much the industry secured for these \n     beloved farmers when cutting its June deal? Zip. Zero. Nada.\n       What changed between June and today is this: Congress \n     started to give the appearance of closing loopholes the \n     industry had artfully built into the June deal--a tactic it \n     has exploited in the past. Penalties for failing to reduce \n     teen smoking, for instance, were too small to matter.\n       Some observers have suggested that the industry quit \n     negotiations now only to improve chances for a weak deal \n     later. That remains to be seen, but one thing is certain. All \n     Big Tobacco has done for two weeks is blow smoke.\n\n  As reported in the Washington Post:\n\n       The latest annual report by the surgeon general, David \n     Satcher, showed what other studies have highlighted: that \n     smoking continues to increase in allure to young people even \n     as fewer adults smoke. Over the past six years, it said, \n     youth smoking has risen by nearly a third, and some 40 \n     percent of white high school students smoke. Smoking by high \n     school-age blacks, who still smoke less than white \n     counterparts, rose by nearly 80 percent from 1991 to 1997. \n     The smoking rate among Hispanic students rose by 34 percent, \n     the study found.\n\n  Here are the facts.\n  First the statistics on youth smoking are clear and alarming: 3000 \nkids a day start smoking every day; 1000 of them will die early from \nsmoking related disease; and one out of every three adolescents uses \ntobacco by age 18. Mr. President, we're not talking about kids who \nsneak a cigarette out of their mother's purse. According to a Surgeon \nGeneral's report: Seventy-one percent of youth smokers, use tobacco \ndaily.\n  The Centers for Disease Control reports that youth smoking is on the \nrise, a trend that the American Cancer Society calls a ``pediatric \nepidemic.'' Ninety percent of lifetime smokers take up the habit before \nthe age of 18--when it is illegal to buy tobacco products in every \nstate in the union. We know from documents discovered in state suits \nagainst the tobacco industry that they have long understood the adverse \nhealth impacts and addictiveness of their products, yet actively \nmarketed to children, including studying 5-7 year olds.\n  The cost of this problem is enormous!\n  Mr. President, 435 thousand Americans die from smoking related \nillness every year--the single greatest cause of preventable disease \nand death in America by far. Every year, taxpayers must foot the bill \nfor $50 billion in health care costs to treat smoking related disease. \nAccording to the Department of the Treasury, smoking related injury, \ndamage and economic cost exceed over $130 billion annually. To recoup \nsome of these costs to taxpayers, 41 states have sued the industry.\n  Mr. President, the severity and urgency of the problem is beyond \nquestion. Now is the time for action. As I said, every living surgeon \ngeneral of the United States has signed a letter urging Congress to \npass comprehensive tobacco control legislation.\n  The bill passed by the Commerce Committee is comprehensive and \nmirrors the framework of the tobacco settlement reached between the \nindustry and the attorney general.\n  The bill: Restricts tobacco advertising and marketing aimed at kids; \nsets aggressive but achievable youth smoking reduction targets, and \nholds the industry responsible for failing to achieve the reductions; \nincreases the price-per-pack of cigarettes by $1.10 over five years to \nreduce youth consumption. Experts agree such a hike is a critical part \nof the overall effort to curb youth from smoking.\n  It provides the Food and Drug Administration with authority to \noversee nicotine and tobacco product ingredients and marketing. It \nrequires the industry to pay up to $516 billion over 25 years to \ncompensate states for tobacco related costs to Medicaid and public \nhealth programs; to fund youth smoking reduction and health research \ninitiatives; and to assist tobacco farmers.\n  The bill is about our kids, it's about accountability and it's about \nsolving a national problem. The industry wants to change the subject \nwith the tried and true tactics of diversion.\n  I understand they now intend to spend $100 million for print and \nbroadcast media to maintain the status quo. Perhaps if the industry had \nspent some of their resources on legitimate anti-youth smoking \nactivities, we wouldn't have the problem we do today.\n  The industry diversion play book consists of four themes.\n\n\ndiversion one--solving the problem of youth smoking is really about tax \n                          and spend government\n\n  Experts agree that a price increase is an essential component of the \neffort to stop youth from taking up the habit--the industry doesn't \nwant a bill that will truly diminish the number of their \n``replacement'' users.\n  The money raised by a settlement would be used to reimburse taxpayers \nfor the $50 billion yearly tax that big tobacco places on American \ntaxpayers in the form of tobacco health care--including a substantial \ndrain on Medicare and Medicaid.\n  The funds would also finance: Youth anti-smoking initiatives; vital \nhealth research to find new cures and treatment for smoking related \ndisease including, cancer, stroke and heart disease. It would assist \nfarmers who will be affected by reductions in tobacco consumption--hard \nworking middle class Americans who for years have been encouraged to \ngrow tobacco by federal policies.\n  The bulk of the revenue raised--up to $195 billion--will be dispensed \nto the states to settle their cases against the tobacco companies and \ncould be used for tax cuts at the State level.\n  It's more than slightly ironic that last summer the industry agreed \nto a substantial price increase in their settlement with the attorneys \ngeneral. They further tax their own credibility by suggesting that an \nadditional 10 cents more per year by the year 2003 is the difference \nbetween enlightened public policy and tax and spend government.\n\n\ndiversion two--the effort to stop youth smoking is about big government\n\n  The tobacco companys ads say that the bill approved by the Commerce \nCommittee contains seventeen new boards and panels, and is government \nrun amok.\n  Of the dozen boards, most of which were contemplated in the \nindustry's agreement, eight of them are part-time or advisory and \nentail little or no cost; two are temporary, including one created to \nreimburse small business people for the termination of cigarette \nvending machines. And, one is to ensure that increased research dollars \nare not wasted.\n  Furthermore, the majority of these initiatives were contemplated in \nthe June 20th agreement signed by the industry.\n\n\n             Diversion Three--The industry will go bankrupt\n\n  The Commerce Committee bill implements the President's request for \n$1.10 increase in the price per pack of cigarettes over five years.\n  The Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, Lawrence Summers, testified \nbefore the Commerce Committee that this increase would not bankrupt or \nrender the industry financially unviable.\n  The President has stated that it is not the administration's \nintention to drive the industry out of business, but to get them to \nstop marketing and selling to kids.\n  If the industry truly believes the President's request creates a \nbankruptcy situation, it's incumbent upon\n\n[[Page S3680]]\n\nthem to make their case to the Department of the Treasury, not simply \nwalk away from the table, and threaten to go back to business as usual.\n\n\n       diversion four--price increases will create a black market\n\n  Again, the administration has assured that the President's request \nwill not stimulate a substantial black market.\n  It's important to understand that today there is a black market today \nin cigarettes, as there is in a variety of consumer goods.\n  If the industry has credible evidence that price hikes will create a \nsubstantial black market that poses a threat to public safety or health \nthey should produce that evidence.\n  I don't believe, however, that most Americans would agree we should \nrefrain from doing what's necessary to stop youth smoking based on \nunsubstantiated conjecture.\n  One answer to the omnipresent black market issue is to better enforce \nour laws against smuggling and sale of contraband.\n  Let me conclude by saying Congress and the administration must focus \non enacting a fair, effective and responsible piece of legislation that \nwill stop youth from smoking. The American people demand it.\n  They do not want a political football, or partisan politics.\n  Certainly, improvements in the Commerce Committee bill can be made, \nand I look forward to continuing to work with all Senators to achieve \nthat end. Now is the time for all sides to lower the rhetoric, make \ntheir case and let the legislative process work.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the Presiding Officer, \nand I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/28/senate-section/article/S3678-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nat this time to modify the Kyl amendment with the modification that is \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Executive amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       In paragraph (1) of section 3, after ``(1) The Strategic \n     Concept of NATO.--'' insert the following:\n       (A) Policy of the united states toward the strategic \n     concept of nato.--The Senate understands that the policy of \n     the United States is that the core concepts contained in the \n     1991 Strategic Concept of NATO (as defined in (1)(F)), which \n     adapted NATO's strategy of the post-Cold War environment, \n     remain valid today, and that the upcoming revision of that \n     document will reflect the following principles:\n       (i) First and foremost a military alliance.--NATO is first \n     and foremost a military alliance. NATO's success in securing \n     peace is predicated on its military strength and strategic \n     unity.\n       (ii) Principal foundation for defense of security interests \n     of nato members.--NATO serves as the principal foundation for \n     collectively defending the security interests of its members \n     against external threats.\n       (iii) Promotion and protection of united states vital \n     national security interests.--Strong United States leadership \n     of NATO promotes and protects United States vital national \n     security interests.\n       (iv) United states leadership role.--The United States \n     maintains its leadership role of NATO through the stationing \n     of United States combat forces in Europe, providing military \n     commanders for key NATO commands, and through the presence of \n     United States nuclear forces on the territory of Europe.\n       (v) Common threats.--NATO members will face common threats \n     to their security in the post-Cold War environment, \n     including--\n       (I) the potential for the re-emergence of a hegemonic power \n     confronting Europe;\n       (II) rogue states and non-state actors possessing nuclear, \n     biological, or chemical weapons and the means to deliver \n     these weapons by ballistic or cruise missiles, or other \n     unconventional delivery means;\n       (III) threats of a wider nature, including the disruption \n     of the flow of vital resources, and other possible \n     transnational threats; and\n       (IV) conflict in the North Atlantic area stemming from \n     ethnic and religious enmity, the revival of historic disputes \n     or the actions of undemocratic leaders.\n       (iv) Core mission of nato.--Defense planning will affirm a \n     commitment by NATO members to a credible capability for \n     collective self-defense, which remains the core mission of \n     NATO. All NATO members will contribute to this core mission.\n       (vii) Capacity to respond to common threats.--NATO's \n     continued success requires a credible military capability to \n     deter and respond to common threats. Building on its core \n     capabilities for collective self-defense of its members, NATO \n     will ensure that its military force structure, defense \n     planning, command structures, and force goals promote NATO's \n     capacity to project power when the security of a NATO member \n     is threatened, and provide a basis for ad hoc coalitions of \n     willing partners among NATO members. This will require that \n     NATO members possess national military capabilities to \n     rapidly deploy forces over long distances, sustain operations \n     for extended periods of time, and operate jointly with the \n     United States in high intensity conflicts.\n       (viii) Integrated military structure.--The Integrated \n     Military Structure of NATO underpins NATO's effectiveness as \n     a military alliance by embedding NATO members in a process of \n     cooperative defense planning and ensuring unity of command.\n       (ix) Nuclear posture.--Nuclear weapons will continue to \n     make an essential contribution to deterring aggression, \n     especially aggression by potential adversaries armed with \n     nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons. A credible NATO \n     nuclear deterrent posture requires the stationing of United \n     States nuclear forces in Europe, which provides an essential \n     political and military link between Europe and North America, \n     and the widespread participation of NATO members in nuclear \n     roles. In addition, the NATO deterrent posture will continue \n     to ensure uncertainty in the mind of any potential aggressor \n     about the nature of the response by NATO members to military \n     aggression.\n       (x) Burdensharing.--The responsibility and financial burden \n     of defending the democracies of Europe will be more equitably \n     shared in a manner in which specific obligations and force \n     goals are met by NATO members.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:30 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate resume consideration of the Kyl amendment No. 2310, \nas modified, and there be 30 minutes equally divided for debate on the \namendment. Further, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nexpiration or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote on or \nin relation to the Kyl amendment, and further that no amendments be in \norder to the Kyl amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I further ask that following the vote on \nadoption of the State Department conference report, at 2:25 p.m., there \nbe 2 minutes equally divided for closing remarks on the Harkin \namendment prior to the vote on or in relation to the Harkin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided for closing remarks prior to the vote \non the adoption of the conference report accompanying H.R. 1757, which \nthe clerk will now report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1757), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes. It is what, 5 minutes each?\n\n[[Page S3681]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes on each side.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield myself half of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Notify me when it is over.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, rumors, they are aflying to the effect that the \nPresident of the United States has instructed the Democrats of the \nSenate to vote against this conference report and, if my intelligence \nsources are correct, it will get about three Democratic votes this \nafternoon. That compares with the vote of 90-5 for this very same bill, \nlargely, that was passed by the Senate. If such game playing is going \nto happen, and if this conference report is defeated because of that \nsort of thing, then the President is going to have a difficult time \nabout a lot of things.\n  Let me say it again. The pending conference report is the result of \nmore than a year's hard work by Senator Biden and Secretary Albright \nand Judd Gregg, Rod Grams, and many others to abolish two antiquated \ntemporary Federal registries created in the 1950s and bringing reform \nto the United Nations. Now, if this conference report is defeated this \nafternoon, so be it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, the chairman and I have worked very, very \nhard over the last 9 months to produce this bill. I will not reiterate \nall that each of us said last week at the end of the day. We have no \nreal disagreement in terms of the substance of the bill. We have a \ndisagreement on not even whether or not we should attach a provision \nrelating to family planning and abortion in the bill. We don't even \ndisagree on that. The chairman had nothing to do with that being in. He \nis a strong supporter of the family planning limitation that is in this \nbill, so-called Mexico City, although he did not ask for it to be put \nin this bill, but it is on the bill. We are faced with the reality, it \nis on the bill.\n\n  The question is, What do we do from here? I urge my colleagues, \nnotwithstanding the agreement the Senator and I have in every other \naspect of the bill, to vote against this conference report. I do so \nbecause, at the insistence of the House, the Mexico City provision, \nwhich is not related to the underlying legislation, is in the bill, and \nstopping the conference report, I hope--and I may be tactically wrong \nhere; this is my objective--I hope we send a signal to the House that \nwe will not yield to what I characterize--not the chairman, ``me''--\ncharacterize, as legislative blackmail on this or other controversial \nissues.\n  As indicated, it would be inappropriate, if the Democrats took back \nthe House next time out--I have no idea whether that will happen, but \nif they did--for them to attach to one of the bills an education \nprovision that no one on the Republican side liked and said, ``Take it \nor leave it.'' I think it is a mistake.\n  The underlying legislation is critically important to American \nforeign policy. It would pay off our arrearages to the United Nations \nand bring additional reform to that body and reorganize our foreign \npolicy agency, and it begins to provide the funds, in essence, to \nrestore our diplomatic presence worldwide. I believe the President will \nsign it promptly, provided we send him one without Mexico City \nattached.\n  Again, the only thing that the chairman and I disagree on, he \nbelieves, and he believed, and I believe he believes it, that what the \nHouse sent is at least a compromise on Mexico City. I view it as not a \ncompromise at all on Mexico City.\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject this conference report so we can \nreturn to conference and produce a bill that the President can sign.\n  I reserve the balance of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I see the Senator from Texas is standing. After he speaks, \nI am delighted to yield my 2 minutes in closing to my friend from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I want to ask the distinguished chairman of the committee \na question, if I might, if he will yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. HELMS. I yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Obviously, a great deal of compromise has occurred on our \nside of the aisle with regard to arrearages at the United Nations. That \nis now, obviously, a focal point of this bill. I have to assume that \nthe President would have to understand that if this bill is defeated \ntoday, his chances of getting any arrearage funding for the United \nNations in this Congress would be diminished substantially and probably \nwould not happen.\n  I ask the chairman his views on that.\n  Mr. HELMS. If I have anything to do with it, there will be no action \non arrearages or anything else that the President is interested in.\n  Now, he has waved that veto flag time and time again. Let him wave it \nthis time, but he must bear in mind that this is it, this is the end of \nit, one way or the other.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield to my colleague from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will join, I hope with the vast majority \nof colleagues on this side of the aisle, to vote against this bill even \nthough the bill is an important bill and it is one that I have worked \non with the ranking member and chairman for a long period of time.\n  I know the chairman worked diligently to try to break this bill free \nof the Mexico City language and to try to have the capacity to move \nforward on the floor. I applaud him for his good-faith efforts to do \nthat.\n  Let me say to my colleagues that this is a tragedy of enormous \nproportions. It is dangerous. It is damaging to the interests of the \nUnited States to tie the U.N. arrearages and larger policy questions to \none issue, to one point of view, by a very narrow percentage of Members \nof the U.S. Congress who want to tie it in this way to the United \nNations. It is a form of a kind of political blackmail.\n  The reality is that the United States of America is going to lose \nsignificant prestige, significant leverage, and our interests are going \nto be set back in the international arena. We are going to be hurt with \nrespect to issues like Bosnia. If anybody mistakes it, all you have to \ndo is look at the way in which the coalition fell apart over Iraq and \nthe issue of holding Saddam Hussein accountable for weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Talk to anybody at the United Nations and you can learn very quickly \nabout the growing anger of nations who watched the United States, which \nhas become a scofflaw within the United Nations, unwilling to live up \nto the rules that we helped to write, unwilling to fulfill our \nobligations under the United Nations, all because one point of view in \nthe U.S. Congress can't have its way.\n  I think those who think about this should think hard about what \ninterest is being served here--the interests of abortion versus the \ninterests of world leadership of the United States in the United \nNations. That is what is at stake here.\n  I think the President ought to veto this and we ought to hold those \naccountable who are unwilling to assert the interests of the United \nStates, the world's leader, all nations of the world today looking to \nus for that leadership, and here we are, handicapping ourselves over a \ntotally separate issue.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to express my opposition to \nthe measure we are about to vote on, H.R. 1757, the State Department \nAuthorization conference report. Despite the fact that this bill \ncontains many provisions which I support, such as a wide-ranging reform \npackage that would ensure U.S. payment of dues to the United Nations, \nthe entire measure is overshadowed by an egregious and misguided \nabortion provision included at the insistence of those who oppose \nabortion rights.\n  This provision would prohibit foreign organizations from receiving \nU.S. family planning funds if that organization, with its own funds, \nprovides legal abortion services or advocates on abortion issues in its \nown country. Such providers, for example, would lose their U.S.\n\n[[Page S3682]]\n\nfunds if they discussed at a conference that more than 20 percent of \nall maternal deaths throughout Latin America and the Caribbean are due \nto illegal abortion.\n  In my view, this provision is a thinly-veiled attempt to further \nerode our commitment to international family planning programs. I must \nsay, Mr. President, I am always perplexed by those who oppose family \nplanning and also oppose abortion. Study after study has shown that \nlack of family planning leads to more unintended pregnancies which \nleads to more abortions. Consider two countries: Russia has very little \ncontraception available, and abortion is the primary method of birth \ncontrol. The average Russian woman has at least four abortions in her \nlifetime! Alternatively, Hungary has made family planning services more \nwidely available and the abortion rate has dropped dramatically.\n  The impact these family planning programs have on the health and \nwell-being of women and children around the world cannot be denied. But \nthere is another issue here that should not be overlooked--the \nimportant role population programs play in sustaining the global \nenvironment.\n  The earth now supports 5.7 billion human beings. In thirty years it \nis estimated the world's population will be 8.3 billion. We are growing \nby 86 million people per year. It is expected that 90 percent of this \nincrease will be in the developing world. India has to feed an \nadditional 16 million people per year. And so many of these people are \nchildren--forty percent of the population of the average less-developed \nnation is under the age of 15.\n  Mr. President, the United States plays a critical role in providing \nfamily planning services abroad. I feel strongly that we should \ncontinue our leadership role in this area. It is both humane and \nenvironmentally sound. This conference report contains provisions that \nwould gut our commitment to international family planning, and I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose this measure.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, here we go again. As we have done so many \ntimes in recent years, we are sacrificing serious and legitimate \nnational interests to the partisan and divisive abortion debate. Due to \nthe global gag rule imposed on international family planning, I will \nvote against the conference report on H.R. 1757, the Foreign Affairs \nReform and Restructuring Act.\n  I commend the President for his strong veto message to the Congress \non this legislation. Passage of this conference report will not change \ncurrent law. A vote in favor of the conference report will not \nultimately result in the payment of the U.S. debt to the United Nations \nor the reorganization of the State Department. Passage may score \npolitical points but it will delay this important legislation and \ndiminish U.S. standing in the international community.\n  This language is anything but a compromise as proponents of the new \nglobal gag rule claim in defending the conference report. It was not \nadopted nor debated on the Senate floor. Every single Democratic \nconferee to this legislation refused to sign the conference report. \nLabeling this language a compromise is misleading and untrue.\n  Passage of the conference report will unfairly disqualify many family \nplanning organizations from receiving U.S. international family \nplanning funds if they use their own funds in their own countries to \npoint out the adverse public health consequences of medically unsafe \nabortion. The elimination of these non-governmental organizations from \nthe program, considered to be one of the best and most cost-effective \nchannels for U.S. foreign aid dollars, will have a devastating impact \non this critical foreign aid program.\n  The language in the bill will condition an organization's eligibility \nfor U.S. family planning assistance unless it agrees to surrender its \nrights to free speech and participation in the political process in its \nown country using its own funds. Proponents of the controversial \nlanguage will describe it as a ban on abortion lobbying, such as a \nrestriction would be unconstitutional if applied to American citizens \nand would undermine one of the primary objectives of our foreign \npolicy--the promotion of democracy around the world. The Senate should \nreject this conference report and the restrictive family planning \nlanguage added behind closed doors.\n  Enactment of the conference report will result in the reduction of \nfamily planning funding by $44 million. The funding cut would likely \ncause a subsequent increase in the number of abortions as couples lose \nor are denied access to contraceptive services. Any Senator who \nsupports family planning as a means to reduce the incidence of abortion \nshould oppose this bill.\n  Family planning saves lives, particularly in the developing world \nwhere a woman dies in pregnancy or childbirth every minute of every day \nand where more than 12 million children each year do not live to see \ntheir fifth birthday.\n  I urge the Senate to reject the Conference Report on the Foreign \nAffairs Reform and Restructuring Act.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nconference report on H.R. 1757--The Foreign Affairs Reform and \nRestructuring Act of 1998.\n  As is the case with many of my colleagues who have already spoken on \nthis matter, I believe that it is fundamentally wrong to be holding the \npayment of U.N. arrears and the structural reform of U.S. foreign \naffairs organization hostage to a single issue related to international \nfamily planning--an issue by the way which was never even discussed \nduring Senate consideration of this legislation. I am speaking of \ncourse of the so called Mexico City restrictions on U.S. international \npopulation programs that have been included in the legislation pending \nbefore us today--Section 1816 of the bill. These restrictions not only \nprohibit foreign non-governmental organizations that accept U.S. \nfunding from using their own funds to perform abortions, but also bar \nthem from lobbying their own governments, with their own money, on \nabortion related public policy issues.\n  Without doubt, Section 1816 is going to result in all of the other \nsections in the bill, over 160 of them--not becoming law.\n  That means that nearly two years of work on this bill will have been \nfor naught. That is unfortunate in my view, because many of the other \nprovisions are meritorious and should become law.\n  Mr. President, how did we get to where we find ourselves with respect \nto this legislation? Mr. President, let's be clear about who is \nresponsible. It was not the President who created the current dynamic--\nhe and officials in his administration have worked in good faith for \nmonths with House and Senate conferees on the legislation before us \ntoday.\n  It certainly wasn't the Senate conferees who working together had \ncome up with an acceptable package of compromises on the various \ndifference between the House and Senate passed bills --a package that \nwe all more or less agreed to and would have supported. A package that \ndid not include Mexico City language.\n  The responsibility for putting U.S. leadership at the U.N. in \njeopardy and delaying foreign affairs reorganization rests solely with \nthe House Republican leadership.\n  The Republican leadership knew full well that this entire bill was \nbeing put at risk with the inclusion of Section 1816 in this bill--a \nprovision which, incidentally, would never become law if it were to be \napplied to domestic non-governmental organizations because it is so \nfundamentally a violation of the first amendment constitutional \nprotections of free speech.\n  I know our Democratic colleagues in the House warned them of what was \nlikely to happen.\n  I know Senator Biden did as well. Certainly the President has made no \nsecret of his fundamental opposition to the so called Mexico City \nlanguage and most especially the ``global gag rule'' aspect of it.\n  Despite these warnings, the House leadership instructed House \nRepublican conferees to include this provision in the final version of \nthe bill. Not a single Democratic conferee from either the House or \nSenate supported the final conference report that we have before us \ntoday. I was one of those conferees who refused to sign onto this \nlegislation.\n  I certainly agree with those who are strongly opposed to the \ncodification of the Mexico City language into law. I\n\n[[Page S3683]]\n\nthink it is reprehensible to attempt to restrict the free speech of \nforeign non-governmental organizations and their members.\n  I happen to believe that these organizations do very important work--\nwork that is making a real difference to the health and over all \nquality of life for hundreds of millions of women and children living \nin developing countries throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America.\n  But my objections with respect to this matter go beyond the substance \nof the provision to that of the tactics that are being used here and \nfor an unwillingness to take into account U.S. national and foreign \npolicy interests that may be at stake. Proponents of this measure have \nmade no effort to balance these overarching interests against the \nnarrower ones of wanting to score partisan political points by \npromoting a very controversial agenda that clearly does not have the \nsupport of the majority of the American people.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that the Senate will vote to reject the \npending conference report and thereby send a signal that, at least in \nthe Senate, we aren't in the practice of ``legislative hostage \ntaking''--that is not the way the Senate conducts its business. In \ndoing so, we will also be sending a signal to the American people that \nwe are here to do their business, the business that we were elected to \nlook out for, and not to play games of ``partisan one upmanship.'' I \nwould urge my colleagues to join me in sending such a message by voting \nno on this measure.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this conference report contains many \nimportant provisions that deserve the support of the Senate.\n  It authorizes Congress, at long last, to pay our overdue debt to the \nUnited Nations. It clears the way for comprehensive UN reform. The bill \nalso includes a much-needed, major restructuring of our nation's \nforeign affairs agencies.\n  In the years since the Cold War ended, the maps of the world have \nbeen redrawn. The reorganization plan in this bill would enable us to \nredraw our foreign affairs structure to match the new, post-Cold War \nreality. It is the product of careful and detailed negotiations, and \nenjoys broad, bipartisan support.\n  Despite these important provisions, I regret that I will vote against \nthis conference report, and I urge my colleagues to do likewise. The \nreason I oppose this report is because, in addition to its positive \nprovisions, it also contains an extreme and extraneous provision the \nSenate has considered and rejected many times in the past. This \nprovision--the so-called ``Mexico City language''--would do serious \ndamage to international family planning efforts--including efforts that \nhave nothing to do with promoting abortion and that, in fact, help to \nprevent abortions.\n  It would do serious damage to one of the ideals on which our own \nnation was founded, freedom of speech and expression. The Mexico City \nlanguage would bar any agency that receives international family-\nplanning assistance from the U.S. from using their own funds to pay for \nabortions, or to lobby for abortions.\n  Let me repeat: This bill does not tell agencies it cannot use U.S. \nfunds for these services. That is already prohibited under existing \nlaw. This bill tells agencies in other nations that they may not use \ntheir own funds to pay for, or lobby for, abortions, without losing all \nU.S. family-planning assistance. This goes far beyond what the current \nlaw prescribes.\n  This body has rejected this kind of restriction in the past because \nwe agreed it is inappropriate to place such limitations on how \norganizations in other nations may use their own money. Mr. President, \nit is still inappropriate for us to do so. But it is important to note \nthat the Mexico City language is not simply the language this body has \npreviously rejected. In 2 important ways, it is even more extreme.\n  First, this Mexico City provision will cut funds for international \nfamily-planning services. The conference report mandates that family \nplanning agencies in other nations may not receive one dollar in U.S. \nfamily-planning assistance unless and until they certify that they will \nnot perform abortions with their own funds. It is true that the \nPresident may waive this restriction. But if he does so, U.S. aid for \ninternational family-planning programs for that year would be limited \nto $356 million--$44 million less than we are now spending.\n  Second, this new version of the Mexico City language includes a \nprovision that not only prohibits funding for any organization that \nlobbies to change abortions laws in other nations, as the former \nversion did. It goes far beyond that prohibition to forbid recipients \nof U.S. funds from making any public statements about abortion. They \nare forbidden, Mr. President, even from expressing concerns about the \ndangers of illegal abortions.\n  And the President has no authority to waive this provision. The \nSecretary of State has rightly labeled this restriction a ``gag rule.'' \nIn no way would this provision improve the lives of women and children \naround the world, nor would it reduce the incidence of abortion. \nInstead, this gag rule would violate one of our country's most hallowed \nprinciples, the principle of freedom of speech.\n\n  What kind of message would we be sending to the rest of the world if \nviolate our founding principles? That those principles are not \ninalienable after all? That they may have worked 200 years ago, but \nthey are not applicable in a modern world?\n  Surely, at a time when struggling new democracies all over the world \nare looking for guidance and inspiration, these are not messages we \nwant to send. But the greatest danger of these extreme and extraneous \nprovisions is that they will not improve the lives of women and \nchildren anywhere, nor will they prevent abortions anywhere. In fact, \nthey will have the opposite effect. They will make it more difficult \nfor women to plan their own families.\n  U.S. support of international family planning programs have \nimmeasurably improved the lives of women in developing countries. By \nhelping women limit the size of their families, we have enabled women \nto make the educational and economic gains that are essential if they, \nand their children, are to live longer and healthier lives. The number \nof women of childbearing age is increasing by 24 million every year. \nNow is not the time for this nation to cut back on our commitment to \nprograms that enable women to plan their families--programs that \nactually reduce the incidence of abortion.\n  And make no mistake, Mr. President, that would be one of the \nconsequences if we pass this conference report. There would, \ninevitably, be an increase in the number of abortions. That is not \nsomething I want to see, and I know that every member of this body \nagrees with me on this point.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it is important to note the context in which \nwe are considering this conference report, and the implications it has \nfor another important piece of legislation the Senate has already \npassed--the supplemental funding for the U.S. contribution to the \nInternational Monetary Fund.\n  Last month, the Senate approved these funds overwhelmingly. The vote \nwas 84-16. The size of that margin indicates the importance Senators \nattach to an adequately-funded IMF. Unfortunately, a small but vocal \nminority of members in the other body have expressed reluctance to vote \non the IMF funding unless we give into their demands on the Mexico City \nissue.\n  They are, in effect, holding hostage an important bill with \nsignificant national security implications, a bill that has broad, \nbipartisan support in the Senate, in order to force their way on a \ncompletely unrelated issue. The IMF appropriation is an insurance \npolicy for the world economy and for countless American exporting \nbusinesses and farmers whose livelihoods depend on strong markets in \nAsia, Latin America, and other regions of the world. It is \ninappropriate and dangerous to link passage of IMF with the Mexico City \nrestrictions. The longer we delay passage of the IMF funds, the more we \nexpose our businesses, workers, and farmers to the risks and \nuncertainties of world financial markets.\n  For all of these reasons, Mr. President, the Mexico City provision \ndoes not belong in either the State Department authorization bill, or \nthe IMF supplemental. If the other body wishes to implement the Mexico \nCity restrictions, it should debate those restrictions in the context \nin which they belong--in a comprehensive foreign aid\n\n[[Page S3684]]\n\nauthorization bill. They should not hold hostage every high-priority \npiece of foreign policy legislation moving through the Congress.\n  It is imperative that the Senate defeat this conference report to \ndemonstrate that we will not support such efforts at linkage either in \nthis instance or in the future. I urge my colleagues to vote against \nthe conference agreement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to emphasize the value of our \nnation's international family planning program. I share the outrage \nexpressed by my colleagues that the United States Congress would even \nconsider the un-democratic and un-American provisions contained in the \nForeign Affairs Reform Act. What Congress should really be focusing on \nas we debate the role of international family planning is the impact of \nthese scarce federal funds on the lives of women and families \nthroughout the world.\n  Currently at least one woman dies every minute from causes related to \npregnancy and childbirth. In developing countries, maternal mortality \nis the leading cause of death for women in reproductive age. The World \nBank estimates that improved access to family planning would reduce \nmaternal death by 20 percent. In the United States, there are 12 \nmaternal deaths for every 100,000 live births; in parts of Sub-Saharan \nAfrica, this ratio is more than 1,500 maternal deaths for every 100,000 \nlive births. That's over 100 times greater than in the United States.\n  By being able to plan their pregnancies, mothers are able to ensure \nthey bear their children at their healthiest times and that pregnancies \ndo not occur too close together. This reduces the risks to the lives of \nboth the mother and her children. Data from developing countries shows \nthat babies born less than 2 years after their next oldest sibling are \ntwice as likely to die in the first year as those born after an \ninterval of at least 2 years. Further analysis suggests that, on \naverage, infant mortality would be reduced by 25 percent if all births \nwere spaced at least 2 years apart.\n  Reduced maternal and infant mortality are just two of the benefits of \nfamily planning programs. Family planning education also helps prevent \nthe spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. Family \nplanning can also reduce the number of abortions. A U.S. study found \nthat for every $1 increase in public funds for family planning, there \nis a decrease of 1 abortion per 1,000 women. According to the \nRockefeller Foundation, in just 1 year, cuts and severe restrictions of \nfederal funding for family planning programs will result in an \nadditional 4 million unplanned pregnancies, and 1.6 million of those \npregnancies will end in abortion. These are only conservative \nestimates.\n  U.S. family planning funds are having a profound, positive impact on \nfamilies throughout the world. Mothers and children are healthier; more \nwomen are using contraception; fewer women are having abortions. Let me \nshare just a few examples of the positive role family planning has \nplayed in Latin America. In 1960 in Chile, less than 3 percent of \nmarried women were practicing family planning, and the abortion rate \nwas 77 abortions per 1,000 married women of reproductive age. By 1990, \n56 percent of married women were using family planning, and the \nabortion rate had dropped to 45 per 1,000. Data from Bogota, Columbia \nshowed that contraceptive use doubled between 1976 and 1990, \naccompanied by a 40 percent decrease in the abortion rate during the \nsame period. In Mexico City, use of contraception increased by about 24 \npercent between 1987 and 1992, and the abortion rate fell 39 percent.\n  Similar successes can be found in examples from former Soviet Bloc \nnations. In Almaty, Kazakhstan, the United States population program \nhas provided funding to train doctors and nurses and to increase \ncontraceptive supplies for 28 clinics. Between 1993 and 1994, the \nnumber of people receiving contraceptives from the clinics increased by \n59 percent, and the number of abortions fell by 41 percent. In Russia, \ncontraceptive use has increased from 19 to 24 percent after an \naffiliate of the International Planned Parenthood Federation opened in \n1991. The abortion rate dropped from 109 per 1,000 pregnancies in 1990 \nto 76 in 1994. The total number of abortions fell from 3.6 million in \n1990 to 2.8 million in 1994. In Hungary, abortion rates dropped \ndramatically from the late 1960's to the mid-1980's, largely due to the \nsignificant increase in contraceptive use.\n  The numbers are incredible, but what is truly important and who we \ncan't forget are the women and their families represented in these \nnumbers. One such woman is 30 year old Maria Elena Absalon Ramirez in \nMexico. Her husband earns just $80 per month to support Maria and their \nfour children. They cannot afford contraceptives and rely on USAID-\nfunded family planning. These are Maria's words: ``What I fear most is \nbecoming pregnant again.''\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize the valuable impact of family \nplanning on the lives of millions of families throughout the world, and \nto oppose restrictions on the use of international family planning \nfunds.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I want to comment on one aspect of the \nconference report before us today, the provisions relating to the \nconsolidation of USIA into the State Department. Although the President \nhas already signaled his intention to veto this bill should it pass, I \nwould like to highlight a concern I share with others which was \naddressed to some degree in the conference report: the need to protect \nthe integrity of U.S. public diplomacy.\n  There have been some indications that when the State Department \nincorporates the functions of USIA into its organization, there are \nsome State Department officials who are interested in using the \nresources associated with USIA programs to boost the public affairs \nfunctions of the State Department. I would like to go on record in \nopposition to any shifting of resources or even worse merging of these \ntwo very distinct functions of public affairs and public diplomacy.\n  To give some background on this issue, since 1948 when U.S. \ngovernment information programs were first authorized under section 501 \nof the Smith/Mundt Act, it has been understood that public diplomacy \nprograms were directed to foreign audiences. As Under Secretary of \nState Philip Habib said in 1986:\n\n       There is a distinction between public diplomacy and public \n     affairs. The word diplomacy means ``outside'' and has nothing \n     to do with what you are trying to do with the American \n     people, which is altogether different. Gaining the support of \n     the American people for U.S. foreign policy initiatives is \n     entirely different from attempting to pursue the interests of \n     the United States in the foreign arena.\n\n  Over the years, Congress and the courts have upheld and strengthened \nthe distinction between public diplomacy, which is directed abroad, and \npublic affairs, which is directed toward a U.S. audience. As USIA and \nits functions are folded into the State Department--and I do not \nnecessarily oppose this and other cost savings moves--we must continue \nto uphold the distinction between these two functions. I support the \nneed to provide a clear articulation of U.S. foreign policy to \nAmericans, especially as the world and U.S. international interests \nhave become increasingly complex. However, the State Department should \nnot anticipate a windfall in resources for its public affairs function.\n  Public diplomacy, the presentation and advocacy of information about \nthe United States, not just the advocacy of a particular foreign policy \nposition, has been best presented independently and objectively without \nconsideration of how that message would play at home. Educating the \nrest of the world about American society should not be hindered by the \nequally important but distinct function of explaining U.S. foreign \npolicy to the American people.\n  Edward R. Murrow said it best almost 40 years ago:\n\n       What we endeavor to reflect . . . is not only our policy, \n     but our ideals. We not only seek to show people who we are \n     and how we live: we must also engage others in the delicate, \n     difficult art of human persuasion, to explain why we do what \n     we do.\n\n  Mr. President, as we consider legislation to consolidate USIA into \nthe State Department, whether it be in this session or in future \nsessions of Congress, I urge my colleagues to keep this important \ndistinction in mind.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the conference \nreport to H.R. 1757, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act.\n  My opposition is tinged with a measure of regret, for this bill \ncontains\n\n[[Page S3685]]\n\nmany provisions that I have worked on, first as Ranking member on the \nHouse International Operations Subcommittee for ten years and for two \nyears as Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on \nInternational Operations. This bill consolidates our foreign policy \napparatus by merging the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the \nUnited States Information Agency into the State Department--which will \nmake our foreign policy machinery run more efficiently.\n  With regard to arrearages owed to the United Nations, I supported the \nprovisions of this bill--which are similar to provisions in my own UN \nReform bill--which linked payment of funds owed by the United States to \nthe United Nations implementing certain benchmark reforms including a \nreduction in the dues charged to the United States for the United \nNations regular budget as well as our share of peacekeeping \nassessments.\n  I have worked on six State Department authorization bills during my \ntime in the Congress and know how difficult a process it is to assemble \na consensus on the reorganization of the State Department. I was \nextremely pleased that this bill built upon the foundation the Foreign \nRelations Committee laid in the last Congress when I was Chair of the \nInternational Operations Subcommittee, I worked with Senator Helms on \nthese most important foreign policy issues. The work done by Senators \nHelms and Biden on these matters is to be commended.\n  However, this bill also contains a provision that would reinstate the \nMexico City Policy in a way that imposes unacceptable restrictions in \ninternational family planning efforts. And for that reason I cannot \nsupport it.\n  Mr. President, this issue is often referred to as the ``Mexico City \npolicy'' issue because it was at the 1984 United Nations Population \nConference in Mexico City that the Reagan Administration adopted for \nour international family planning programs a precursor of what became \nknown as the ``gag rule'' for our own domestic family planning \nprograms. Under the Mexico City policy, the Reagan Administration \nwithheld international family planning funds from all groups that had \neven the slightest involvement in legal abortion-related services using \ntheir own private funds.\n  Before I address what I believe to be the most troubling aspects of \nthe current version of the ``Mexico City policy,'' let me first \nemphasize that no United States taxpayer funds are being used to pay \nfor abortions overseas. Since 1973 an amendment, authored by the \nChairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, prohibits the use of \nUnited States funds for abortion services. That needs to be made clear \nin discussing United States funding for international family planning \nefforts.\n  However, the current version of the so-called ``Mexico City policy'' \ncontained in this bill is most troubling. Foreign nongovernmental \norganizations would still be barred from receiving family planning \nassistance if they, with their own funds, perform legal abortions. \nWhile the President can waive the ban on the performance of abortions, \nhe is prohibited from using waiver authority granted him under section \n614 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to permit these groups to \nlobby on abortion matters.\n  As Secretary of State Albright noted, this lobby ban ``is basically a \ngag rule that would punish organizations for engaging in the democratic \nprocess in foreign countries and for engaging in legal activities that \nwould be protected by the First Amendment if carried out in the United \nStates.''\n  Let me take just a moment to illustrate what the practical effect \nthis lobbying ban would have on international family planning efforts.\n  If a foreign nongovernmental organization, or NGO, were to produce a \npaper that noted that a certain percentage of all maternal deaths in a \ncertain part of the world are due to illegal abortion, it would lose \ntheir US family planning funds. The reason? This paper would be calling \nattention to ``defects'' in abortion laws.\n  If the president of an NGO were to give a radio interview and make a \n``public statement'' giving an opinion about his or her nation's own \nabortion law, that NGO would lose its US family planning funds. The \nreason? A question about abortion law was answered on the airwaves.\n  These restrictions greatly concern me and they should concern anyone \ninterested not only in the free exchange of ideas but the welfare of \ndeveloping nations.\n  Ever since the 1974 United Nations Population Conference in \nBucharest, Romania the United States has been the traditional leader in \ninternational family planning assistance. Many of the world's \ndeveloping nations at that time perceived family planning to be a \nwestern effort to reduce the power and influence of Third World \nnations. By the time of the Mexico City Conference ten years later, \nmost developing nations had come to understand the importance of \nwidely-available, voluntary family planning to their own nation's \ndevelopment potential.\n  I believe that the absence of family planning assistance may well \nlead to more, not fewer, abortions being performed. If organizations \nsuch as the International Planned Parenthood Federation would be denied \nUnited States funds, we would be unable to support some of the most \neffective and capable family planning programs in the developing world. \nThese programs are vital in preventing unplanned pregnancies, in \nreducing infant mortality and in promoting maternal and child health.\n  I am also troubled by the message that this ``gag rule'' sends to \nnations all around the world about American values that I cherish--\nfreedom of speech and participation in the political process of one's \ncountry. Under the restrictions imposed by this bill, a foreign \nnongovernmental organization would be required to remain silent on this \nissue. This restriction on public debate is unhealthy for the \ndemocratic process and is something Americans would not tolerate if \nattempts were made to impose it here at home.\n  Finally, I am troubled by the fact that these restrictions would \nplace the weight of the United States government behind efforts to tell \nNGOs what they can and can not do with their own, let me repeat that, \ntheir own, funds. These groups should not have to check in with the \nUnited States whenever they wish to issue a public statement, sponsor a \nconference, or distribute materials with their own money.\n  Mr. President, international family planning should not be held \nhostage to these restrictions. The benefits of population control are \nsubstantial. Funds invested in family planning yield savings in \nmaternal and child health care costs. Lower population growth rates \nmake it easier for developing nations to institute the types of free \nmarket reforms that offer them their best hope for long-term \nsustainable development. Lower population growth places fewer strains \non these nations political institutions which means there is less of a \nrisk to international stability and peace.\n  Lower population growth also places less of a strain on the \nenvironment. Reduced environmental trauma, improved standards of \nliving, and reduced immigration pressures benefit every single living \nperson on the planet.\n  This conference report endangers all of these potential benefits. For \nthis reason I will oppose its adoption and I urge my colleagues to do \nlikewise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allocated to the Senator from \nDelaware has expired.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. All the President has to do is pull back that flag of \nveto. All the Democrats have to do is to vote for this bill, and then \nwe can proceed to work in harmony, as we have previously, leading to a \n90-5 endorsement on this bill on the first go-round.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished assistant \nmajority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I compliment my colleague from North Carolina for his \nwork on the State Department reorganization bill. He has worked on it \nfor years. He has done good work. It will save taxpayers a lot of money \nand make the State Department more accountable and do a better job.\n  We have heard colleagues on the other side say, I will not support it \nbecause of the so-called abortion provision. The only thing in this \nbill that deals with abortion is that it basically says we don't want \nto have U.S. money used to lobby other countries to change their laws. \nWhat in the world makes\n\n[[Page S3686]]\n\npeople think that we are so right on abortion, this administration's \nphilosophy is so right on abortion, we should be lobbying other \ncountries to change their position? Some countries are pro-life. They \nhave it in their constitution; they have it in their legislature. Why \nshould U.S. tax money be used to lobby those countries to change their \nlaws? That is a serious mistake--a serious mistake.\n  I heard somebody say we haven't changed Mexico City policy. There is \nno restriction in here. These International Planned Parenthoods can use \ntheir money for abortions overseas. That is not even in this. The only \nrestriction is, anybody that received nongovernmental entity can't use \nmoney to lobby other countries to change their laws and influence other \ncountries on abortion. I don't think we should do that. We certainly \nshouldn't have U.S. tax moneys doing that.\n  I think this is a decent compromise. I urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to pass this.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Does the Senator from Delaware have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent for 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I know my friend from Oklahoma didn't \nintend to mislead, but there is already a law, the Helms amendment, \nwhich says no U.S. money can be used for that purpose --no U.S. money.\n  What the Mexico City language in this bill says is that these \nnonprofit organizations cannot use their own money, the money they \nraise, in Mexico, in Argentina, in Italy, in France, in China, they \ncan't use that money to lobby their government. No U.S. taxpayers' \ndollars are allowed under present law to be used to lobby for abortion, \nperiod, bang. That is already law. That is the Helms amendment.\n  What we are talking about is using their money raised from sources \nother than a contribution from the U.S. taxpayer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 60 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, money is fungible. We had the law of the \nland under President Reagan and President Bush for 10 years, 12 years, \na certain number of those years. No money should be used by these \norganizations if they take U.S. money to fund abortions or to lobby \ngovernments. Whether it be government money or their money, we said, \n``No; if you are going to get U.S. money, you can't go in and take \nother money and use it to pay for abortions or lobby other countries.''\n  Money is fungible, so the net result is, what we are trying to say \nis, wait, if you are going to take U.S. taxpayer dollars, don't use \nmoney and shuffle money around in accounts and lobbying other countries \nto change their laws. They are representing our Government in many \ncases. If they are getting U.S. taxpayer money and they are lobbying \nand using that money to set up family planning, and they are also \nlobbying, a lot of other countries are going to think that is the U.S. \nGovernment or would think that is taxpayer dollars. That is a mistake.\n  This is a reasonable compromise. I urge my colleagues to pass it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY.

If no one yields time, time runs equally on each \nside.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Harkin \namendment. Everyone should understand one thing. This has nothing to do \nwith the expansion of NATO. Under the resolution we are passing, we say \nwe are not going to do anything beyond what we now do to contribute to \nthe common budget of NATO, which, on average, is 25 percent.\n  There are three common budgets. My friend from Iowa comes along and \nsays: Look, we are not going to allow you to do what you were allowed \nto do now for Greece, Turkey, Germany. For example, when we passed the \nCFE agreement, we agreed we would get rid of a lot of materiel. That \nmateriel was worth the sum total of about $185 million. We gave it to \nTurkey, Portugal, Germany, et cetera.\n  Under this amendment, we would not be able to do that kind of thing \nfor any of the new countries if they come in. In addition to that, we \nwould be limited to be engaged in any foreign military sales to these \ncountries. Nothing to do with common budgets.\n  I urge you to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Iowa has 1 minute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As former U.S. Ambassador to Russia, Jack Matlock warned:\n\n       We're going to have a dilemma that we either encourage \n     them--new NATO members--to divert resources they don't have \n     or we end up fooling the American people about what it's \n     going to cost them.\n\n  That is what this amendment is about, not fooling the American \npeople.\n  My amendment does two things. It requires a full accounting of all \nU.S. contributions, all for NATO expansion by including the U.S. \ncontributions to the national governments when calculating the U.S. \nshare of enlargement costs.\n  Right now, we are limited to 25 percent for the common costs. That \ndoes not take into account the national costs. What I am saying with \nthis amendment is, sure, we will provide our fair share, but why should \nwe do more than 25 percent.\n  And please do not fall for the argument that we could not have done \nthis\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\nfor Greece and others in the past. The cold war is over. Europe is \nrich. These countries have money. We should not just stick U.S. \ntaxpayers with the total bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the \nexpansion of NATO. And how appropriate that our friends, colleagues, \nand allies from the United Kingdom have joined us on the Senate floor \njust as they have joined us in battle and just as they have joined us \nin keeping the peace, and we welcome them with affection, admiration, \nand gratitude.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has returned to \nconsideration of the ratification of NATO enlargement. I hope we will \nnow have an uninterrupted debate. NATO enlargement deserves the dignity \nof serious consideration of this matter and to take such time as the \nSenate deems necessary.\n  Mr. President, I support NATO enlargement because it will make Europe \nmore stable and America more secure. It means that the new democracies \nof Central and Eastern Europe will share the burden of European \nsecurity. It means that future generations might not have to fight and \ndie in a European theater.\n  If NATO doesn't enlarge, the Iron Curtain remains permanent and the \nunnatural division of Europe will live on longer than the Communist \nempire did in the Soviet Union. NATO will remain, as President Havel \nhas said, an alumni club for cold war victors. It will have little \nrelevance to the realities of the 21st century.\n  Mr. President, as a Polish American, I know that the Polish people \ndid not choose to live behind the Iron Curtain. They were forced there \nby the Yalta agreement and by Potsdam and because they and the Baltic \nStates and the other captive nations were sold out by the West.\n  Many Members of the U.S. Senate have stood long for the freeing of \nthe captive nations. Many of our colleagues have been strong supporters \nof Solidarity. I, as both a Congresswoman and then as a U.S. Senator, \nsupported the Solidarity movement. I was a strong supporter of the \nSolidarity movement. I was with President Ronald Reagan in a wonderful \nevening he held at the White House where he hosted the Polish \nAmbassador to the United States who had defected when Poland had \nimposed martial law on its own people, there sitting with President \nReagan and the Ambassador from Poland who chose to defect rather than \nuphold where the Polish Army had been forced to go against its own \npeople.\n  We pledged that we would make Poland free. And now Poland is free, \nbut we have to make sure that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic \nare not only free but that they are secure. That is why my support is \nfor the expansion of NATO. My support for NATO is not based on ethnic \nAmerican politics nor is it even based on the past, but it is based on \nthe future. What will the new world order look like?\n  I support NATO enlargement because it will make America and Europe \nmore stable and secure. NATO enlargement means a future in which the \nnewly independent countries will take their rightful place as a member \nof Western Europe. NATO played an important part in securing this \nfreedom. It has been the most successful alliance in history. It is an \nalliance that helped us win the cold war. It deterred war between the \nsuperpowers and helped prevent confrontation between member states.\n  But if NATO is to survive, it must adapt to the needs of a post-cold-\nwar world, or it will become irrelevant.\n  NATO has evolved since it was created in 1949. We have enlarged NATO \non three different occasions. Each new member strengthened NATO and \nincreased security in Europe. No expansion of NATO is easy. No \nexpansion of NATO is done without thought. No expansion of NATO is ever \nwithout controversy. We can only reflect what the bitter debate must \nhave been when we voted to include Germany because of their provocative \nrole in World War I and World War II.\n  Today, we are facing difficult and different threats to security. We \nhave civil wars, as in Bosnia; we have hot spots caused by ethnic and \nregional tensions, as in Kosovo; we have international crimes, drugs, \nand terrorism; and we have the spread of weapons of mass destruction. \nNATO must change in order to meet these new threats. Europe's new \ndemocracies will help us meet those challenges.\n  The countries of Central and Eastern Europe want to help us address \nthese new threats. How many times has the Senate discussed \nburdensharing in Europe--and we want others to share the burden, not \nonly in the financial cost, but of the risk to be borne in defending \ndemocracy. How often have we in the United States complained that \nEuropean countries were not willing to pay their fair share for their \nown defense?\n  Now, we have countries that are asking to share the burden. They are \nasking to pledge their troops and equipment for a common defense. They \nare asking to share the burden of peacekeeping. In fact, they are doing \nit right now in Bosnia, where thousands of troops from Poland, Hungary, \nand the Czech Republic are helping to secure the peace. Hungary has \nmade itself available, so it is our base camp to go into Bosnia. They \nhave even committed to joining us and ending Iraq's\n\n[[Page S3688]]\n\nchemical and biological weapon programs, which is more than can be said \nof some of our allies.\n\n  These countries are not asking for a handout, nor are they asking for \nour protection without their own ability to maintain their own defense. \nThey are asking to be full partners in the new Europe. By transforming \ntheir countries into free-market democracies, countries that have a \ndemocracy, a free-market economy, with civilian control of the \nmilitary, transparent military budgets, wow, these new democracies are \nready to join NATO.\n  These new democracies will contribute to America's security by making \nNATO stronger. They are adding troops and equipment. They will provide \nadditional strategic depth to NATO. They will also provide the will to \nfight for democratic values. Their history and geography make them \npassionate defenders of peace and democracy. They know what it means to \nbe occupied and oppressed by tyrants, occupied and oppressed against \ntheir own will. They will put our common values into action. They will \njoin with us in defending our national security and our values, whether \nit means peacekeeping in Europe or preventing the spread of weapons of \nmass destruction anywhere in the world.\n  Opponents of NATO enlargement have valid concerns, and I think we \nneed to discuss them. First of all, opponents of enlargement point to \ncost. They say that NATO enlargement has a cost, and they are right. \nThe new NATO members must modernize their military and make them \ncompatible with NATO systems. The new NATO members have committed to \npay this price.\n  There will also be a cost to the United States. Our funding of NATO's \ncommon budget will increase. NATO estimates that the total common \nbudget will increase $1.5 billion over 10 years. The American share of \nthat will be $400 million, or $40 million a year.\n  But what is the cost of not enlarging NATO? I believe it will be far \nhigher. What will be the cost to European security, the cost to the new \ndemocracies of Eastern Europe, the long-term cost to America? And, most \nimportant, will the benefits of NATO enlargement outweigh the costs?\n  As a member of the Senate NATO Observer Group, working on a \nbipartisan basis, I met recently with the Foreign Ministers of Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic. I asked them those very questions.\n  The Polish Foreign Minister, Bronislaw Geremek, is a hero of the \nSolidarity movement. He said that Poland would feel abandoned once \nagain by the West. He said that Poland will still pay to modernize \ntheir military. In fact, he said that the failure to include these \nthree nations in NATO will cause them to spend more on their military \nbudget. They also said they would form their own military alliance, \nwhich would be decidedly more anti-Russian than NATO. He went on to say \nthat by refusing to enlarge NATO, we would give the hardliners in \nRussia a great victory. The antidemocratic forces in Russia would feel \nvindicated and proud. We would be handing them a victory that they \ncould build on.\n  What would be the long-range costs to America of failing to prepare \nNATO for the 21st century? The cost would be instability in Europe and \nthe increased chance of being pulled into yet another European war. And \nthe cost of preventive security is always less than the cost of war.\n  I would like to discuss the benefits of enlargement, which I believe \noutweigh the costs. The strategic benefits of enlargement are most \nimportant. NATO enlargement will create a zone of peace and stability \nthat does include Eastern Europe. It will extend NATO's stabilizing \ninfluence to more of Europe and reduce the chances of aggression or \nconflict in Eastern Europe. Enlargement will bring peace and security \nto Eastern Europe, just as it did for the West.\n  There are also economic benefits. Europe is America's largest trading \npartner, with $250 billion in two-way trade each year. Our new NATO \npartners will increase trading opportunities. They are building vibrant \nfree-market economies. Poland's economy is growing at 6 percent, which \nis more rapidly than many of the others. NATO brings stability, and \nstability brings prosperity. We are creating a prosperity zone across \nEurope.\n  Mr. President, in the best tradition of the Senate, I could expand, \nbut I know my colleague from Texas is waiting to speak as well. We are \nboth involved in the supplemental. What I want to say is that the \ntreaty ratification is one of the Senate's most fundamental duties. We \nare extending our Nation's commitment to collective defense. I \ncertainly don't take this responsibility lightly. In the very best \ntradition of the Senate, we are addressing NATO enlargement as a \nnational security issue, not a political issue. NATO enlargement is \nbipartisan, and it should be. It must be fully supported by members of \nboth parties and the leadership of the Senate.\n  We have worked closely with the President and Secretary Albright. The \nSenate has been fully consulted at every step of the process, as has \nbeen required by our Constitution. Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, \nour Republican and Democratic leaders, appointed a NATO observer group, \nchaired by Senator Roth, which has engaged in all aspects of discussing \nNATO enlargement, as well as the appropriate committees. So now we have \nhad discussion at the committee level. Now it is time to debate this on \nthe Senate floor.\n\n  I am proud to support NATO enlargement. By ratifying this resolution, \nwe are marking the end of the cold war and the beginning of a new \ncentury. We are building an undivided, peaceful, and democratic Europe \nfor the new millennium. We are laying the groundwork for a new era of \npeace and stability.\n  Mr. President, a new century is coming, a new millennium is about to \nbe born, and I do not want the repugnant and despicable wars that \ncharacterized the 20th century to be carried into and repeated in the \n21st century. That is why I believe in the expansion of NATO with these \nthree countries. I look forward to a full and ample debate with my \ncolleagues, Mr. President. This is a moment that I think is a long time \nwaiting. We appreciate the leadership of President Ronald Reagan, who \nbrought the end of the cold war, and Mr. George Bush, who was willing \nto defend and fight against the weapons of mass destruction. And now, \nunder President Bill Clinton, we look forward to expanding NATO and to \nkeeping that momentum going.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I was going to make my floor \nstatement, but Senator Smith and I have an amendment and we have been \nencouraged to go ahead and put our amendment forward. I will yield to \nSenator Smith for his introduction of the Smith-Hutchison amendment \nthat deals with MIA. I yield the floor to him.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the pending Kyl amendment be temporarily set aside for the purpose \nof offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

First of all, I want to compliment \nand commend the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, for her \ncooperation and support as we worked together to craft this amendment.\n  This is a very, very important amendment, which I will get into in a \nmoment, regarding the cooperation of these new NATO nations--if they \nwere to become NATO nations--that would require their full cooperation \nwith the United States in order to obtain the fullest possible \naccounting of any military personnel missing from any of the wars, from \nWorld War II, Korea, Vietnam, to the cold war.\n  This amendment is supported by a number of veterans organizations--\nVietnam Veterans of America, National Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans \nCoalition, MIA Families, Korean/Cold War Family Association, National \nLeague of POW/MIA families.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a brief statement in \nsupport of this amendment by each of those organizations be printed in \nthe Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Vietnam Veterans of America,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 13, 1998.\n\n  Hold Former Soviet Bloc Nations Accountable For Pledges Made on POW/\n                                  MIAs\n\n       During the current Senate debate on the expansion of NATO, \n     Vietnam Veterans of America strongly urges the United States \n     Senate to hold the former Soviet Bloc counties of Poland, \n     Hungary, and the Czech Republic accountable for their pledges \n     of cooperation on POW/MIA archival research made to the U.S./\n     Russia Joint Commission in July 1997.\n       The Joint Commission on the POW/MIA issue was established \n     by President Bush and President Yeltsin in 1992. One of its \n     goals was to research the military, intelligence, security, \n     and communist party archives for relevant information on the \n     disposition of American POWs from the Vietnam War. The \n     Eastern Bloc countries actively supported and were allies of \n     the communist government of North Vietnam during this \n     conflict.\n       The former Soviet Bloc countries had a significant presence \n     in Asia and were aware of communist POW policy. Membership in \n     NATO guarantees an American military presence. Before \n     considering expansion of NATO to include these Soviet Bloc \n     countries, they must grant access to their archives and \n     provide relevant information on American POW/MIA's from the \n     Vietnam War. Vietnam Veterans of America strongly urges the \n     United States Senate, in their current debate, to focus on \n     the unsatisfactory follow up actions by these countries, and \n     to delay the expansion of NATO to include the Soviet Bloc \n     countries until they have fulfilled their previous \n     commitments.\n       Vietnam Veterans of America is the nation's only \n     congressionally chartered veterans service organization \n     dedicated solely to the needs of Vietnam-era veterans and \n     their families. VVA's founding principle is ``Never again \n     will one generation of veterans abandon another.''\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Vietnam & Gulf\n\n\n                                       War Veterans Coalition,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 1998.\n     Hon.

One of those goals is for full POW MIA \n     accountability.\n       The primary argument in favor of NATO expansion into \n     Eastern Europe has been said to be a means of encouraging \n     enforcing Western, democratic norms on these former Communist \n     countries. Under the circumstances, we do not find it at all \n     unreasonable to also require the emptying of the closets \n     containing defunct Communist secrets concerning the \n     disappearance of many of our servicemen, apparently alive and \n     in captivity at some point, from hot and cold wars fought \n     during half a century.\n       We therefore endorse your rider, requiring the President to \n     certify full co-operation by the NATO membership applicants \n     on the POW-MIA issue that continues to haunt us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             J.

Bob Smith,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: The lack of full and open cooperation \n     by the governments of Vietnam and Russia to help account as \n     fully as possible for Americans still missing from the \n     Vietnam War has prompted our support for your efforts to seek \n     such cooperation from the governments of Poland, Hungary and \n     the Czech Republic.\n       We recognize that the initiatives of the U.S.-Russian \n     Commission on POW/MIA offer promise to POW/MIA families who \n     have long awaited answers. Although less promising than \n     through the leadership serving in Hanoi, Moscow and \n     Pyongyang, there is increasing evidence that the countries \n     who were a part of the former USSR have relevant knowledge \n     about Americans still missing and unaccounted for from our \n     nation's past military conflicts.\n       For this reason, the League expresses our gratitude to you \n     and your colleagues who recognize the need to seek full \n     cooperation from the governments of Poland, Hungary and the \n     Czech Republic.\n           Respectfully,\n                                              Ann Mills Griffiths,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                National Alliance of Families,\n\n                                     Bellevue, WA, March 16, 1998.\n     Re: NATO--A Resolution for Our POWs.\n     Hon. Jesse A. Helms,\n     Chairman, Foreign Relations Committee, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Helms: Within days, the Senate will vote to \n     extend NATO membership to Poland, Hungry and the Czech \n     Republic. The membership of the National Alliance of Families \n     asks that during debate on this subject, a resolution is \n     introduced requiring the United States to formally request \n     that these nations release all archival information the above \n     Countries hold on American Prisoners of War from the Korean \n     War, The Cold War and the War in Southeast Asia.\n       During the Hearings before the House Subcommittee on \n     Military Personnel, evidence was presented clearly showing \n     Czech involvement with American and United Nation POWs during \n     the Korean War. Evidence presented by the former Czech \n     General, Jan Sejna, indicated POWs from the Vietnam War were \n     transported to Czechoslovakia.\n       We do not wish to punish the present democratic nations of \n     the former Eastern Bloc. However, we do not want to let a \n     golden opportunity slip through our fingers. Each former \n     Eastern block nation seeking NATO membership must be asked a \n     series of specific questions relating to that Country's \n     knowledge of American POWs. This mandate for questioning can \n     only be achieved by a formal Senate Resolution.\n       Each former Eastern Bloc country should be asked to:\n       1. Search their records for the location of any Americans \n     or former American citizens living in their country. Making \n     said survivors available to U.S. investigators;\n       2. Open their archives, making all documents relating to \n     American POWs or survivors. This should include all records \n     of interrogations and medical experimentation; and\n       3. All records and documentation of the Country's \n     involvement with American POWs on foreign soil.\n       These requests should be made with the understanding that \n     no nation will be condemned or punished for involvement with \n     American POWs or survivors.\n       Any nation coming forward with ``live'' American POWs \n     (survivors) or information relating to POWs (or survivors) \n     will be commended for their spirit of cooperation in this \n     ``new age'' of democracy.\n       The Countries that once formed the Soviet Eastern Bloc, \n     holds a wealth of information on American POWs. A resolution \n     by the United States Senate, formally requesting this \n     information assuring no reprisals or condemnation should \n     encourage the cooperation of these new Democracies.\n       Senator, please do not let this golden opportunity to gain \n     information about our POWs slip through our fingers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Dolores Apodaca Alfond,\n     National Chairperson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Korean/Cold War Family\n\n\n                                   Association of the Missing,\n\n                                      Coppell, TX, April 27, 1998.\n     Re expansion of NATO.\n\n     Senator Robert Smith.\n       Dear Senator Smith: The proposed expansion of NATO to \n     include the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary presents a \n     unique opportunity to gain information about the fate of the \n     more than 10,000 American men who remain missing from the \n     Korean, Vietnam, and Cold Wars. Although the governments \n     involved might express the best of intentions at this stage \n     of the admission process, experience tells us that promises \n     made to gain\n\n[[Page S3690]]\n\n     advantage are often broken when the incentive no longer \n     exists. The window of opportunity to ensure significant \n     cooperation is open to us during the admission process, and \n     will be lost if not seized at this time.\n       As you know, the United States has considerable \n     intelligence and other information that delineates a Soviet \n     program during the Korean, Vietnam and Cold Wars to exploit \n     American POWs. The governments of the former East Bloc \n     countries most certainly had information about this covert \n     program, and some intelligence suggests they participated in \n     the effort to some extent.\n       The United States would be remiss if we did not set forth a \n     clear expectation of full and good faith cooperation on the \n     POW/MIA issue in the proposed NATO Treaties, as a condition \n     of membership. The nexus between a military alliance and the \n     POW/MIA Full Accounting is both clear and appropriate. As an \n     integral part of their membership in NATO, the three \n     countries under consideration at this time, and all former \n     East Bloc countries that might be considered in the future, \n     should come forward with whatever information they might have \n     about missing American servicemen.\n       Cooperation on this important issue should go without \n     saying for these countries. If we fail to require a \n     demonstrable level of meaningful cooperation, these countries \n     will be justified in presuming that the United States \n     Government really does not want to know what happened to our \n     missing servicemen. Surely, the Senate does not want to send \n     such an unacceptable message to these countries, to the \n     families of our missing men, nor to the American People.\n       We thank you for your ongoing support for our efforts to \n     account for American POW/MIAs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Donna D. Knox.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I also thank Congressman \nSam Johnson, who, as many of my colleagues know, was a POW, along with \nSenator McCain, and others, during the Vietnam war. Congressman Johnson \nand I have traveled to Prague, Warsaw, and to Moscow together in search \nof answers, along with former Ambassador Malcolm Toon, as part of the \nU.S.-Russia commission to seek answers on our missing.\n  There is a great window of opportunity here in the old eastern bloc \ncountries as well as Russia to get some answers as to what may have \nhappened to these Americans. I think as we went out and searched the \ncountryside and met in the capitals of these countries, we received \nsome cooperation. I want to make that very clear. But, Mr. President, \nthere is much more to be done. There are clearly answers in these \narchives. I think it is very important that, if we are going to say \nthat our military--our men and women in uniform--is going to be asked \nat some point, if NATO expansion occurs, to shed their blood, possibly, \nor defend these countries, I think it behooves these countries to \nprovide us the fullest possible accounting of any service personnel who \nmay have crossed their borders during the time the Communists held, \nbasically, and controlled these countries.\n  I wish that I could say that all follow-up action to our trip had \noccurred properly and that we had every satisfactory answer that we \nwanted, but that is not true. It is disturbing because of the reasons \nthat I gave. At some point in the future, by having these countries \npart of NATO, we are going to ask Americans to face possible combat \nsituations to defend these countries. So the least they could do is to \nprovide us answers that they may have now of things that occurred \nduring Communist control. It has been said by some NATO advocates that \nwe have an opportunity to ensure the cold war never resurfaces. Yet we \nstill can't seem to get the cooperation we need from this region to \naddress vital questions about our missing Americans, especially from \nthe cold war but also possibly from Korea and Vietnam. If their pledges \nwere genuine, as I believe they were, then, frankly, I question why \nleaders of these countries can't convince the old cold war \nbureaucracies to allow us access to the archives and allow us access to \nindividuals who could provide us answers.\n  We have had some cooperation. I am very grateful for that \ncooperation. We met with some very influential people in the \ngovernments of those three countries when I traveled there last summer. \nSince last summer there have been follow-up communications by our \ncommission support staff at the Department of Defense and also by my \nown office with each of these nations urging them to follow through. \nBut most important is the fact that, based on current leads available, \nour commission really still believes that there is relevant \ninformation, very relevant information, which likely exists in Eastern \nEurope, especially in the military intelligence security Communist \nParty archives of these three nations in question.\n  Again, this is a very complex situation that has developed. The \nCommunist Party controlled these archives, controlled all of the \ngovernment activities, controlled the activities of intelligence and \nmilitary and security. Now we have a different government, a friendly \ngovernment. But the access to those archives has not yet been provided \nto us. If they are friendly and we are going to bring them into NATO \nand defend them, then they owe us that information, pure and simple. \nThey owe us that information. They owe us every opportunity to get and \nfind that information wherever it may be. I regret to say we really \nhave not had that kind of cooperation, even though we have had some \nvery interesting meetings.\n  Let me just conclude on this point. We should remember and not forget \nthat these eastern bloc countries, when they were eastern bloc \ncountries, were allies of the North Koreans, were allies of the North \nVietnamese, and the Soviets, of course, during the cold war. They had a \nsignificant presence in both North Korea and in Vietnam. They were \nprivy to information about Communist policies toward our own American \nPOWs. That is very important. I want to repeat that. They were privy to \na lot of information about our POWs in Vietnam, our POWs in Korea, and \nindeed some of the missing cold war losses. This information has not \nyet been shared with us.\n  It is very important that we delve into this and find out whether any \nAmerican POWs were transferred, either stopping there permanently or \ntransferred through any of the capitals of these countries. I want to \nemphasize again, this is not meant to be a hostile statement. We met \nwith those governments, and they were very cordial and very cooperative \nbut somewhat standoffish by basically passing the buck by saying, Well, \nyou know those were the Communist days, and I am not sure we can dig \nthat out.\n\n  Again, if we are asking Americans to shed their blood in the future \nto defend free nations, then asking them to dig into their archives a \nlittle bit is not asking too much.\n  I want to emphasize again and appeal to leaders of the Czech \nRepublic, Poland, and Hungary to follow through on commitments that \nwere made during our visits and help us to search for American missing \nservice personnel from the cold war, from Korea, and from Vietnam and \nurge my colleagues on behalf of the veterans organizations that I have \nmentioned, on behalf of all veterans throughout America and the \nfamilies, most especially the families of those who are missing, to \nplease join with me in continuing to push for more progress on this \nhumanitarian issue. We can do that and, I think, make a very strong \nstatement here on the floor by voting for this amendment.\n  At this point I yield the floor for the purpose of allowing my \ncolleague, Senator Hutchison, who has been a stalwart on this issue to \nspeak. I am very grateful to her for her support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Smith for leading the \neffort on this amendment.\n  I want to tell you a story about how this came to be an amendment to \nthis bill.\n  Pat Dunton is my constituent. She is the president of the Korean-Cold \nWar Family Association of the Missing. Pat Dunton's father served in \nthe Korean conflict. She has been trying to get information about her \nfather for all of these years since the Korean war. She still gets \nchoked up talking about not knowing where he is or what happened to \nhim. She came to my office one day and we started talking about how \nhard it is not to know. We started thinking. Well, you know, maybe we \ncould do something with the new members who have been invited into NATO \nbecause during the cold war, which is when some of the MIA incidents \ntook place, maybe the governments of these countries who were allies \nwith the Soviet\n\n[[Page S3691]]\n\nUnion, some of whom were in Korea, might be helpful in going to these \nfamilies and providing the information that they might have knowledge \nof. I just believe that this is something that should be done. I also \nbelieve that all three of the countries being considered for NATO \nmembership would like to help in this effort.\n  I went to Senator Smith, who has been the leading advocate in the \nSenate for not forgetting our POWs and MIAs. I said, Let's do something \nin the NATO agreement that would require any information to be opened \nto the families of POWs from any conflict. But most especially, of \ncourse, Korea is where we think these countries really might have some \ninformation that could be relevant.\n  I am pleased that Senator Smith decided to take the lead and work \nwith me on this because I think it can make a difference. It calls for \nthe full cooperation of the Governments of Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic in obtaining that accounting, and specifically calls for \nfacilitating access to relevant archival material and for these \nGovernments to identify any individuals that may possess knowledge \nrelative to captured and missing U.S. personnel.\n  Mr. President, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have all \nthrown off the chains of Communist domination. But not so long ago and \nthroughout the cold war their military forces and their intelligence \nservices were closely aligned with the very governments who hold the \nkeys to a great deal of information which may help achieve the full \naccounting we seek. For example, from the end of the Korean war in \n1953, representatives of the Czech and Polish military were stationed \ninside North Korea as part of the Neutral Nations Supervisory \nCommission at Panmunjom. Their military personnel had direct contact \nwith the North Korean military and had at times a great deal of high-\nlevel access throughout North Korea. They met with their North Korean \ncounterparts and may well have highly relevant information on the fate \nof Americans who were missing during the Korean war.\n  We also know that their intelligence services and their military \noften shared information with the intelligence services and military \nforces of the Soviet Union and that there are those who may have direct \nknowledge of events involving Americans who were missing during the \nVietnam war as well as the numerous Americans who disappeared during \nmilitary operations in other areas during the cold war.\n  As new NATO allies, it is certainly reasonable to expect that they \nwould open their archives and provide access to our officials. I have \nalready received assurances from representatives of the Polish \nGovernment that this access would be readily granted, and I am certain \nthat the Czechs and the Hungarians would also be eager to work with us.\n  I have also been contacted by family members of the missing as well \nas by military personnel working in the area of POW-MIA recovery, and \nboth groups have insisted that it would be helpful to make an official \nstatement on behalf of Congress in the form of this amendment that this \nis an issue of national importance.\n  I think the amendment is necessary and important. It sends a message \nto the long-suffering families often forgotten that are still seeking \ninformation about the fate of their loved ones. We must take every \nopportunity to demonstrate that we understand their grief and their \ndesire to find answers and that it is reasonable to expect any new \nallies to also respect our legitimate desire to learn all we can about \nthose who are missing in the service of our country. The armed forces \nand the intelligence services of these same countries that seek to join \nNATO today were once on the other side of the bitter struggle of the \ncold war. So they would have information, and we hope that they would \nagree readily to help us in giving some comfort and perhaps providing \nanswers, that final answer, to some member of a family who has been \nwaiting maybe not patiently but certainly with hope in their hearts \nthat someday they would know what happened to their father or their son \nwho has served in our military and perhaps gave his or her life in \nservice to our country. I think we owe them this amount of caring, this \namount of assurance that we will go the extra mile to make sure they \nhave that closure if it can possibly be given to them.\n\n  So I thank Senator Smith. I hope the Senate will adopt this amendment \nwhen we have the vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. Smith of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I say to my colleagues, just 1 or 2 \nminutes. I wish to expound a little bit on what the Senator from Texas, \nMrs. Hutchison, just said in terms of the impact on families.\n  In the 1950s, there was a Captain Dunham who was shot down over \nSoviet territory--then Soviet territory--and as a result of the U.S.-\nRussian commission, of which Senator John Kerry and I are members, we \nran an ad in the Red Star newspaper in Russia that went all over; it \nwas read heavily by former military people, veterans of the Soviet \nUnion. And an individual read the article about this Captain Dunham who \nwas missing. It turned out that this individual had been at the crash \nsite and provided us the ring of Captain Dunham, his personal ring, \nwhich came back to his family, and as a result of following that up, we \nwere able to find Captain Dunham's remains, missing since the 1950s, \nand returned just 2 or 3 years ago.\n  So I think this is a good example of what cooperation can really \nproduce. Sometimes what might seem like a small, insignificant fact \nturns into a huge issue and a great relief to the family of a missing \nserviceman or woman. So this is very important, and I want to emphasize \nagain that what this amendment does is very simple, Mr. President.\n\n  Let me just mention three things. It would require that prior to the \ndeposit of the U.S. instrument of ratification, the President shall \ncertify to Congress that each of the Governments--Poland, Hungary, and \nthe Czech Republic--is fully cooperating with the U.S. in order to \nobtain the fullest possible accounting of any military personnel from \nthe cold war, from Vietnam, or any military conflicts; that they \nfacilitate full access to all relevant archival material; and that they \nwould identify any individuals who may possess knowledge relative to \nthe capture of missing personnel. That is it. That is all the amendment \ndoes.\n  I thank my colleagues, especially Senator Hagel, who has been \nwaiting. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I will be very brief. Speaking for myself and my side and \nI think Senator Smith of Oregon, who will say the same thing, we are \nprepared to accept the amendment.\n  Let me just make a few very brief comments. I think that the \napplicants for NATO accession have provided cooperation, as was \nindicated in the U.S. efforts to locate American POWs and MIAs in the \ncold war.\n  In July of 1987, the U.S.-Russian Joint Commission on POW/MIAs \nvisited Poland; the Department of Defense Prisoner of War/Missing \nPersonnel Office visited in December of 1997. Resulting from these \nvisits, senior Polish officials pledged to search their archives \nthoroughly and open all relevant information to the United States. U.S. \nofficials met with the Polish National Security Bureau, the Ministry of \nDefense, the Ministry of Intelligence Services, the Office of Central \nSecurity, Central Archives. All, in the minds at the Pentagon, are \nfully cooperating. I can say the same relative to the Czech Republic \nand with regard to Hungary.\n  So although I, quite frankly, do not think it is necessary, I have no \nobjection to the amendment. And let me say to my friend from New \nHampshire, all you have to be is the brother, sister, mother, father, \nson, daughter, nephew, or niece of an MIA to understand everything the \nSenator says.\n  My mother lost her closest brother in World War II, shot down in New \nGuinea. They never found his body. To this day, my mother--and that was \n1944--wakes up after dreaming that he has been found. To this day, he \nis a constant--``constant'' would be an exaggeration--he is a regular \nsource of\n\n[[Page S3692]]\n\npainful memories for my mother. The idea that there is no closure, the \nidea that there has never been the ability to say his name was Ambrose \nJ. Finnegan, God love him--his nickname was Bozy to everybody in my \nmom's family. My mother, when I was a kid, literally would wake up at \nnight screaming from a nightmare. She would scare the hell out of us, \ndreaming that her brother was in the most extreme circumstance.\n  I do not mean in any way to suggest this is not important by saying \nwe will accept it and that I do not think it is necessary, because it \nis being done, because it is true, the pain lasts. My mother just \nturned 80 years old. It is like yesterday for my mother.\n  So I appreciate what my friend from Texas and my colleague from New \nHampshire are doing. Again, I do not think it is necessary, because I \nanticipate they will fully cooperate. But I see no problem in accepting \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I would like to associate myself with the words \nof the Senator from Delaware and just tell my colleagues, the advocates \nof this amendment, I support it. I believe the Poles, Hungarians, and \nCzechs would support it, too. These are nations that know something \nabout prisoners of war and missing in action, gulags, and all the \nhorrors that go with totalitarianism, and I fully expect that they \nwould want us to accede to this.\n  I appreciate the Senators offering this amendment. I think it helps. \nAnd part of the reason to expand NATO is to heal these countries. Part \nof the healing comes from addressing issues like this. We will find \nthey will do this with us and without any resistance to it.\n  I thank the Senators who are offering this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. If I could just respond to the Senator \nfrom Delaware for a moment, I listened to his story about the personal \nepisode in his family. I might say, we have found in the last 4 or 5 \nyears, aircraft--I am almost certain that we located an aircraft in New \nGuinea and other areas where aircraft had been lost during World War \nII. I think it says a lot about our own Nation that we would still send \nteams out there in those jungles, searching for people who were lost. \nMaybe at some point, maybe--I know it was your relative, I did not \nhear, what relative?\n  Mr. BIDEN. My uncle. My mother was one of five children. It was her \nbrother and her soul mate. It is amazing how, like I said, she is 80 \nyears old, God love her, and it is still there.\n  The only reason I bothered to mention it--I never mentioned it before \non the floor in all the debates we had about POWs and MIAs. I \ncompliment my colleagues in their diligence to continue to pursue \naccounting for POWs and MIAs, and I didn't want them to think that, \nbecause I slightly disagree with their assertion of what these three \ncountries have done--I agree with my friend from Oregon. I think they \nare clearly interested in helping. If there are any countries that are \nfully aware, as my friend from Oregon said, it is the Hungarians and \nthe Czechs and the Poles, who have had people dragged off to those \ngulags, never to be heard from again.\n  These democratically elected officials, now--I would be dumbfounded \nif they did not fully cooperate. But I understand the motivation. That \nis my point, to my two colleagues. I am happy, from our side, to accept \nthe amendment, as well as my friend has indicated he is willing to \naccept it.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I appreciate my colleague's willingness \nto accept it. It seems to be the consensus of those of us who are \nsponsoring it, we seek a recorded vote on it because of the \nsignificance of the issue.\n  With that in mind, I will ask for a recorded vote at the appropriate \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Obviously that is the Senator's right. I do not challenge \nit. I just am reminded, I remember one time when I first got here--and \nI know he has been here a long time. I went up to Russell Long, the \nChairman of the Finance Committee, and indicated to him I wanted help \non an amendment to a Finance Committee bill. Senator Long, the senior \nSenator and Chairman of the Finance Committee, said, ``Fine.'' He \naccepted it.\n  Then I thought later it would be good to have a recorded vote. I \nstood up and said, ``I have decided I want a recorded vote.'' He said, \n``In that case, I am against it.'' We had the recorded vote and he beat \nme. So I learned, from my perspective anyway, that when someone accepts \nan amendment, I am always happy to do it.\n  But I understand the Senator's motivation. I will not change my \nposition, but maybe he would reconsider whether we need the vote. But \nthat is his judgment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I had great confidence that you would not \ndo that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to support the \nratification of NATO expansion. I have had the good fortune, over \nalmost the last year and a half that I have been in the U.S. Senate, to \nserve on the Committee on Foreign Relations. That has given me a unique \nopportunity to examine the NATO expansion protocol. I attended, start \nto finish, each of the eight full hearings we had in the Foreign \nRelations Committee on this issue. I also was appointed by the Senate \nMajority Leader to serve on the NATO Observer Group Task Force. I \nattended almost all of the 17 meetings that our distinguished \ncolleagues from Delaware, Senator Biden and Senator Roth, held. That \ndoes not give me a particularly unique perspective on this issue, but \nit gives me some grounding on understanding the complications of NATO \nexpansion.\n\n  As I have listened to the debate the last 2 days, and in previous \nweeks when this Chamber debated this issue, and during committee \nhearings, I have come to the conclusion that, yes, a number of the \nquestions and points raised by my colleagues are not only relevant but \nare important and they should be fully aired and fully debated. It is \nbased on those observations that I have made, as I have listened to \nthis debate, that I wish to offer some of the following points.\n  Aside from the obvious defense purpose of the expansion of NATO, \nthere are other issues involved. The obvious defense purpose of \nexpanding NATO is to help assure stability and security in Europe, all \nof Europe. There has been some debate on the floor about this issue, \nthis fourth expansion--and, by the way, a not unprecedented expansion. \nWe have expanded NATO three other times, to include West Germany, \nGreece, Turkey, and the third expansion was Spain and Portugal. So this \nwould be not an unprecedented action we take, that we include three new \ncountries. But I find interesting that there has been some reference \nmade to ``we would split Europe.'' I say just the opposite, just the \nopposite. We would, in fact, do much to unify Europe. Why would that \nbe? That would be because stability, security, economic development, \ndevelopment of democracy and market economies, would extend across the \ncontinent of Europe and no longer would there be the Iron Curtain that \nfell at the end of World War II. NATO expansion would help assure that.\n  I also find the argument interesting from the perspective of--I \nthought, when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, that meant something. It \nwas beyond symbolism. It was a witness to history that authoritarian, \ntotalitarian government does not work, under any name--Nazism, \ncommunism, it doesn't work.\n  Here we are, almost 10 years after the fall of communism, with the \nBerlin Wall, talking about, ``Well, I don't know, should we do this? We \nmight offend our Russian friends.'' Certainly any important decision \nmust factor in every dynamic in the debate and every dynamic of our \nnational security interest--relationships, future relationships, and in \nthis case it certainly does factor in our relationship with Russia. \nBut, my goodness, why did we fight, for 40 years, a cold war? And we \nwon it. Only 10 years later, to some extent, to be held hostage to what \nthe Russians want?\n\n[[Page S3693]]\n\n  You see, I don't see an awful lot of sense in that. Yes, it is \nimportant to understand the Russians. Yes, it is important to engage \nthe Russians. But not allow Russia, or any other nation to dominate the \nfinal analysis and decisions of our Nation's security interests, nor \nall of the collective security interests of Europe.\n  There is another consequence of this that has not yet been fully \ndeveloped and that is we would be helping provide role models for \nCentral and Eastern Europe by these three new nations, Poland, Hungary, \nand the Czech Republic, coming into NATO, complying with--not as a \nhandout, not as a gesture, but complying with all of the requirements \nestablished 50 years ago to belong to NATO. We just didn't invent \nthese. They didn't just ``happen.'' They are the same requirements for \nPoland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary as we had for the previous three \nexpansions of NATO.\n  Other nations of Central and Eastern Europe can look to these three \nnations as role models, for help, and not just in the national security \ndynamic. Let's face it, I have heard, also, a lot of talk about the \nEuropean Union--why not allow these nations to be brought into the \nEuropean Union first? Mr. President, you cannot separate economics \nhere. You can't separate economic stability from military \nstability. They are integrally entwined.\n\n  There is no question the world is a global community underpinned by a \nglobal economy. Of course--of course--these nations will benefit \neconomically. And that will invent and give opportunities to other \ncountries, and more opportunities as well. Now, this is not just--not \njust--a national defense issue and a security issue for the United \nStates. This is an investment for the United States.\n  This is an investment because it is connected. And if we invest, yes, \nsome money--my goodness, isn't that something? We would actually have \nto pay some money, not wild exaggerations that we have heard on the \nfloor of the Senate, but some real dollars to invest, to expand the \nsecurity and stability umbrella of NATO eastward.\n  It is an investment for us for a couple of reasons. One, it will help \nassure this country will not be sending its children and its \ngrandchildren to fight another World War or a war in Europe. \nDemocracies do not attack other democracies. Democracies do not go to \nwar. So it is an investment in national security and peace for us.\n  It is also an economic investment. As these nations that had been \nunder the yoke of Communist dictatorship for almost 50 years are now in \na position to develop democracy and flourish economically as they \ndevelop their democratic governments and their freedoms, they are as \nwell developing market economies.\n  What does that mean to us? That means markets, that means some \nstability, that means connection.\n  I also have found some of my colleagues, particularly on my side of \nthe aisle, comment about, ``Well, but this President, this \nadministration, wants to take NATO expansion beyond the boundaries of \nwhat the mission is of NATO.'' I remind my colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle, my Republican colleagues, who might have some concern about \nthis present administration, 10 Republican and Democratic \nadministrations have presided over America's involvement in NATO, 10 \nadministrations, Republican and Democratic.\n  This debate should not get confused with the underbrush of detail or \nwho is in the White House today. This debate is about the future and \nhow we are preparing for the future as we go into the next century--not \nabout Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright, Bill Cohen. They are players on \nthe scene for a very brief time, just like 10 administrations have been \non the scene, essentially for a brief time.\n  Missions and organizations change, believe it or not. Missions and \norganizations change. Times change. Dynamics change, challenges change, \ncircumstances and situations change.\n  To my colleagues who say, ``Well, prove to me that NATO is going to \nbe important. Prove to me every dollar that's going in. Prove to me we \nneed NATO,'' well, as brilliant as many of my colleagues are, no one \ncan give them that answer, you see, because no one can predict the \nfuture. But that is what NATO expansion is about. That is why we \nestablished NATO 50 years ago, because the future was uncertain and was \nunstable. If we did not have NATO today, we would have to invent NATO.\n  To those of my colleagues who say, ``Well, why rush? We're rushing \ninto this. What's so important about doing this now? This year? Next \nyear?'' I say, I suppose you could have asked that question after World \nWar II--there was relative peace in Europe after World War II--``What's \nthe rush?'' And for every one of the previous three expansions into \nNATO, you could have said, ``Why West Germany now? Let's wait until \nabout 1980,'' or for any of the other nations. But, my goodness, \ndoesn't it make a little more sense to develop strong, bold, dynamic, \nfuturistic policy now--now--when we can think clearly, when we can \nunderstand the dynamics of the issues rather than, well, let us wait \nfor some country to be invaded and then we will show them what we are \ngoing to do? Come on, it does not work that way. It does not work that \nway.\n  Let us not squander the time we now have to plan as best we can for a \nsurely uncertain future.\n\n  Another dynamic that gets lost in this debate, Mr. President, is \nanother certainty--the diffusion of power in the world. The face of \nthis globe will not look the same in 25 years. It will not look the \nsame because the geopolitical, economic and military power structures \nof the globe of this 5.2 billion-people world are changing. Like life \nchanges, everything changes.\n  It is in the best interest of this country and the world for us to \nlead as best we can to prepare for those new challenges and to prepare \nfor that new diffusion of power, as it will surely come, as it is \ncoming today.\n  Yes; yes, Europe is only one part of that. But look at the numbers--a \nrather significant part. Any measurement you take of the importance of \nEurope, any measurement you take--people, gross domestic product, \nexports--and do we really believe Europe still and will still be \nuntouched into the next century with no war, no conflict?\n  Who would have predicted Bosnia? Who would have foreseen that in 1990 \nand 1991? Kosovo. These are deadly, real examples of how fast things \ncan come unraveled even in--even in--Europe.\n  Another question that is asked, and appropriately so, is our force \nstrength. It is a very good question. Over the last 10 years, we have \nbeen asking our military to do more with less--more deployments, longer \ndeployments. We now have a force structure, in real dollar terms--in \nreal budget terms--that is down as low as any time since 1940. Less \nthan 3 percent of our gross domestic product goes for our national \ndefense. That is below dangerously low. And if we in fact are going to \nask our military to take on new responsibilities, like NATO expansion, \nwhich I support, and NATO and the Persian Gulf, and a hundred other \nnations where we have troops, then we are going to have to pay \nattention to our military. And we have not been doing that.\n  Another debate for another time surely, Mr. President, but one that \nis appropriately talked about in this debate and asked because if we \nare going to ask our military to do more, we are going to have to pay \nattention to the budget and to rebuilding our military. We are soon \nbecoming a hollow military, and that is in any measurement you wish to \ntake. In the President's own budget for fiscal year 1999, he cuts \nanother 25,000 uniformed men and women from the services. We cannot \nhave it both ways. But, as I say, part of the debate should be part of \nthat debate, but that debate should come at a different time.\n  I conclude my remarks, Mr. President, by saying that we have a unique \nopportunity, as the most dominant nation on Earth, at a most unique \ntime in history--not a time seen probably since Rome during the Roman \nEmpire--when one nation has so thoroughly dominated this globe.\n  There is a bigger question for this country and a bigger challenge \nthat will require a bigger debate than NATO. But it is part of the \ndebate. And that is, yes, a great nation is required to do great \nthings, to take on great burdens, and to give great leadership. It is \nan awesome responsibility the United States has. And our challenge, our \ndebate is, do we wish in fact to go into the next century as that \ndominant\n\n[[Page S3694]]\n\ngreat nation and carry that great burden of leadership? This is part of \nthat debate.\n\n  We have an opportunity, unique in history, to help build strong \ndemocracies, help to build structures that will give more people more \nfreedom than the history has ever known, more market economies, better \nstandards of living, better health, less conflict, less war. That is \nwhy NATO expansion is important. It is not the only issue, maybe not \nthe most important issue, but surely it fits into the grander debate \nthat we will have.\n  New alliances are being formed, new alliances will continue to be \nformed in the next century. We want to be part of that. As we rely on \nmore nations and more relationships and more alliances, in the end that \nwill mean less burden for us, less burden for us because we are helping \ndevelop strong democratic nations with resources, with economies that \ncan defend themselves. That is in our interest. In the end, it is in \nthe world's interest.\n  That, more than any other reason, is why I strongly support NATO \nexpansion. I ask that my colleagues in this body who are still \nundecided, for legitimate reasons, listen to this debate closely, \nbecause in the end this debate is about our future and what is in our \nbest interest.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is true the Delaware which touches New \nJersey is owned by Delaware, but I am from Delaware. I would be proud \nto be from New Jersey, but I am prouder to be from Delaware.\n  Mr. President, I understand we are going to go to the Kyl amendment \nvery shortly and I cosponsor and agree with the Kyl amendment. I think \nthe manager supports the Kyl amendment, too. But while we wait for \nSenator Kyl to make his opening statement in support of his amendment, \nI would like to reiterate a point I made yesterday with Senator Smith, \nin the few minutes while we are waiting for Senator Kyl to come to the \nfloor.\n  Yesterday there was a good deal of talk here about whether or not \nthis expansion of NATO was good, bad or indifferent. The distinguished \nSenator from New York, Senator Moynihan, the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, Senator Warner and others, were taking issue with the \nexpansion of NATO. I referenced why I thought the Poles thought this \nwas in their interest because the comments were basically made that the \nPoles--Senator Smith of New Hampshire said we support the Poles anyway.\n  I made the point that that kind of promise had been made to Poland \nbefore. In 1939, France was considered to have Europe's strongest army. \nIt had built the massive defensive fortification called the Maginot \nLine which was widely thought to be impregnable.\n  Hitler's generals warned against an attack on France. In late August \nof 1939, of course, came the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet \nUnion and Nazi Germany which--difficult though it may be to understand \ntoday--astonished the world then.\n  Little more than a week later, on September 1, 1939, Hitler's forces \nlaunched a surprise attack on Poland. Here we come to two critical \npoints.\n  First, Great Britain and France had cobbled together an alliance with \nPoland earlier that year after Germany had annexed the rest of \nCzechoslovakia.\n  But that last-minute alliance, of course, can in no way be compared \nto today's powerful integrated military command of NATO. France and \nBritain had no capability to project forces eastward to defend the \nPoles. Furthermore, Poland was then ruled by authoritarian colonels, \nwhile Britain and France were democracies. Therefore, appeasers could \nand did proclaim that they would not ``die for Danzig.''\n  Hitler saw all this and correctly anticipated that France and Britain \nwould not actively oppose his attack on Poland. And they didn't.\n  Secondly, Hitler's generals needed the attack on Poland to perfect \ntheir new tactic which was dubbed the ``Blitzkrieg'' or ``lightning \nwar.'' The panzer attack on the Polish cavalry, as was pointed out \nyesterday, an incredible undertaking where Poles on horses were taking \non armored divisions of the German Army, which the Senator from \nVirginia recalled earlier in the debate, was a metaphor for the \neffectiveness of the German's new kind of rapid, mobile warfare.\n\n  I said yesterday that France and Britain, after formally declaring \nwar on Germany September 3, 1939, did nothing. In fact, Mr. President, \nfor more than 8 months nothing happened on the Franco-German frontier. \nCommentators labeled this the ``phony war,'' a term which students of \nhistory will call and readily recall.\n  Meanwhile, after carving up Poland with Stalin, the Germans were \nfreed to redeploy offensive combat units for use in the West. On May \n10, 1940, Hitler invaded France and the Low Countries using the \nBlitzkrieg tactics perfected against the Poles, now against France. \nGoing through Belgium and Holland, the Germans simply bypassed the \nvaunted Maginot Line, and soon they were in Paris.\n  So I repeat, Hitler's road to France went through Poland. We should \nask ourselves what lessons can be learned from this sad tale and \nacknowledge Poland is east of Germany. How did it get to France? Had \nthey not gone into Poland first they would not, in all probability, \nhave been nearly as successful as they were in 1940. The road to France \nwas through Poland.\n  First, the lesson we should learn from this sad tale is the alliance \nonly means something if it has a deeper purpose. Today, Poland, Hungary \nand the Czech Republic are democracies with Western values--not as \nPoland was then, a very different country. By the way, only extreme \nisolationists, I submit, would repeat a ``I won't die for Danzig'' \nslogan in 1998.\n  Second, the alliance must have military muscle to back up a paper \nagreement. NATO clearly has the military structure in force to make \ncollective defense credible.\n  The third lesson, is NATO, through its Partnership for Peace Program, \nis actively cooperating with non-NATO countries, including Russia, to \nlessen tensions and make future conflicts highly unlikely.\n  So for all these reasons, Mr. President, Poland, Hungary, and the \nCzech Republic, passionately want to become members of NATO. All three \ncountries have successfully completed a demanding set of reforms in \norder to qualify.\n  History need not repeat itself, Mr. President. But history is always \ninstructive. That is why I mention the connection between Poland and \nFrance in 1939 and 1940. I hope this explanation is helpful to my \ncolleagues. I hope we keep it in mind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wonder if I might engage our distinguished colleague, \nwho just presented his views, in a bit of a colloquy.\n  First, I ask my colleague, did he make the statement that NATO is for \nthe defense of all of Europe, or some broad, sweeping statement to that \neffect?\n  Mr. HAGEL. No, I didn't say it is for all of Europe. I said we would \nhave a Europe, as we expand NATO eastward, that gives Europe an \nopportunity from east to west, all of Europe, to be democratic, \nopportunity to develop market economies, the potential to be a free \ncontinent, and that NATO could help do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I am just going back to read the \ncharter, article V, and this is the heart and soul of NATO.\n  It says that parties agree that an armed attack against one or more \nof them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack \nagainst them all, and consequently they agree that if such an armed \nattack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or \ncollective self-defense, recognized by article V of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations, will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking \nforthwith, individually and in concert with other parties, such action \nas it deems necessary, including use of armed force to restore and \nmaintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\n  Now, it was very clear when this was written that we envisioned the \nSoviet Union as the threat. That was the purpose of it. And now with \nthe demise of the Soviet Union and the threats now being fractured into \nmany places and of many types, we are trying to determine what is the \nfuture mission of NATO.\n\n[[Page S3695]]\n\n  One of my great regrets is that we are proceeding with this matter of \nincluding three new states at a time when NATO itself has not \ndetermined exactly what is to be the mission subsequent to the 1991 \nstatement to that effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds the Senator of the previous \norder.\n  Mr. WARNER. For the benefit of the Senate, the Chair should state the \norder.\n\n\n               Executive Amendment No. 2310, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is to be 30 \nminutes of debate on amendment No. 2310 offered by Senator Kyl of \nArizona to begin at 4:30 p.m.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for about a minute and \na half.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I direct my comment to the distinguished Senator who is \nproposing the amendment, Senator Kyl, which will now be the subject of \nfurther debate. In particular, on page 1 entitled ``common threats,'' \nit says, ``NATO members will face common threats to security in the \npost-cold war environment, including . . .''--and on page 5 it says--I \nguess that was 4. It says, ``. . . conflict in the North Atlantic area \nstemming from ethnic and religious enmity, the revival of historic \ndisputes, or the actions of undemocratic leaders.''\n  I find that far afield from the NATO charter itself. Indeed, it is \nsomewhat far afield from the 1991 restatement of the mission of NATO. \nSpeaking for myself, I have grave concerns about NATO incorporating in \nany future document the fact that it stands ready to stamp out ethnic \nand religious enmities and the revival of historic disputes. That is \nthe very thing we are involved in now in Bosnia. I just don't have time \nto get into it, but I would like to have a clearer explanation from the \nproponent of this amendment as to what he intended by the inclusion of \nthis paragraph in this amendment. Basically, I wanted to support the \namendment, but I cannot support a document that says NATO is going to \ntake it upon itself to put out civil wars and religious enmities and \nethnic disputes. I am concerned about the future of American \nservicepersons and that the men and women who will proudly wear the \nuniform of the United States and be an integral part of NATO would be \nsubject, under NATO commanders, to go into these areas and meet such \nconflicts.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will be delighted to answer the question of \nmy distinguished colleague from Virginia. I will begin, first of all, \nby setting forth the essential concept or idea underlying this \namendment.\n  The future course of the NATO alliance, its core purposes and its \nstrategic orientation in this post-cold war era, will be decided by \nallied negotiations upcoming on the so-called revised strategic concept \nof NATO. The new document is going to be agreed upon in a little bit \nless than a year--next April. Senate advice and consent to the NATO \nenlargement issue here presents a unique opportunity for the Senate of \nthe United States to speak on this issue, an opportunity we would not \notherwise have. We, therefore, can help to lay out the strategic vision \nof NATO from the standpoint of the United States and thus influence the \noutcome of these negotiations.\n  In my view, the current resolution focuses too much on what NATO \nshould not be and should not do. The resolution does not attempt to lay \nout a comprehensive set of principles to guide development of the \nstrategic concept. And so this proposed amendment will establish the \nSenate's vision of the future of NATO and, I hope, help to lay the \nfoundation for American positions on the strategic concept.\n  Here is the background that will lead up to the answer to the \nSenator's question. I hope it is the only expression of concern about \nthe amendment because I would certainly like to have his support for \nwhat I think is an amendment that will be overwhelmingly supported by \nboth proponents and opponents of expansion. Our principal objective \nhere, I say to the Senator from Virginia, is to ensure that NATO \nremains an arm of U.S. power and influence. NATO, not the WEU or the \nOSCE, must remain the principal foundation for the security interests \nof its members. This means NATO must be prepared militarily to defend \nagainst a range of common threats to our vital interests. We have tried \nto identify what they all are.\n  Now, some of us may not like what some of them are and may not like \nthe fact that we will have to respond to them. For example, a radical \nIslamic terrorism threat in the North Atlantic region may require that \nwe defend against that. That didn't used to be a big problem for NATO. \nWhat I have done is insert the words ``in the Atlantic area''--words \nthat were not in the underlying resolution of ratification that came \nout of the committee. So what I have tried to do is both to, yes, \nacknowledge a threat that we all acknowledge that could arise, but to \nlimit the nature of our response to that in the Atlantic area by the \nspecific language of the section that the Senator from Virginia and the \nSenator from Texas are concerned about.\n  This amendment underscores that collective defense will remain the \ncore alliance mission. But it acknowledges that new threats have \nemerged in the post-cold war era that will require NATO to adapt its \nmilitary forces and defense planning mechanism.\n  Mr. WARNER. May I have one word of clarification?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to try to answer the question.\n  Mr. WARNER. The mix of NATO is the collective security of member \nnations and the collective security of the continent that they occupy. \nThat has been the traditional mission. Now, you are recognizing these \nare threats, and I agree they are becoming more and more threats--\nreligious and ethnic strife. But do you intend, by this document, to \nsay that that should be written in as a mission of NATO, to stand ready \nto intervene in these types of conflicts? Or are you just recognizing \nthem as potential threats and subsequently, depending on the magnitude \nof the threat, the NATO commanders, and the NAC, North Atlantic \nCouncil, can determine if in fact it threatens the collective security \nof a nation or the nations?\n  Mr. KYL. That is an excellent question, Mr. President, and it is, of \ncourse, the latter--something that I think the Senator from Virginia \nand I support. I point to the specific language to confirm my point. In \nparagraph 5, ``common threats,'' it says: ``NATO members will face \ncommon threats to their security in the post-cold war environment, \nincluding. . .'' Then we list threats. We hope they will never arise. \nThat is the context in which this particular provision is listed.\n  If I could just close my comment here, Mr. President, because the \nSenator from Delaware wishes to comment. This amendment merely \nconditions Senate advice and consent to its understanding of U.S. \npolicy as it relates to the revising strategic concept of NATO. It \nacknowledges the principles that have animated our participation in \nNATO from the very beginning and also identifies the threats that we \nmay face. It states that the Senate understands that the core concepts \ncontained in the 1991 document remain valid today.\n  I say to my friend from Virginia, in essence, that the 1991 strategic \nconcept provides a foundation on which to build the revised statement \nof NATO strategy and sets forth the 10 principles which the Senator \nunderstands will be in the new document.\n  I urge my colleagues who support and oppose the expansion of NATO to \nsupport this amendment and to put the Senate on record as defining the \nNATO of the future. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, collectively, with the Senator from \nTexas--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Delaware \ncontrols the time. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much time do I control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Texas and I wish to discuss the capacity \nto respond to common threats. NATO's continued success requires a \ncredible military capability to deter and respond to common threats. \nAnd when you look at the definition of common threats, it includes \nhistoric disputes, religious enmities, ethnic and\n\n[[Page S3696]]\n\nthe like. I fear that, although the Senator in his statement seemed to \nclarify that this is not to be a mission, somehow the language, I \nbelieve, is somewhat tangled. I yield to my colleague from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have just been looking at the \namendment with the Senator from Virginia. I like every other part of \nthe amendment. I like every other part of the amendment. But it seems \nthat the words define what a common threat is, and included in the \ncommon threat are ethnic divisions or uprising, and then it says that \none of the missions of NATO is to respond to common threats. I just \nwondered if there could be a clarification, or perhaps a clarifying \namendment that would assure that is not going to be a responsibility of \nNATO to come into a situation in which there is a border dispute or an \nethnic dispute. In fact, that is one of the amendments I would offer \nlater, which is to avoid having the United States get into an ethnic \ndispute.\n\n  If the Senator from Arizona can clarify it, I think the Senator from \nVirginia and I would like to support the amendment. But if it needs \nsome work to assure its intent, then perhaps we could work on that as \nwell.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. On my time, let my take a crack at that, if I may. I am a \ncosponsor, although I cannot take credit for the drafting. It is \ntotally a product of my friend from Arizona, and it is an admirable \njob. The Senator from Oregon and I were just talking about what a good \namendment this is. I am glad to cosponsor it. But let me maybe help.\n  I have in my hand the alliance's Strategic Concept of 1991, the last \none that occurred. It is the present operating doctrine for NATO. My \nfriend from Virginia pointed out that the North Atlantic Assembly \ncommittee gets together and they decide whether this should be updated \nperiodically, what it should say, and what article V of the Washington \ntreaty means. Article V of the Washington treaty, the NATO treaty, was \nread earlier by my friend from Virginia.\n  It starts off, the parties agree that an armed attack against one or \nmore of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack \nagainst them all, consequently, and it goes on from there. Let me read \nfrom the strategic concept, the alliance's strategic concept, which is \nthe operating strategy of NATO, as we speak, the one that was, in \neffect, redone in 1991 to respond to the changed circumstances, meaning \nno longer the Soviet Union, the Berlin Wall is down, and all these \nnations. We are talking about independent republics and nations \nthemselves. OK. That is the concept in which the strategic document \ncame about.\n  On page 4, under ``Security Challenges and Risks,'' paragraph 10, the \npresent strategic doctrine of NATO reads as follows:\n\n       Risks to allied security are less likely to result from \n     calibrated aggression against the territories of the allies, \n     but rather from adverse consequences of instability that may \n     arise from serious economic, social, or political \n     difficulties, including ethnic rivalries and territorial \n     disputes . . .\n\n  --border disputes, and ethnic rivalries. Excuse me. Let me be clear \nthat I don't want to misquote. Go back to the quote:\n\n       . . . political difficulties, including ethnic rivalries, \n     and territorial disputes.\n\n  Parenthetically inserted by me was border disputes, and what is going \non in Bosnia now.\n  Back to the quote:\n\n       . . . which are faced by many countries in Central and \n     Eastern Europe . . .\n\n  Not members of NATO.\n\n       . . . the tensions which may result, as long as they remain \n     limited, should not directly threaten the security and \n     territorial integrity of members of the alliance. They could \n     however lead to a crisis inimical to European stability and \n     even to armed conflicts which would involve outside powers, \n     or spill over into NATO countries having a direct effect on \n     the security of the alliance.\n\n  Nothing to do with the expansion of NATO--zero, zero to do with \nexpansion. Presently, NATO interprets article V to represent--is \ninterpreted and laid out tactically in the alliance's strategic concept \nas interpreted by the 16 NATO nations. It authorizes and allows, and \nthey in advance acknowledge that NATO will deem, under article V, \ninstability as a consequence of ethnic rivalries, or boundary and \nterritorial integrity. They will interpret that. They may interpret \nthat to be a threat to the security of any of the member nations; ergo, \nyou are then allowed under NATO strategic doctrine, if all NATO \ncountries agree, as they do in this doctrine, to use force.\n  What is happening in this debate, unintentionally, as I said to my \nfriend from Virginia yesterday, and what we are really debating in the \nbiggest debate that has occurred is what the greatest differences have \nbeen over NATO strategy as it now exists.\n  That is really what people are arguing about. They are really arguing \nnot about what these three additional countries will do to impact on \nstrategy. They are basically arguing, as they should, as they should, \nwhether or not this outfit we put together almost 40-some years ago \nstill is relevant today, whether we should still have it. But the \nstrategic doctrine today put in place in 1991 says, and I will repeat, \n``Risks to allied securities are less likely to result from calculated \naggression against the territory of the allies but, rather, from \nadverse consequences of instability that may arise from serious \neconomic, social and political difficulties including ethnic rivalries, \nterritorial disputes which are faced by many countries in Central and \nEastern Europe.''\n  Now, my friend from New York, who is opposing the expansion, is \nprobably the single most qualified man in the Congress, having written \nabout and predicting the kind of chaos that would come from the male \nfist of communism being lifted off of the sectarian rivalries that have \nbeen subsumed under that heavy hand in the Communist rule--he predicted \nin a book he published several years ago, that I recommend to everyone, \nthat there would be crisis in Europe. It would not be Soviet armies \ninvading.\n  So my friends who keep saying: Look, we ought to reflect reality, \nNATO should reflect the real world, as Senator Smith from New Hampshire \nkept saying yesterday, NATO did just that in their strategic doctrine \nof 1991. They said the risk--paraphrasing--is not from Soviet \ndivisions; it is from ethnic rivalries, economic, social, and political \ninstability. That is where our risks lie and we must respond to those \nrisks.\n  So nothing new is being stated by my friend from Arizona. He is not \nbreaking new ground. He is reiterating a basic principle of the \nstrategic doctrine that exists now. And if we vote down these three \ncountries, it will still exist. To the extent you have a fight, an \nargument with that section of his amendment, which I cosponsor, you do \nnot have a fight about expansion. You have a fight about why don't you \nintroduce an amendment that says the strategic doctrine of NATO should \nnot be what my friend states it should be and, in fact, is.\n  So, again, we tend to----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I think we \ncould settle this with two sentences. Do I understand from the \nsponsors--and you being a cosponsor of the amendment --that nothing in \nthe amendment expands beyond what is stated in the 1991 doctrine, \nparagraph 10, which the Senator from Delaware just read? If it is to be \ninterpreted as saying that remains as the goal, then I am comfortable \nwith the amendment. But as drawn, largely due to the defining language, \nI have a problem with it in its present form.\n  I agree with the Senator from Delaware, if that is to be the mission \nin the future, a consistent one with paragraph 10.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, if I may respond, since I am not the author \nbut only the cosponsor, I do not want to take the liberty of suggesting \nwhat the Senator from Arizona meant, but that is my understanding. It \nis my understanding that the words as drafted now in paragraph 5--and I \napologize. I am searching for the language--say each of the threats are \nself-evidently covered by present NATO doctrine: ``Re-emergence of \nhegemonic power confronting Europe,'' i.e., Russia. That is part of our \nexisting doctrine today. ``Rogue states and non-state actors possessing \nnuclear, biological, or chemical weapons and the means to deliver these\n\n[[Page S3697]]\n\nweapons by ballistic or cruise missiles,'' et cetera. That, as I read \nparagraph 10, is contemplated within the ``serious economic, social and \npolitical difficulties.'' It says, ``including ethnic rivalries and \nterritorial disputes'' but not limited to those two items.\n  No. 3, ``Threats of a wider nature, including the disruption of the \nflow of vital resources'' obviously would affect the economic security \nand the stability of the NATO nations. No. 4, ``Conflict in the North \nAtlantic stemming from ethnic and religious enmity.'' That is covered. \nSo as I said----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is a little swift in saying \nthat is covered. Look, in paragraph 10, in referring to such disputes \nas ethnic and religious enmity, they say this response: ``These \ntensions which may result as long as they remain limited should not \ndirectly threaten the security and territorial integrity of members of \nthe alliance,'' and therefore NATO stays out.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, to respond, that is exactly what this \namendment says. The amendment says, as my friend from Arizona has \ndrafted it, it is a decision self-evident. In this amendment, it is a \ndecision for the NAC to make whether or not it is an armed conflict \nthat will spill over. There have been a number of ethnic conflicts in \nCentral and Eastern Europe which we had concluded not to get involved \nin because the NAC concluded they were not directly threatened, they \ndid not directly threaten the security of those countries. They did \nconclude that the ethnic rivalries and the war in Bosnia did--did--\nthreaten their security. They made that judgment internally within the \nNAC, within that governing body of NATO.\n  So I reserve the remainder of my time. I have 2 minutes, I am told.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 7 minutes.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous the following Senators be \nlisted as cosponsors to my amendment--Helms, Roth, Biden, and Smith of \nOregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the Chair. I thank Senator Kyl. The \nSenator just took away some of the business I wanted to do.\n  I am very pleased to be added as an original cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I think the Clinton administration made a serious \nerror in allowing the other NATO countries to reopen the strategic \nconcept issue. The current document agreed to in 1991 needs no \nalteration. The approach taken under President Bush's strategic concept \nhas served NATO well for the past 7 years and would have served equally \nwell for the next 7. That said, what is done is done. The \nadministration failed to prevent the French and others from opening a \nPandora's box.\n  Negotiations on the strategic concept for the purpose of amending it \nwill commence this summer, and I expect that a document will be agreed \nupon by early next year. Senator Kyl's amendment establishes a vision \nfor NATO's future. It does so by emphasizing those aspects of the \ncurrent NATO policy which the United States finds most important. For \ninstance, the Kyl amendment makes clear that NATO, not the European \nUnion, not the OSCE or any other United Nations-type organization, must \nremain the principal foundation for collective security in Europe.\n  It also takes note of the broad range of threats that will face the \nUnited States and our NATO allies in the post-cold war world and calls \nupon NATO members to ensure that their forces can be rapidly deployed \nand sustained during combat operations.\n  Taken together with paragraph B of the current condition 1 of the \nresolution, which calls upon NATO military planners to put territorial \ndefense above all other priorities, this amendment makes clear that the \nUnited States expects every NATO member to pursue the capability of \noperating with the United States in any contingency under any \ncircumstance.\n  Finally, it reaffirms the key tenets of current NATO nuclear policy. \nI find this paragraph of the Kyl amendment particularly important.\n  In conclusion, Senator Kyl has identified the 10 most important \naspects of NATO's current strategic concept which must be preserved. \nHis amendment sets forth the Senate's expectations that any future \nrevisions to the strategic concept must reflect these principles. I \nwelcome his contribution to the resolution of ratification. It provides \na much-needed vision for the future course of the NATO alliance. The \nadministration can expect that I for one will hold it to the policies \nestablished under the Kyl amendment during the course of future \nnegotiations of the strategic concept.\n\n  Again, my thanks to Senator Kyl. I think his amendment is forward \nlooking. It is visionary. Unlike so many amendments offered here today \nwhich are sort of in the category of ``thou shalt not,'' this is in the \ncategory of ``thou shalt do.'' So I thank Senator Kyl for that and his \nleadership. I am proud to be a cosponsor with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I would be delighted to yield for a question from the \nSenator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Would it be correct to say that the statement, \n``Conflict in the North Atlantic area stemming from ethnic and \nreligious enmity, the revival of historic disputes or actions of \nundemocratic leaders'' does not represent any expansion of the 1991 \ndoctrine?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from New York that I am \nin total agreement with the Senator from Delaware. That is the case, \nthat this was not intended to be an enlargement of existing NATO \npolicy.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I make that statement in order to assure my colleagues \nwho are concerned about enlarged missions that it is not our intention \nto try to expand the mission of NATO. But what we are concerned about \nis helping the administration of the United States define very clearly \nto our European allies our strategic vision of NATO as a defense \nalliance. Unfortunately, some Europeans have a different point of view. \nThey would limit NATO solely to the mission of collective defense \nagainst an armed attack, elevate the WEU to the principal military \norganization for responding to all other threats to NATO security, and \ncuts the United States out of decisionmaking on issues affecting our \nvital interests. Some undermine our ability to shape NATO as a viable \n21st century military alliance, and that is why I offered this \namendment, to help make clear an unambiguous U.S. policy on the future \ndirection of the alliance using the fundamental principles which have \nexisted since 1949 when these concepts were first enunciated and which \nin the Foreign Relations Committee report at that time said that, of \ncourse, each party would have to decide in the light of circumstances \nsurrounding the case and the nature and extent of the assistance \nwhether, in fact, an armed attack had occurred and article 5 thus \nbrought into play--armed attack relating to different kinds of \nsituations that might not be a direct invasion but might, from other \nkinds of causes nevertheless, pose a security risk to the states within \nNATO.\n  So I really believe we have not expanded the current policy, but I \nhope we have clarified for our friends in Europe the limits of the U.S. \npolicy, the vision, the strategic vision that we have. I appreciate the \nquestions raised by the Senators from New York and Virginia to help us \nclarify that point.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we thank the Senator and with that \nassurance I will give you my support. But the amendment is to restrict \nin some way the expressions in the resolution that is before the \nSenate.\n  Mr. KYL. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would the Senator state that for the record?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes. Mr. President, that is correct. We explicitly, for \nexample, insert ``in the North Atlantic area\" which is not in the \nunderlying resolution of ratification.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield. I think I am out of time.\n\n[[Page S3698]]\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Would the Senator agree that in 1949 the issue facing \nWestern Europe and the United States was not ethnic and religious \nconflict, it was international communism in the form of the Soviet \nUnion, which had declared ethnic and religious conflict to be a \npremodern phenomenon, long since sent into the dustbin of history?\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator is correct that the concern at the time was the \ngreat conflict between the West and communism from the Soviet Union. I \nsuggest the Senator probably knows better than any of the rest of us \nabout the longstanding disputes, some ethnic and religious in origin, \nwhich were, perhaps, always under the surface. But at that time, of \ncourse, the Senator is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am not one for shilling for books, but \nfor those of you who are interested in this subject and the religious \nand ethnic conflicts that have erupted after the mailed fist of \ncommunism has been lifted in Central and Eastern Europe, I strongly \nrecommend--and I mean this sincerely--Senator Moynihan's book entitled \n``Pandaemonium.'' It is worth, as they say, the read, and is incredibly \ninstructive. I mean it sincerely. It is incredibly insightful, and \nthose of you who have an interest should take a look at it.\n  I yield the floor and yield the time, and I am ready to vote.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms. Moseley-\nBraun) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDNG OFFICER.

The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nSenate ratification of the Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty on \naccession of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic. I have been \nprivileged to participate in the historic debate on the enlargement of \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization as a member of the Committee on \nForeign Relations. Since last October, the committee has held 8 \nhearings on this issue and heard testimony from 37 witnesses with a \nvariety of opinions on NATO enlargement.\n  I will take this opportunity to thank the chairman of the committee, \nthe Senator from North Carolina, and the committee's ranking member, \nSenator Biden, for the balanced manner in which these hearings were \nconducted and for their support for expeditious consideration of this \nimportant matter.\n  As we all know, Mr. President, NATO has been the most important \nfactor in maintaining peace in Europe since the devastation of World \nWar II. As we prepare to mark the alliance's 50th anniversary next \nyear, it is appropriate to look back on its successes and look forward \nto see what role NATO will play in the next 50 years. The world will be \na much different place in 1999 than it was in 1949 when this alliance \nwas formed as a buffer against Soviet aggression and as a means of \nprotection for nations whose people had just emerged from one of the \ncostliest wars, in both human and financial terms, in our history.\n  But to fully understand and appreciate what the security of NATO \nrepresents to the people of Eastern Europe, we must first remember what \nthey have endured in the years since we celebrated V-E Day. At the same \ntime the people of Western Europe were working to found an alliance \nthat would ensure security and were fighting to rebuild their countries \nand the economies after the fall of the Third Reich, a new threat was \nemerging on the other side of the continent.\n  The Soviet Union, which had been our ally against Hitler, was about \nto become our foe in a cold war that would last almost a half century \nand result in the sacrifice of lives, traditions, and religious liberty \nthroughout Eastern Europe. The people of Eastern Europe barely had time \nto recover from the devastation of a world war when they were faced \nwith Soviet tanks. Foreign subjugation was, of course, nothing new for \nthe people of Eastern and Central Europe.\n  For centuries, Mr. President, this part of the world had been a \nbattleground where people and territory seemed little more than spoils \nin a seemingly endless series of bloody fights. Bit by bit, the Soviet \nUnion redrew Europe's map until it swallowed up the entire eastern and \ncentral region. Under the reign of the Communist Party, people lived in \nfear that they would be accused of being disloyal to the party. \nReligion was outlawed, and the myriad beautiful places of worship in \nthe Soviet Union were left vacant; many were destroyed.\n  In spite of the treatment they were forced to endure at the hands of \nthe Soviet regime, the people of Eastern Europe never lost their will \nto be free, as demonstrated by events such as the Prague Spring and the \nSolidarity movement. By the mid-1980s, the Soviet Union was beginning \nto crumble and the people of Eastern Europe yearned to satisfy their \nhunger for democracy and freedom. Beginning in 1989, the people of \nPoland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia peacefully ousted their Communist \ngovernments and replaced them with democracy. It was, in the words of \nVaclav Havel, a ``velvet revolution.''\n\n  Because of modern technology, the world community has had a front-row \nseat for the transformation of Eastern Europe. We literally watched the \nBerlin Wall fall and marveled at cranes dismantling statues of Lenin \nand laying low the hammer and sickle.\n  Today, nearly a half a century after World War II, the Iron Curtain \nis gone and the Soviet regime is no more. The changing face of Europe \nis marked by newly-independent countries eagerly embracing democracy \nfor the first time in more than two generations. But the people of \nthese former Soviet satellite countries still live in the shadow of the \nhistory of Soviet domination. These nations and their people seek to \nrejoin the West, and seek a means to ensure that they will never again \nfall victim to a Soviet-style regime.\n  The lingering memory of Soviet domination was evident at the Winter \n1998 Olympic Games, where a player on the Czech Republic's hockey team \nwore the number 68 to mark the February 25, 1968, invasion of his \ncountry by the Soviet Union. When the Czech Republic's hockey team beat \nthe Russian team for the gold medal, many Czechs felt that the victory \nrepresented more than athletic excellence. It also symbolized their \ncountry's freedom from the Soviet domination of the past.\n  Now, there is a new, democratic Russia, and the nations of Eastern \nEurope,\n\n[[Page S3699]]\n\nwhich have become our friends and trading partners, are caught, both \nliterally and figuratively, between this new Russia and the West. This \nis a critical time for the newly-independent states of Eastern Europe \nto establish themselves as countries in their own right, finally free \nof the yoke of Soviet domination.\n  It is only natural that these Eastern European countries would seek \nto join NATO, an alliance which shines as a beacon of democracy and \nsecurity on the European continent. The proposed enlargement of this \nalliance represents a crossroads in American foreign policy, and, \nindeed, in the fragile balance of power in Europe. Some opposed to \nenlarging this alliance have said that it would create a new series of \ndividing lines in Europe, between NATO, Russia, and those countries \nwhich are caught in the middle--neither members of NATO nor under the \nsphere of Russian influence. Others have argued that all countries \nmeeting the criteria for membership in NATO should be allowed to join. \nOpponents fear that this would lead to a different dividing line --one \nbetween Russia and the rest of Europe.\n  Many of my constituents, and indeed many people around the world, \nhave a special interest in the debate over NATO enlargement due to \ntheir ethnic heritage or their memories of the iron fist of Soviet rule \nin Eastern Europe. I share their commitment to a Europe which will \nnever again fall victim to such oppression.\n  The proposed enlargement embodied in the protocols currently before \nthis body leads to many questions: How many countries? How many rounds \nof enlargement? What about Russia? What about those that may be left \nout?\n  It is my view that the newly-independent countries in Europe should \nnot be forever caught between Russia and the West. It is also my strong \nview that the United States must proceed carefully so that we do not \ndamage our relationship with a democratic Russia. Unfortunately, parts \nof the debate over NATO enlargement have taken on an ``us versus them'' \nquality. We must not forget that the Russian Federation is not the \nSoviet Union, and that we should encourage democracy wherever it takes \nroot. Instead of the ``us versus them'' of the Cold War era, this \ndebate should be about the new landscape of Europe. We must not make \nRussia feel as if it is being ganged up on by the West. We must \nencourage democracy there as we do elsewhere on the globe, and we must \nencourage the newly-independent states to take control of their own \nfutures.\n\n  That is why the Administration helped to successfully negotiate the \nNATO-Russia Founding Act. And that is why the language in the \nresolution of ratification currently before this body encourages the \ncontinuation of a constructive relationship between NATO and Russia.\n  I support the fundamental goals of NATO enlargement, and believe it \nis in America's national interest to pursue this first round, as it \nhas. However, I do have some concerns, that I know are shared by many \nother Members of Congress, about the commitment--financial and \notherwise--the United States will undertake as it pursues enlargement \nof the alliance.\n  On that point, Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment on \none of my concerns about this debate: the disparity among the various \nestimates on the financial commitment the United States would be \nundertaking if NATO enlargement were to proceed. There have been at \nleast three major studies conducted on this subject, each of which has \ntaken a different approach with respect to the basis for their \nestimates. While I understand that it is impossible to account for all \nof the different variables that will be included in this endeavor, each \nstudy assumes a different set of costs, and thus reaches very different \ncost projections for the U.S. share of this undertaking--any- where \nfrom $2 billion to $7 billion.\n  I am pleased that I was able to get clarification on this issue \nthrough the hearings we held in the Foreign Relations Committee, and I \nam pleased that the members of the Committee devoted so much time to \nthis important aspect of NATO enlargement. The Committee based its \nevaluation of the estimated cost of NATO enlargement on the following \nfour assumptions that can be found in the Department of Defense and \nNATO studies:\n  First, because there is no immediate threat to NATO, the alliance \nwill continue to operate in the current strategic environment for the \nforeseeable future.\n  Second, NATO will not station substantial forces on the territories \nof Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic.\n  Third--and this is a key point for me--NATO's standard burdensharing \nrules will apply to the costs of enlargement.\n  Fourth, the modernization of the United States military is considered \nto be a strictly American project that will not be funded through the \nNATO common budget, and, thus, NATO enlargement will not require the \nUnited States to undertake any new force modernization initiatives \nbeyond those already planned.\n  Mr. President, I believe that these four assumptions are at the heart \nof the debate over the cost of NATO enlargement. While, in my view, the \nenlargement of the alliance is in the best interest of the United \nStates, I remain committed to ensuring that the federal government \nachieves--and maintains--a balanced federal budget. The Committee's \ncareful analysis of the costs involved in NATO enlargement addressed \nmany of my concerns in this regard. I agree with the language included \nin the Committee Report which states that the Committee ``stresses the \nimportance of all current and future allies to meet their commitments \nto the common defense. Anything less will result in a hollow strategic \ncommitment.'' At the same time, I will look carefully at any of the \namendments before us that seek to control the costs to the U.S. \ntaxpayer of this enlargement.\n  Because of the necessity of all NATO members to meet their \ncommitments to the common defense, I asked Secretary of State Madeleine \nAlbright, at a February 24, 1998, Foreign Relations Committee hearing, \nif Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic would be prepared to take on \nthese commitments. She told me that ``We are confident that Poland, \nHungary and the Czech Republic will take on the financial commitment \ninvolved in NATO membership. Indeed, to prepare for this commitment, \nall three have increased their defense budgets to fund necessary \ndefense reforms, and to bring them in line with the standard outlays of \nNATO Allies. . . . Moreover, the cost of defense would undoubtedly be \nhigher if these countries did not join NATO.''\n  In addition, I have been assured by both Secretary Albright and \nSecretary of Defense William Cohen that the United States share of NATO \nenlargement costs will not exceed $7 billion over ten years. They have \ninsisted that the wide range of cost estimates can be attributed to the \nuse of varying data and the fact that the original estimates assumed \nthe admission of four new countries into the alliance. I respect the \nviews of the Department of Defense and the General Accounting Office in \nexplaining the differential, and will continue to monitor revised cost \nestimates as they become available.\n  The many cost estimates involved in this first round of NATO \nenlargement also lead me to wonder if we will have a clearer picture of \nthe cost of future rounds, or if we will be faced with the same \nfinancial uncertainties that loom before us today. This is an issue the \nSenate will be looking at closely as the Alliance develops its policies \nregarding future enlargement. This is also the subject of at least one \namendment to the resolution of ratification currently before this body.\n  I also have concerns about the impact of new U.S. commitments to NATO \non America's general military readiness, especially at a time when so \nmany of our forces are deployed around the world in Bosnia, the Persian \nGulf, Korea, and other posts. I asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, General Hugh Shelton, about this concern when he testified \nbefore the Committee on Foreign Relations. He said, ``I see nothing in \nthe NATO enlargement concept that will detract from our overall \nreadiness. To the contrary, the additional troops, military equipment \nand capabilities that the three new countries bring to the Alliance can \nonly reduce the demands on current members.''\n  I am encouraged by his answer, and I am also encouraged by the \nwillingness\n\n[[Page S3700]]\n\nof Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to participate in NATO's \nPartnership for Peace. All three countries were original members of \nthis program, and all have provided troops and equipment for NATO \nmissions. In my view, the willingness of these three countries to \nparticipate in NATO efforts will only strengthen the alliance.\n  As I stated earlier, I share the Administration's basic views on the \nmerits of enlarging this alliance. The people of Eastern Europe must \nnever again be subjected to the conditions they were forced to endure \nunder Soviet rule. They see NATO membership as a means to ensure their \nfuture safety. My concern is about the extent of the commitment the \nUnited States will be making, and the uncertainty regarding the price \ntag that American taxpayers will be asked to pay in this time of fiscal \nrestraint and personal sacrifice. But voting in favor of NATO \nenlargement should not be considered a blank check for military or \nother spending in the region. Should the Senate ratify the protocols we \nare considering today, I and my colleagues in both the House and the \nSenate will continue to monitor the new U.S. commitments to NATO--\nfinancial and otherwise--through the regular congressional budget and \nappropriations process.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution of \nratification.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been watching with a great deal of \ninterest the debate that is taking place. It has been a very healthy \ndebate. Certainly the Senator from Wisconsin raised some very good \npoints. As I listened to his comments, I can only say that I agree with \nalmost everything he said except for his conclusion. I look at the cost \nof this, and we do not know what to anticipate should we extend NATO to \nthese countries. I am deeply concerned about the costs that would be \nincurred. The range has been incredible. You talk about something \nbetween $400 million and $120 billion. That range is not one that gives \nme much comfort.\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that the same group of people \nthat are giving us their assurances now--that is, the Secretary of \nDefense, the Secretary of State, and the White House --that it is not \ngoing to cost over a certain amount of money, are the same ones that \ntold us in November of 1995 that it would not cost more than $1.2 \nbillion for our participation in Bosnia. We knew better. But, \nnonetheless, that is what they said. They said that is a guarantee. Yet \nhere we are now. Our direct costs in Bosnia have exceeded $9 billion. I \nsuggest that is less than half of the total direct and indirect costs. \nSo I don't have a very high comfort level when it comes to being able \nto rely on what it might cost us to extend NATO to these three \ncountries.\n  The second thing as I read article V, which is the security \nguarantee, is that I see this as a very expensive security guarantee, \nand it is open ended. It stipulates that, ``An armed attack against one \nor more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered as an \nattack against them all.'' It doesn't say that we would come to the aid \nof someone who is attacked if we have any national security interests. \nIt doesn't say that if it should impair our Nation, we are going to be \nin a position to defend them. It is not like many of the situations \nwhere we have become involved in helping countries such as Nicaragua \nand others because we know it is cheaper actually to help them than it \nis to have to fight these battles ourselves. This just says, ``as an \nattack against them all.'' That means that if there is an attack, we \nhave to come to their aid. We always take a much greater share of the \nburden than our partners do.\n  The third thing is that I have no doubt in my mind that if we do \nthis, this is just the beginning and that we will be extending it to \nmore and more countries.\n  I would like to remind you, Mr. President, of a quote from Secretary \nAlbright that the door is open, she said, to other countries with \ndemocratic governments and free markets. ``The administration is \nfighting an effort by Warner and others to place a moratorium on \nadmission of additional countries until it is known how well the first \nrecruits are assimilated.'' After the first three recruits were invited \nlast year, Albright said, ``We must pledge that the first new members \nwill not be the last, and that no European democracy will be excluded \nbecause of where it sits on the map.''\n  So with the increased costs as we make these extensions, we are \nlooking at Romania, Slovenia, Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Albania, \nBulgaria, Macedonia, and Slovakia, and many others. I don't see where \nthere is an end it to. However, I remind my colleagues that this is not \na partisan subject.\n\n  I was honored to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee with \nthe Democrat who is probably more knowledgeable than any Democrat has \nbeen--certainly in my recollection--on that committee, Sam Nunn. Sam \nNunn was quoted as saying, ``Russian cooperation in avoiding \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction is our most important \nnational security objective, and this NATO expansion makes them more \nsuspicious and less cooperative.'' He further said, ``The \nadministration's answer to this and other serious questions are what I \nconsider to be platitudes.''\n  I agree with Senator Nunn that this is opening the door to something \nthat is very expensive, and also it could impair what progress we have \nmade with Russia.\n  Just to quote the Duma, on January 23 they passed a resolution--this \nis in Russia, the Russian Duma--calling NATO expansion the biggest \nthreat to Russia since the end of World War II.\n  All of these things have been talked about on this floor. One thing \nthat has not been talked about is what I would consider to be the \ngreatest exposure we would be inheriting by making this extension.\n  I can remember being here on the Senate floor back in November of \n1995. We missed passing a resolution of disapproval to keep sending our \ntroops over to Bosnia. We had no national security interest on a very \nexpensive thing that now has caused the decimation of our entire \ndefense system. We did that as a response to the strongest argument; \nthat is, we must continue our commitment and our allegiance to NATO. So \nNATO is the reason that we are over in Bosnia today. Even though the \nadministration said this would be something that would cost \napproximately $1.2 billion, it has cost directly $9 billion, and \nindirectly far more than that.\n  Mr. President, it wasn't long ago that we were talking about making \nsome strikes on Iraq. We know there are problems there. We know they \nhave not kept their commitment to the United Nations. They have not \nallowed our inspection teams to see what they had agreed they should be \nable to see, and it looks like those storm clouds may be there. If that \nhappens, I don't know of one person who has a background in military \nstrategy in the Pentagon or one person in the administration who can \ntell you that you can go in there and do surgical strikes from the air \nand not end up having to send in ground troops. Where are we if we \nshould have to do that?\n  In the case of Iraq, we are talking about a theater that includes \nBosnia. We are talking about the 21st COCOM located in Germany that was \nsupposed to be offering the logistical support for any ground movement \nin any place within the theater. That would include Iraq.\n  Right now, you go over to the 21st COCOM in Germany, and you will \nfind out that we don't have the capability of supporting any other \nground operations in addition to Bosnia because they are at over 100 \npercent capacity right now trying to support Bosnia. They don't have \nthe spare parts for their equipment. They don't have the equipment. \nThey are using M-115 trucks that have 1 million miles on them. It is \nsomething that we can't afford. It is something that we can't afford in \nterms of using up our military assets and our capability. Yet we are \nnot able to support any ground operation anywhere else in the theater \nso long as we are offering that support to Bosnia. And the reason we \nare there is this allegiance that we apparently have to NATO.\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that in addition to all the other \narguments we have heard, from the cost of the operation to our \nrelationship with Russia and all the rest of them, that there is\n\n[[Page S3701]]\n\nanother very serious problem we are facing, and that is how many more \nBosnians are out there that we are going to be obligated to support as \na result of increasing our commitment to NATO.\n  Mr. President, I would like to say that if you were in a position \nwhere most Americans think we are in right now, and that is where we \nare the superpower, that we are able to defend America on two regional \nfronts, then I would say maybe we should consider doing this. But right \nnow we have a hollow force. We are in a situation very similar to what \nwe were facing in the 1970s.\n  Mr. President, I think we can no longer afford the luxury of any more \nactivities such as the Bosnian operation. I think we would be best \nserved not to extend NATO to these three countries.\n  Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues to \ndiscuss the issue of national security and the vital security interests \nto the United States and Europe, and obviously I am talking about the \nproposed expansion of NATO. To borrow a very well-known phrase, now we \nare engaged in a great debate, or at least a very good discussion, to \ndetermine and to test whether that alliance or any alliance so \nconceived and so successful in the past can meet the challenges of \ntoday.\n\n  We are in the amendment process, but I do want to offer some general \ncomments and some concerns.\n  But for NATO and the collective security of Europe and the United \nStates, the time has come. I must say that from the time of news \naccounts on old newsreels, or what we in my age can recall as the \nMovietone News or to CNN today, it has been quite a show for NATO. But \nit is time to turn off the movie projector, sweep up the popcorn, and \nturn out the lights. The old NATO show is over. Just as in that great \n1971 movie, ``The Last Picture Show,'' when the camera pans back from \nthe now-closed movie theater and pictures a deserted small, dusty town \nin Texas and tumbleweeds blowing down the street, we are not sure what \nthe future holds but we know it will be different from the past.\n  We now face the uncertainty of NATO either enlarged or with the same \n16 members. We don't know what it will be in the future, but we are \ncertain it will be different than in the past and, quite frankly, peace \nand stability in Europe and throughout the world hang in the balance.\n  The debate on the addition of three new members will soon be over and \nthe time for the vote will rapidly approach, perhaps as of this week.\n  The administration assures us that to fundamentally alter the most \nsuccessful alliance in our history is a good thing. They tell us that \nwe will be more secure with an expanded alliance, that the wrongs of \nYalta will be corrected, the candidate countries will now be free to \nfully develop as democratic and market-driven societies. We are \nguaranteed that no new dividing lines between the West and the East \nwill result from this or any kind of future enlargement, that the door \nis open to all, and that further rounds of enlargement are a certainty. \nThe administration also predicts that although the Russians are upset, \nand they are, with the enlargement of NATO they will simply ``get over \nit'' and come to understand we have their best interests in mind with \nenlargement and Russia will also be more secure.\n  Now, we get all this for the amazing value of about $1.5 billion over \nthe next 10 years. We are reassured that although the cost estimates \nhave varied from $125 billion to $1.5 billion over the next 10 years, \nNATO's sharp-penciled budgeteers certainly have it right. Much to our \nrelief, the burdensharing problems between our NATO allies that have \nplagued the alliance in the past will not be a problem now or in the \nfuture of an enlarged NATO, so the argument goes. The administration is \nconfident the United States will not have to pick up any unexpected \ncosts, although the allies have said they will refuse to pay one \nadditional mark or franc for enlargement.\n  Now, I have spent considerable time looking into each of these \ncontroversial areas surrounding the enlargement of NATO, and one of the \nmost amazing things about this debate is that in each concern for \nenlargement, the basis of the arguments, both pro and con, are \nfundamentally the same but the conclusions are the opposite.\n  Let me take a few minutes to lay out the pros and cons of NATO \nenlargement, if I might. First is the issue of cost and also \nburdensharing. Unfortunately, only time will truly show what the costs \nfor NATO enlargement will be. With such a wide variance in the \nestimates, there clearly is not a single set of assumptions to gauge \nthe true costs of enlargement. I do not know how we could. I can tell \nyou the final costs will not be $1.5 billion over a 10-year period, but \nI cannot tell you what the costs will be, and I do not think anybody \nelse can.\n  The opponents of enlargement say the $1.5 billion number is \nlaughable, and the opponents breathe a sigh of relief that the agreed-\nto number is so low that no one could suggest we cannot afford the \ncosts of enlargement. We are told the reasons for $1.5 billion being \nthe correct cost include the fact only three countries are being \ninvited as opposed to four or five, and the military infrastructure in \nthe candidate countries is in much better shape than originally \nthought.\n\n  I am a little surprised at the infrastructure point. NATO has been \ninvolved in Partnership for Peace exercises and military-to-military \ncontacts with those countries for more than a few years. We have a huge \nfacility at Taszar in Hungary at a former Soviet air base. Didn't \nanyone in NATO or the United States notice the condition of the \ninfrastructure during any of the exercises, and particularly in the \nthree candidate countries?\n  Finally, another reason the cost has been reduced is that NATO has \nshifted some of what some thought to be shared costs to the three \ncandidate countries.\n  I am concerned, regardless of the public statements by these \ncountries, that they will not be able to fund NATO enlargement or, if \nthey do, they will divert needed resources away from more important \ndomestic issues and into military spending. If they are unable to meet \ntheir fiscal obligations for enlargement, will the costs be deferred or \nwill NATO simply pick them up?\n  I might point out in terms of paying the contribution to NATO there \nare three accounts. The NATO Security Investment Program, formerly \ncalled the NATO Infrastructure Program, comes from the annual military \nconstruction appropriation. We do not have the money in that account to \npay for this. The NATO civil budget money comes from the annual State \nDepartment appropriation ``Contributions to International \nOrganizations,'' and that money is tight. The NATO military budget \ncomes from the Department of Army annual appropriation, and that \nbudget, too, is under very severe pressure.\n  Let's take up one other subject, if I might, Mr. President. What \nabout the correction of the wrongs of Yalta? The candidate countries \nare proud, developing democracies and countries wanting very badly to \nbecome a part of the West. They have already made some great strides. \nWe all understand they suffered terribly during the many years of \nSoviet domination. I applaud their efforts. I am confident they would \nbe wonderful allies, capable at some point of carrying out their NATO \nresponsibilities. I have been to Prague. I have been to Budapest. I \nhave listened to the history. I have felt the pride of their \naccomplishments. A freedom-loving person cannot experience the strength \nof their conviction without reaching out to help them attain their \nstated goals of Western integration. But understanding and empathizing \nwith their feelings and their desires are not reasons for the Senate to \nratify a change in NATO membership.\n  The only reason to enlarge NATO is if it is in our vital national \ninterest to simply do so. Proponents of enlargement do not see it that \nway. For example, General Shalikashvili in a recent Los Angeles Times \narticle said, ``Meanwhile, there are urgencies to expanding NATO. It is \nnearly 10 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the countries of \nEastern Europe--including my native land, Poland--have waited long \nenough for a place at the table where they have yearned to be for so \nlong.''\n  That is a common theme for the enlargement proponents, including the\n\n[[Page S3702]]\n\nSecretary of State. They have the right to join NATO, and that is good \nenough to alter the alliance. Others argue that enlarging NATO will \nshow the continued interest and commitment of the United States in a \nstable and secure Europe. As a matter of fact, I think the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer has made that very cogent argument.\n  It is still not clear why NATO must enlarge to demonstrate, however, \nin this Senator's opinion, U.S. resolve or commitment to Europe. There \nis no question in my mind a secure and stable Europe is in our vital \ninterest, but I fail to see the connection between an enlarged NATO and \nthat end goal.\n  It is interesting to note that Austria, a Central European country, \nis not seeking NATO membership. There is no cry of a security vacuum in \nAustria or a concern for the right to join the primer alliance, which \nis NATO. In fact, Austria took a good look at NATO and decided it was \nmore important to seek its long-term security within the European Union \nand the Partnership for Peace and the Organization for Security for \nCooperation in Europe, OSCE. This would have been the best approach, in \nthis Senator's view, for security and acceptance into the West for the \ncurrent candidate nations rather than immediate NATO membership. \nUnfortunately, that is not now an option. We have come too far. The \nadministration has planted the flag of U.S. commitment and integrity--\nno small matter.\n  Let me share with you the results of a survey published in June of \n1996 in an issue of The Economist. I am sure some will challenge these \nresults, but I think it is worth reviewing these questions asked of \ncitizens of the three candidate countries.\n  Would these countries support sending troops to defend another \ncountry? Only 26 percent of the people of Hungary, 43 percent of those \npolled in the Czech Republic, and 55 percent in Poland support sending \ntroops to defend another country. Now, considering this is the best \nthat the support will ever be, since the excitement of joining NATO \nwill soon wear off, I suggest this is not a very good commentary on the \nweak support to carry out a core requirement of NATO. And that core \nrequirement is the common defense and the commitment to send troops to \ndefend an ally.\n  Let me ask another question: Would these countries support having \nNATO troops based on their soil? In The Economist, they reported that \nonly 30 percent of the Czechs and 35 percent of the Hungarians support \nthe notion of allowing NATO troops to be stationed on their soil. \nAlthough 56 percent of the people of Poland, obviously, supported the \nidea, it is still an idea that does not have broad support in any of \nthe three of the candidate countries.\n  The next question: Would these countries support regular NATO \nexercises in their country, or regular flights over their country? Less \nthan half of any of the candidate countries supported having NATO \nexercises on their soil or even allowing flights over their country, \nand those percentages range from 26 percent to 41 percent, \nrepresenting, again, little support for the cost of simply joining the \nalliance.\n  Would these countries support spending a bigger share of their \ncountry's budget on military and social needs? The numbers in support \nfor this question are very low, and it is a crucial question. In the \nCzech Republic, 8 percent; in Hungary, 9 percent; and 23 percent in \nPoland support spending a bigger share on defense. Unfortunately, there \nwill be these costs associated with their membership in NATO. I know \nthe agriculture problems they are having in those countries. A great \ndeal of those expenses will have to be committed to the transformation \nfrom a collective farm system to a system more in keeping with the rest \nof Europe.\n  My only point in presenting these statistics is to show there are \nconcerns in the candidate countries about the commitment to NATO. I am \nafraid the survey says NATO may no longer be a ``one for all, all for \none,'' but rather it may become an ``all for me, but not for you'' \nalliance.\n  Let me say, in April of this past year the Roper Starch World Wide \npoll asked Americans the level of support for using armed forces in \ncertain situations. I hope--and I do not believe that the American \npublic has become so isolationist that they would never risk any \nAmerican life in defense of freedom. But there is a clearly \nunderstandable concern about risking American lives in what some call a \npolitical war of gradualism where there is no clear and discernible \nvital national interest.\n  Listen to this. If the U.S. were attacked, 84 percent of those polled \nsupported using force. This is in the Roper Starch World Wide poll. I \nwould like to know where the other 16 percent are.\n  If our forces stationed overseas were attacked, 50 percent supported \narmed intervention. To safeguard peacekeeping within the framework of \nthe United Nations, the support dropped to 35 percent, which explains a \ngreat deal in regards to what happened in the gulf. Finally, to stop \ninvasion of one country by another, the support fell sharply to 15 \npercent. That is why it took George Bush and Jim Baker and Dick Cheney \nand others a whole year to rally support among our allies in regards to \nthe gulf war.\n  One issue we should all be concerned about is the collective security \ncommitment that NATO makes in the post-cold-war environment, and that \ncommitment is contained in article V of the NATO charter. During the \ncold war, obviously, everybody understood that if the Soviet Union and \nthe Warsaw Pact countries attacked Western Europe, the very survival of \nthe free world was at stake and every NATO member would strike back \nwith all of their military capability. But is that still true today \nwith no threat to the survival of Europe? Would all NATO members \nautomatically strike back if another member was attacked tomorrow?\n\n  Article V can be read either way, and in fact the proponents and \nopponents argue both ways. There is a considerable amount of \ndisagreement on this topic. I believe that if a member of NATO had a \nvital national interest at risk in the country under attack, they would \nrespond with military force. If there was no threat to their vital \ninterests, I doubt they would automatically respond with the same kind \nof military force. They would respond with outrage. They might threaten \nmilitary force if the belligerents did not stop. But I am not sure if \nthey would respond militarily. I am confident, however, that the \ncandidate countries think NATO would respond to an attack on them, just \nas they would have during the cold war--that is, with all of their \nmilitary strength.\n  The construction of article V is such that both interpretations are \npossible. Some argue--and I believe they have a point--that this \nambiguity is good and may be just the right amount of deterrence in the \nminds of would-be belligerents. This is a serious issue, since it is at \nthe very heart of the commitment and success of NATO during the cold \nwar. We need to fully understand what article V means in today's \nenvironment. We just had an amendment on the floor of the Senate to try \nto spell that out.\n  The confusion over article V is only one mission concern. There is a \nmore fundamental concern: What is the mission of NATO in the post-cold-\nwar? The distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Biden, and the distinguished Senator from Oregon who \nwas just the Presiding Officer, the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, the Senator from Arizona, had a lengthy debate over this and \nconsidered the Kyl amendment. Let me share part of former Secretary of \nDefense Perry's testimony before the Armed Services Committee.\n\n       The original mission of NATO--deterring an attack from the \n     Soviet Union--is obviously no longer relevant. The original \n     geographical area of NATO's responsibility is no longer \n     sufficient. The original military structure of NATO is no \n     longer appropriate. And the way in which NATO relates to \n     Russia must be entirely different from the way it related to \n     the Soviet Union.\n\n  One would think, with that array of differences, and before the \nalliance was changed forever, that some agreed-to long-range strategy \nwould have been developed. Unfortunately, this is not the case. \nListening to the discussion on the Senate floor by my colleagues, I \nbelieve there are many possibilities for future missions of NATO. Some \nsay the Kyl amendment opened the door to more possible missions, and \nthe Senator from Arizona firmly says that he wants to go back to the \noriginal 1991 strategic concept.\n  Can anyone in the Senate say with certainty what NATO's mission is? \nCan\n\n[[Page S3703]]\n\nanyone articulate what mission, what role, against what threat we are \nrushing toward enlargement of NATO, to fundamentally alter this great \nalliance?\n  Let me say that simply to bring NATO expansion into focus, the \nPresident, it seems to me, should become engaged. In Warsaw, St. \nPetersburg, and in Bucharest, the President did address general \nEuropean security concerns. But to my way of thinking, despite all of \nthe hard work by the Secretary of State and others, he has not made a \npersonal case to the Congress or the American people.\n  As a matter of fact, in remarks during the European trip, the \nPresident said, in a post-Soviet era--I am paraphrasing here--military \nmatters are no longer primary, that terrorism, illegal drugs, national \nextremism, regional conflicts due to ethnic, racial, and religious \nhatreds do matter. I can assure you, using an expanded NATO to address \nthese concerns raises some very important questions.\n  What means would be used? Warplanes, ground forces, and naval power \nare of little use in fighting ethnic hatred and racism. If NATO \nmembership reduces the threats of ethnic rivalries, somebody should \ntell that to the Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland, the \nBasques in Spain, and the Kurds in Turkey.\n  Do we really want to change the most successful security alliance in \nhistory to a European United Nations? With 16 NATO members and 28 other \nnations inaugurating the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, it seems to \nme the protocol, rituals, and welcoming speeches will leave no time for \nany serious discussion. Exactly what force requirements are necessary \nto prevent a power vacuum? What is the strategy to ensure stability and \nsecurity in Europe?\n  NATO's leadership understands there is some confusion in this regard \nand, as I have indicated, has directed a review of its 1991 Strategic \nConcept to see if it is in line with the changed world and threats--and \nwe had a good debate on the Senate floor just earlier on this very \nmatter.\n  Now the Secretary of State wants to ``spread NATO's security from the \nMiddle East through Central Africa,'' but several of the current \nalliance members remain unconvinced of the utility of these so-called \nout-of-area operations for NATO. Again, let's quote from Dr. Perry's \nwritten statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n\n       The geographical area of NATO interests should be anywhere \n     in the world where aggression can threaten the security of \n     NATO members. . . .\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       The geographical area of NATO interests should be anywhere \n     in the world where aggression can threaten the security of \n     NATO members--certainly including all of Europe, and \n     certainly including the Persian Gulf.\n\n  That is a quote. Just think of that, even with the current membership \nand the world's global economy, what corner of this universe could not \nhold interest for NATO members? Are we considering NATO as a global \nalliance? If we are, are we to consider global membership for NATO? Is \nthis alliance to become the military arm of the United Nations? We \nshould be seriously concerned that we are changing NATO before we are \ncertain of its future mission requirements.\n  Now, the last but most frequently debated point associated with NATO \nenlargement is the impact on United States-Russian relations. Here both \nsides of the argument can list exactly the same points but come up with \nopposite results. It is a paradox of enormous irony.\n  Unfortunately, this is the one area that will have the most profound \neffect on our country in the coming decades. We must be certain of what \nwe are doing.\n  The proponents argue that Russia understands that NATO is no threat \nto them. Opponents point out that some 350 Members of the Duma, some of \nwhich we have met with in the Senate Armed Services Committee, have \nformed an anti-NATO group. Let me inform the President there is not \none--one--Member of the Duma that is pro-NATO publicly. The proponents \nsay the Russians will get over it--in time. Opponents state enlargement \nwill sour our relations with the moderate Russians. The proponents \nvigorously point out that in dealing with the Russians, we can't be \nseen as simply giving in to the ``hard-liners.'' Opponents say if we \nenlarge NATO, we will play into the hands of the ``hard-liners.''\n  Let me say, I think I know at least in part what some of the blood \npressure and the motives are in regard to expanding NATO and Russia. \nAnd I quote an article from the Washington Post from Charles \nKrauthammer, who I think is an outstanding columnist most of the time \ndue to the fact that he agrees with my prejudice. Obviously, I think he \nis a very learned columnist, but on this he tells the truth. He says \nhere that:\n\n       . . .NATO expansion nothing more than extending the borders \n     of peace; building new bridges; strengthening an alliance \n     directed against no one in particular, certainly ``not \n     arrayed against Russia. . . .\n\n  Then he tells the truth.\n\n       This is all nice and good. It is, however, rubbish. In \n     order not to offend the bear, the administration must \n     understandably pretend that NATO expansion has nothing to do \n     with Russia. Those not constrained by diplomatic niceties, \n     however, can say the obvious: NATO, an alliance founded in \n     that immortal formulation ``to keep America in, Germany down, \n     and Russia out,'' is expanding in the service of its historic \n     and continuing mission. . . .\n\n  And that is to contain Russia. We are poking the Russian bear.\n  So it goes with a host of NATO enlargement topics dealing with \nRussia-and-United States relations. Keeping or encouraging Russia \nmoving toward a complete system of democratic reforms, I submit, Mr. \nPresident, is in our vital national interest and, from a timing \nperspective, it is more important than the addition of these three \ncandidate countries.\n  These are the key issues surrounding the debate on NATO enlargement: \ncost, mission and strategy, and United States-Russia relations. \nUnfortunately, there are still many unanswered questions remaining on \nthese vital areas. I trust the Senate, with the various amendments we \nwill be considering and the very good debate that we have had, will \nanswer these concerns. The show is over, and we must address this \nenlargement of NATO on the floor now with the facts we have before us.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, in closing, \nMr. President, an article by John Lewis Gaddis, who is a professor of \nhistory at Yale University. The information was provided to me by the \ngranddaughter of Dwight David Eisenhower. Susan Eisenhower has played a \nvery important role in this debate.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the New York Times on the Web, Apr. 27, 1998]\n\n                 The Senate Should Halt NATO Expansion\n\n                         (By John Lewis Gaddis)\n\n       New Haven--The decision to expand NATO to include Poland, \n     Hungary and the Czech Republic has produced some strange \n     political alignments. There aren't many causes that Bill \n     Clinton and Jesse Helms can both support, or that Phyllis \n     Schlafly and the editors of The Nation can join in opposing.\n       Even stranger, to a historian, is the consensus that seems \n     to be shaping up within our community. Historians normally \n     don't agree on much, whether it is about the origins of the \n     Peloponnesian War or the end of the cold war. And yet I've \n     had difficulty finding any colleagues who think NATO \n     expansion is a good idea. Indeed, I can recall no other \n     moment when there was less support in our profession for a \n     government policy.\n       A striking gap has opened, therefore, between those who \n     make grand strategy and those who reflect on it. On this \n     issue, at least, official and accumulated wisdom are pointing \n     in very different directions.\n       This has happened, I think, because the Clinton \n     Administration has failed to answer a few simple questions:\n       Why exclude the Russians? One of the few propositions on \n     which historians tend to agree is that peace settlements work \n     best when they include rather than exclude former \n     adversaries. Within three years after the defeat of Napoleon \n     in 1815, the victors had brought France back within the \n     concert of Europe. Within six years of their surrender in \n     1945, Germany and Japan were firmly within American-designed \n     security alliances. Both settlements survived for decades. \n     The post-World War I settlement, however, excluded Germany. \n     The lessons of history on this point seem obvious.\n       Who, then, will we include? The Administration has made it \n     clear that expansion will not stop with Poland, Hungary and \n     the Czech Republic. It has mentioned the Baltics and Romania \n     as possible future members. The State Department's Web site \n     claims support for NATO expansion from groups like the \n     Belorussian Congress Committee of America, the Ukrainian \n     National Association and the Armenian Assembly of America.\n\n[[Page S3704]]\n\n       The State Department assures us, though, that the Russians \n     view this process with equanimity and that we can expect \n     relations with Moscow to proceed normally while we sort out \n     just who the new members of NATO will be. Perhaps it will \n     next try to tell us that pigs can fly.\n       What will expansion cost? The Administration's estimate for \n     including Poland, Hungary and the Cezch Republic comes to \n     only $1.5 billion over the next 10 years, of which the United \n     States would pay $400 million. That sounds like a bargain, \n     but the estimate assumes no change in the current security \n     environment. Has it occurred to the Administration that the \n     act of expanding NATO, especially if former Soviet states are \n     included, could itself alter the current security \n     environment? It doesn't take a rocket scientist--or even a \n     historian--to figure out that actions have consequences.\n       What's the objective? Alliances are means to ends, not ends \n     in themselves. NATO served brilliantly as a means of \n     containing the Soviet Union, but the Administration has \n     specified no comparably clear goal that would justify \n     expanding the alliance now that the cold war is over. It \n     speaks vaguely of the need for democratization and \n     stabilization, but if these objectives inform its policy, \n     shouldn't they apply throughout Eastern Europe and in Russia \n     as well?\n       I heard a very different explanation from influential \n     government and academic figures when I visited one of the \n     proposed new member countries last month. NATO expansion, \n     they boasted, will demonstrate once and for all that the \n     Russians never have been and never will be part of European \n     civilization. Yet Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has \n     told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that she wants to \n     erase ``the line that once so cruelly and arbitrarily divided \n     Europe.'' It is not at all clear how this policy will produce \n     that result.\n       Isn't it too late now to change course? Some argue that eve \n     if the decision to expand NATO wasn't the most thoughtful, \n     historically aware way to make policy, the decision has been \n     made and going back on it would be a disaster far greater \n     than the problems NATO expansion itself will bring. This \n     sounds a little like the refusal of the Titanic's captain to \n     cut his ship's speed when told there were icebergs ahead. \n     Consistency is a fine idea most of the time, but there are \n     moments when it's just plain irresponsible.\n       Only future historians will be able to say whether this is \n     such a moment. But the mood of current historians should not \n     give the Administration--or those senators who plan to vote \n     this week for NATO expansion--very much comfort.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I simply close in quoting the last two \nparagraphs:\n\n       Isn't it too late now to change course? Some argue that \n     even if the decision to expand NATO wasn't the most \n     thoughtful, historically aware way to make policy, that the \n     decision has been made and going back on it would be a \n     disaster far greater than the problems NATO expansion itself \n     will bring.\n\n  That is a good argument. As a matter of fact, I think that may be a \npersuasive argument. I have listed a lot of concerns that I have. I \nthink the adjectives and adverbs that I have used and the language I \nhave used would indicate, if somebody is watching, ``Well, Senator \nRoberts, he is going to vote no.'' I am undecided.\n  Again, what the professor has indicated that ``the decision has been \nmade and going back on it would be a disaster far greater than the \nproblems NATO expansion itself will bring.\n  Then he goes on to say this:\n\n       This sounds a little like the refusal of the Titanic's \n     captain to cut his ship's speed when told there were icebergs \n     ahead. Consistency is a fine idea most of the time, but there \n     are moments when it's just plain irresponsible.\n\n  That is the other view.\n\n       Only future historians will be able to say whether this is \n     such a moment.\n\n  Professor Gaddis goes on to say:\n\n       . . .But the mood of current historians should not give the \n     Administration--or those senators who plan to vote this week \n     for NATO expansion--very much comfort.\n\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and I thank the indulgence of my \ncolleague from Illinois. I apologize to him for going on a little bit \nlonger than I told him, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleague from \nKansas for his remarks. It is always a great education to listen to his \nstatements on the floor. Though we may not agree on any particulars, I \ncertainly do respect him very much and have enjoyed our service \ntogether both in the House and the Senate.\n  I stand this morning not to give a long speech, even by Senate \nstandards, but I would like to say I hope all Members of the Senate \nwill put this debate into its historical context. This may be one of \nthe most important foreign policy debates of the decade. It is to \ndetermine the future of the U.S. relationship with a new Europe, a \nEurope after the cold war.\n  Since 1949, the United States understood, particularly through the \nNATO alliance, our relationship with Europe. We defined that \nrelationship in specific terms and committed not only the United States \non paper but, in fact, at one point stationed some 300,000 Americans in \nEurope, in an effort to make certain that that sector of the world will \ncontinue to be safe from any type of aggression or invasion.\n  When I think back on my own life and all of the concerns of the cold \nwar, it focused primarily on the possibility that the Soviet Union \nmight expand through some manner through its Warsaw Pact nations into \nthe a NATO alliance and force us to respond. It was a concern that cost \nus lives, it cost us money, and it really was the focus of our foreign \npolicy for many, many decades.\n  With the tearing down of the Berlin Wall, the end of the Soviet \nUnion, as we knew it, and the emergence of countries in Eastern and \nCentral Europe, formerly part of the Soviet orbit, we now are in a \nposition to redefine the U.S. position in the world. There are some \npeople who naturally tend toward the American tradition of \nisolationism. We are pretty far away from these countries. ``Perhaps we \nshouldn't be concerned about them,'' they will say. ``Let them worry \nabout their own future, we have our own concerns here.'' But, we have \nheard that response many times in our past, and the Americans, by and \nlarge, have rejected it. We understand we are part of the world \ncommunity. In fact, we are viewed by most nations of the world as a \nmajor leader, an example, in many instances, of democracy and a country \nwhich most nations choose to emulate.\n  I found it interesting, when the wall came down in Berlin and the \nEastern and Central European countries started emerging as democracies, \nhow many of the new leaders made a point of coming not to London, not \nto Paris, but to Washington, DC, in the hopes that they might address a \njoint meeting of Congress. To them, it was a validation that the new \nCzech Republic and the new Poland was going to embark on a democratic \nexperiment, and coming here to this building in Washington, DC, was \nreally shown to be a break from the past; that they would separate \nthemselves from the past and their connection with the Eastern powers, \nwith communism, with the old Soviet Union, and dedicate themselves to \ndemocracy.\n  Now we have the natural evolution of their emergence as democracies \nand our natural evolution as a leader in today's world. We are debating \non the floor of the Senate the question of enlarging the NATO alliance \nto include newcomers, to include nations which just a few years ago \nwere perceived as potential enemies and now we see as allies. What a \nrefreshing change in this world that a nation like Poland, which we \nidentify with certainty in my home State of Illinois and the city of \nChicago very closely, that a nation like Poland now has a chance to \njoin us as close allies.\n  I listened carefully as some of my colleagues talked about the \nattitudes in these nations about the possibility of NATO membership. \nMake no mistake, if you visit these countries, that is all they talk \nabout--the possibility that at some point in time, they will be part of \nthe NATO alliance.\n  This is an exciting prospect for them, not so much because they \nanticipate some military invasion or the need for military defense, but \nrather because they see this alliance with the United States and with \nother NATO allies as an assurance that they are committed to many \nthings, to democracy, to a free market and, most importantly, to the \nprinciples of NATO.\n  It is interesting, this alliance, in our world's history, is a unique \none because for 50 years this was not an aggressive alliance, this was \na defensive alliance. We basically said we respect others' boundaries \nas we expect them to respect ours and we are not setting out to invade \nand claim territory but merely to protect our own. It was a defensive \nalliance. It has been throughout history. And that is its future as \nwell.\n\n[[Page S3705]]\n\n  As other countries come in--Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic--they \naccept the premise. The premise is, you are on board as an alliance to \nprotect our borders and to try our best to maintain stability in this \nnew and developing world. I think that is the bottom line here. It is \nno longer a fight against ideology or even the aggression of some \nsuperpower but rather the stability of the region.\n  Is that stability important to the United States? I think it is \ncritical to the United States. In just a few months we are going to see \nthe creation of the Eurodollar, or the Eurocurrency, which is going to \nbe perhaps one of the more dominant currencies in the world. We will \nsee the European nations by and large coming together as an economic \nunit as a major competitor to the United States, and at the same time \nwe will see opportunities in Europe for American firms.\n  If we are going to engender this relationship, this free market \neconomy and this new democracy, it is entirely consistent for us to \nbuild an alliance with these countries through NATO.\n  I hear some of my colleagues arguing against the expansion of NATO, \nand as I listened carefully, they are actually arguing against the \nexistence of NATO. I hope they are not. To pause on reflection, it has \nbeen one of the most successful military alliances in our Nation's \nhistory, perhaps in the history of the world. And it is important for \nus to maintain NATO and to expand it.\n  I watched carefully the amendment offered by the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. Kyl, just an hour or two ago. I read it carefully, and I \nthought, does this amendment, which seeks to spell out the parameters \nof the expansion of NATO, in any way preclude the possibility that one \nday Russia would join NATO? Well, it does not, because it speaks in \nterms of principles and goals and values.\n  I think when we talk about the nervousness in Russia about the \nexpansion of NATO, we should put it in historical context. The Russians \nhave gone through a major transformation in a very short period of \ntime. Once considered a superpower and a major leader in the world, \nthey are now struggling to redefine themselves in the 21st century.\n  I know this causes angst and pain among many Russian leaders who can \nrecall, I am sure with fondness, days of empire. But the fact is, it is \na new world and a new opportunity, and they have a chance for a new \nrelationship. A new and expanded NATO is no threat to Russia. A new and \nexpanded NATO is an invitation to Russia to join us in the same \nprinciples and values. I think that should be our view, our vision of \nthe new world.\n  When I hear about this Russian concern and nervousness, I really hope \nthey will take the time to consider the history of this alliance, which \nhas been a peaceful alliance, a defensive alliance.\n\n  Let me speak for a moment before I close about the Baltic States. I \nalways confess my prejudice when I come to this issue. My mother was \nborn in Lithuania. So when I speak of the Baltic States, it is with \nsome particular personal feeling. I have visited Lithuania on four our \nfive different occasions and have also visited Latvia and Estonia.\n  I did not believe in my lifetime that I would see the changes that \nhave taken place in those three tiny countries. When I first visited \nLithuania back in 1978 or 1979, it was under Soviet domination, and it \nwas a rather sad period in the history of that country. The United \nStates said for decades that we never recognized the Soviet takeover of \nthe Baltic States. We always believed them to be independent nations \nthat were unfortunately invaded and taken over by the Soviets.\n  When I went to visit them in 1979, I saw the efforts of the Soviet \nUnion to impose upon the people in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia the \nRussian culture. They expatriated so many of the local people and sent \nthem off to Siberia and places in the far reaches of Russia; and then \nthey sent their own populations, the Russian cultural population, those \nspeaking the Russian language, into the Baltic States in an effort to \ntry to homogenize them into some entity that was more Russian than it \nwas Baltic.\n  But it did not work. The people maintained--zealously maintained--\ntheir own culture, and they kept their own religion, their own \nlanguage, and their own literature and their own dreams. I did not \nimagine in my lifetime that I would ever see these Baltic States once \nagain free, and yet I lived to see that happen.\n  In fact, at one point I was sent as a member of a delegation by then-\nSpeaker of the House Tom Foley to witness the first democratic election \nin Lithuania. The Soviets refused to give me a visa. I sat in Berlin \nday after weary day waiting for a chance to get in. And finally I was \nonly able to be there the day of the election, that evening for the \ncelebration. But I was there for an important moment, and I am glad I \nsaw it.\n  Today these three nations are trying their best to become mature \neconomies, to watch their democracies flourish. And they have ample \nevidence of real progress. The fact that they would entertain the \npossibility of being part of NATO should not be a source of concern to \nus but one of great hope and great optimism, because as countries like \nLithuania, Latvia and Estonia, and so many others that were either part \nof the Warsaw Pact or even Soviet republics become part of NATO, they \nreally show this transformation and this progression into a democratic \nform and a new democratic vision in Europe.\n  One of the resolutions being offered by one of my colleagues wants to \nsingle out the Baltic States as if they are the real concern of Russia. \nIf you took a look at a map of the world and saw the huge expanse of \nRussia today, and then took a look at these three tiny nations, \nEstonia, Latvia and Lithuania, it is almost laughable that the Russians \nwould look to them as any threat to their future or to their security. \nThey are small nations with very small armies and virtually no \nsophisticated military forces. What they are asking for is a chance to \nflourish, and I think they should have that chance.\n  So I close by saying that I hope my colleagues in the Senate who have \nfollowed this debate will understand its historic importance and \nunderstand that those of us who are privileged to serve in the Senate \nand have a chance to vote on this question of NATO enlargement may be \ncasting a vote on foreign policy that is going to be viewed for \ngenerations to come as a milestone--the end of the cold war, the new \nvision of the world, the new definition of an alliance involving the \nUnited States and freedom-loving democracies in Europe that led to \nstability and to growth. That is my vision of the world. That is my \nvision of NATO enlargement.\n  I hope that a majority of my colleagues will join me in supporting \nPresident Clinton and supporting virtually all of these nations that \nare asking for NATO to be enlarged to reflect this new vision.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I rise to express my intention to vote for the admission \nof the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland to the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization.\n  In taking up this decision, the Senate takes up one of its basic \nconstitutional mandates. A nation's most sacred obligation is to \nprotect its citizens and its territory from hostile forces. The NATO \nalliance has been the cornerstone of our efforts to do so on behalf of \nfree citizens for nearly 50 years. It has emerged as the most \nsuccessful enterprise of common defense in human history. Any changes \nin the membership of the Alliance that we contemplate must undergo \ncareful consideration.\n  I have done so and am confident that this enlargement is in our \nnational security interests and will ensure that NATO continues to do \nin the 21st century what it has done in the latter half of the 20th for \nthe United States, and the people of Europe--guarantee their security, \nfreedom and democratic forms of government.\n\n[[Page S3706]]\n\n  Mr. President, last year, I was asked by the Senate Majority Leader \nand the Senate Democratic Leader to join a bipartisan group of 28 \nSenators to study the issues associated with NATO enlargement. I was \nhonored to join in such a task. The NATO alliance has been for nearly \n50 years the greatest force for maintaining peace and security in the \nworld. When it was funded, the United States had just emerged from \nfighting the most destructive war in history on the European continent \nand was just beginning to lead the fight against imperial Soviet \ncommunism--a Cold War against a totalitarian foe who was committed to \nimposing another form of tyranny first in Europe and then around the \nworld.\n  The nations of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Poland, therefore, faced \nthe bitter prospect of exchanging one form of tyranny for another. I \nknew that if NATO was to continue to protect freedom and democracy in \nEurope, it needed to face the changing circumstances posed by the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact and communist ideology. \nThe Alliance had to change in form to preserve the principles that it \nhad safeguarded in modern times.\n  Today, the United States and the other 15 members of the Alliance \nhope to move the frontiers of NATO eastward at a time when there is not \na visible threat to the security of any of its members. When the \nAlliance expanded between the 1950s and the 1980s to add Greece, \nTurkey, West Germany and Spain, the grim shadow of Soviet power menaced \nEurope and the West.\n  I believe that the parallels with the decision to expand NATO in the \n1990s are in some ways similar to those which existed at the end of \nWorld War II. At that time, the strategic security situation on the \ncontinent of Europe was also in flux. The threat from Nazi Germany had \ncollapsed, but no protective machinery had yet been set up to prevent \nthe emergence of a new tyranny. As the great statesman Winston \nChurchill noted, ``From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the \nAdriatic, an iron curtain has descended upon the continent [of \nEurope].''\n  Unlike the era beginning at the end of World War I, when we \nretreated from victory to a fateful isolationism, the United States \nrealized that our own security depended upon the building and \nmaintenance of a free and democratic Europe.\n\n  President Harry Truman, with the able leadership of Senator Arthur \nVandenberg, began the shaping of what became known as the \n``containment'' policy. The United States and its friends in Europe \nwould resist the westward march of communism. Harry Truman and his \ngeneration were determined to block the Soviet Union from leveraging \nthe political fate of a continent that had drawn millions of Americans \ninto war by ensuring that its expansion not go any further.\n  At first it was thought that economic assistance to Europe was \nsufficient. The Marshall Plan, named for the then Secretary of State \nGeorge Marshall, was first articulated in 1947 and approved by the \nCongress in 1948. Just as today some believe that membership in the \nEuropean Union is enough to ensure the security of Poland, Hungary and \nthe Czech Republic, it was hoped in the 1940s that economic aid alone \nwould suffice in strengthening Europe to resist the designs of the \nSoviet Union. However, that was not to be the case. Both the Communist \ncoup in Czechoslovakia, and the 1948 Berlin blockade, convinced the \nUnited States that more than economic aid was needed to protect freedom \nand democracy in the Western world.\n  As a result, on April 4, 1949, the United States and eleven nations \nof Western Europe signed the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington. NATO \nwas born, and for the first time in history, a military alliance was \ncreated for the sole purpose of defending freedom and democracy. And \nwithout firing one shot in 40 years, it gave ready firepower to the \npolicy of containing Communism until that system collapsed under its \nown contradictions.\n  Our commitment to security in the North Atlantic Treaty is spelled \nout in Article V. The words ``an armed attack against one or more of \nthem in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against \nthem all'' signify the commitment of this country to forego \nisolationism and to play a critical role in helping to guarantee \nfreedom and security in Europe.\n  Today of course, there is no immediate threat to the security of \nWestern Europe. The United States and the other 15 members of NATO face \nan incipient Russian democracy. Communism as a system and a power has \nreceded from the tormented heart of Europe. The mighty Red Army of the \n1940s is now a force that is in military decline. Today, we live in a \ndifferent world--but not one without dangers or threats. Today, we face \nour own set of challenges--and we must create our own set of solutions.\n\n  The end of the Cold War has not meant that freedom has suddenly \nbecome free-of-charge. While the Soviet Union has disintegrated and the \nthreat of invasion from a much weaker Russia has receded, this \ndevelopment by no means signals that NATO's mission has evaporated. To \nthe contrary, just as NATO protected and guaranteed the freedom of the \nUnited States and Western Europe during the latter half of the \ntwentieth century, it can, and must, continue to do so for all of \nEurope as we prepare to enter the new millennium.\n  For forty years, NATO could protect only the Western half of Europe--\nthe other half was trapped behind the Iron Curtain of communism. With \nthe collapse of the Soviet Union, three of those nations--the Czech \nRepublic, Hungary and Poland are now poised to enjoy the freedoms that \nthe totalitarians so long withheld and to take fresh responsibility for \ntheir political pluralism as members of a voluntary alliance.\n  I know that some of my colleagues in this chamber, whose opinions I \nrespect, assert that it is more important for Poland, Hungary and the \nCzech Republic to achieve membership in the European Union and to enjoy \nthe economic benefits that it offers as a prelude to joining NATO. This \nproposal brings the echoes of history to the Senate if we recall that \nsome advocates of the Marshall Plan thought economic health was \nsufficient for the protection of freedom and democracy. Unfortunately, \nit was not true then, and it is not true today.\n  The European Union is not a substitute for the NATO alliance. If that \nwere the case, then the nations of Western Europe would not need the \nbenefits of NATO membership to ensure their security. They realize that \nthe two entities each serve their purpose and reinforce rather than \nsubstitute for each other. The European Union is an economic entity \nthat will shepherd the prosperity of Europe well into the next century. \nI have little doubt that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will \neventually become members. However, membership will only be part of the \nway they help fulfill their desire--for the first time in over fifty \nyears--to determine for themselves how they will ensure their security.\n  NATO was and is more than a defensive military alliance. It reflects \nthe civic values underpinning trans-Atlantic security through the \ncultivation of peaceful ties among governments that rest on the consent \nof the governed. It is a tangible symbol of the resolve of democratic \nnations, united in a common purpose, to promote freedom and democracy. \nWhile the threat in the Cold War was from a large conventional army led \nby the Soviet Union that could sweep across Germany, today the threat \nis far more subtle but just as real. Today we all face threats from \nterrorism, weapons of mass destruction in the hands of rogue states and \nnationalistic passions liberated from Cold War restraints. The Gulf War \nshowed that the United States and the European members of NATO face \nthreats far from their borders. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic \nmust deal with these same threats, and they can overcome them as \nmembers of the NATO alliance.\n  Already, we have seen a preview of some of the potential \nsecurity benefits of having these nations--all of which are now strong \ndemocracies that have worked to strengthen civilian control of the \nmilitary--as NATO members:\n\n  All three have contributed to the success of the SFOR mission in \nBosnia. Hungary's base at Taszar has been host to over 95,000 U.S. \nmilitary personnel rotating in and out of IFOR and SFOR duty. And if \nthere had been a need to fight Iraq, our new NATO members would have \nbeen ready to assist. Poland has chemical weapons experts\n\n[[Page S3707]]\n\nready to support us if necessary. The Czech Republic would also supply \nchemical weapons experts. Hungary's Foreign Minister would have urged \nhis nation's parliament to open its airspace and airports to U.S. \naircraft if military action had been needed.\n  The spur to all of these actions was prospective membership in NATO, \nand the assumption of a fair share of responsibilities as full fledged \nmembers of the Western community. This enthusiasm should make us \nrealize how important NATO is and how established members often take \nthe Alliance and its benefits for granted.\n  It would be unjust to deny the Poles, Hungarians and Czechs a role in \nsafeguarding the freedom of the European-American community--a freedom, \nincidentally, we rhetorically upheld for these nations over the past \nfour decades. It would be morally wrong to create an artificial \ndividing line in Europe just a decade after another such line was \nerased.\n  Mr. President, what would happen if the Senate were to reject NATO \nexpansion? I believe that we would signal the willingness of the West \nto confuse the tranquility of today with the potential turmoil of \ntomorrow for which history warns us to prepare. If we reject expansion \nnow, we would also reject the enduring link, shown by our experience in \nNATO, between democratic institutions and the defense of peace.\n  The incentive of NATO membership has furthermore stabilized \ndemocratic forces in all three candidate nations. Poland instituted \ncivilian control of the military and formed a joint battalion with the \nDanes and Germans. Hungary and Romania, the latter a possible future \nmember of NATO, signed a treaty respecting the rights of the Hungarian \nminority in Romania. If NATO membership did not provide the framework \nfor these actions, the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians could still be \nstruggling with the social and military legacies of authoritarianism.\n  Mr. President, if we were to reject the logical first step of NATO \nmembership for these three states, then the progress made by these \nnations might be reversed. All three nations could and would be \nentitled to feel that NATO and the West do not care about them. We in \nthe Senate would be sending a message that while the United States and \nWestern Europe are entitled to the benefits of freedom and the \nconfidence that a military alliance will sustain them that NATO is an \nexclusive club which will not admit those willing to make it even \nbetter. All three nations might then form another military bloc.\n  Such an organization might turn inward or Eastward to make security \narrangements without the participation of the West. But I would rather \nsee Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic work within the NATO \nalliance to address the concerns of the Baltic states and other \nregional parties.\n  Another aspect of this issue which has concerned me and I know, many \nSenators, is the cost of this expansion. It is a legitimate concern. \nThe General Accounting Office produced a report just last month \nconcluding that the Defense Department's assessment of the NATO cost of \nexpansion was reasonable if the current environment of a diminished \nmilitary threat to the continent will continue for years into the \nfuture. New members, in turn, will sustain their own internal budgets \nfor critical defense modernization. It is also up to them to meet their \nformal treaty commitments to the commonly-funded budgets of the \nAlliance.\n\n  The governments of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have \nagreed to specific 10-year obligations on payments for the integration \nof military systems and command structures with existing Alliance \nmembers. I commend our prospective new partners and the Defense \nDepartment for developing this blueprint for enlargement. They must \nalso expect that NATO as well as Congress will hold them accountable \nfor it.\n  Mr. President, Secretary Albright summed it up well last year when \nshe said: ``Let us not deceive ourselves. The United States is a \nEuropean power.'' We fought two world wars because much of Western \nEurope was threatened, invaded and occupied. The Cold War was fought \nbecause some of these nations were again threatened and others forced \nto endure Communist tyranny.\n  The enlargement of NATO will mean that more of Europe is part of an \nalliance designed to protect freedom and democracy. That makes conflict \nand the defense of our security interests much greater.\n  NATO will be stronger with the addition of more territory and more \narmed forces--200,000 in fact--a valuable addition if we account for \nthe reductions in Western military forces since the end of the Cold \nWar. Peace through strength may be a slogan to the cynics, but to me, \nit summarizes the invaluable lesson that we learned on the post-war \nashes of a Europe leveled by aggression.\n  One of the Senate's most illustrious members, Senator Arthur \nVandenberg, said at the time of NATO's founding in 1949 that ``[NATO] \nis not built to stop a war after it starts . . . It is built to stop \nwars before they start.''\n  The admission of these three applicants will strengthen NATO's \nability to prevent war. I cannot imagine that the United States and the \nother members of NATO would do nothing if the territorial integrity of \nPoland, Hungary and the Czech Republic were threatened--even if they \nwere not a part of NATO. But by having them become members, we would \nbring into the democratic family a region that has hosted the century's \nbloodiest conflicts.\n  Furthermore, by formally extending NATO's territorial jurisdiction \nfurther east, the Alliance will be even better placed to prevent any \nsecurity threat to all of its members. NATO's role has evolved from \ndeterring an invasion of the West by the Soviet Union to preventing \narmed conflict on the continent of Europe, and admission of Poland, \nHungary and the Czech Republic will augment this shift in mission.\n  Others will argue that NATO expansion will cause problems in \nrelations with Russia; that expansion undercuts efforts to build \ndemocracy in Russia; that we are still treating Russia as a Cold War \nadversary, instead of a nation building a democracy and a free-market \neconomy or that expansion will anger Russia at a time when we need to \nwork together on issues such as Iraq and the danger of weapons \nproliferation. Mr. President, I do not agree with these arguments.\n  Even if NATO had never promised to expand, the United States and \nRussia would continue to have international policy differences. There \nis also no evidence that the prospect of NATO expansion has hurt \nefforts to ratify arms control treaties or to address concerns over the \nneed to control nuclear weapons of all varieties.\n  I also do not believe that enlargement will harm efforts to build a \nsecure and strong democracy across the 11 time zones of Russia. The \nstability an enlarged NATO will bring to Eastern Europe will provide a \nmore secure environment in which democracy's roots can grow stronger. \nNATO is furthermore not building a military force which can threaten \nRussia, as demonstrated by its intention not to station either nuclear \nweapons or substantial forces in the territories of the new members.\n  Finally, the United States and NATO have worked hard to address \nRussian concerns over expansion through the Founding Act and the \ncreation of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council. The Permanent \nJoint Council allows NATO and Russia to talk directly about ways to \npromote and enhance Europe's security. It offers a means to discuss \nmatters of concern to either or both parties. If Russia chooses to work \nwith the Permanent Joint Council in a cooperative manner, then this \nCouncil can help take NATO-Russia relations to a level of cooperation \nthat benefits all of Europe. The Permanent Joint Council, however, will \nnever substitute for or supersede any NATO policy making organs. Russia \ndoes not have a veto over NATO actions and must never be allowed to \nobtain one.\n  It is not possible for NATO to remain static and at the same time \neffective in the post-Cold War environment of Europe. NATO is, and must \nremain a military alliance that will guarantee the security of its \nmembers. However, it does face a different set of challenges as the \n21st century approaches. Because the threat to NATO's territorial \nintegrity today is significantly diminished, the Alliance has the \nopportunity to vanquish the dangers posed by unbridled nationalism and \ngreat power policies and to replace them with free-\n\n[[Page S3708]]\n\nmarket democracies that can grow and prosper.\n  Mr. President, when Secretary of State Madeleine Albright testified \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee, she quoted an individual who \nappreciates what freedom means and that is not to be taken for granted. \nCzech President Vaclav Havel stated that ``Even the costliest \npreventive security is cheaper than the cheapest war.''\n  By admitting the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland, NATO will be \ntaking a giant step toward insuring that the freedoms won by Eastern \nand Central Europe at the end of this century will survive and prosper \nin the next. By expanding NATO, the West will ensure that the freedoms \nit preserved through the darkest days of World War II and the Communist \nthreat of the 20th century will survive and prosper through the \nmillennium.\n  In conclusion, NATO enlargement will enhance our national security \nand the stability of Europe. As my former Senate colleague and current \nDefense Secretary Bill Cohen stated, ``a stable Europe is necessary to \nanchor America's worldwide presence.''\n  The addition of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to NATO will \nmean a stronger NATO, and our approval of this enlargement will show \nthat the United States is ready to do so in the 21st Century what it \ndid for the latter half of this one: be a force, with other \ndemocracies, for the protection of freedom today and for the \ngenerations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/28/senate-section/article/S3687-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE.

Mr. President, as April draws to a close this week I want \nto remind my colleagues of Alcohol Awareness Month. I think the \ntireless efforts of many types of groups have raised our awareness \nabout alcohol consumption. This includes efforts made by federal and \nstate governments, citizen action groups, and the beverage alcohol \nindustry itself. More than ever, Americans deplore the devastation of \ndrunk driving. More than ever, Americans understand the consequences of \nfailing to deal responsibly with alcoholic beverages.\n  Americans also need to understand that alcohol is alcohol. A standard \nserving of beer, wine, and distilled spirits contain the same amount of \nalcohol. Some fear that teaching alcohol equivalence would be paramount \nto promoting alcohol consumption. But I think it can actually have the \nopposite effect, promoting a rational approach to this topic and \nencouraging moderation The U.S. Departments of Health and Human \nServices, Transportation, Agriculture, and Education, as well as the \nDietary Guidelines for Americans all define a drink as 12 ounces of \nbeer, 5 ounces of wine, and 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits. And the \nfederal government is not alone is recognizing alcohol equivalence. \nMany leading organizations involved in this debate do as well.\n  Yet as recently as 1996, one survey found that only 39% of Americans \nunderstand that a 12 ounce can of beer, a 5 ounce glass of wine, and a \nmixed drink with 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits contain the same \namount of alcohol. We owe it to Americans to do a better job of \ndisseminating this information and providing basic facts on this topic. \nIn recognition of Alcohol Awareness Month, it is the very least we can \ndo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/28/senate-section/article/S3708-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WE THE PEOPLE--THE CITIZEN AND THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, on May 2-4, while their friends are \ncelebrating the 124th running of the Kentucky Derby, some students from \nmy home state will be answering questions about the Constitution, here \nin Washington, in a mock Congressional hearing. These students will be \ncompeting in the national finals of the We the People . . . The Citizen \nand the Constitution program. I am proud to announce that the class \nfrom Louisville Male High School will represent Kentucky. These young \npeople have worked long and hard to reach the national finals, winning \nlocal competitions to get here.\n  I would like to recognize these students for their achievements. The \nmembers of this class representing Kentucky are Angela Adams, Perry \nBacon, Katherine Breeding, Will Carle, Eric Coatley, Courtney Coffee, \nBrian Davis, Mary Fleming, Matt Gilbert, Amanda Holloway, Holly Jessie, \nHeath Lambert, Gwen Malone, Kristy Martin, Brian Palmer, Lauren \nReynolds, Shane Skoner, LaVonda Willis, Bryan Wilson, Darreisha Wilson, \nBeth Wilson, Janelle Winfree, Treva Winlock, and Jodie Zeller.\n  I would also like to recognize their teacher, Mrs. Sandy Hoover, who \nclearly deserves a lot of the credit for the class' success. The \ndistrict coordinator, Dianne Meredith, and the state coordinators, \nDeborah Williamson and Jennifer Van Hoose, also contributed their time \nand effort to help the class reach the national finals.\n  The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is \nthe most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The three-day national competition simulates a \ncongressional hearing. Students are given the opportunity to \ndemonstrate their knowledge while they evaluate, take, and defend \npositions on relevant historical and contemporary constitutional \nissues. The simulated congressional hearing consists of oral \npresentation by the students before panels of adult judges.\n  The We the People . . . program is run by the Center for Civic \nEducation. The program has provided teaching materials to upper \nelementary, middle, and high schools for more than 75,000 teachers and \n24 million students across the nation. Members of Congress and staff \nalso contribute by discussing current constitutional issues with \nprogram participants.\n  This special program is designed to help students understand and \nappreciate the values and principles that unite us as Americans. The \nprogram also promotes the notion of citizenship--that the rights and \nbenefits are tempered by the responsibilities of participation in \neffective government.\n  I wish these young people the best of luck testing their \nconstitutional knowledge in the upcoming national finals of the We the \nPeople . . . program. I also congratulate them on reaching this level \nof competition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/28/senate-section/article/S3708-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, in one of the most outrageous, cold-blooded \nkillings I can recall in a region where such despicable acts have been \ncommonplace, Guatemalan Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi was murdered this past \nSunday when his assailant crushed his skull with a cement block.\n  The way he died is horrifying enough. But what senators should also \nbe aware of is that Bishop Gerardi had just completed an \nextraordinarily courageous investigation of the thousands of atrocities \ncommitted against Guatemala\n\n[[Page S3709]]\n\ncitizens during thirty years of civil war. He undertook his inquiry \nafter it became clear that the Guatemalan Clarification Commission \nwould not seek to identify those responsible for even the worst \natrocities. Bishop Gerardi's investigation, not surprisingly, \nattributed the overwhelming majority of human rights violations to the \nmilitary and the death squads and paramilitary groups allied with them.\n  Mr. President, the United States bears more than a little \nresponsibility for the slaughter in Guatemala that devastated that \ncountry in the years after the CIA-backed coup of 1954. Our government \ntrained the Guatemalan armed forces, remained silent when they tortured \nand killed thousands of innocent people, withheld information about the \natrocities, and justified our complicity as the necessary response to a \nguerrilla insurgency. In fact, during this period of political violence \nwhich is apparently not yet over, the principal victims were \nGuatemala's Mayan population of rural peasants who have been the target \nof discrimination and injustice for generations.\n  According to a statement by the Guatemalan Embassy, the Guatemalan \nGovernment ``condemns and repudiates'' this crime and has opened an \ninvestigation. Let us hope that this investigation can withstand the \ninevitable pressure from the forces who would intimidate anyone who \nseeks real justice in Guatemala. The Arzu Government deserves \nconsiderable credit for bringing the peace negotiations to a successful \nconclusion. But few weeks pass that I do not receive a report of a \npolitical crime in Guatemala, most of which go unsolved. Justice \nremains elusive for those who need it most.\n  How the Guatemalan government handles this investigation will either \nembolden or deter those who seek to undermine the peace accords, and, \nas the Ranking Member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee I can say \nthat as far as I am concerned it will also be important in determining \nour future assistance relationship with Guatemala.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/28/senate-section/article/S3708-5", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      Executive Messages Referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Office laid before the Senate \nmessage from the President of the United States submitting one treaty \nand sundry nominations which were referred to Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/28/senate-section/article/S3709-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:40 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to the \nprovisions of 22 U.S.C. 276h, the Speaker appoints the following \nMembers of the House to the Mexico-United States Interparliamentary \nGroup: Mr. Kolbe, Chairman and Mr. Gilman, Vice Chairman.\n  The message also announced that pursuant to the provision of 22 \nU.S.C. 276h, the Speaker appoints the following Member of the House to \nthe Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group: Mr. Houghton, \nChairman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/28/senate-section/article/S3709-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3709]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n             Jeffords, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Harkin, Ms. \n             Snowe, Mr. Reed, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. \n             Levin, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Specter):\n       S. 1993.

Mr. President, America's home health agencies provide \ninvaluable services that have enabled a growing number of our most \nfrail and vulnerable senior citizens to avoid hospitals and nursing \nhomes and stay just where they want to be--in their own homes. Today, \nhome health is the fastest growing component of Medicare spending, and \nthe program grew at an astounding average annual rate of more than 25 \npercent from 1990 to 1997. As a consequence, the number of Medicare \nhome health beneficiaries has more than doubled, and Medicare home \nhealth spending has soared from $2.7 billion in 1989 to $17.1 billion \nin 1996.\n  This rapid growth in home health spending understandably prompted \nCongress and the Health Care Financing Administration, as part of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997, to initiate changes that were intended to \nmake the program more cost-effective and efficient and protect it from \nfraud and abuse. However, in trying to get a handle on costs, we in \nCongress and the administration have unintentionally created problems \nthat may restrict some elderly citizens' access to vitally needed home \nhealth care.\n  Critics have long pointed out that Medicare's cost-based payment \nmethod for home health care has inherent incentives for home care \nagencies to provide more services, which has driven up costs. \nTherefore, the Balanced Budget Act called for the implementation of a \nprospective payment system for home care by October 1, 1999. Until \nthen, home health agencies will be paid according to what is known as \nan Interim Payment System.\n  Under the new IPS, home health agencies will be paid the lesser of: \ntheir actual costs; a per-visit cost limit; or a new blended agency-\nspecific per beneficiary annual limit based 75 percent on an agency's \nown costs per beneficiary and 25 percent on the average cost per \nbeneficiary for agencies in the same region. These costs are to be \ncalculated from cost reports for reporting periods ending in 1994.\n  I spent some time going over the formula because it is important to \nunderstand what the importance of that very\n\n[[Page S3710]]\n\ncomplicated formula is for many of our home health agencies.\n  At a recent hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, on \nwhich I serve, we heard testimony from a number of witnesses who \nexpressed concern that the new Interim Payment System inadvertently \npenalizes cost-efficient home health agencies by basing 75 percent of \nthe agencies' per patient payment limits on their FY 1994 average cost \nper patient. This system effectively rewards agencies that provided the \nmost visits and spent the most Medicare dollars in 1994, while it \npenalizes low-cost, more efficient providers. Let me repeat that point, \nMr. President. The agencies, usually the non-profits, that have \nprovided services at the lowest cost, are penalized by the new payment \nsystem.\n  Home health agencies in the Northeast are among those that have been \nparticularly hard-hit by the formula change. As the Wall Street Journal \nrecently observed,\n\n       If New England had been just a little greedier, its home-\n     health industry would be a lot better off now . . . \n     Ironically, . . . [the region] is getting clobbered by the \n     system because of its tradition of non-profit community \n     service and efficiency.\n\n  Moreover, there is no logic to the variance in payment levels. As the \nsame article goes on to point out, the average patient cap in Tennessee \nis expected to be $2,200 higher than Connecticut's, and the cap for \nMississippi is expected to be $2,000 more than Maine's, without any \nevidence that patients in the Southern states are sicker or that nurses \nand other home health personnel in this region cost more. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of this article \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this system also gives a competitive \nadvantage to high-cost agencies over their lower cost neighbors, since \nagencies in a particular region may have dramatically different \nreimbursement levels regardless of any differences among their patient \npopulations. And finally, this system may force low-cost agencies to \nstop accepting patients with more serious health care needs.\n  That is exactly the opposite of what we should want. I simply do not \nthink that this is what Congress intended. To rectify this problem, \ntoday I am pleased to introduce legislation along with Senators Chafee, \nJeffords, Leahy, Feingold, Snowe, Durbin, Harkin, Reed and Santorum. \nThe Medicare Home Health Equity Act will level the playing field and \nmake certain that home health agencies that have been prudent in their \nuse of Medicare resources are not unfairly penalized. The legislation \nwill also ensure that home health agencies in the same region are \nreimbursed similarly for treating similar patients.\n  Instead of allowing the experience of high-cost agencies to serve as \nthe basis for the new cost limits, the bill we are introducing today \nsets a new per beneficiary cost limit based on a blend of national and \nregional average costs per patient. This new formula will be based 75 \npercent on the national average cost per patient and 25 percent on the \nregional average cost per patient. Moreover, by eliminating the agency-\nspecific data from the formula, the Medicare Home Health Equity Act \nwill move us more quickly to the national and regional rates which will \nbe the cornerstones of the future prospective payment system, and it \nwill do so in a way that is budget neutral. This is a matter of common \nsense and fairness. It is also a matter of ensuring that there is a \nfair system for reimbursing these vitally needed home health agencies \nthat are providing services that are so important to so many of our \nsenior citizens. I urge all of my colleagues to join as cosponsors of \nthe Medicare Home Health Equity Act, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the bill as well as a section by section summary be printed \nin the Record.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

To \n     the extent that such adjustments in\n\n[[Page S3711]]\n\n     a year would otherwise exceed the amount certified to the \n     Secretary pursuant to subsection (b) for such year, the \n     Secretary shall reduce the payments to home health agencies \n     in a pro rata manner so that the adjustments do not exceed \n     such amount.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Medicare Home Health Equity Act--Section-by-Section Summary\n\n\n                              CURRENT LAW\n\n       The cost-based payment method that has historically been \n     used for Medicare home health services has inherent \n     incentives for home care agencies to provide a higher volume \n     of services. Therefore, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) \n     called for the implementation of a prospective payment system \n     (PPS) for home care by October 1, 1999. In the interim (FYs \n     1998 and 1999), home health agencies will be paid according \n     to an Interim Payment System (IPS) established by the BBA.\n       The IPS reimburses home health agencies using the lowest of \n     three cost limits: 1) an agency's actual costs; 2) a per \n     visit cost limit applied to each skilled nursing, physical \n     therapy, or other type of home health visit provided; or 3) \n     an agency-specific aggregate per patient cost limit that is \n     based 75 percent on an agency's average cost per patient in \n     1994 and 25 percent on a regional average cost per patient in \n     1994.\n       The Interim Payment System penalizes cost-efficient home \n     health agencies by basing 75 percent of the agencies' per \n     patient payment limits on their FY 1994 average cost per \n     patient. Giving such a heavy weight to the agency-specific \n     costs per beneficiary effectively rewards agencies that \n     provided the most visits and spent the most Medicare dollars \n     in 1994, while it penalizes low-cost, more efficient \n     providers. As a result, high-cost and inefficient agencies \n     will continue to receive a disproportionate share of Medicare \n     home health dollars.\n\n\n                  The Medicare Home Health Equity Act\n\n         Formula change for setting per beneficiary cost limits\n\n       The Medicare Home Health Equity Act will level the playing \n     field and make certain that those home health agencies that \n     have been prudent in their use of Medicare resources are not \n     unfairly penalized. Moreover, it will ensure that home health \n     agencies in the same region are reimbursed similarly for \n     treating similar patients. Instead of allowing the experience \n     of high cost agencies to serve as the basis for the cost \n     limits, the bill sets a new per beneficiary cost limit based \n     on a blend of national and regional average costs per \n     patient. This new formula would be based 75 percent on the \n     national average cost per patient in calendar year 1994 \n     ($3,987) and 25 percent on the regional average cost per \n     patient in calendar year 1995.\n\nRestoration of the per-visit cost limit to 112 percent of the national \n                                  mean\n\n       The per visit cost limits essentially place a cap on the \n     amount of costs that can be reimbursed by Medicare for each \n     home health care visit provided. The BBA reduced these cost \n     limits from 112 percent of the mean to 105 percent of the \n     median. This was done to provide additional savings. However, \n     most of the BBA savings (at least 80 percent) came from the \n     per-beneficiary cost limits. According to Price-Waterhouse, \n     changing the formula from an agency-specific to a national/\n     regional average cost per patient blend achieves an \n     additional $5.5 billion in savings. The Medicare Home Health \n     Equity Act of 1998 uses these savings to restore the per-\n     visit cost limit to 112 percent of the national mean.\n       Most analysts agree that the growth in Medicare home health \n     expenditures is due to the high number of visits provided to \n     patients, not by the cost per visit. In fact, the cost per \n     visit has remained relatively stable in recent years, and CBO \n     confirms that controlling use, not price, is the key to \n     Medicare home health cost containment. It is appropriate to \n     use the savings achieved by rewarding rather than penalizing \n     cost-efficient agencies to re-establish the cost limits that \n     enabled many of those agencies to provide more efficient care \n     over the entire episode of care. The average cost per visit \n     tends to be higher for lower-overall cost, non-profit HHAs \n     which tend to provide care in fewer visits. By keeping visits \n     to the number that are medically necessary, costs per visit \n     may increase slightly, but overall costs per patient \n     decrease.\n\n Modifies Application of Proration of Per Beneficiary Limits Provision\n\n       The BBA contained a provision which requires proration of \n     the per beneficiary annual limit where the patient is served \n     by more than one home health agency. The Medicare Home Health \n     Equity Act modifies this provision to clarify that proration \n     only applies where it can be demonstrated that a home health \n     agency is attempting to circumvent the limits by shifting \n     care between agencies.\n\n                    Establishes an Outlier Provision\n\n       The bill instructs the Secretary of HHS to prescribe rules \n     under which adjustments can be made in payments to home \n     health agencies that are ``outliers'' where events beyond \n     their control or extraordinary circumstances, including their \n     case mix, create ``reasonable costs'' that exceed what \n     otherwise would be their payment limits. This is included so \n     that there is some provision for higher payments for home \n     health agencies that treat the sickest Medicare home care \n     patients and does so in a way that is budget neutral.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\n   Region's Home-Care Firms Face Being Punished for Their Efficiency\n\n                           (By Carol Gentry)\n\n       If New England had been just a little greedier, its home-\n     health industry would be a lot better off now.\n       In a rush to cut Medicare spending, Congress has set up a \n     home-health payment system that punishes low-cost agencies \n     and states, while it rewards big spenders and regions where \n     audits have found widespread fraud and abuse. Ironically, New \n     England is getting clobbered by the system because of its \n     tradition of non-profit community service and efficiency.\n       And patients are feeling the effects. In the past two \n     weeks, about 30 complaints have come into the Boston office \n     of the federal agency that must implement the change, the \n     Health Care Financing Administration. The agency says the \n     complaints are coming from patients who need frequent, long-\n     term nursing visits, but say they are being turned away or \n     cut off.\n       ``I fear we're now looking at home health agencies dumping \n     (expensive) patients,'' says Margaret Leoni-Lugo, chief of \n     the HCFA quality-improvement branch for New England. Such \n     discrimination violates state and federal regulations.\n       Ms. Leoni-Lugo says she sympathizes with the difficult \n     situation confronting New England agencies, but cannot \n     condone patient dumping. Today she is expected to hold a \n     telephone conference with health-department officials in the \n     six New England states, warning them to watch for evidence \n     that agencies are cutting care too much.\n       ``We want to keep the beneficiaries safe,'' says Ms. Leoni-\n     Lugo.\n\n\n                            the new formula\n\n       The new system rolls back payments to 1993-94 levels minus \n     2%, regardless of whether an agency's budget was low or \n     grossly inflated during those years. Under the system, home-\n     health agencies' Medicare payments will be affected not only \n     by their own budget history, but also by their location. If a \n     company is in a penny-pinching region, its payments will be \n     lower than if it comes from an area of big spenders. The \n     agencies that come out best under this formula are those that \n     spent money willy-nilly five years ago and were surrounded by \n     companies that did the same thing. The biggest winners will \n     be states in the South.\n       Meanwhile, frugal agencies in regions with moderate costs--\n     especially New England, the Midwest and the Mountain states--\n     are reeling. Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine will be among \n     the hardest-hit states in the nation. Massachusetts, \n     Connecticut and Rhode Island fare only marginally better.\n       Advocates for the elderly and the region's home-health \n     agencies say such a system gives a competitive advantage to \n     the worst players in the industry. ``This is not in the best \n     interest of taxpayers,'' says Susan Young, executive director \n     of the Home Care Association of New Hampshire.\n       Adds Margaret Gilmour, president and chief executive \n     officer of Home Health & Hospice Care, a home-care agency in \n     Nashua, N.H.: ``This is going to be a tidal wave of disaster \n     for elder care.''\n       Layoffs are already under way in New Hampshire, Ms. Young \n     says, where the industry is among the leanest in the nation.\n       The congressional delegation from Massachusetts hopes to \n     derail the new system before it can do massive damage. ``This \n     defies common sense.'' says Rep. James P. McGovern, a \n     Democrat from Worcester. ``This is a big, fat mistake.''\n\n\n                      Taking Care of the Homebound\n\n       In late November, Rep. McGovern and 11 other members of the \n     state's congressional delegation sent a letter of concern to \n     HCFA. The group hopes to meet with top agency officials in \n     Washington soon.\n       Home-health agencies send nurses, aides, and physical and \n     speech therapists to the homes of patients who are so \n     physically or mentally disabled that they cannot easily go or \n     be taken to a medical clinic.\n       While most private insurers and health-maintenance \n     organizations cover home health care, the main money pipeline \n     is Medicare. All homebound elderly and disabled beneficiaries \n     of the program are eligible for free unlimited visits, as \n     long as the visits are part of a treatment plan that is \n     authorized by a physician and is updated every two months.\n       There are several types of home-health agencies, including \n     the community-based nonprofits, such as the Visiting Nurses \n     Associations of America; the newer for-profit companies; and \n     hospital-affiliated agencies. Medicare's costs have been \n     higher for patients who go through one of the hospital or \n     for-profit companies.\n       Hospital-affiliated agencies tend to have higher per-visit \n     costs than independent ones because they can legally transfer \n     some of the hospital's overhead to the home-health books and \n     have Medicare pay for it. For-profit agencies tend to \n     generate higher Medicare payments by billing for a greater \n     number of visits per patient.\n       Patients recuperating from surgery or a short-term illness \n     may need only a few visits, but home-health agencies are a \n     lifeline for patients with long-term conditions--multiple \n     sclerosis. Alzheimer's disease, heart failure, severe \n     diabetes--who are trying to stay out of nursing homes.\n\n[[Page S3712]]\n\n       The new system sets an annual limit on the amount that \n     Medicare will spend on any given patient. While that cap is \n     different for every agency, it averages out to 75 visits a \n     year in Massachusetts. Patient advocates say this gives \n     agencies an incentive to take only those clients who are \n     going to get better or die in a short time.\n       To make matters worse, agencies must reduce expenses \n     without knowing just how deep the cuts will be. The details \n     of the payments formula won't be determined until April 1, \n     but will be retroactive to Oct. 1.\n\n\n                         seeking formula change\n\n       In the letter to HCFA, the Massachusetts delegation asked \n     administrators to alter the new formula to ``lessen the \n     blow'' to low-cost, efficient home-health agencies. The \n     letter says it is unfair to tag payments to a 1994 average \n     per-patient cost of $4,328 in Massachusetts, when Tennessee \n     was getting $6,508 and Louisiana $6,700.\n       Rep. McGovern says he hopes to repeal the payment-system \n     provision when Congress convenes later this month, but he \n     knows that may not be easy. Many of the leaders of Congress \n     are from the South, where payment rates are projected to be \n     double those in much of New England.\n       Massachusetts has a lot at stake. In 1995, the last year \n     for which Medicare has complete data, the program spent more \n     than $1 billion in New England to provide home health to \n     246,000 beneficiaries. Of that money, Massachusetts absorbed \n     more than half for 119,000 homebound patients. More than 14% \n     of the state's Medicare beneficiaries were served by home \n     care, while the rate was about 10% nationwide.\n       Under the new payment system, members of the Massachusetts \n     delegation say, their state stands to lose $95 million and at \n     least 1.5 million patient visits in the first year.\n       Why will the system affect Massachusetts so much? The \n     state's home-health agencies deliver care at a more moderate \n     cost per visit than most other states, federal data show, but \n     also perform more visits per patient, on average. Pat \n     Kelleher. executive director of the Home Health Care \n     Association of Massachusetts, says one reason is that the \n     state has deliberately pushed home care to save state tax \n     money. Federally paid Medicare home-health visits keep \n     patients out of nursing homes, which draw most of their \n     revenue from the state Medicaid program.\n\n\n                      Rough Time Ahead for Vermont\n\n       If the other New England states affected, Vermont, the only \n     state that legally requires home-health companies to be non-\n     profit, especially faces troubled times. After consistently \n     providing home care at the lowest cost per patient in the \n     nation. Vermont's 13 agencies stand to lose more than $2 \n     million this year and estimate they will have to reduce \n     service by 10%.\n       The Vermont Assembly of Home Health Agencies estimates the \n     average per person payments in the state this year will be \n     $2,600 a year, less than half what they payout is expected to \n     be in, say, Alabama.\n       ``The system was supposed to limit the high rollers'' says \n     the association's director, Peter Cobb but instead ``Congress \n     rewarded excess.''\n       The rule changes stem from the passage last August of the \n     Balanced Budget Act, which cuts $115 billion from Medicare by \n     2002. The home-care portion of the act slices $16.2 billion \n     from the budget.\n       Home care seemed a logical place to look for cuts, since \n     it's the fastest-growing segment of the health industry. \n     Between 1990 and 1995, while the number of Medicare \n     beneficiaries rose 10%, the number of home-health visits grew \n     255% and spending went up 316%.\n       Some of that increase accompanied the rise of managed-care \n     companies that try to keep patients out of the hospital to \n     save money and, if they must go, keep the visits as brief as \n     possible. However, much of the inflation in home care was a \n     predictable response to a payment system that offered no \n     incentive to be frugal.\n\n\n                        probe finds waste, fraud\n\n       Massive fraud, waste and ineptitude in Medicare billings \n     were reported last summer by the Office of the Inspector \n     General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \n     following a two-year investigation called Operation Restore \n     Trust. The study covered five states that account for 40% of \n     Medicare payments: California, New York, Florida, Texas and \n     Illinois.\n       The report said one-fourth of home-health agencies in those \n     states received nearly half the Medicare dollars spent on \n     home-health care. According to the report, the ``problem'' \n     agencies tended to be for-profit, closely held corporations \n     with owners that were involved in a tangle of interlocking, \n     self-referring businesses. Texas was cited as the biggest \n     home-health spender of the states studied. (An HCFA audit \n     conducted in Massachusetts and Connecticut last year found a \n     few overpayments, but no cases of fraud.)\n       It just so happened that the revelations of Operation \n     Restore Trust occurred at the same time that Congress was \n     looking for ways to cut Medicare spending.\n       Congress wanted to change the home-health payment system so \n     that it would reward efficiency, by switching to a flat rate \n     by diagnosis. This ``prospective payment system'' would be \n     similar to the one that Medicare uses to pay hospitals.\n       But HCFA said it needed more time to develop the complex \n     formula to set prospective payment in motion. So Congress \n     created an interim system that will run until Oct. 1, 1999. \n     It freezes spending at the rates there were in place in 1993-\n     94--before Operation Restore Trust began.\n\n\n                            varying payments\n\n       Now payments vary illogically. The average patient cap in \n     Tennessee is expected to be $2,200 higher than that in \n     Connecticut, and the cap for Mississippi $2,000 more than \n     Maine, without any evidence that patients in the Southern \n     states are sicker or that nurses cost more there.\n       But those who think the Southern states are pleased at \n     getting a patient cap double that of New England are \n     mistaken. Officials at the Texas Association for Home Care \n     say they need bigger payment rates because they have a high \n     rate of poor elderly who have never had proper health care, \n     and the state Medicaid program hasn't taken care of them \n     because it's stingy.\n       ``Congress has cut into the bone,'' says Sara Speights, \n     director of government and public relations for the Texas \n     group.\n       Inequities exist even within the same region. Ms. Gilmour \n     of the Nashua, N.H., home-care agency says a competitor in \n     northern Massachusetts could end up with a payment cap twice \n     as high as her own as a result of her staff's efforts to keep \n     costs down. Because patients are free to choose either \n     agency, she worries they will gravitate to the one that has a \n     bigger budget.\n       Joan Hull, chief executive of the nearby competitor, the \n     Home Health Visiting Nurses Association of Haverhill, Mass., \n     says her agency is a product of a merger between agencies \n     that had different payment rates, so she doesn't know whether \n     the Medicare cap will be $3,400 or $4,600 per patient. \n     Unfortunately for her agency, services it has delivered since \n     the beginning of its fiscal year in October will be on the \n     new payment rate, but the agency won't know what the rate is \n     until April.\n       ``It's crazy, isn't it?'' Ms. Hull says with a laugh.\n\n\n                             yankee thrift\n\n       Home health agencies in the New England states have \n     delivered care for less money than the national average, both \n     in Medicare payments per visit and per patient.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenators Collins, Chafee, Jeffords, Leahy, Reid and others in \nintroducing the Home Health Medical Equity Act of 1998. I especially \nwant to compliment the Senator from Maine, who has taken the lead on \nthis issue. It is a matter of enormous concern in her State and also in \nmine. I think it is worth taking a moment just to acknowledge how \nuseful the Senate Aging Committee is, to be able to highlight an issue \nlike this. I wonder whether this issue would have gotten the attention \nit deserves had it not been for that forum, where we were able to have \nan excellent hearing and hear from Senators all over the country whose \nStates are very negatively affected by the rules that were put into \nplace. I congratulate the Senator from Maine for taking the initiative \nout of that hearing to introduce legislation.\n  This legislation is a crucial step in ensuring that the Medicare Home \nHealth Care program's Interim Payment System does not penalize regions \nof the country that have been providing home health services \nefficiently.\n  Mr. President, I have been working to promote the availability of \nhome care and other long-term care options for my entire public life \nbecause I believe strongly in the importance of enabling people to stay \nin their own homes. For seniors who are homebound and have skilled \nnursing needs, having access to home health services through\n\n[[Page S3713]]\n\nthe Medicare program is the difference between staying in their own \nhome and being moved into a nursing facility. Home care offers feelings \nof security, dignity and hope. Where there is a choice, we should do \nour best to allow patients to choose home health care.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that there are situations when one's \nability to conduct the activities of daily living are so limited, and \nthe medical needs are so great, that the patient would be better \nserved, in some cases, in a skilled nursing facility. I also want to \nrecognize that my State of Wisconsin has a very, very good network of \ncaring and high-quality nursing homes. Without a doubt, there is a need \nfor these services. But, Mr. President, as I travel throughout \nWisconsin's 72 counties every year, what seniors tell me again and \nagain is that, to the extent possible, and as long as it is medically \nappropriate for them to do so, they would like to remain in their own \nhomes. I think seniors need and deserve that choice.\n  Mr. President, seniors clearly prefer to remain in their own homes \nrather than be moved to a nursing home. Their medical needs can often \nbe met through home health services. Despite these facts, the \nimplementation of the Medicare Home Health Interim Payment System as \npassed in last year's budget could create serious access problems for \nseniors in States like Wisconsin and Maine when they seek the home \nhealth benefit. The cuts to the Medicare Home Health program imposed by \nthe Interim Payment System are so severe that home health agencies will \nhave no choice but to reduce dramatically the amount of services \nprovided. Some home care agencies may get out of the home care business \naltogether. But, Mr. President, the real impact of the Interim Payment \nSystem will not be simply to reduce payments to home care providers and \nforce some out of business, what it will really do and what really \nconcerns me is it will drastically reduce the options that homebound \nseniors now have today with respect to whether they will remain in \ntheir home in the community or whether they will be forced into a \nnursing home situation that is not necessarily the best place for them.\n  As of right now, Mr. President, the Interim Payment System for \nMedicare home health care is a system that pays agencies the lowest of \nthe following three measures: (1) actual costs; (2) a per visit limit \nof 105% of the national median; or (3) a per beneficiary annual limit, \nderived from a blend of 75% an agency's costs and 25% regional costs. \nNow, these measures are pretty technical and I will not go into any \nmore of the specifics about them. But suffice it to say that the net \neffect of the Interim Payment System will be to penalize severely \nagencies who have been operating efficiently all these years. Since the \nInterim Payment System will pay the agency the lowest of the \nthree measures that I mentioned, agencies in areas where costs have \nbeen kept lower will be disproportionately and unfairly affected.\n\n  Mr. President, according to the Health Care Financing Administration, \njust in Wisconsin alone, there are currently 181 home health care \nagencies that participate in Medicare. Of these, two-thirds of them are \noperated as nonprofit entities. These nonprofit home health care \nproviders are often county health departments and visiting nurse \norganizations; these are not entities out to make a fast buck on the \nbacks of homebound seniors. According to administrators of Valley \nVisiting Nurse Association in Neenah, WI, the average, per patient \nMedicare home care cost in Wisconsin is $2,586, compared to $5,000 in \nother parts of the country. Let me repeat that, the statistics, because \nit is really quite striking. The average, per patient Medicare home \ncare cost in Wisconsin is only $2,586, compared to often over $5,000 or \nmore in other places in the country. These nonprofit providers in \nWisconsin are already as lean as they can be. I am fairly convinced \nthey don't have any ``fat'' to cut from their programs. The Visiting \nNurse Association Home Health of Wausau showed me some figures \ndemonstrating that, over the past 5 years, their services have averaged \n30 percent below limits imposed by the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, with 36 percent fewer visits per beneficiary than the \nnational average.\n  Mr. President, the effect of the deep reductions imposed by the \nInterim Payment System will be, quite simply, a devastating blow to \nthese types of agencies, and, in turn, will seriously impact the \navailability of home health care services to many people in Wisconsin. \nThis devastating blow is dealt not because Wisconsin has been providing \ntoo many services too expensively. It is just to the contrary. States \nlike Wisconsin and others are being penalized more precisely because \nthey have always operated efficiently. Moreover, on a national level, \nwith a reduced per-patient limit, home health agencies have a \ndisincentive to take more seriously ill patients onto their rolls.\n  Mr. President, the legislation my colleagues and I introduce today \nwill change the Interim Payment System to bring about greater payment \nequity for Medicare home health providers in different parts of the \ncountry. The bill, as the Senator from Maine outlined, would create a \nnew formula for the per-patient limit that reflects a higher percentage \nof national data rather than relying solely on regional and local data. \nThe change in payment calculation would enable high-efficiency, low-\ncost home health agencies to continue providing services efficiently \nand cost-effectively. But, Mr. President, the most important impact of \nthe Medicare Home Health Equity Act will be to make sure that seniors \nwho are homebound and have skilled nursing needs will retain for as \nlong as possible the right to decide to stay in their own homes.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for \nhis cosponsorship of this important legislation and for his leadership \nin this issue.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to sponsor the Medicare Home \nHealth Equity Act of 1998 with my distinguished colleague from Maine. I \nwant to applaud Senator Collins' efforts to correct a provision in the \nBalanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 which has had the effect of \npenalizing those home health agencies that have taken the lead in \nbecoming more cost-efficient over the last several years.\n  The Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1998 will help avert the \npotentially devastating effect of the Interim Payment System (IPS), \nestablished by the Balanced Budget Act, on many home health agencies in \nRhode Island, and throughout the country.\n  The IPS for Medicare home health services that was established by the \nBBA bases its reimbursement in large part on agency-specific costs \nduring fiscal year 1994. Consequently, home health agencies that had \nalready been implementing cost-efficient practices at that time, like \nmany agencies in Rhode Island were doing, are now finding their \nreimbursements greatly reduced.\n  Home health agencies in my home state have told me that this \ndecreased reimbursement, in addition to being unfair, might lead to \nreductions in critical health services that currently enable elderly \npatients to maintain their dignity and quality of life. These agencies \nalso have pointed out that this interim payment system may well result \nin a loss of jobs in the home health industry.\n  I am greatly troubled by the thought that the IPS now in effect may \nwell put into financial jeopardy those Rhode Island home health \nagencies that have been working diligently to heed our appeal to \ndeliver cost-efficient services. The impact of this payment system on \none of Rhode Island's most vulnerable populations, the infirm elderly, \nis unpredictable and potentially devastating.\n  The Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1998 bases Medicare \nreimbursement for home health services primarily on national costs \nduring the baseline year rather than agency-specific costs. \nConsequently, the most efficient home health agencies will not be \nplaced at financial disadvantage. This is a matter of economic \nnecessity--we will never be able to maintain the financial security of \nthe Medicare program unless we encourage everyone involved in the \nsystem to help make it work.\n  This bill is budget-neutral and will not increase overall Medicare \nexpenditures. The legislation is a big step forward in our goal of a \ncost-efficient and reliable health care system for our older citizens.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting the\n\n[[Page S3714]]\n\nMedicare Home Health Equity Act of 1998.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Vermont's home health agencies are a \nmodel of efficiency for the nation. For the past seven consecutive \nyears, the average Medicare expenditure for home health care in Vermont \nhas been the lowest in the nation. This efficiency was achieved by \nexclusive reliance on 13 nonprofit agencies which provide care without \nsacrificing quality, and which adhere strictly to Medicare requirements \nand guidelines. Today, I am cosponsoring The Medicare Home Health \nEquity Act of 1998, with my good friend Senator Collins, in order to \npreserve this high-quality, low-cost home health system from possible \ninsolvency.\n  At this moment, Vermont is facing an unprecedented crisis in its home \nhealth care system. This is not a crisis of their own making, and the \nhome health agencies had little, if any, advance warning that disaster \nwas imminent. The crisis that befalls Vermont's home health care \nagencies, and many others throughout the country, arose from the \ndecision made by Congress, as a part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \n(BBA), to adopt a Medicare prospective payment system for home health \ncare.\n  There is compelling rationale and general agreement for moving \nMedicare to a prospective payment system (PPS) in the home health care \nsector. Under a national, prospective payment system, low-cost agencies \nwill fare well, as they have already learned how to manage their \nresources wisely. However, the interim system created by the BBA for \nthe transition to a PPS is fundamentally flawed and rewards high-cost \nagencies. Under the Interim Payment System, reimbursement limits for \nhome health care are heavily weighted toward an agency's historical \ncosts. This means that until a prospective payment system can be \ndesigned and implemented, the lowest cost agencies will face the most \nsignificant caps on their Medicare payments.\n  Where a prospective payment system aims to level the playing field \nfor agencies that care for similarly situated patients, the interim \nsystem preserves and reinforces significant disparities across \nagencies. Although high-cost agencies will face reductions in payments \nunder the interim system, these will be the agencies in the best \nposition to make those cuts. Low-cost agencies with budgets that are \nalready lean have no place to turn. It would be a national tragedy if \nthose low-cost agencies cannot survive the transition to a prospective \nsystem.\n  I commend the efforts of my good friend Senator Collins for bringing \nthis bill forward. it was a difficult task to craft a remedy that \nallows committed and responsible home health agencies to survive and \nalso maintain budget neutrality. The Medicare Home Health Equity Act of \n1998 would alter the interim payment formula by basing payment caps on \na blend of national and regional averages. In this way, we can move \ntoward a more uniform level of reimbursement and allow home health care \nagencies in the same locale to operate under the same constraints. \nFurthermore, this legislation can be implemented quickly. This is \nimportant, because the regulations defining the interim payment system \nwere not published until January of this year--nearly four months after \nthe payment system was in force.\n  The situation is serious. We must provide relief to home health \nagencies and peace of mind to the clients who are under their care. \nLast August, I voted in support of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I \nwas proud of the changes we made to preserve Medicare benefits for the \npresent and for future generations. Today, I urge my colleagues to \nenact The Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1998 and correct the \nunintended consequences of the BBA's interim payment system \nreimbursement limits on low-cost home health agencies.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Susan Collins, in the introduction of \nthe ``Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1998.'' This bill tries to fix \nwhat we believe to be an unintended injustice in the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997.\n  As many of you know, home health agencies have historically been \nreimbursed on the basis of costs. The Health Care Financing \nAdministration paid each agency to cover the cost of providing care. \nThis arrangement has been widely criticized because of offers no \nincentive for agencies to control their costs.\n  In order to correct this, we in Congress agreed that Medicare should \nmove to a prospective payment system to control costs and ensure \nquality and access to care. The Balanced Budget Act establishes this \nsystem for home health, effective as of October 1, 1999. In the mean \ntime, an interim payment system has been put in place. These changes \nwere needed in order to rein in the incredible growth--some due to \ninappropriate payments--in the industry in the last seven years. In \n1990, Medicare spent $3.7 billion on home health care. In 1996, $16.7 \nbillion was spent. In addition, the average number of visits per \nbeneficiary soared from 26 in 1990 to 76 in 1996.\n  I believe the change to the prospective payment system had to be \ndone. However, the interim payment system will reward high-cost, \ninefficient home health provides at the expense of those home health \nagencies that have historically kept their costs low. I don't believe \nthis was the intent of Congress, and that is why I am cosponsoring \nSenator Collins' bill to correct this injustice.\n  As co-chair of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, I've been working for \na long time to change the big city, urban bias in Medicare's \nreimbursement payments. It penalizes more conservative cost-effective \napproaches to health care, and that hurts rural areas like Iowa. We \nwent a long way towards fixing that bias in Balanced Budget Act by \nequalizing Medicare's reimbursement payments for managed care services.\n  But unbeknownst to me and, I believe, most of my colleagues, while we \nprovided rural equity in one area, we took it away in another. It is \njust common sense that we should reward those who provide quality care \nin a cost-effective, efficient manner. We did this when we changed the \nMedicare managed care rates. It doesn't seem right that in the same \nAct, we created an interim payment system for home health services that \nrewards the high cost, wasteful agencies and leaves those that have \nsuccessfully kept their costs low struggling to survive.\n  The system's reliance on a provider's historical costs in determining \ntheir reimbursement amounts has produced an uneven playing field. Many \nof the newer agencies, who got started during a period of high growth, \nnow have a competitive advantage. They will now be reimbursed at a \nhigher rate than their lower cost competitors.\n  Senator Collins' bill does the right thing--it rewards those agencies \nwho have done the most to save Medicare money. These include many \nvisiting nurse associations, non-profit free standing agencies and most \nnon-profit hospital based programs.\n  The Home Health Equity Act will revise the current system of \nreimbursement based on 75 percent of agency cost blended with 25 \npercent of national costs. The legislation would create a 75 percent \nnational rate blended with 25 percent regional rate to level payments \nto providers in a given geographic area. In addition, this bill \ncontinues the cost savings that the interim payment system was intended \nto achieve. Price Waterhouse has analyzed the bill and found it to be \nbudget neutral.\n  If we don't fix the interim payment system, I am afraid we risk a \nreduction in access to and quality of health care for Iowa seniors. \nIowa home health care agencies have historically provided efficient, \nquality service and they ought to be rewarded, not punished for this. \nMost importantly, rural patients and their families deserve continued \naccess to the best possible care.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in introducing \nthe Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1998.\n  The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) included numerous changes to Medicare \nthat were necessary to extend the solvency of the trust fund and \nincrease the program's integrity. It was extremely important \nlegislation that I strongly supported, but there was no way to know the \nimpact of every provision it included.\n  One provision of the BBA in particular, the interim payment system \nfor\n\n[[Page S3715]]\n\nhome health care, locks in place inequities between regions of the \ncountry, efficient and inefficient providers, and new and older \nagencies. I am concerned about the impact of that provision on my state \nof South Dakota.\n  In South Dakota, the interim payment system has raised significant \nconcern. The interim payment system bases each agency's per patient \ncost limit largely on its per beneficiary cost in 1994. My concern is \nthat South Dakota's cost per beneficiary and number of visits per \npatient were well below the national average in 1994. Many of the home \nhealth agencies in the state have expanded the geographic area they \nserve since 1994 and have added services that formerly were not \navailable in the more rural parts of the state. Some of these agencies \nare the sole providers in our most rural counties.\n  I have heard from Hand County Home Health Agency which primarily \nserves women, age 85 and older, with little family nearby and with \ndifficult health conditions. Since 1994, the Hand County Home Health \nAgency has kept its costs down, but has added new services such as \nphysical therapy and has expanded the geographic area to serve areas \nthat no other provider covers. The agency has told me that they have to \nconsider discontinuing the new services they cover or decreasing the \ngeographic area they serve. Neither of these options seems acceptable \nto me.\n  The interim payment system also creates problems between new and \nolder agencies. In the same geographic area, where there is a new \nprovider and an old agency, the new provider's limit will be based on \nthe national median reimbursement. This results in significant \ndiscrepancies in reimbursement and ultimately the services that \nagencies can afford to deliver within the same area and market.\n  Ultimately the impact of this payment system falls on beneficiaries, \nand this must be foremost in our minds. Senator Collins' bill would go \na long way to addressing the access, quality, and equity issues that \nhave been raised by the interim payment system in South Dakota. I am \npleased to join her in beginning the dialogue on this issue that I hope \nwill lead to construction changes for home health care patients in \nSouth Dakota and across the nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COATS (for himself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Coverdell, and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 1994.

Mr. President, I am here today to announce, along with \nseveral Members--in fact, a coalition of 30 Republican Members from \nboth the House and the Senate called the Renewal Alliance, which has \nbeen in business now for a considerable amount of time--more than a \nyear--will be jointly introducing new initiatives to help restore hard-\npressed urban neighborhoods of our country to reach out to families and \ncommunities and neighbors that are dealing with some of the most \ndifficult and intractable social problems that affect our society.\n  This package, called REAL Life--renewal, empowerment, achievement, \nand learning for life--contains what we believe are essential elements \nto help bring improvements and restore hope to impoverished communities \nand to bring self-sufficiency to low-income individuals and families. \nREAL Life seeks to address the critical deficits facing neighborhoods \nand communities, families, those communities and neighborhoods who lie \nbehind the gleaming skyscrapers, the neighborhoods where some of the \nmost difficult problems in our society--homelessness, drug abuse, teen \npregnancy, poverty, and violence--are found in some of the most complex \nand intractable forms in the neighborhoods, however, where groups of \nindividuals and private community organizations and leaders are already \nat work defeating the poverty and dysfunction that have defied our \nwell-intentioned and lavishly funded Federal efforts.\n  Before I begin to make specific comments about the legislation that \nwe will be introducing, let me take a moment to read from a letter \ngiven to me by Light of Life Ministries, a rescue mission operating in \nPittsburgh, PA. I think this letter communicates in a very compelling \nand clear way both the problems that we face today in our low-income \nareas and particularly in our cities--although these are no respecters \nof income or persons, but it seems that the problems are particularly \nacute in some of our urban areas--but also addresses some of the \nsolutions that even today are within our grasp.\n  This letter is from a fellow named Benjamin Primis, a young man who, \nafter a promising start in life, fell on hard times. He was a graphic \nartist working in the television industry, and he began using drugs and \nbecame addicted to crack cocaine. Soon he was homeless and desperate.\n  Benjamin writes:\n\n       I found myself homeless in Pittsburgh. It seemed as though \n     the world had turned its back on me. . . . When there was \n     nowhere else to run, the Light of Life Ministry in Pittsburgh \n     opened their doors of unconditional love. . . . Instantly I \n     was comforted with three hot meals a day, clean linens, drug \n     and alcohol therapy. . . . They fed me when I was hungry. \n     They clothed me when I had nothing else to wear. [Most \n     importantly,] they cared for me when I didn't care for \n     myself.\n\n  Benjamin Primis's story is one of thousands, maybe tens of thousands, \nof stories of hope and restoration and healing that bring us together \nhere on this floor, the Senate floor, this morning. Ben Primis was \nfailed by both the dogmas and initiatives of Republicans and Democrats, \nconservatives and liberals. A booming economy did not prevent his fall \ninto poverty. And the Government safety net proved to be an illusion. \nInstead, Ben was rescued by one of the thousands of neighborhood-based, \nprivately run, often faith-based religious charities that operate in \npoor neighborhoods across our country.\n  Let me give another example, Mr. President. For years, officials in \nthe District of Columbia and Members of Congress have wrestled with the \nproblem of violence in this city that has plagued this city. A lot of \nprograms have been tried, and the police department has been \nstrengthened and reorganized and redeployed on several occasions to \nalmost no effect. It seemed that none of the often very expensive \ninitiatives had any fruition.\n  Last year, a group of African American men called the Alliance of \nConcerned Men began brokering peace treaties among the gangs that \ninhabit, and frequently dominate, some of the city's public housing \ncomplexes. Benning Terrace in southeast Washington, known to the D.C. \npolice department as perhaps the most dangerous area of the city, has \nnot had a single murder since the Alliance's peace treaty went into \neffect early last year. This movement is now spreading across the city.\n  These are community healers who are saving lives where all other \nGovernment efforts have failed. I have met with these individuals. I \nhave listened to their stories and some of the most remarkable stories \nof transformation of individual lives and reconciliation that anyone \ncould ever encounter.\n\n  The Light of Life Mission in Pittsburgh, the Alliance of Concerned \nMen in Washington, DC, Gospel Rescue Mission of Washington, these are \nthe kinds of organizations that the Renewal Alliance REAL Life \ninitiative wants to place at the center of our Nation's welfare and \nsocial policies.\n  REAL Life is not a handout, it is an opportunity agenda for America's \npoor,\n\n[[Page S3716]]\n\nand it is concentrated on those who live on America's meanest streets. \nIt does acknowledge a role for Government programs, but it makes that \nrole one of a junior partner--not a CEO, not a director, but a junior \npartner, a junior partner with those organizations that, without \nGovernment help, without Government rules and regulations, are reaching \nout and actually bringing hope and bringing restoration to some of the \nmost desperate situations that our country encounters. This whole array \nof community-based organizations, faith-based organizations, social \ninstitutions, help restore individual lives and rebuilds neighborhoods.\n  Finally, REAL Life is a vision that starts with a belief that real \nand lasting social reform begins among the families, the churches, the \nschools, the businesses, that are the heart and the soul of local \ncommunities.\n  We have three central components in REAL Life. We have a community \nrenewal component, which I will talk a little bit more in a moment, \nwhich incorporates a State-based voluntary charity tax credit, charity \ndonations protection, liability reform. We have an economic empowerment \ncomponent, which incorporates a number of empowerment initiatives that \nhave been discussed and talked about over the years. These will be \ndiscussed by other members of the Renewal Alliance. We have educational \nopportunity for low-income families. This real-life initiative by the \nRenewal Alliance has narrowed its scope to three essential components \nas a means of demonstrating the effectiveness of these initiatives.\n  Before I yield to other members of the Renewal Alliance--and I note \nthat Senator Abraham, a key member of our Alliance, is here and ready \nto speak--let me briefly discuss the community renewal portion of the \npackage we are introducing today.\n  The REAL Life Community Renewal Act begins with the belief that \nsocial capital, the invisible elements of trust, cooperation, and \nmutual support that undergird communities life, have been severely \ndamaged by 30 years of misguided Government programs. The traditional \nnetworks of community action and caring anchored in churches, schools, \nand volunteer programs have been displaced by Government programs. Too \nmuch money and too little wisdom have combined to wreak havoc in urban \nneighborhoods. We seek to repair that damage done by the Great Society \nby shifting authority and resources out of Government and into the \nprivate, religious, and voluntary groups that know the deepest needs of \nlocal neighborhoods. We achieve this through State-based charity tax \ncredit.\n  We tap a wide range of existing Federal welfare block grants as a \nfunding source for these charity tax credits. The credit is entirely \nvoluntary. It builds up on efforts in the States to find innovative \napproaches for the delivery of welfare services. Already, Arizona and \nPennsylvania and Indiana have either incorporated or are in the process \nof incorporating charity tax credits as a way to provide incentives for \ncontributions to these organizations.\n  As I said, we also contain provisions which will strengthen charities \nthrough enhanced liability protections and also to prevent IRS actions \nagainst these organizations to allow them to better do their mission. \nOthers here this morning will speak in greater detail about the \neconomic empowerment and educational opportunities sessions of our \nproposal.\n  The bottom line is this: After 30 years of experiments with top-down \nFederal poverty strategies and an enormous expenditure of money, the \nreturns are in. The Great Society approach, the Government-knows-all \napproach, the Government-can solve-all-your-problems approach, has \nfailed. It has been a failure that has been widespread across this \ncountry. Many of the initiatives were well motivated, but the results \nare in. It is time now for us to look at a new approach, a new approach \nthat makes local leadership, community-based institutions, and \nneighborhood center reform efforts the heart of our welfare strategy.\n  I trust that my colleagues will join us in this effort to bring real \nlife to those in greatest need in our society. I could spend the day \ndiscussing and talking about initiatives that have taken place in \ncommunities across this country where individuals, inspired by nothing \nmore than a dream or a vision, often severely and desperately \nunderfunded, have opened their arms and opened their hearts and opened \ntheir doors to provide real support and real help for real people in \nneed. They have done so in a remarkable way.\n  The Center for the Homeless in South Bend, IN, has combined the \nefforts of 300 churches spanning the spectrum of denominations and \nreligions. They have utilized the services of the University of Notre \nDame, the hospital community of St. Joseph County, and help from \nvolunteers from all walks of life, and put together a model homeless \nshelter which has a six-part, 2-year strategy of taking homeless \nindividuals and turning them into homeowners, restoring their lives, \nand, in the process, restoring neighborhoods and restoring communities. \nIt is one of the most remarkably efficient and effective efforts that I \nhave witnessed.\n  But the story is repeated all across the State of Indiana in \ninitiative after initiative. The Matthew 25 clinic in Fort Wayne, IN, a \ncombination of doctors, dentists, and nurses, on a volunteer basis, is \nreaching out and established a clinic, providing medical care and help \nto low-income individuals who are not insured and don't have \nopportunities for medical treatment in the normal course of things. \nThey have made a remarkable difference in our community. It is not a \nFederal program; it has nothing to do with a Federal program; there are \nno Federal funds. It is voluntary efforts by the community of medical \npersonnel in our city. Whether it is a maternity home, a home for \ngirls, a spouse abuse shelter, any of a number of programs, they are \nduplicated and replicated in virtually every city in America. Yet, they \nare struggling, struggling because, as I said, after 30 years of \nFederal initiatives, their efforts have been almost overwhelmed by the \nwell-intended, well-meaning, extraordinarily expensive, and incredibly \nlow-result efforts of the Federal Government. It is this problem that \nwe are trying to address.\n  This doesn't have to be a partisan issue. This is something \nRepublicans and Democrats can come together on. I believe liberals, who \nhave been well-motivated and well-intended, have seen the dismal \nresults of their efforts and are looking for an alternative. And those \nconservatives who say, ``Let this sort itself out; after all, it is an \nissue of personal responsibility and there is nothing Government should \nbe involved in,'' I think are ignoring the fact that some of these \ninstitutions that are so essential to helping in this process need \nsupport and need to be rebuilt.\n  This is not a new, massive Federal program, this is simply some \nstartup initiatives to point the way and, hopefully, to encourage the \nsupport and development of these non-Government institutions.\n\n  My colleague from Michigan is on the floor, Senator Abraham, who has \nbeen instrumental in helping to develop the REAL Life initiative. I am \npleased to yield time to him to explain another component of this \nparticular package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to begin by thanking Senator \nCoats for the leadership he has provided. Even before there was such a \nthing as the Renewal Alliance, Senator Coats was, in a variety of \ncontexts, bringing forth the arguments in the case that he has begun to \npresent here today. I think the existence of his efforts and the \nvarious projects he has worked on was really the basis upon which a lot \nof us thought it made sense to begin working on a joint venture, the \nRenewal Alliance agenda that we are presenting today.\n  I would like to discuss a piece of legislation that has to do with an \nimportant part of the Renewal Alliance agenda. This is a bill which \nprovides economic empowerment in economically distressed areas. It is \npart of an effort by a number of us who wish to bring about the \nrevitalization of economically and socially distressed areas in our \ncountry, especially in our cities.\n  Traditional responses to persistent poverty have not been \nparticularly effective. Frankly, even in the best of economic times, we \nfind that certain parts of our communities still don't see significant \nchange and feel that they are left behind--and indeed they are,\n\n[[Page S3717]]\n\neconomically. On the other hand, at the other end of the spectrum there \nhas been the Government solution approach that we have seen over the \nlast several decades, more than $5 trillion in Government programs. \nYet, we have seen very little change in the level of poverty in the \ncountry. The fact is that the debate that has occurred over the past 30 \nyears between, on the one hand, the argument that all we need is a \nstrong economy and, on the other hand, all we need are more Government \nprograms, leaves us still short of the mark.\n  So what the Renewal Alliance has attempted to do is look beyond those \ntraditional responses, believing that across America people have an \nabundance of desire to help the less fortunate to rebuild our cities \nand stop moral decay; also believing that too often the Federal \nGovernment impedes or fails to promote the community renewal that we \nneed.\n  We must encourage families, churches, small businesses, and community \norganizations to take on the hard work of social renewal. How? By \nreducing Government barriers that are making it difficult for \neconomically distressed areas to improve the quality and conditions of \nlife there and, at the same time, providing incentives so that the \nculture and the private sector can assist the Government in achieving \nthis objective. Yes, we do need a social safety net for the truly \ndeserving, but that will never give people the opportunity to get out \nthe economically distressed conditions they find themselves in. We must \ngo further.\n  So what I would like to talk about specifically now is the economic \nempowerment component of the Renewal Alliance agenda. What we need are \nnew approaches to our urban problems and problems of any community in \nthe country that suffers from economic disadvantage because, as I say, \ndespite the War on Poverty, our cities still face an array of problems.\n  Illegitimacy in our inner cities is at a record high level, in some \nareas exceeding 80 percent.\n  Harvard's Lee Rainwater estimates that by 2000, 40 percent of all \nAmerican births will occur out of wedlock. And our cities are losing \npopulation, as well.\n  Since the mid-1960s, our largest 25 cities have lost approximately 4 \nmillion residents. Too often, the people left behind are the poor.\n  Half the people in our distressed inner cities lived below the \npoverty line in 1993.\n  To address this tragic situation, we propose the ``REAL Life Economic \nEmpowerment Act.'' This legislation would target America's 100 poorest \ncommunities and offer pro-growth incentives to create jobs and spur \nentrepreneurship where it is needed most.\n  In order to become a renewal community, a community must meet several \ncriteria. First, it must need the assistance. That means people in the \narea must be experiencing abnormally high rates of poverty and \nunemployment.\n  Second, State and local governments must enter into a written \ncontract with neighborhood organizations to reduce taxes and fees, \nincrease the efficiency of local services, formulate and implement \ncrime reduction strategies, and make it easier for charities to \noperate.\n  Third, the community must agree not to enforce a number of \nrestrictions on entry into business or occupations, including \nunnecessary licensing and zoning requirements.\n  In exchange, the community would receive a number of benefits from \nthe Federal level. Our legislation would zero out capital gains taxes \nwithin these empowerment areas, it would increase business expensing, \nit would give a 20 percent wage credit to businesses hiring qualified \nworkers who were still employed after 6 months, and it would provide \ntax incentives for entrepreneurs who clean up environmentally \ncontaminated ``brownfield'' sites.\n\n  Unlike the administration's current ``empowerment zones,'' our \nincentives recognize that it is the private sector, not the Federal \nGovernment, that must be part of any effort to revitalize our \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, there will be no boards established to dole out \nGovernment patronage, and our legislation will not include the onerous \nconditions and bureaucratic requirements of current programs. What is \nmore, States and localities will be joining the Federal Government in \nreducing the burden of Government so that local small businesses can \nstart and grow in distressed areas.\n  We know that it is these small businesses, from barber shops to local \ngrocery stores, that often serve as the glue holding communities \ntogether. Not only do these small businesses provide jobs, they also \nprovide places where people can meet one another to exchange news and \nkeep in touch with local events and other job opportunities. It is \ncrucial that we seed our distressed areas with businesses like these so \nthat residents can pull their communities together and work toward a \nbetter life.\n  Mr. President, in short, what we hope to do with our legislation is \nto provide the incentives so that small entrepreneurial enterprises can \ndevelop in areas where there is currently significant economic \ndistress. Therefore, the jobs being created will be created where the \npeople are who don't have jobs. Right now, the biggest impediment to \ncreating jobs is to create conditions in which entrepreneurship can \nexist. That means cleaning up contaminated brownfield sites, it means \nproviding access to capital so small businesses can begin and flourish, \nit means making sure that Government regulations and rules aren't so \nburdensome and onerous that even the best-intentioned small business \nperson can't even open their enterprise. The only way that is going to \nhappen is if we have State, local, and Federal teams working together \nin the fashion that our legislation suggests.\n  The suggestion that this can work is, I think, abundantly clear if \none looks to just existing examples of this going on in the country \ntoday. In our State of Michigan, under Governor John Engler, we have \nlaunched several extraordinarily interesting initiatives along these \nlines--one called the Renaissance Zone Concept, which essentially does \nthe same thing we are proposing in this legislation; it just doesn't \nhave the Federal component. Obviously, the State could not include us \nin the mix. But what the State has done is to say that, within a \ncertain number of zones in the State, in economically distressed \nareas--and they range from inner-cities to rural areas, Mr. President--\nwe will dramatically reduce the burdens of taxes and regulations in \norder to try to stimulate economic development. And we are doing that \nwith tremendous results.\n  Another approach that is somewhat similar is being done in an effort \nto get people off of the welfare rolls and onto the job rolls. In fact, \nwe have a country in Michigan which, because of this kind of State and \nlocal cooperative effort, the county of over 200,000 people has \nvirtually nobody left on the welfare rolls because of the innovative \napproach that is being taken.\n  It is time to learn from these ``laboratories,'' these experiences at \nthe State level. We believe this legislation moves us in that \ndirection. So as we proceed forward with this Renewal Alliance agenda, \nI intend to work very hard on that component of it to find us economic \nempowerment. We want to give the Members of the Senate a chance to \ndecide whether or not the business-as-usual approach is the way we want \nto enter the 21st century, or whether we want to augment what we do in \nFederal programs, as well as private sector initiatives, by providing, \nthrough the legislation we will offer, an opportunity to reduce the \nimpediments to starting new business opportunities in our economically \ndistressed areas, as well as providing incentives to create more of \nthose businesses that obviously provide more people with a chance to \nget on the first rung of the economic ladder.\n  Mr. President, let me conclude, because other members of the Alliance \nare here. I thank Senator Coats for his leadership on this. I look \nforward to working with all of our colleagues as we try to move this \nagenda forward this year.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for his \ninvaluable contributions to this effort. I now turn to another key \nmember of our Renewal Alliance, someone who has offered additional \ninvaluable contributions, for further explanation of the package we are \nintroducing, Senator Santorum of Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S3718]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer for his \nrecognition.\n  Mr. President, let me thank Senator Coats for his tremendous \nleadership on what is, really, a new paradigm. Those listening to the \ndebate on the Senate floor and the discussion of the Renewal Alliance \nagenda--renewal, empowerment, achievement learning for life--may be \nhearing some things for the first time, as to a different approach.\n  One of the things that I know Senator Coats talked about and, in a \nsense, schooled many of us in here on this side of the aisle and on the \nother side of the aisle, I might add, is the importance of \nunderstanding the problems of this country, the real intractable \nproblems, the ones that we sort of don't believe that there are any \nquick fixes to and are not going to be fixed in Washington. In fact, \nmany of us would argue that many were exacerbated by attempts by \nWashington to fix those problems.\n  As a result of Senator Coats' urgings, the more I have gotten out \ninto the neighborhoods in the last few years--poor neighborhoods, in \nparticular, in Pennsylvania--to see what works and what doesn't: What \nare people doing at the local level that is making a difference in \npeople's lives, that is taking absolute hopelessness and despair and \nturning it into productivity and optimism?\n  What I see is that, almost without exception, they are not Government \nprograms and, almost without exception, they don't take Government \ndollars because, in so doing, it would corrupt what works for them \nbecause the Government would have some way of dictating to them how \nthis program must work or what hoops they must jump through. And they \nhave designed a program that meets the needs of the people in that \ncommunity, designed by people in that community who have, in many, if \nnot most, cases experienced the same kind of hopelessness and despair \nbefore they arrived where they are today--in a state of now helping \nthose come out of the problems they have.\n  So what I have learned from my discussions with those very people is \nthat we need to look here in Washington as to how we can help them, \nhelp them do the mission--and it is a mission, it is not a job. I don't \nknow of anybody I have met in these communities who is making any \nmoney, who is getting a good night's sleep at night, who is profiting \nin any real financial way from, or any tangible way from, their work, \nbut profiting enormously in the intangibles that are, frankly, the most \nsatisfying.\n  It is a true labor of love for people in these communities, whether \nthey are in the economic development area, or in the community \ndevelopment area, or in dealing with homelessness, or abused women, or \ndoing a charter school, or running a small parochial school. Whatever \nthe case may be, these are people who are convicted, who care deeply--\nnot about education, not about homelessness, not about drug abuse; they \ncare about that person sitting across the table from them. It is not a \nmacroissue. It is a one-to-one, person-to-person challenge to save \nsomeone's life. They do it because they care. They do it because they \nlove that person. That is the magic that no Government program can \nprovide.\n  What Dan Coats, Spencer Abraham, and Sam Brownback--those of us who \nare members of the alliance having looked into the eyes of those who \ncare, not those who appropriate money here in Washington who say we \ncare, but those who are there across the table shedding the tears, \nholding the hands, embracing those in real pain, those people who \ncare--how can we help them? How can we help the world ministries, the \nreal healing agents of our society to solve those intractable problems \nthat, believe it or not, they solve, and do so so well? How did we help \nthem do it better? How can we help them turn more lives around and \nreplicate the great accomplishments they have made to so many \nneighborhoods? There isn't a neighborhood in America where there is not \nat least one person or one organization--whether it is a school or \nwhether it is a rehab center or whether it is a homeless shelter or a \nsoup kitchen--that isn't touching and changing people.\n  We have come forward with this agenda that is not, as the speaker \nsaid before, a Washington-based solution to the problem. But it is, in \nfact, a way that Washington can, one, get out of the way; two, maybe \nhelp with some of the things in a legal sense to get out of the way; \nthree, give financial resources to those organizations that need those \nresources to either help the community or help the economy; and, next, \ngive resources to the hands of parents and children so they can have \nthe opportunity to hope through an education that gives them the tools \nto be able to be successful in our society.\n  But I am going to focus my couple of minutes more to talk in the area \nof education. I cannot tell you the number of employers I talked to \njust within the southeastern Pennsylvania area the other day, \nPhiladelphia. Employer after employer, factory or industry, they told \nme how they desperately need skilled people. They desperately need \npeople who are even semiskilled who can be trained. There are such \nshortages in the workplace today. Then I asked--the unemployment rate \nin the city of Philadelphia, the center city, or in Chester, or in \nLevittown, or places like that is very high, and there is available \nwork? They say, ``Yes, there is. We have job fares. We ask people to \napply, and they don't.'' I said, ``Why don't they?'' They said, ``Well, \nby and large, they don't have the education. They can't, in many cases, \nfill out applications, or they just simply don't have the education \nnecessary to even meet what is a minimal skilled job.''\n  The jobs are there. But we just do not have people who are educated \nenough to take advantage of those opportunities. That is, in fact, a \nshame, and, as a result of a variety of factors, a breakdown in the \nfamily, the breakdown in the community, and, yes, the breakdown of the \neducational structure.\n  There are lots of things we can do to solve the first two problems \nthat have been talked about. I am going to talk about the third, which \nis the breakdown of the education structure. I am not going to profess \nto you I have the answer--the silver bullet to make public education \nwork in America's poor neighborhoods. I do not have a silver bullet. I \ncan sit up here and suggest a variety of things that may or may not \nwork to solve that intractable problem in educating poor students in \npoor schools. I do not have that answer off the top of my head. What I \ndo have is a solution that will give children and families the \nopportunity to send their child to school where they can get a good \neducation tomorrow. We have to step back and say, ``Well, is that good \nenough?'' Some may say, ``Senator, you are not solving the big problem \ntomorrow in public education in the poor neighborhoods of our \ncountry.'' I will answer, You are right. I am not. I am not going to \nsolve that problem tomorrow. But what I am going to start to do today \nis to give that young person who may have a dream, or that mother or \nfather who sees the spark in that young child's eye and believes that \nspark can lead them to somewhere in life if given the educational \ntools. I am going to give them the chance to get that child a chance. \nThat is all we can do right now--to give them a scholarship, to send \nthem to a school where they will have the opportunity to see that spark \ncatch fire, to feed them what they need to take on the world.\n\n  Our program, called Educational Opportunities for Low-Income \nFamilies, is to provide scholarships through existing block grants that \ngo to the States right now. We would allow that block grant to be used \nfor scholarships to go to low-income children and 185 percent of \npoverty and below in the poorest neighborhoods in our country so that \nit will give low-income kids in poor neighborhoods the opportunity to \nhave a scholarship that pays up to 60 percent of the cost of their \ntuition and would give them the opportunity to go to school and learn. \nI think it is a great opportunity for us to help one child at a time. I \nbelieve that in the long run helping one child at a time and giving \nthat choice will, in fact, cause dramatic reforms in the whole \neducational system in those communities.\n  I have been given the high sign here. I will follow my chairman's \nlead. Again, I thank Senator Coats for his tremendous leadership on \nthis.\n\n[[Page S3719]]\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, it is very difficult to ask the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania to wrap up his remarks because he, obviously, has \nsuch a deep-felt and heartfelt passion for these issues. I appreciate \nhis work with us. We are under some time constraint.\n  I now turn the floor over to the Senator from Kansas, Senator \nBrownback, who has also been a very key instrumental member of the \ndevelopment of this package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much. Mr. President, I am delighted to \nbe able to work with the distinguished Senator from Kansas, who is \npresiding today, and also the distinguished Senator from Indiana, who \nhas put forth this new alliance. It is a cadre of members who are \nputting forth these points that we think have not been sufficiently \ndebated nor brought forward in the overall debate in America about what \nwe should do about the crying issues of poverty that has so hit and \nharmed our Nation in so many places, both urban and rural.\n  More than 30 years after the United States first declared the War on \nPoverty, most signs point to failure. The United States has spent \nhundreds of billions of dollars--by some accounts we have spent nearly \n$4 trillion--to fight poverty only to find poverty in America has grown \nmore widespread, more entrenched, and more pathological. The solution \nis not to expand more Government but rather to go a different way, and \nto say, ``Look, we have tried that route. We have spent nearly $4 \ntrillion trying that route. We have tried every program you possibly \ncan with that route. Maybe there is another way that we should be \ngoing.''\n  This is what the Renewal Alliance, this program, is about--about \nrewarding self-help and not Government help. It is about encouraging \ncharity rather than encouraging Government. It is about encouraging \nvolunteerism rather than putting more people on the taxpayer rolls to \nsolve problems that we have failed to be able to solve. Family \nbreakdown, crime, poor education performance, and a lack of opportunity \nin the inner cities, and many other areas, including many rural areas, \nare now national problems. But many of the solutions are to be found on \na local level and not in Washington, through personal contacts that \npeople can make between individuals and the dedicated involvement of \nfamilies, churches, schools, and neighborhood associations. These small \ngroups, not big Government, but rather small groups, often referred to \nas the ``little platoons'' in a civil society, can often accomplish \nwhat no Government program could dream of or ever been able to do. They \nhave the soft hearts and the willing hands to be able to reach out and \ntouch people directly in a community where they are in there with the \nfamilies working with them.\n\n  Last December, I had the chance to visit several of these small, \nprivate charities in my home State of Kansas. To me, they are living \nproof of the amazing effectiveness of small, local charities that lead \nwith heart, that lead with love.\n  Mr. President, in this very body, in this very room, as you enter \ninto the main doorway coming in here, there is a sign above the door \nmantle which reads ``In God We Trust.'' As I visited these small \ncharities in Kansas, I was reminded at that time and was thinking about \nhow many people say that versus how many people do that. These are \ncharities, which ``In God We Trust'' they live every day.\n  I visited Good Samaritan Clinic in Wichita, which serves around 300 \npatients a month from Wichita's poorest neighborhood. This tiny clinic \noperates on less than a shoestring budget. With the exception of a fax \nmachine and one piece of furniture, everything in the clinic is \ndonated. The clinic's staff, a dedicated and accomplished group of \ndoctors, are mostly volunteers. They are reaching out and touching \npeople, and helping and healing people with their skills and with their \nhearts.\n  I visited the Topeka Rescue Mission and the Union Rescue Mission of \nWichita, both of which serve thousands of people each year.\n  These missions are not merely assigning people to bunks, but they \nchallenge them personally and spiritually, and they are challenged to \nchange their hearts and their souls along with helping them out in \ntheir lives.\n  I visited the Crisis Pregnancy Outreach Program in Topeka and a \nmaternity home in Wichita and saw firsthand the love and personal \nattention devoted to each woman who passes through those doors.\n  Contrast that with the large Government solution that we have tried \nfor the past 30 years that gets millions of people flowing through the \ndoor but constantly keeps them flowing back out the door and never \nreally changes things in a person's life, continues to hand them \nsomething but doesn't put arms around them and hug them, doesn't put \narms around them and give them heart and soul and say, ``Here is my \nphone number; call anytime.''\n  It is not that we don't have a lot of good and dedicated servants; we \ndo, but they are limited in what they can do. This is a mission for \nthem. They must not see the number of people who are walking through; \nthey must see a soul at a time. They must see another and another, to \nreach out and touch and help them. We need to encourage these groups \nand not discourage them.\n  As the past 35 years of our history has shown, the Federal Government \nis limited in its capacity to solve the problems of poverty and \npathology, But it can eliminate perverse incentives that reward \nirresponsibility and fuel the flight of capital from the inner cities, \nand it can encourage entrepreneurialism, charitable giving and \ninvestment in the inner cities and its inhabitants, investment in the \ninhabitants of those areas and rural areas as well. It can do these \nthings and it should. And through the renewal alliance REAL Life \nlegislation, it will.\n  That is why I am delighted to be associated with the Senator from \nIndiana in this package that we have put forward. It is a different \nway. It is a way that people every day are proving can and is working, \nand we need to encourage it and lift it up and move it forward. I am \ndelighted to be a part of this legislation.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for his \ninvaluable support and effort in helping craft this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I know the time allocated to us is just about up.\n  I send to the desk three pieces of legislation, one that I am \nintroducing, another that Senator Abraham is introducing, and a third \nthat Senator Santorum is introducing, all of which encompass the three \nmajor components of the renewal alliance package. I would ask for its \nimmediate referral.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent if it is possible--a \nqualified unanimous consent request--to have these numbered \nsequentially since these three pieces of legislation are part of a \npackage. If it is possible, we would like to have them numbered \nconsecutively.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection? The Chair hears none, \nand the bills will be so numbered. They will be received and \nappropriately referred.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I believe that wraps up our time. I think \nthe Senator from Iowa is in the Chamber prepared to speak within a \nmoment or two. Let me ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes to \nwrap up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 additional remaining on his \ntime.\n  Mr. COATS. That is propitious then. The Senator will take all 2 of \nthose minutes. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, in summary, let me state that what we are attempting \nto accomplish here is a third alternative. We believe that the well-\nintentioned, well-motivated programs of the past, at great cost to the \ntaxpayers, have failed to successfully address some of the most \ndifficult social problems facing our Nation, and particularly problems \nfacing low-income urban communities where in many situations nothing \nbut crime and drugs are the prevalent activities of those \norganizations. By the same token, the argument that no Federal policy \nis the best policy to address these problems is something that we as a \ngroup cannot accept.\n  We think this third alternative, providing REAL Life meaningful \nsolutions to the areas of community renewal, economic empowerment and \neducational opportunities for low-income families offers real hope. It \ndoes so not through Government organizations,\n\n[[Page S3720]]\n\nGovernment structures or even significant Government funding. It does \nso by encouraging those community volunteer, nonprofit, often faith-\nbased organizations that already exist and should exist in greater \nnumbers to take a much greater role in addressing these problems. We \nwant to make the Federal Government not the dominant partner but a \njunior partner, an entity that can assist through the provision of Tax \nCode changes, primarily tax credits and other incentives, to encourage \nindividuals and other organizations to contribute to these nonprofit \ngroups to allow them to do a better job. They have demonstrated success \nat an efficiency rate and at a cost-effectiveness that far exceeds \nthose current programs in place.\n  Are we calling for a dismantling of the safety net? No, we are not. \nWe are calling for a better use of dollars, a better commitment, \nstronger commitment to organizations which have demonstrated real \nsuccess in providing hope to individuals, transformation and renewal of \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, I believe the time is probably expired, and with that \nI yield the floor and encourage my colleagues to take a look at the \nREAL Life Renewal Alliance initiative which we are happy to provide and \ndiscuss with our colleagues.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Faircloth):\n  S. 1997. A bill to protect the right of a member of a health \nmaintenance organization to receive continuing care at a facility \nselected by that member; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n         THE ``SENIORS' ACCESS TO CONTINUING CARE ACT OF 1998''\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Seniors' \nAccess to Continuing Care Act of 1998'', a bill to protect seniors' \naccess to treatment in the setting of their choice and to ensure that \nseniors who reside in continuing care communities, and nursing and \nother facilities have the right to return to that facility after a \nhospitalization.\n  As our population ages, more and more elderly will become residents \nof various long term care facilities. These include independent living, \nassisted living and nursing facilities, as well as continuing care \nretirement communities, which provide the entire continuum of care. In \nMaryland alone, there are over 12,000 residents in 32 continuing care \nretirement communities and 24,000 residents in over 200 licenced \nnursing facilities.\n  I have visited many of these facilities and have heard from both \nresidents and operators. They have told me about a serious and \nunexpected problem encountered with returning to their facility after a \nhospitalization. Many individuals have little choice when entering a \nnursing facility. They do so because it is medically necessary, because \nthey need a high level of care that they can no longer receive in their \nhomes or in a more independent setting, such as assisted living. But \nresidents are still able to form relationships with other residents and \nstaff and consider the facility their ``home''.\n  More and more individuals and couples are choosing to enter \ncontinuing care communities because of the community environment they \nprovide. CCRC's provide independent living, assisted living and nursing \ncare, usually on the same campus--the Continuum of Care. Residents find \nsafety, security and peace of mind. They often prepay for the continuum \nof care. Couples can stay together, and if one spouse needs additional \ncare, it can be provided right there, where the other spouse can remain \nclose by.\n  But hospitalization presents other challenges. Hospitalization is \ntraumatic for anyone, but particularly for our vulnerable seniors. We \nknow that having comfortable surroundings and familiar faces can aid \ndramatically in the recovery process. So, we should do everything we \ncan to make sure that recovery process is not hindered.\n  Today, more and more seniors are joining managed care plans. This \ntrend is likely to accelerate given the expansion of managed care \nchoices under the 1997 Balanced Budget Act. As more and more decisions \nare made based on financial considerations, choice often gets lost. \nCurrently, a resident of a continuing care retirement community or a \nnursing facility who goes to the hospital has no guarantee that he or \nshe will be allowed by the MCO to return to the CCRC or nursing \nfacility for post acute follow up care.\n  The MCO can dictate that the resident go to a different facility that \nis in the MCO network for that follow up care, even if the home \nfacility is qualified and able to provide the needed care.\n  Let me give you a few examples:\n  In the fall of 1996, a resident of Applewood Estates in Freehold, New \nJersey was admitted to the hospital. Upon discharge, her HMO would not \npermit her to return to Applewood and sent her to another facility in \nJackson. The following year, the same thing happened, but after strong \nprotest, the HMO finally relented and permitted her to return to \nApplewood. She should not have had to protest, and many seniors are \nunable to assert themselves.\n  A Florida couple in their mid-80's were separated by a distance of 20 \nmiles after the wife was discharged from a hospital to an HMO-\nparticipating nursing home located on the opposite side of the county. \nThis was a hardship for the husband who had difficulty driving and for \nthe wife who longed to return to her home, a CCRC. The CCRC had room in \nits skilled nursing facility on campus. Despite pleas from all those \ninvolved, the HMO would not allow the wife to recuperate in a familiar \nsetting, close to her husband and friends. She later died at the HMO \nnursing facility, without the benefit of frequent visits by her husband \nand friends.\n  An elderly couple in Riverside, California encountered the same \nproblem when the husband was discharged from the hospital and retained \nagainst her will at the HMO skilled nursing facility instead of the \ncouple's community. At 25 miles apart, it was impossible for his wife \nand friends to visit at a time when he needed the tenderness and \ncompassion of loved ones.\n  Another Florida woman, a resident of a CCRC fractured her hip. Her \nHMO wanted her to move into a nursing home for treatment. She refused \nto abandon her home and received the treatment at the CCRC. Her HMO \nrefused to pay for the treatment, so she had to pay out of her pocket.\n  Collington Episcopal Life Care Community, in my home state of \nMaryland, reports ongoing problems with its frail elderly having to \nobtain psychiatric services, including medication monitoring, off \ncampus, even though the services are available at Collington--how \ndisruptive to good patient care!\n  On a brighter note, an Ohio woman's husband was in a nursing \nfacility. When she was hospitalized, and then discharged, she was able \nto be admitted to the same nursing facility because of the Ohio law \nthat protected that right.\n  Seniors coming out of the hospital should not be passed around like a \nbaton. Their care should be decided based on what is clinically \nappropriate, not what is financially mandated. Why is that important? \nWhat are the consequences?\n  Residents consider their retirement community or long term care \nfacility as their home. And being away from home for any reason can be \nvery difficult. The trauma of being in unfamiliar surroundings can \nincrease recovery time. The staff of the resident's ``home'' facility \noften knows best about the person's chronic care and service needs. \nBeing away from ``home'' separates the resident from his or her \nemotional support system.\n  Refusal to allow a resident to return to his or her home takes away \nthe person's choice. All of this leads to greater recovery time and \nunnecessary trauma for the patient.\n  And should a woman's husband have to hitch a ride or catch a cab in \norder to see his recovering spouse if the facility where they live can \nprovide the care? No. Retirement communities and other long term care \nfacilities are not just health care facilities. They provide an entire \nliving environment for their residents, in other words, a home. We need \nto protect the choice of our seniors to return to their ``home'' after \na hospitalization. And that is what my bill does.\n  It protects residents of CCRC's and nursing facilities by: enabling \nthem to return to their facility after a hospitalization; and requiring \nthe resident's insurer or managed care organization (MCO) to cover the \ncost of the care, even if the insurer does not have a contract with the \nresident's facility.\n\n[[Page S3721]]\n\n  In order for the resident to return to the facility and have the \nservices covered by the insurer or MCO: 1. The service to be provided \nmust be a service that the insurer covers; 2. The resident must have \nresided at the facility before hospitalization, have a right to return, \nand choose to return; 3. The facility must have the capacity to provide \nthe necessary service and meet applicable licensing and certification \nrequirements of the state; 4. The facility must be willing to accept \nsubstantially similar payment as a facility under contract with the \ninsurer or MCO.\n  My bill also requires an insurer or MCO to pay for a service to one \nof its beneficiaries, without a prior hospital stay, if the service is \nnecessary to prevent a hospitalization of the beneficiary and the \nservice is provided as an additional benefit. Lastly, the bill requires \nan insurer or MCO to provide coverage to a beneficiary for services \nprovided at a facility in which the beneficiary's spouse already \nresides, even if the facility is not under contract with the MCO, \nprovided the other requirements are met.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I am committed to providing a safety \nnet for our seniors--this bill is part of that safety net. Seniors \ndeserve quality, affordable health care and they deserve choice. This \nbill offers those residing in retirement communities and long term care \nfacilities assurance to have their choices respected, to have where \nthey reside recognized as their ``home'', and to be permitted to return \nto that ``home'' after a hospitalization. It ensures that spouses can \nbe together as long as possible. And it ensures access to care in order \nto prevent a hospitalization. I urge my colleagues to join me in \npassing this important measure to protect the rights of seniors and \ntheir access to continuing care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1998. A bill to authorize an interpretive center and related \nvisitor facilities within the Four Corners Monument Tribal Park, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                THE FOUR CORNERS INTERPRETIVE CENTER ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould authorize an interpretive center and visitor facilities at the \nFour Corners National Monument. As my colleagues know, Four Corners is \nthe only place in our country where four state boundaries meet. Over a \nquarter of a million people visit this monument every year.\n  The Four Corners area is also unique for reasons other than the \npolitical boundaries of four states. Once inhabited by the earliest \nAmericans, the Anaxazi, this area is rich in historical, \narchaeological,and cultural significance as well as natural beauty.\n  Currently, however, there is nothing at Four Corners that would help \nvisitors to fully appreciate and learn about the area. And, at a \nnational monument that has 250,000 visitors a year, one would expect \ncertain basic facilities to exist--restrooms, for example. But, there \nis no electricity, running water, telephone, or permanent structure at \nFour Corners.\n  The bill I am introducing today is simple: We propose a Federal \nmatching grant to build an interpretive center and visitor facilities \nwithin the boundaries of Four Corners Monument Tribal Park.\n  We are not suggesting a museum the size of the Guggenheim. But, \nexhibits on the history, geography, culture, and ecology of the region \nwould significantly enhance the area and Americans' appreciation of \nthis unique part of their country and their heritage. And, I daresay \nthat some very basic guest amenities would enhance their enjoyment of \nit.\n  There is, as you can imagine, a great deal of excitement and \nenthusiasm for this project from many fronts. Currently, the Monument \nis operated as one of the units of the Navajo Nation Parks and \nRecreation Department. And, since there has been so much debate about \n``monuments'' recently, I should clarify that the Four Corners \n``Monument'' is merely a slightly elevated concrete slab at the \njuncture of our four states.\n  The Navajo Nation owns the land in the Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah \nquarters and the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe owns the quarter in Colorado. \nAlthough the Navajo Nation and the Ute Mountain Ute Tribe are fully \nsupportive of the project and have entered into an agreement with one \nanother in order to facilitate planning and development at the Four \nCorners Monument, neither Tribe has the necessary resources to improve \nthe facilities and create an interpretive center at the Monument.\n  The bill, however, does not contemplate federal government give-away. \nThe bill requires matching funds from nonfederal sources and for the \ntwo tribes to work collaboratively toward the development of a \nfinancial management plan. It is intended that the Interpretive Center \nbecome fully self-sufficient within five years.\n  The bill requires that proposals meeting the stated criteria be \nsubmitted to the Secretary of the Interior. These criteria include, \namong other things, compliance with the existing agreements between the \nNavajo and Ute Mountain Ute Tribes, a sound financing plan, and the \ncommitment of nonfederal matching funds. The federal contribution would \nnot exceed $2.25 million over a 5 year period.\n\n  Over the past several years, the Navajo Nation has met with many of \nthe local residents of the area and has found overwhelming support to \nimprove the quality of the services provided at the Four Corners \nMonument. The local area suffers an unemployment rate of over 50 \npercent and any development which would create employment opportunities \nand would encourage visitors to stay longer in the area would be \nwelcomed.\n  Another important participant in the development of this proposal is \nthe Four Corners Heritage Council. This Council, which was established \nin 1992 by the governors of the four states, is a coalition of private, \ntribal, federal, state, and local government interests committed to \nfinding ways to make the economy of the Four Corners region sustainable \ninto the future. The mission of the Heritage Council is to guide the \nregion toward a balance of the sometimes competing interests of \neconomic development, resource preservation, and maintenance of \ntraditional life ways.\n  Back in 1949, nearly 50 years ago, the governors of the states of \nArizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah assembled at the Four Corners \nin a historic meeting. Each governor sat in their respective state and \nhad what is probably the most unusual picnic lunch in history. They \npledged to meet often at the Four Corners Monument to reaffirm their \ncommitment to working together. Clearly, the governors understood that \nthey shared stewardship of a unique piece of western real estate.\n  Mr. President, the heritage of this area belongs to all Americans. \nThe small investment requested in this legislation will help bring it \nto life.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1998\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to co-sponsor \nthis important legislation introduced by my friend from Utah, Senator \nHatch. The bill authorizes the construction of an interpretive visitor \ncenter at the Four Corners Monument. As I am sure\n\n[[Page S3723]]\n\nall senators know, the Four Corners is the only place in America where \nthe boundaries of four states meet in one spot. The monument is located \non the Navajo and Ute Mountain Ute Reservations and operated as a \nTribal Park. Nearly a quarter of a million people visit this unique \nsite every year. However, currently there are no facilities for \ntourists at the park and nothing that explains the very special \nfeatures of the Four Corners region. The bill authorizes the Department \nof the Interior to contribute $2 million toward the construction of a \nmuch needed interpretive center for visitors.\n  Mr. President, the Four Corners Monument is more than a geographic \ncuriosity. It also serves as a focal point for some of the most \nbeautiful landscape and significant cultural attractions in our \ncountry. An interpretive center will help visitors appreciate the many \nspecial features of the region. For example, within a short distance of \nthe monument are the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde, Colorado; the Red \nRock and Natural Bridges areas of Utah; and in Arizona, Monument Valley \nand Canyon de Chelly. The beautiful San Juan River, one of the top \ntrout streams in the Southwest, flows through Colorado, New Mexico, and \nUtah.\n  In my state of New Mexico, both the legendary mountain known as \nShiprock and the Chaco Canyon Culture National Historical Park are a \nshort distance from the Four Corners.\n  Mr. President, Shiprock is one of the best known and most beautiful \nlandmarks in New Mexico. The giant volcanic monolith rises nearly 2,000 \nfeet straight up from the surrounding plain. Ancient legend tells us \nthe mountain was created when a giant bird settled to earth and turned \nto stone. In the Navajo language, the mountain is named Tse' bi t'ai or \nthe Winged Rock. Early Anglo settlers saw the mountain's soaring spires \nand thought they resembled the sails of a huge ship, so they named it \nShiprock.\n  The Four Corners is also the site of Chaco Canyon. Chaco was an \nimportant Anasazi cultural center from about 900 through 1130 A.D. Pre-\nColumbian civilization in the Southwest reached its greatest \ndevelopment there. The massive stone ruins, containing hundreds of \nrooms, attest to Chaco's cultural importance. As many as 7,000 people \nmay have lived at Chaco at one time. Some of the structures are thought \nto house ancient astronomical observatories to mark the passage of the \nseasons. The discovery of jewelry from Mexico and California and a vast \nnetwork of roads is evidence of the advanced trading carried on at \nChaco. Perhaps, the most spectacular accomplishment at Chaco was in \narchitecture. Pueblo Bonito, the largest structure, contains more than \n800 rooms and 32 kivas. Some parts are more than five stories high. The \nmasonry work is truly exquisite. Stones were so finely worked and \nfitted together that no mortar was needed. Remarkably all this was \naccomplished without metal tools or the wheel.\n  Mr. President, 1999 marks the centennial year of the first monument \nat the Four Corners. An interpretive center is urgently needed today to \nshowcase the history, culture, and scenery of this very special place. \nNew facilities at the monument will attract visitors and help stimulate \neconomic development throughout the region. I am pleased to co-sponsor \nthis bill with Senator Hatch, and I thank him for his efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, over the past year, some \nremarkable developments have taken place at the University of South \nDakota (USD) involving the advancement of public service. The South \nDakota Board of Regents has designated the University as a public \nservice center of excellence,'' the Farber Fund which is committed to \nassisting students with experiences helpful to a future in public \nservice has continued to grow, and the University's political science \nprogram has prospered.\n  There are a great many people responsible for these positive \ndevelopments, but undoubtedly the person who has contributed the most, \nboth in terms of effort and vision, has been Dr. W.O. Farber. I have a \nspecial fondness for Bill Farber because he was chairman of the USD \npolitical science department (then referred to as the government \ndepartment'') when I was completing my undergraduate work there, and \nlater Dr. Farber was instrumental in assisting me with my graduate \nstudies. But beyond personal friendship, Dr. Farber has become an \nunequaled institution in our state--a voice for reason, progress and \nintegrity respected by all.\n  Dr. Farber presented an important lecture this past year at the \ndedication of Farber Hall in the beautifully restored Old Main on the \nUSD campus. I believe that all Americans would benefit from Dr. \nFarber's wisdom shared with us at that time and also by the Farber \nTestament'' which dates to our nation's bicentennial in 1976.\n  Mr. President, I ask that excerpts of Dr. Farber's speech, ``The \nChallenge of Public Service'' and the Farber Testament be printed in \nthe Record.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to recognize the \ncontributions Dr. Farber has made to the advancement of public service \nand I encourage all of my colleagues to take the time to read these \nimportant observations.\n  The material follows:\n\n              Excerpts of the Challenge of Public Service\n\n  (By Dr. William O. Farber, Professor Emeritus (Political Science), \n                      University of South Dakota)\n\n       Note.--This lecture, presented August 1, 1997, was the \n     first to be given in the newly dedicated Farber Hall in Old \n     Main. Dr. Farber was introduced by President James Abbott.\n\n       USD Alumni and Friends: As you may well imagine, this \n     moment has been on my mind for a long time. H.G. Wells, the \n     fabled historian of my generation, once described the\n\n[[Page S3726]]\n\n     eternal tragedy of a teacher to be that a teacher is a sower \n     of ``unseen harvests.''\n       Today, I have the greatest of good fortune. For I am able \n     to witness a ``seen harvest.'' In my wildest fantasy I never \n     thought that some day, on a single spot, I would witness such \n     an assembly of those who, during a sixty-year period, would \n     have brought me such inspiration, challenge, and \n     satisfaction. It is a great day, in this building, in this \n     hall, for us to celebrate.\n       This is certainly a special event for me for more than one \n     reason. There had been a rumor that there had never been a \n     Farber family, that I had appeared out of nowhere. Here this \n     afternoon are seven Farbers, including two brothers, my \n     special critics. I am especially happy they are here.\n       The presence of all of you makes me realize the \n     extraordinary nature of USD. The credentials of a university \n     are its alumni and, as I survey this audience, I appreciate \n     that the University of South Dakota has much of which to be \n     proud.\n       There are those who think that ``politics'' is a dirty word \n     and ``government'' is synonymous with incompetence. But you \n     know and I know better, that ``politics'' is determining the \n     problems facing the world and deciding what can be done to \n     improve humankind's lot, and ``government'' is the agency \n     through which, when individual efforts fail, we collectively \n     make our nation and world a better place in which to live. \n     And that is what democracy and public service are all about.\n       While you were a student and, even now, I think of us as \n     partners in a goal to improve government and the world. We \n     know that if government is bad, all other human endeavors \n     will fail. We subscribe to the Athenian oath that we will \n     seek to transmit our community to the next generation \n     greater, better, and more beautiful than it was transmitted \n     to us.\n       We are here today then as partners in an especially \n     important enterprise, as contributors, indispensable \n     contributors, who have made this renovation of Old Main and \n     this event possible. Many of you, like myself, have great \n     memories of this building. I believe a superior restoration \n     job has been done. I am especially proud of the Governors' \n     Balcony. The idea came to me in June 1996, when, on the \n     retirement of Bob Dole from the Senate, the decision was made \n     to designate a Senate Balcony as the Dole Balcony. USD has \n     had ten of its alumni serve as Governor of South Dakota--\n     Norbeck, Gunderson, Jensen, Sharpe, the two Mickelsons, \n     Anderson, Foss, Farrar, and Janklow. I have been fortunate in \n     knowing six of them. They serve as models of what can be \n     done. Students of the future can receive their inspiration in \n     this room as well as this building. We owe much to many.\n       Fortunately, USD now is at the threshold of what can be a \n     great future. It reminds me of Shakespeare's ``tide in the \n     affairs of men, which taken at the flood leads on to \n     fortune.'' We are now lucky to have a USD graduate as \n     president. I was tempted to say a ``coyote'' for president \n     but somehow that didn't seem quite right. Jim Abbott was a \n     political science major and is a member of the Farber Fund \n     Executive Board. One wonders why we didn't place more \n     emphasis on selecting one of our own sooner. Jim knows the \n     territory.\n       There are three other developments which bode well for USD \n     in achieving its goals. The Farber Fund is now approaching $1 \n     million in assets and it takes only my death to put it there. \n     (This is not a suggestion.)\n       The Fund has done much to stimulate ambition among our \n     students and cause them to heighten their goals. The second \n     development, thanks to Ray Aldrich, is the Chiesman Fund for \n     Civic Education, which has over $400,000 to promote civic \n     education through research and public forums. The third is \n     the selection, by the Board of Regents of the Political \n     Science Department's proposal, for a Leadership Training \n     program as a Center of Excellence providing some $340,000 \n     annually, including the recruitment of new staff.\n       Thus the Political Science Department and the University as \n     a whole have some unusual opportunities in the near future. \n     Already planned for next year is a lecture program, which \n     involves some of you. The initial response from alumni has \n     been excellent. Old Main is to be the center of student \n     activity, an emphasis much to my liking.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                         the background to know\n\n       What is this business about? It's about preparing ourselves \n     and others. There is an awful lot of garbage out there being \n     passed around as information, on the tube, on the web, on the \n     newsstand, and, indeed, in the classroom. We need to ask the \n     right questions. We need to determine priorities. We need to \n     help others to take little for granted.\n       I had a jolting experience with respect to the background \n     to know. I took a minor in education at Northwestern where I \n     received my BA and MA. To complete the minor, I took \n     ``practice teaching'' and had the luck to do my \n     ``practicing'' at New Trier High School in Winnetka, \n     Illinois. I was an understudy to Laura Ullrich. Although she \n     was a high school teacher, she had a Ph.D. In my evaluation \n     session with her, she was very laudatory, said I had good \n     command of the class, etc. But then she said, ``You have one \n     fault. You don't know your subject.'' That stinging rebuke I \n     have never forgotten. You do need to know your subject. The \n     need for the background to know is imperative. As part of the \n     background to know, you must learn and love to read and \n     write.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       My favorite quote is from Elizabeth Barrett Browning: \n     ``Every common bush is afire with God, but only he who knows, \n     takes off his shoes. The rest sit round it and eat \n     blackberries.'' The point is that it is possible to see in \n     every situation intriguing and challenging forces. But you \n     need to see. And that is what education is all about.\n       In addition to giving a stimulating lecture for all to hear \n     collectively, the teacher must provide individual \n     recognition. If a student calls for an appointment, I do my \n     best to say, ``Can you come over now.'' The student calls \n     when the problem is disturbing him. I like to go to class \n     early, walking down the aisle in large classes, to invite \n     access.\n       I came from a family with a strong work ethic. My dad, for \n     some 50 years, owned and worked in a grocery store. . . . I \n     worked in the store on Saturdays and summer during high \n     school and during summers through seven years of college.\n       The experiences in the grocery store taught me many things. \n     the first is the constant need to be a salesman, including of \n     yourself. When Mrs. Peterson came in the store with her list \n     of needs, I always thought, what does she really need that is \n     not on her list, and I made the applicable suggestion. Now, \n     when a student comes into my purview, I think what is a \n     potential career he or she has not thought about, which might \n     be even better than present goals?\n       In attaining goals it is important to give encouragement. \n     Some time ago, I was going to Pierre by plane from Sioux \n     Falls. A good looking fellow sat down beside me and said, \n     ``Do you remember me?'' I fumbled and said ``Your face is \n     familiar, but I do not recall your name.'' He identified \n     himself and then said, ``I want to tell you what you did for \n     me. Inside the cover of a bluebook, a test I had taken, you \n     wrote `It begins to look as though you are getting the hang \n     of it.' You have no idea how encouraged I felt at a time \n     I felt discouraged. I have gone on, graduated, and have a \n     successful business in Sioux Falls and Denver.'' I was \n     happy with the compliment, but then I thought of all the \n     other bluebooks that had deserved a similar statement. The \n     position of a teacher is a delicate one.\n       One of the things I have done at graduation time has been \n     to encourage students by rewarding them with a token gift. \n     Originally, it was a marble owl from Italy, later an onyx \n     turtle from Mexico, and more recently a Dedo gargoyle from \n     Notre Dame. This past year a former student called me from \n     Boston. ``Doc,'' he said, ``when you gave me a turtle, you \n     said, like the turtle you will only make progress when you \n     stick out your neck. Doc, I've made it, and I want you to \n     know I have kept that turtle in sight for twenty years.''\n       The background to know, fortunately is now easier to \n     acquire, but at the same time there is much more to know. \n     Thanks to technology we have greatly expanded our ability to \n     know. We have access to global knowledge almost instantly. \n     The shortcuts in acquiring knowledge are many and in this \n     fast world the shortcuts are necessary. If you wanted to, you \n     could get up from your seat, walk out on me here and read \n     parts of my speech later on the Farber Fund web page. In the \n     background to know, you must learn and love to read and write \n     and cherish the value of both. As educators and public \n     servants, we must not only acquire and dispense information, \n     but also develop in ourselves and in others the inner hunger \n     and imagination to use information meaningfully. Thus \n     research in all areas including political science is a must \n     and thankfully the USD Governmental Research Bureau, \n     established in 1939, still exists and continues to provide \n     needed studies in government. The Chiesman grant will make it \n     possible to expand our research activities. It is a wonderful \n     opportunity also for USD to promote civic education through \n     public forums not only in Vermillion but throughout the \n     state.\n\n\n                           the vision to see\n\n       The second important point is for one to have the vision to \n     see. The background to know provides the pieces of the \n     puzzle; as with a jigsaw puzzle, the vision to see puts the \n     pieces in their rightful places.\n       Vision often comes easily. There are obvious reforms that \n     should be made. In the early thirties Jane Addams, the \n     founder of Hull House in Chicago, pointed out the \n     ridiculousness of the American policy of killing little pigs \n     to decrease supply when we had a nation of 12,000,000 \n     unemployed and people starving. Justice Brandeis used to \n     plead for ``education in the obvious.''\n       I have been enchanted with how the devil took Jesus to the \n     top of a mountain to show him the kingdoms of the earth.\n       Thus from time to time we need to get to the mountaintops \n     and examine our own problems. Look at South Dakota. The \n     single most important political fact is our population size, \n     only a bit over 700,000, less than the population of cities \n     like Indianapolis, Phoenix, or San Antonio. Yet here we are \n     to govern the 700,000 saddled with 66 counties, 300 \n     municipalities, 900 township governments, and an \n     increasing number of special districts. It is just plain \n     nuts. Compared to Arizona with 16 counties, we should have \n     10 at most. Cities with populations of under 500 should be \n     disincorporated. And townships have long since lost their \n     reason for being.\n       E.A. Ross, a prominent University of Wisconsin sociologist, \n     once said, ``Rural Wisconsin resembles a dried up fish pond \n     with nothing but the bullheads and the suckers left behind.'' \n     I wouldn't put rural South Dakota in\n\n[[Page S3727]]\n\n     the same category as Wisconsin, but there is no doubt that \n     the drain out of population with two-thirds of our counties \n     losing population every census for the past thirty years has \n     caused a loss of leaders.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       It doesn't take too much vision to see that on the national \n     level we should make certain that every child up to age 18 \n     has adequate medical attention. And the tuition costs of \n     college students are a national disgrace. Even our best and \n     brightest are graduating with debts in many cases of more \n     than $50,000. If China and Cuba can provide free educational \n     and health costs, we, at least, could drastically reduce \n     tuition costs.\n       In 1935, when I came to South Dakota, I was impressed by \n     the vision of many of the local leaders. Governor Peter \n     Norbeck was still alive and his record of accomplishment and \n     his belief in what government could do was still remembered. \n     In Vermillion, in the midst of a depression, the town could \n     boast of a recently completed municipal swimming poll, a new \n     Union Building, and a new hospital.\n       I had the good fortune to know Doane Robinson quite well. \n     His vision of South Dakota included the building of the \n     Missouri River dams, widespread irrigation including much of \n     the land east of the Missouri and west of the Jim, extensive \n     electrical power almost certain to attract a Henry Ford \n     plant, and the use of the Missouri for transportation.\n       Many of these dreams have not been realized, but some have \n     been. I am impressed with the great potential South Dakota \n     has today. Look at Vermillion. The bridge to the south will \n     open up new economic possibilities along the river itself. \n     The example of Gateway stands out as an example for other \n     industries to emulate. The caliber of our labor supply, the \n     low crime rates, the quality of our labor supply, the low \n     crime rates, the quality of living, the educational system, \n     all make the state and its cities attractive places in which \n     to live. Now is the opportune time to set up think tanks in \n     South Dakota. Some of you have expressed a willingness to \n     serve.\n       What we need for many of our problems is thus the vision to \n     see. It is absurd to think that the governmental structure \n     the founding fathers created in 1787 in Philadelphia, scared \n     by a pending French revolution, is the best possible for the \n     year 2000. And that much of state and local government should \n     remain, two centuries later, relatively unchanged.\n       But there is another important ingredient to the vision to \n     see. It is to secure human rights and equality of \n     opportunity. One of the memorable events in my life was \n     sitting beside Phil LaFollette at a graduate political \n     science student session. We were considering at length First \n     Amendment rights. He turned to me and said, ``We are \n     discussing the wrong rights. More important than these are \n     the right to feel secure, have a decent job with just \n     compensation, the right to an education, a home and a \n     family.''\n       Thus, I think we can conclude that while education is the \n     basis of what we need to know and see, there is another \n     important ingredient, to think of human values and the need \n     to be caring. Life is not worth living if there is not a \n     constant concern for others. I am reminded of one of Senator \n     Karl Mundt's favorite quotes: ``The hermit of God who shuts \n     himself in, shuts out more of God, than he shuts in.''\n       One of the best ways to provide a new dimension to one's \n     vision to see is to be acquainted with a different culture. \n     That is why the encouragement given to students to travel \n     with funds from the Farber Fund has been so significant. One \n     of my favorite quotes, an inscription on the old Pennsylvania \n     Station in Washington, DC, is: ``He who would bring back the \n     wealth of the Indies must first take the wealth of the Indies \n     with him.'' The requirement of a report upon the student's \n     return has helped to implement that advice.\n\n\n                             the will to do\n\n       This brings me to my third and final point, the will to do. \n     Without action, without implementation, all else becomes \n     pointless. But most of us, burdened by needs of everyday \n     life, are reluctant to do more than will make our own life \n     more comfortable. The lesson from Toynbee is the need to \n     insure that our civilization, our government, reflects \n     citizen involvement, so that future developments of the \n     Hitler type can be and will be resisted. That demands \n     participation of a high order, the lack of which even now \n     threatens our government.\n       What I am pleading for is a will to do, not only for one's \n     own self but as well for one's community, one's state, one's \n     nation, and indeed, the world. None of us attains his fullest \n     potential. We can be more than we are. We should sacrifice \n     what we are for what we can become.\n       Winston Churchill said, ``we shall never surrender, never, \n     never, never.'' And, ``There are no hopeless situations, only \n     people hopeless about them.'' There is a need for all of us \n     to continuously explore alternatives. There are many ways to \n     skin the proverbial cat.\n       George Bernard Shaw's famous quotation provides an \n     important clue: ``You see things as they are, and ask `Why?' \n     But I dream things that never were and ask `Why not?' '' I am \n     confident that most of you present here today are ``Why not'' \n     leaders. Part of the will to do is to accomplish through \n     others. I have always believed, as you know, that a college \n     education is a partnership between teachers and students and \n     the success of much of life depends on partnerships. And as \n     Pat O'Brien has noted in his essay in Dig Your Well Before \n     You Are Thirsty, Farber Fund contributors have been an \n     amazingly successful network.\n       An essential ingredient of leadership is enthusiasm. A \n     teacher not sold on the importance of the subject is doomed \n     to be a poor stimulator of students. The key to Nelson \n     Rockefeller's success as New York governor was described as \n     his ``exuberance.'' I like Eisenhower's statement: ``It is \n     not the size of the dog in a fight that counts, it is the \n     size of the fight in the dog.''\n       The will to do involves leadership. I feel this afternoon \n     that I am surrounded by leaders. The challenge today for \n     professors and students has changed mightily since 1935. The \n     complexity of modern problems demands a higher degree of \n     expertise. Computers have opened up vast areas of information \n     heretofore not available. In some ways, we are swamped. \n     Leadership with guidance is increasingly important. In this \n     world we need to speak out. In politics, if you don't blow \n     your own horn, there is no music.\n       I have great confidence in South Dakota's potential. But I \n     am equally convinced that without governmental changes of the \n     sort outlined in the Vision to See, that potential will not \n     be realized. I know that the conventional wisdom dictates \n     that it is difficult to make changes in South Dakota. But we \n     have, in my opinion, a population that can be sold. Remember, \n     in 1936 the size of South Dakota legislature was reduced by \n     public vote from 180 to 105 with the loss of 75 legislative \n     seats--an astounding public victory.\n       I was a participant in the constitutional revision effort \n     from 1969-1975. From a governmental point of view, the \n     reorganizations of the executive and judicial branches of \n     government were remarkable events that received popular \n     approval. It is amazing what little things can help to bring \n     about reform. Ted Muenster recalls that it was a letter from \n     the State Snake Exterminator, who held office with no other \n     employees, asking for a new pickup that made him realize the \n     stupidity of a state administrative organization with over \n     100 reporting units. Action followed.\n       In 1982, I had the good fortune to head the successful \n     drive, using the initiative, which changed the basis of our \n     system, of electing legislators, abolishing the block system. \n     It took time and effort but we did the job. What is needed is \n     leadership. I am convinced that we have the ability to change \n     our outmoded method of taxation. There are those in this room \n     who could do it.\n       This emphasis on leadership is why, as we look to the \n     future, the opportunities now open to USD and especially in \n     political science are indeed attractive. Key to this program \n     is the recruitment of a core group of superior students whose \n     leadership has been demonstrated in high school. As you can \n     readily appreciate this is why scholarship money is a \n     critical need.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       With rising tuition costs, few superior students can afford \n     university training without scholarship aid. South Dakota can \n     well afford the investment in such aid. At the present time \n     this state, of its total revenue, devotes 6.5 percent to \n     higher education, the lowest of any state in the region. \n     North Dakota provides 10 percent, Iowa 8.4, Minnesota 6.8 and \n     Nebraska 8.3. As a consequence, compared to surrounding \n     states, our in-state tuition is the highest with the \n     exception of Minnesota.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       And thanks to many of you, the support of the Farber \n     Internship and Travel Fund has made possible funding that has \n     enabled more than 500 eager political science students to \n     receive internships, attend state national conferences, and \n     study overseas. It has raised their sights, stimulated their \n     study, and attracted many to careers of public service.\n\n\n                               THE FUTURE\n\n       It is my hope that here in Farber Hall past traditions will \n     guide future activities to motivate students to become \n     involved and reap the many rewards of public service.\n       In the evening, I often walk to the Shakespeare garden and \n     then pause at the Quirk carillon. There I am encouraged as I \n     read from Longfellow's Psalm of Life:\n\n     Let us then be up and doing,\n     With a heart for any fate,\n     Still achieving, still pursuing,\n     Learn to labor and to wait.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       One final thought: It is my hope that in that wonderful and \n     exciting twenty-first century in which you will have an \n     important role, that sometime when the merry feast is on, you \n     may reflect on what we did here on August 1, 1997, and \n     celebrate by imbibing a strawberry daiquiri!\n       God bless you all and thanks much for attending.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                          The Farber Testament\n\n       To My Students: I believe that dedicated public service is \n     the noblest of the professions. To enter it, whether as \n     academic or as practitioner, is the greatest of good fortune. \n     Thus, I have sought to encourage all in my purview to share \n     the joys and rewards of this commitment.\n       You who came to me with some inner flame, it has been my \n     mission to nurture, to\n\n[[Page S3728]]\n\n     feed that flame, and at all costs never to kill it. With all \n     the world's contemporary challenges, the chance to motivate, \n     to stimulate, to kindle, remain the high calling, and ever to \n     remind that in catastrophe there is opportunity, out of \n     weakness can come strength. My hope has been that none of you \n     has left my presence feeling the worse for the encounter.\n       The keys to a happy, acceptable, and productive life are \n     participation, involvement and concern for others. I have \n     hoped, by example, to inspire you to be change agents. Often \n     your intellect, I know, has been superior to my own; only my \n     experience has been greater and that I have tried to permit \n     by association ``to rub off on you.''\n       To broaden one's horizons, travel, experimentation, and \n     bold thinking must be the goals. I have sought to teach the \n     importance of the background to know, the vision to see, the \n     will to do. Like others before me I have often learned more \n     from you than you from me. But always, for more than 40 \n     years, has the joint educational venture been intensely \n     human, exciting, and worthwhile.

Mr. President, last week, a Washington-based trade \nassociation, the Emergency Committee for American Trade (ECAT), \nreleased an important new study on how American companies with global \noperations increase the U.S. standard of living and strengthen the \ndomestic economy. The study is entitled ``Global Investments, American \nReturns'' and I highly recommend it to every Member of the Senate\n  I am proud that two of my state's most successful companies have \ncontributed case studies to this compelling report. Cargill, \nIncorporated and 3M Company are examples of why America's economic \nfuture and an improved standard of living for all Americans depend upon \nour ability to operate, sell, invest and compete in the global \nmarketplace.\n  Cargill, Incorporated operates in some 72 countries as a marketer, \nprocessor and distributor of agricultural goods and services. The \ncompany has been so successful in selling to foreign markets that some \nof Cargill's fertilizer facilities operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a \nyear. This allows the plants to achieve lower unit operating costs and \nthereby allows Cargill to deliver a more competitively priced product. \nIf these plants served only the U.S. market, they would sit idle most \nof the year because fertilizers are required only during very short \nperiods of growing seasons. Cargill's global presence helps generate \ndemand for its fertilizers all year round by serving different parts of \nthe world during different growing seasons.\n  3M Company produces a large and continually evolving range of \ntechnologies and products. For example, the company currently offers \nmore than 900 varieties of tapes alone. More than 53 percent of the \ncompany's total sales are from outside the United States. 3M Company's \nsuccess in operating abroad has meant growth here at home. Efficient \nforeign distribution, sales, and technical support, and research and \ndevelopment generate increased U.S. production and research and \ndevelopment here at home. For example, 3M's $2.6 billion in Asian-\nPacific sales contributes more than $182 million to the company's \nannual research and development budget of $1 billion--much of which is \nspent in Minnesota. In addition, finished and semifinished goods that \nare manufactured in the United States and then exported help support \noverseas sales.\n  Cargill and 3M Company are just two of the American companies \nprofiled in Global Investments, American Returns. The study uses data \nand business cases to illustrate the importance of operating globally. \nFor example, the study shows that:\n  Global activities by American companies actually increase investments \nhere at home rather than substitute for them.\n  The global presence of U.S. firms helps to increase export sales and \ncreate additional purchases from U.S. suppliers.\n  American companies with global operations account for most of the \nnation's research and development capital investments, and export \nsales.\n  American companies with global operations also rely heavily upon U.S. \nsuppliers. These companies purchase more than 90 percent of their \nsupplies--amounting to $2.4 trillion annually--from American companies.\n  American manufacturers with global operations pay higher wages than \ndo purely domestically-focused firms. For production or blue-collar \nworkers, the difference is 15 percent higher earnings.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to review carefully ``Global Investments, \nAmerican Returns.'' It is an important study that should guide \nAmerica's tax and trade policies. I am especially pleased to learn that \nECAT--and companies like Cargill and 3M that contributed to the \nreport--will launch a trade education campaign to help spread the facts \nand dispel the misconceptions about trade and investment. I am proud \nthat these Minnesota companies are a part of this effort.\n  I ask that the Executive Summary of the study be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The Executive Summary follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       In public and private-sector debates over U.S. trade and \n     investment policies, the role in the U.S. economy of \n     Americans companies with global operations \\1\\ has often been \n     misunderstood. Although there is no doubt that the United \n     States plays an important role in the world economy, most \n     Americans are unaware of the critical contributions that \n     trade and foreign direct investment (FDI) of American \n     companies with global operations make to the U.S. economy.\n       To broaden public understanding of the positive role of \n     these companies, this study expands upon the research in \n     ECAT's previous Mainstay studies in two important ways. \n     First, it focuses on the key issue of the U.S. standard of \n     living. Second, it broadens the scope of the study to include \n     all three major sectors of the economy: manufacturing, \n     agriculture, and services.\n       There are two key points in Mainstay III. First, by raising \n     U.S. worker productivity, American companies with global \n     operations help raise the U.S. standard of living. Second, \n     because the U.S. and foreign activities of these companies \n     tend to complement each other, the ability of these companies \n     to help raise the U.S. standard of living depends crucially \n     on their ability to undertake foreign direct investment \n     abroad.\n       Mainstay III is based upon analysis of the investments, \n     research and development, exports, imports, and purchases \n     from suppliers of American companies with global operations \n     and many other data from 1977 through 1994. The primary data \n     source is surveys of such companies conducted by the Bureau \n     of Economic Analysis (BEA) within the U.S. Department of \n     Commerce.\n       The following sections summarize the major findings and \n     conclusions of the study:\n\n\n  1. setting the stage: the world economy in which American companies \n                     with global operations compete\n\n       American companies today operate in a world economy that is \n     increasingly concentrated outside the United States and that \n     is rapidly expanding its international linkages through FDI \n     and international trade.\n       The U.S. share of the global economy is shrinking. For \n     decades, the U.S. economy has been growing more slowly than \n     the rest of the world, such that the U.S. share of total \n     world output has been declining. This share was approximately \n     50 percent in 1945, but is down to only 20 percent today.\n       FDI and trade help U.S. integration into the global \n     economy. American companies with global operations have \n     helped integrate the United States more closely into the \n     growing world economy. Average annual outflows of FDI from \n     the United States quadrupled from the 1960s through the \n     1980s, and total trade as a share of U.S. output rose from \n     5.6 percent in 1945 to 24.7 percent in 1995.\n       By participating in the world economy, American companies \n     with global operations maintain a significant presence in the \n     United States.\n       Most employment is in the United States, not abroad. In \n     1977, U.S. parent companies accounted for 72.8 percent of \n     total worldwide employment of American companies with global \n     operations and by 1994, they accounted for 74.3 percent of \n     the total.\n       Profits earned by foreign affiliates are mostly \n     repatriated. In 1989 (the most recent year for which these \n     data are available), U.S. parents repatriated 72.8 percent of \n     their foreign affiliates' net income.\n       Most intermediate inputs are purchased from domestic \n     suppliers, not foreign suppliers. From 1977 through 1994, \n     more than 90 percent of all intermediate inputs purchased by \n     U.S. parents came from American suppliers, not foreign \n     suppliers.\n       Overseas, American companies with global operations are \n     located primarily in developed countries, and the sales from \n     these operations are overwhelmingly in local markets.\n       Most affiliate activity abroad is in developed--not \n     developing--countries. In 1994, developed countries hosted \n     nearly two-thirds of U.S. foreign affiliate employment and \n     accounted for more than three-quarters of foreign affiliate \n     assets and sales.\n       Foreign affiliate sales are mostly abroad, not back to the \n     United States. In 1994, only 10 percent of total U.S. \n     affiliate sales went to\n\n[[Page S3729]]\n\n     the United States. The other 90 percent stayed abroad, and \n     fully 67 percent of all sales were within the host countries \n     of the foreign affiliates.\n\n\nii. the importance of american companies with global operations to the \n         u.s. standard of living: generating high productivity\n\n       American companies with global operations contribute in \n     several important ways to the U.S. standard of living, and \n     this contribution is larger than that of purely domestic \n     firms.\n       Investment in Physical Capital. American companies with \n     global operations undertake the majority--57 percent in most \n     years--of total U.S. investment in physical capital in the \n     manufacturing sector.\n       Research and Development. American companies with global \n     operations perform the majority--between 50 percent and 60 \n     percent--of total U.S. research and development.\n       Exports. American companies with global operations ship the \n     large majority--between 60 percent and 75 percent--of total \n     U.S. exports. Their foreign affiliates are important \n     recipients of these exports; their share has increased to \n     over 40 percent today.\n       Imports. American companies with global operations also \n     receive a sizable share of U.S. imports--roughly 30 percent. \n     These imports benefit the U.S. economy in many ways, \n     including giving U.S. companies access to foreign-produced \n     capital goods and technologies.\n       All these activities help increase U.S. productivity and \n     thereby enhance the U.S. standard of living.\n\n\niii. the importance of american companies with global operations to the \n              u.s. standard of living: paying higher wages\n\n       American companies with global operations pay their workers \n     higher wages than those paid by comparable American companies \n     without global operations.\n       A study of 115,000 U.S. manufacturing plants indicated that \n     U.S. parent plants pay comparable workers higher wages than \n     purely domestic plants. Production workers receive an average \n     of 6.9 percent less at comparable domestic plants employing \n     more than 500 employees and 15.2 percent less at comparable \n     domestic plants employing fewer than 500 employees.\n       Non-production workers receive an average of 5.0 percent \n     less at comparable domestic plants employing more than 500 \n     employees and 9.5 percent less at comparable domestic plants \n     employing fewer than 500 employees. These results control for \n     possible wage differences attributable to variations across \n     plants in age, industry, location, and size. In light of all \n     these controls, it seems likely that these wage differences \n     are attributable to workers at U.S. parents being more \n     productive than workers at comparable domestic plants.\n\n\niv. the importance of american companies with global operations to the \n        u.s. standard of living: linkages to american suppliers\n\n       In addition to directly raising the U.S. standard of living \n     themselves, American companies with global operations may \n     also raise the U.S. standard of living through their \n     interactions with domestic U.S. suppliers.\n       Evidence exists that companies benefit from being exposed \n     to other dynamic, successful firms. Exposure to ``worldwide \n     best practices''--whether those best practices are in the \n     same country or abroad--tends to foster innovation, cost \n     control, and other improvements that boost firm productivity.\n       The very large amount of purchases of intermediate inputs \n     from domestic suppliers by U.S. parents of American companies \n     with global operations suggests the possibility that U.S. \n     domestic suppliers have sufficient exposure to these high-\n     productivity parents to realize some productivity gains. For \n     the past 20 years, U.S. parents have purchased over 90 \n     percent of their intermediate inputs--$2.4 trillion in 1994--\n     from domestic, not foreign, suppliers.\n\n\nv. how foreign direct investment abroad complements u.s parent activity \n   and contributes to a high standard of living in the united states\n\n       Because the U.S. and foreign activities of American \n     companies with global operations tend to complement each \n     other, the ability of these companies to raise the U.S. \n     standard of living depends crucially upon their ability to \n     undertake FDI abroad.\n       Analysis of BEA data, academic research, and case studies \n     of 10 major American companies demonstrates that U.S. FDI \n     generally complements rather than substitutes for U.S. parent \n     activity. Within American companies with global operations, \n     affiliate expansion generally triggers in U.S. parents \n     additional investment, research and development, trade, and \n     input purchases from domestic suppliers. As stated earlier, \n     these activities are key determinants of the U.S. standard of \n     living.\n       Restrictions on FDI that prevent U.S. companies from \n     expanding abroad generally will reduce U.S. parent activity \n     and thus, lower the U.S. standard of living.\n\n\n               vi. conclusions and policy recommendations\n\n       The United States must continue to strengthen the open \n     system of global trade and investment in order to maximize \n     the contributions of American companies with global \n     operations to an improved standard of living for all \n     Americans. To that end, U.S. trade and investment policies \n     should take into account the following recommendations based \n     on the research and findings in this study:\n       The U.S. government should maintain its open trade and \n     investment policies. Moreover, these policies should \n     recognize the ways in which trade and foreign direct \n     investment benefit the U.S. economy.\n       The U.S. government should continue to negotiate \n     aggressively for more open foreign markets and should \n     persuade foreign governments to end restrictions on trade and \n     investment. Removing these restrictions will create a ``win-\n     win'' situation that benefits both foreign countries and the \n     United States.\n       The U.S. government should strive to continue to harmonize \n     its international trade, investment, and tax policies. In the \n     case of American companies with global operations, this \n     harmonization should take into account the many ways that \n     their foreign operations tend to complement their U.S. \n     activities.\n       Given that most services are inherently nontradable, firms \n     in these industries must invest abroad to serve global \n     markets.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the North Haverhill, New Hampshire, Post #5245 of the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) on the occasion of their fiftieth \nanniversary. As a veteran and member of the VFW myself, I honor these \nmen for their selfless commitment to their country and to their \ncommunity.\n  Since 1948, the original membership of 30 World War Two veterans has \ngrown to 160 veterans of World Wars One and Two, the Korean War, the \nVietnam War and the Gulf War. I would like to specially recognize the \ncharter members that have been there from the beginning--William \nFortier, Leo Fortier, Fred Robinson, Paul LaMott, Everett Jessman, \nMaurice Bigelow, Willis Applebee, Ernest Hartley, William Harris, \nLaurent Fournier, Clifford Sawyer and Leon Dargie. All have served our \ncountry valiantly, and now tirelessly serve the Upper Valley, devoting \nendless hours to their community.\n  The extent of the Post's involvement is endless, helping not only \nveterans, but anyone to whom they can lend a helping hand. They are \nespecially involved with the youth of the Upper Valley. Their youth \nprograms projects stretch from donating American flags to schools and \nteaching proper flag etiquette, to sponsoring essay contests and \nawarding college scholarships. They also sponsor Cub Scout and Girl \nScout troops and instruct youth on bicycle safety. In addition, members \nhost meals at a local soup kitchen, visit nursing homes and the VA \nHospital and also visit shut-ins. They transport the elderly to \nappointments, donate wheelchairs and walkers and distribute food \nbaskets on Thanksgiving.\n  For half of a century, these members have exemplified goodwill and \nconcern for their neighbors, and their efforts will no doubt continue \nfor the next fifty years. I congratulate Post #5245 for their steadfast \nservice to the Upper Valley. New Hampshire and the United States are \ntruly indebted to the North Haverhill Post #5245 of the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, and I am proud to represent them in the U.S. Senate. \n\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/28/senate-section/article/S3729-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3730]]\n                    RETIREMENT OF RABBI JACK ROSOFF\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate an \nesteemed New Jerseyan, Rabbi Jack M. Rosoff, on the occasion of his \nretirement after 34 years of service at Congregations B'nai Israel in \nRumson, New Jersey.\n  I really got to know Rabbi Rosoff when he organized a community-wide \nresponse to acts of vandalism committed against B'nai Israel and the \nneighboring Catholic church in Rumson. I spoke at the rally that Rabbi \nRosoff put together condemning the desecration, and was very moved by \nhis dedication to fighting bigotry.\n  Rabbi Rosoff's accomplishments during his tenure at B'nai Israel, for \nwhich he has just been elevated to Rabbi Emeritus status, are almost \ntoo numerous to mention. He has multiplied the membership of his \ncongregation by hundreds and provided Sunday school opportunities for \nover 300 students. He developed the Israel Scholarship Program there, \nenabling all students in their junior year to spend six weeks in \nIsrael.\n  Beyond those achievements, Jack has been a counselor and friend to \nthe members of his synagogue. He has rejoiced with them in times of \nhappiness and has been a comfort in times of grief.\n  Rabbi Rosoff has served on the boards of various organizations in \nMonmouth County, including Riverview Hospital, the Mental Health \nAssociation, the Day Care Center, the Clergy Advisory Council of the \nlocal Planned Parenthood, as well as being the founding member of the \nGreater Red Bank Interfaith Council.\n  Rabbi Rosoff should be honored by all of us not only for his 34 years \nof service to B'nai Israel, but for his community-wide leadership and \ncivic involvement. I am pleased to congratulate him again on his \nretirement, and wish him well in this next chapter of his life. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/28/senate-section/article/S3730-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ISRAEL'S 50TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. BOND.

My \nhome State of Missouri is especially excited for the event since \nPresident Harry S.

The Jewish Federation of St. Louis is \nthe central planning and fundraising agency of the St. Louis Jewish \nCommunity.

Will you all be seated, please. Good \n     morning, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Dan Akaka. I'm the \n     convener of the United States Senate Breakfast Group and \n     chairman of the National Prayer Breakfast. I want to say \n     welcome to all of you here this morning.\n       On behalf of the United States Senate and House of \n     Representatives, I welcome you to the 46th annual National \n     Prayer Breakfast. We're happy to have you here on this \n     special day. Robert Parker presented the pre-breakfast prayer \n     this morning, and we are happy to have you here. At this \n     time, General Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff, will offer the opening prayer. General?\n       Gen. Hugh Shelton. Let us pray.\n       O Lord, our strength and our redeemer, we come together \n     today to pray for strength and guidance in a difficult and \n     challenging world. Though we have come far, we have so far to \n     go to realize your plan here on Earth. Lord, we ask your help \n     and guidance for all those who have been chosen to lead our \n     people all over the world. And grant that we may follow with \n     humble and willing hearts to do the work that must be done \n     to preserve the blessings of peace and to share the gifts \n     that you have given us. May those chosen to lead, lead \n     with wisdom and compassion, not in pursuit of wealth and \n     power, but guided by your righteous word and walking in \n     your upright ways.\n       Today we pray for your blessings on all our men and women \n     in uniform, at home and abroad. Keep them safe as they keep \n     the peace. And keep them strong to carry the burdens that \n     must be borne in a troubled world. And Father, though we are \n     of many faiths, we have but one prayer, and that is to share \n     your peace with people everywhere. May you stretch your \n     loving hands over friend and foe alike and bring us together \n     in the spirit of truth so that in our time we may know your \n     peace.\n       Now we pray that you would bless this food to the \n     nourishment of our bodies and our help to thy service. These \n     things we ask in your name. Amen.\n       Senator Akaka. Thank you very much, General Shelton. You \n     honor us very much with your presence here at this prayer \n     breakfast.\n       Please enjoy your breakfast. Our program will resume in a \n     few minutes.\n       [Breakfast.]\n       Senator Akaka. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It is a \n     wonderful privilege for me to welcome all of you this morning \n     to the National Prayer Breakfast. I particularly want to \n     greet our international guests who represent over 160 \n     nations. And everyone attending the prayer breakfast for the \n     first time, I say again, welcome. (Applause.)\n\n[[Page S3731]]\n\n       This morning we gather almost 4,000 strong from all 50 \n     states, commonwealths and the U.S. territories and nations \n     around the world to reaffirm our faith, seek spiritual \n     support for our President and leaders in our country, and \n     share fellowship and friendship with one another.\n       We are honored to have the President and First Lady and the \n     Vice President and Mrs. Gore as our guests. In attendance we \n     also have members of the Senate and the House, officials from \n     the President's Cabinet and leaders of our armed forces, \n     responsible student leaders and leaders from all facets of \n     society throughout the United States.\n       We're also pleased to welcome the President of Albania, \n     former heads of state, cabinet ministers, parliamentarians, \n     members of the diplomatic corps, educators and business, \n     labor and religious leaders from around the world.\n       Permit me to introduce the people sitting at the head \n     table.

(Applause.)\n       As chairman, I want to express my deepest appreciation to \n     all participants this morning for sharing your faith with us. \n     Looking upon this august and joyful assembly, I see the \n     universality of the prayer breakfast, the coming together of \n     people of different nations, faiths and cultures, and the \n     power of love and consideration for one another.\n       I am reminded of the passage from Psalm 33, verse 12: \n     ``Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord, the people he \n     chose for his inheritance. From heaven, the Lord looks down \n     and sees all mankind. From his dwelling place, he watches all \n     who live on Earth. He forms the hearts of all and considers \n     all their works.''\n       God's love for all of us is everlasting, for all men and \n     women from all nations. This perfect love fills our hearths, \n     prepares us for the challenges we face each day and opens our \n     minds to God's wisdom. As we seek to love God and one \n     another, let the spirit of this prayer breakfast enrich us, \n     strengthen us and lead us on life's journey, where we are \n     never alone.\n       It is my privilege at this time to introduce to you the \n     honorable Bobby Scott, Congressman from Virginia, who is \n     leader of the House Prayer Breakfast Group. He will speak to \n     us on behalf of the House and the Senate Prayer Groups. \n     Bobby?\n       Representative Bobby Scott. Thank you, Senator. Mr. \n     President and Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Vice President and Mrs. Gore, \n     other dais guests, ladies and gentlemen, I'm delighted to \n     join my congressional colleagues from the House and the \n     Senate Prayer Breakfast Groups in bringing you another \n     welcome to the 1998 National Prayer Breakfast. This is our \n     46th year of coming together to commemorate the value of \n     prayer in both our personal lives and our work on behalf of \n     the people of this nation.\n       We are joined by national leaders of business, labor, \n     government, religion and other walks of life throughout the \n     United States and over 16 of countries around the world. \n     Members from the U.S. Senate first met for prayer and divine \n     guidance during World War II. The House organized a weekly \n     prayer group shortly thereafter, And both groups have \n     continued the practice of weekly prayer breakfasts, meeting \n     for breakfast, prayer and fellowship.\n       Since those first meetings in the face of a great national \n     crisis, the need for a prayer group and the benefit of \n     fellowship and prayer have been recognized in Congress. From \n     the beginning of the prayer breakfast groups in both \n     chambers, members of all faiths have come together to hear \n     testimonials of faith and challenge and to seek guidance and \n     strength from each other.\n       What we discuss and exchange in those meetings stays in \n     those meetings. So members are free to share with each other, \n     and we do. The weekly prayer breakfast provides members with \n     one hour during the week in which we can relax without the \n     presence of the media and without regard to partisan \n     political affiliation. And so I can assure you that it is \n     one hour that many of us look forward to each week.\n       As an example of the typical weekly prayer breakfast in the \n     House, we begin with Scripture and a prayer and a report on \n     member's faith and challenges, such as illness, or illness or \n     death within their family, so that we can offer our prayers \n     and support to that member. We also sing a hymn or, as more \n     accurately can be described, we make a joyful noise. \n     (Laughter.) And at each breakfast, one member is invited to \n     speak for 15 minutes to share a personal challenge, \n     reflection or faith experience with the group.\n       The weekly Senate and House prayer breakfasts have met \n     separately since their inception. However, in 1953 both \n     groups decided to combine forces and hold the first National \n     Prayer Breakfast. President Dwight D. Eisenhower attended \n     that first National Prayer Breakfast, and every President \n     since has attended each year's breakfast.\n       President Clinton and Vice President Gore--(applause)--\n     President Clinton and Vice President Gore have continued that \n     unblemished record through their presence here today, \n     reflecting their recognition of the value of prayer in our \n     professional and personal lives. So I know I speak for all of \n     my colleagues in both chambers when I say that we are \n     delighted to host this 46th National Prayer Breakfast. You \n     strengthen us and uplift us with your presence.\n       So, again, welcome. And may God bless you, Thank you. \n     (Applause.)\n       Senator Akaka. We will now hear an Old Testament reading \n     from the Honorable Don Gevitz, an outstanding businessmen \n     from California and our former United States Ambassador to \n     the Republic of Fiji, the Kingdom of Tonga, the Republic of \n     Nauru and the Republic of Tuvalu.\n       Ambassador Don Gevirtz. Thank you, and good morning. Mr. \n     President, my exboss, Mr. Vice President, distinguished \n     guests. What is an ex-U.S. Ambassador born into the Jewish \n     faith doing at an event like this? (Laughter.) Appreciating \n     the power of interfaith brotherhood and fellowship inspired \n     by the National Prayer Breakfast movement.\n       At the core of my philosophy are the two words I want on my \n     tombstone. They are, ``He grew.'' Although my readings this \n     morning are from the Old Testament. I would like to borrow \n     for just a moment from the rich tradition of Luke, chapter 2, \n     verse 52, in the New Testament, because of its clear \n     statement about human potential. ``Jesus grew in wisdom and \n     statute and in favor with God and man.''\n       I think that this is God's wish for all of his children. \n     Proverbs in the Old Testament clearly identifies the \n     characteristic a person must have to grow to realize his \n     human potential. Proverbs, chapter 20, verse 5, points out \n     that ``The purposes of a man's heart are deep waters, but a \n     man of understanding draws them out.'' Additionally, verse 15 \n     says, ``Gold there is, rubies in abundance, but lips that \n     speak knowledge are a rare jewel.''\n       Proverbs, chapter 18, verse 15, suggests that ``The heart \n     of the discerning gains in knowledge. The ear of the wise men \n     searches for knowledge.'' And Proverbs, chapter 28, has \n     important lessons of growth. Verse 14 says, ``Happy is the \n     man who is never without fear. He who hardens his heart will \n     fall into distress.'' And verse 22 says, ``He chases after \n     wealth the man of greedy eye, not knowing that want is \n     overtaking him.'' And finally, verse 1 says, ``The wicked man \n     flees when no one is after him. The virtuous man is bold as a \n     lion.''\n       The Bible has much wisdom for that person whose objective \n     is growth. Samson had great credentials, but in Judges, \n     chapter 16, verse 20, he learns that the Lord has left him. \n     Consequently, he was remembered only for what he might have \n     been. I want to be remembered for realizing my full \n     potential, for earning those words on my tombstone, ``He \n     grew.''\n       Thank you very much. (Applause.)\n       Senator Akaka. Renowned inspirational signers Randy and Gae \n     Hongo have traveled all the way from Honolulu to be with us \n     this morning. They are joined this morning by their son \n     Andrew, who came here from Yale University to sing as a \n     family. The Hongo family will offer us a musical reflection, \n     of their own arrangement, the phrase, ``Ua mau ke `ea `o ka \n     `ania `I ka pono,'' which translates from Hawaiian into ``The \n     life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness.'' It was \n     first uttered in thanksgiving by King Kamehameha III. It is \n     now the motto of the state of Hawaii. Its insight holds true \n     today. The Hongo family.\n       [Song.]\n       Senator Akaka. Thank you very much. Randy, Gae and Andrew. \n     It is now my pleasure and great honor to introduce to you Dr. \n     Dorothy Height, President of the National Council of Negro \n     Women and a true national treasure, who will read from the \n     New Testament.\n       Dorothy Height. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, \n     distinguished guests and friends. Our New Testament reading \n     is from Matthew, the 25th chapter, the 34th to the 45th \n     verse. It answers the question that all of us ask ourselves \n     every day as we try to be truthful, to be faithful, to serve \n     our God. It answers the question that we have with each \n     other, whatever our differences: What is our obligation? What \n     must be our commitment?\n       ``Then the king will say to those on his right, `Come, you \n     who are blessed by my father. Take your inheritance, the \n     kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world. For \n     I was hungry and you gave me something to eat. I was thirty, \n     and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger and you \n     invited me in. I needed clothes and you clothed me. I was \n     sick and you looked after me. I was in prison and you came \n     to visit me.'\n       ``Then the righteous will answer him, `Lord, when did we \n     see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you \n     something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite \n     you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see \n     you sick or in prison or go to visit you?' The king will \n     reply, `I tell you the truth, whatever you did for the least \n     of these, my brothers of mine, you did for me.\n       ``Then he will say to those on his left, `Depart from me, \n     you who are cursed, into the eternal fires prepared for the \n     devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you gave me \n     nothing to eat. I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to \n     drink. I was a stranger and you did not invite me in. I \n     needed clothes and you did not clothe me. I was sick and in \n     prison, and you did not look after me.' They also will \n     answer, `Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a \n     stranger or needing\n\n[[Page S3732]]\n\n     clothes or sick or in prison, and we did not help you?' And \n     he will reply, `I tell you the truth, whatever you did not do \n     for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.' ''\n       [The reading of his word. (Applause.)]\n       Senator Akaka. Thank you, Dr. Height. The Vice President \n     and I entered Congress together as members of the class of \n     1976. As a Congressman and Senator, he faithfully \n     participated in both the House and Senate breakfast groups. \n     Today we are honored to have him offer the prayer for our \n     national leaders. So it is with pleasure that I welcome the \n     pride of class of '76--(laughter)--and an esteemed friend, \n     the Vice President of the United States, Albert Gore, Jr. \n     (Applause.)\n       Vice President Gore. Thank you very much. I'm glad to be \n     introduced by the pride of the class of '76. Thank you very \n     much, and to Mrs. Akaka, to the President and First Lady, to \n     Congressman Scott and to Senator and Mrs. Mack, to Dr. Graham \n     and all the members of the clergy who are present, members of \n     the cabinet, Speaker Gingrich and members of the House and \n     Senate who are present.\n       It is, of course, humbling to join with so many people of \n     all faiths to rededicate ourselves to God's purposes and to \n     reaffirm the ultimate purpose of our lives, to glorify the \n     creator and to love the Lord our God with all our hearts, \n     with all our souls and with all our minds, and to love our \n     neighbors as ourselves.\n       I believe God has a plan for the United States of America \n     and has since our founding. Our mission has always been to \n     advance the cause of liberty and to prove that religious, \n     political and economic freedom are the natural birthright of \n     all men and women and that freedom unlocks a higher fraction \n     of the human potential than any other way of organizing human \n     society.\n       And I believe that God has given the people of our nation \n     not only a chance, but a mission to prove to men and women in \n     all nations that people of different racial and ethnic \n     backgrounds, of all faiths and creeds, can not only work and \n     live together but can enrich and ennoble both themselves and \n     our common purpose and to prove, in the words of Jesus, \n     ``that they all may be one, as thou, Father, art in me, and I \n     in thee.''\n       Yet too often we lose sight of our common purpose and seek \n     to make our public discourse one of meanness and not of \n     meaning, one of bitterness and invective, not of faith and \n     love. James Madison, one of our founders, wrote, ``A zeal for \n     different opinions concerning religion, concerning \n     government, an attachment to different leaders ambitiously \n     contending for preeminence and power, have in turn divided \n     mankind into parties, inflamed them with mutual animosity, \n     and rendered them much more disposed to vex and oppress each \n     other than to cooperate for their common good.''\n       We've seen those animosities unleashed by the whole \n     continuum of human difference--differences of parties, \n     opinion and faction, differences of nationality, religion, \n     language and gender; and the most visible and therefore most \n     persistent differences of all, those of race and ethnicity.\n       Overcoming those differences, fulfilling the mission that \n     is ours in human history, must be achieved ``not by might, \n     nor by power, but by my Spirit, sayeth the Lord of hosts.'' \n     It requires a dedication to faith and trust in God.\n       And so, speaking for my own faith in Jesus Christ but \n     acknowledging and respecting all of the faiths represented \n     here, I offer this prayer for our nation and its leaders and \n     ask you to join with me.\n       God, who through thy saints and prophets has spoken to us \n     in days of old, speak to us again in this hour. Teach us to \n     be peacemakers and agents of reconciliation. Show us how to \n     live out your commitment to the poor and to the oppressed. \n     Inspire us to overcome the fears that have long bound us to \n     small visions and tiny dreams. Save us from the differences \n     that can obscure our common purpose and serve as an excuse \n     and trigger for the unleashing of the evil that lies coiled \n     in the human soul.\n       Help us to overcome evil with good. Deliver us from the \n     wanton selfishness that would make us rich in things but poor \n     in spirit. Grant us wisdom and courage for the living of \n     these days. We pray for all who are given the responsibility \n     to lead our nation and the other nations of this world. Help \n     all of these leaders to seek out your will and give to all of \n     them the strength to live in your way in our world. In your \n     name we pray, Amen. (Applause.)\n       Senator Akaka. Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President. It \n     gives me great pleasure to introduce our featured speaker \n     this morning. Senator Connie Mack is a source of inspiration \n     and strength in our Senate Prayer Breakfast Group. As our \n     planning committee discussed whom to invite to address the \n     breakfast, our focus turned inward. Connie has a wonderful \n     message, and we are so grateful that he agreed to share it \n     with us this morning. I give you my friend, the honorable \n     Connie Mack. (Applause.)\n       Senator Mack. Mr. President, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Vice \n     President, Mrs. Gore, ladies and gentlemen of the head table \n     and guests from throughout our land and from across the \n     globe. This is a distinct honor for me and true privilege to \n     have the opportunity to speak with you this morning.\n       There are several people that I would like to introduce \n     before I begin my remarks, and in a sense it is an expression \n     of the love and affection that I have for my family. I am one \n     of eight children. Three of my brothers are here this \n     morning: My brother Dennis, my brother Andy and my bother \n     John. I am not quite sure where they're seated. (Applause.) \n     All together.\n       I have an older sister who is a Catholic nun who could not \n     be with us today. And John is a trained Baptist minister. \n     (Laughter.) So I think you can get the feel that there have \n     been some interesting discussions--(laughter)--about religion \n     in our lives.\n       As I thought about what I would share with you this \n     morning, I decided, rather than to give some speech on \n     politics and government, that I would share with you my own \n     personal quest for a deeper understanding of the teachings of \n     Jesus Christ.\n       When I use the word ``share,'' this is something, frankly, \n     that is pretty new to me. And when Danny called me and asked \n     me if I would do it, frankly, there was no choice other than \n     to say yes. But I must say to you, I felt a sense of terror \n     go through my being. I'm an individual who has held my \n     spiritual beliefs, my religious feelings and training, \n     inside. I was not a person who shared those thoughts and \n     ideas with anyone else, to the point that--and I see Don \n     Nickles out there somewhere this morning--I can remember \n     saying to Don before one of our policy committee lunches, \n     when he asked me if I would give the blessing, I said, ``Don, \n     I would rather not.''\n       And I don't know whether the men in the audience have had \n     the experience of thinking about asking their wives to pray \n     with them. We were having a discussion, a few of us in our \n     Bible study and prayer breakfast, about prayer and about our \n     prayer together, and I said to them, ``Isn't it strange? I \n     find it difficult to say to my wife Priscilla--we've been \n     married now 37 years--for some reason there was an incredible \n     sense of vulnerability that kept me from turning to her and \n     say, `Would you be willing to pray with me?' '' I am pleased \n     to say that I did ask her, and we do pray together.\n       Again, I don't know whether you have shared the same \n     feelings that I have had, but there have been many times in \n     my life where I sensed that there was a void, that there was \n     a part of me that I wasn't dealing with, that there was a \n     part of me that I did not understand. But there is also a \n     part of me that said I want to get in touch with that part of \n     me.\n       And it is the prayer breakfasts and the Bible study group \n     that helps me deal with that void, if you will. I was \n     struggling really to have a deeper understanding of the word \n     ``love.'' What does love really mean? Who is in control of my \n     life? Like I suspect most of us in this room, and maybe \n     especially at the head table, we have steadfastly tried to \n     stay in control of our lives throughout our entire lives. \n     What is the meaning of God's will? How do you know what God's \n     will is?\n       I want to touch on those points as I go through my remarks. \n     But I also want to recognize--I mentioned Don Nickles a \n     moment ago, and another colleague of mine in the Senate, Dan \n     Coats, who never lost faith in me. No matter how many times \n     they would ask and I would refuse to join them in Bible study \n     or the prayer breakfast, they never gave up. ``Connie,'' they \n     said, ``you would love this. This is exactly what you need.'' \n     And finally, one day I said yes.\n       And it's because of Dan and Don and Danny and others like \n     them who kind of guided me along the path to a deeper \n     understanding that I can honestly say to you today that on \n     October the 26th, 1995, my life began anew. And I want to \n     tell you about that, a very special meeting of Bible study. \n     And again, a couple of our members, Dan Coats and I were \n     engaged in a very focused discussion. Interestingly enough, \n     today I cannot remember what the discussion was about. But I \n     sure know it was focused. (Laughter.)\n       One of the thoughts that occurred to me as our meeting was \n     starting was, as I looked around the room to see who was \n     there, Danny Akaka had not come yet. And Danny Akaka is a \n     person who I have gotten to know and to love and deeply \n     appreciate as a result of our experiences today at both \n     prayer breakfasts and Bible study. And Danny wasn't there, \n     and I kept thinking, ``I hope he comes today. I hope he comes \n     today.'' Again, mind you, now, this focused discussion that \n     was taking place.\n       As it ended, seated right next to Dan Coats was Danny \n     Akaka. And I was kind of stunned that you were there. I \n     didn't know how you had gotten into the room. And I was \n     expressing to him my sense of love and appreciation that he \n     was with us.\n       Lloyd Ogilvie at that time, I think sensing something \n     special, said to us, ``Is there anyone here this morning who \n     would like to deepen his commitment to Jesus Christ?'' The \n     immediate thought that went through my mind was, ``It ain't \n     me, buster.'' (Laughter.) I mean, that's it. ``It ain't me, \n     buster.'' Lloyd said I'm now going to be remembered as the \n     guy that said, ``It ain't me, buster.'' (Laughter.)\n       But as soon as that thought went through my mind, no sooner \n     had it gotten out of mind, I said, ``I want you to pray for \n     me.'' And I had no idea what was going to happen after that. \n     Lloyd asked me to move my chair to the center of the room, \n     and all of my colleagues gathered around me, placed their \n     hands on my shoulders and prayed for me.\n       It is difficult and, frankly, impossible to explain to you \n     the emotion that I felt at that moment. But the one thing I \n     do recall is, contrary to what you might think, there was a \n     sense of something flowing out of me. And later, when I \n     thought through what that experience was, I know what it was. \n     It was that\n\n[[Page S3733]]\n\n     desire of keeping control of my life, that I was the one that \n     was in charge. I was willing to give up that control. And on \n     that day, October the 26th, 1995, I know that that control \n     went out of my life and I began the process, began the \n     process, of turning my life over to God.\n       After that very moving experience, Priscilla and I had the \n     opportunity to be in Vermont on vacation. And I had gone out \n     to go skiing that morning. And I got to the foot of the \n     mountain that was in Vermont. It was -10 degrees. The wind \n     was blowing 15, 20 knots. And I say, ``I've got to be crazy \n     out here skiing.'' I went back home. I picked up a book that \n     Lloyd Ogilvie had written called ``The Greatest Counselor in \n     the World,'' a book about the Holy Spirit.\n       And later that day there was a sense of restlessness in me, \n     and I decided to go for a walk. And I put on some snow shoes. \n     Now, being from Florida, I had not had that experience \n     before. (Laughter.) And I walked out into the forest, along \n     the sides of the mountain, by myself. As far as I could see, \n     there was nothing but the beauty and cleanness of the white \n     snow. The only sounds that I heard were the sounds of nature. \n     The trees--I never heard this before, but the trees actually \n     rubbing against each other as there was a breeze that made \n     its way through the forest.\n       I made my way down into a ravine, and there was a small \n     stream that was making its way; a few spots where the water \n     could be seen around the ice, and the sounds of that stream \n     bubbling up. And I stopped there, wanting to get on my knees \n     and to pray. But I must say to you, I was terrified about \n     getting on my knees with those snow shoes. And with the snow, \n     I didn't think I could get back up. (Laughter.)\n       So I stood there, and I literally raised my hands to the \n     heavens and prayed that the Holy Spirit would fill me. There \n     was a rustling of the wind. I'm not trying to hold out any \n     kind of mystery, but there was a rustling of the wind that \n     gave me a sense that, in fact, I was being filled with the \n     Holy Spirit. And as I look back on those days, I now \n     recognize that the fruits of the Holy Spirit have become part \n     of my day--love, peace, joy, patience, goodness, kindness, \n     gentleness, faithfulness, self-control. They are part of my \n     day because that's God's will.\n       I remember not long after that that Priscilla and I had the \n     opportunity to be at the movies. And the movie was over and I \n     turned to her and I said, ``I am filled with a sense of \n     joy.'' What was rather startling about that was that later I \n     said to Priscilla, ``Do you know that that's the first time \n     in over 17 years that I have truly had a sense of joy?''\n       My brother Michael had died of cancer in 1979. And for all \n     those years, I carried around in me the gloom of his death. \n     But I recognized, at the moment that I turned to Pris and \n     said, ``I feel a sense of joy,'' that the gloom had been \n     lifted and God's love had replaced it.\n       I want to now share a couple of experiences with you to \n     show you how my life has been changed as a result of this. \n     Some of you in the Senate may remember a fellow by the name \n     of Butch. He was a bus boy in the Senate dining room. I got \n     to know Butch over the years as I would come in and have \n     breakfast, and he would bring me a paper and we would chat \n     for a few minutes.\n       One day I was having lunch with some of my colleagues in \n     the Senate dining room, and one of the waitresses came up to \n     me and handed me a note and said that Butch was seriously \n     ill. Well, I put the note in my pocket. And as I left the \n     Senate dining room, I stopped and talked with the waitress \n     and she once again said that Butch was seriously ill. And I \n     could sense she was saying--she had given me the note that \n     said he was at, I believe, Southeast Greater Hospital here in \n     Washington. I could tell she was really saying to me, ``Can't \n     you go see Butch?'' And like I'm sure most of my colleagues, \n     my initial reaction was one of ``Where am I going to find the \n     time?''\n       Well, again, the note's in my pocket. I went home. The \n     following morning I looked at my schedule. There was a gap in \n     my schedule. And I thought, ``Well, maybe I ought to just go \n     see Butch.'' So I went over to the hospital. I went up to \n     Butch's room. A nurse was there giving him a shot. And I \n     looked at Butch, his eyes wide open, almost transfixed on the \n     television set. And within a few seconds, it became obvious \n     to me that Butch was about to die.\n       It was just the two of us. I had asked the nurse how he was \n     doing as I walked in, and she said, ``He was fine yesterday. \n     His family came from Chicago. They had a great time \n     together.'' But clearly things had changed. And again, it was \n     just Butch and myself. And I thought, ``I cannot leave him \n     here alone, to die alone.'' And I walked over to the side of \n     the bed. I took Butch's hand, held it, rubbed his arms, and \n     tried to comfort him in the sense of saying, ``It's all \n     right. You're at peace now. You'll be joining your God and \n     your creator.'' And Butch died just a few moments after that.\n       The nurse came back in the room. She called one of, I \n     believe, his aunts. His aunt actually was already on her way. \n     She walked in within a few minutes. I explained to her that \n     Butch had just died. I hugged her, embraced her, and again \n     told her that he died in peace and he died in the hands of \n     his God and creator.\n       As you can imagine, as I made my way back to the Senate and \n     back to the dining room so I could tell his colleagues on the \n     staff of the dining room that Butch had died, as you can \n     imagine, I was asking myself several questions. How did you \n     get there that day? Why were you there at that moment? What \n     was it that you were supposed to learn from that experience?\n       And what I learned from the experience is something that's \n     all too obvious, but sometimes we have a tendency to forget, \n     and that is that in God's eyes, as it should be in our eyes, \n     that all of us are equal. It makes no difference whether \n     you're a United States Senator or whether you're a buy boy in \n     the United States Senate. (Applause.)\n       Another experience that happened to me was again an \n     acquaintance of mine, and frankly, an acquaintance of many \n     people in this room, Tom Korologos. Tom's wife Joy passed \n     away as the result of melanoma, the same kind of cancer that \n     killed my brother in 1979. I picked up the phone and I called \n     Tom and gave my condolences and expressed my concern and my \n     love for him.\n       I ended up going to Joy's funeral service. And again, I had \n     maybe met Joy once. And as I was sitting in the church \n     waiting for the service to begin, I was again asking myself--\n     again, to the members of the House and Senate, and clearly \n     the President and the Vice President, understand this \n     incredible demand on us for our time. And it's almost a \n     natural thing to kind of ask every place we go. ``Why are we \n     here?''\n       And so as I'm, waiting for this service to begin, I'm \n     asking those same kind of questions. Why am I here? Well, \n     once the service began and the family began to express their \n     deep convictions to their Lord and maker, it was pretty \n     obvious to me why I was there. I wrote down some notes that \n     morning during the service of some feelings that went through \n     my mind, and I want to share from the notes that I made that \n     morning. So they may not be grammatically collect, so bear \n     with me. I'm going to read them exactly as I wrote them.\n       ``Was there because I have replaced the love of self with \n     the love for others. Being at the funeral service for Joy \n     Korologos also allowed me to recognize that doing God's will \n     is not the pursuit of the grand, but rather one day at a \n     time, one moment at a time, pursuing God's will; that if I \n     allow God to guide me one step at a time, I will eventually \n     get to where he wants me to be in my life. And if I truly \n     believe, if I truly believe this and follow that belief \n     throughout each day, I will be free. I will be at peace; the \n     ultimate freedom, to be free of worldly desires.''\n       I also learned that this moment was a life-changing moment. \n     As I said above, pursue God's will one step at a time and not \n     worry or even wonder where it may lead me. This is a radical \n     departure for me from my previous life--management by \n     objectives, goal-setting, state a goal, a target, an \n     objective, and then pursue it. Now for me it is ``Help me, \n     dear God, to do what is right, what is in your will at this \n     moment, and then my life will take care of itself.''\n       To me, this was a great revelation. Two points that I would \n     want to build on here for just a moment; that doing God's \n     will is not the pursuit of the grand. I don't know about you, \n     but as I have thought about trying to understand God's will, \n     I always had this idea that there was some huge event in the \n     future that I was called on to participate in, always trying \n     to figure out what it was; never could do it.\n       And now I understand that if each day I will pursue God's \n     will--and I think you're beginning to understand why I said a \n     moment ago that when Danny called me and asked me if I would \n     be willing to give this address this morning, I had no choice \n     but to do it, because on that day my sense was it was God's \n     will that I speak this morning. So, again, I try to live each \n     day now attentive, attentive to the needs of others, \n     attentive to the needs of my colleagues in the Senate, trying \n     to make sure that I am not so busy that I don't hear their \n     cries for help.\n       I'd like to close my thoughts here this morning with \n     another personal experience. And I want to use 1 Corinthians, \n     chapter 13, verse 13, which I suspect that many of you are \n     familiar with. I have used 1 Corinthians 13 at both weddings \n     and at funerals, because in essence it is all about life. \n     ``And now abide faith, hope, love, these three. But the \n     greatest of these is love.''\n       And I don't know about you, but I've always kind of \n     wondered what makes love the greatest of those three. And I \n     will try to explain in just a couple of minutes at least what \n     my understanding of that Bible reading is.\n       Both my mother and father died during these past 20 months \n     or so. In a conversation in Bible study, as I was expressing \n     my concerns about having a deeper understanding of love and \n     trying to understand my relationship with my God and maker, \n     it was said to me that sometimes it's helpful to think about \n     your loving relationship with your father here on Earth. It \n     may give you some insight into your loving relationship with \n     your God.\n       Well, as would, I think, be natural when you see your \n     parents heading towards the last moments of their life, it's \n     fairly easy to get into a discussion about what love is all \n     about. And I found out one of the things that there's a big \n     difference between the love between a mother and her son and \n     a father and his son. My mother loved me unconditionally. It \n     made no matter what I did. She was there to comfort me, to \n     love me, to protect me.\n       But with my father, frankly, it was different. And I didn't \n     understand what that relationship was. Was the relationship \n     one\n\n[[Page S3734]]\n\n     that was based on a need for reward? Was I looking for \n     respect? What portion of it was fear? And as I watched my \n     father over the last 20 years or so and recognized that he \n     did over 17,000 hours of volunteer time at the local \n     hospitals, and I heard people talk about seeing my father \n     helping them being wheeled down to surgery or to the X-ray, I \n     sensed that there was a strong sense of love that my father \n     had expressed during those years.\n       And I finally understood the significance of the meaning of \n     love and why love is so important, because frankly love is a \n     collection of all the graces that God has given us in which \n     we express in action, that we act in behalf of or on behalf \n     of those less fortunate than us, those who at the moment need \n     our assistance. And so for all those years I saw this \n     outpouring of love from my mother and father and I understood \n     then why I love my father and why I loved my Father in \n     heaven, and it is very simple. It is because they so deeply \n     loved me.\n       Thank you. Have a great day. (Applause.)\n       Senator Akaka. Ladies and gentlemen, it is now my privilege \n     and high honor to introduce the President of the United \n     States, William Jefferson Clinton. Welcome, Mr. President. \n     (Applause.)\n       President Clinton. Thank you very much. Thank you very much \n     to my good friend and sometimes golfing partner, Senator \n     Akaka, to all the members of Congress here, Reverend Graham, \n     other head table guests and ladies and gentlemen.\n       For five years now, Hillary and I have looked forward to \n     this day. For me it's a day in which I can be with other \n     people of faith and pray and ask for your prayers, both as \n     President and as just another child of God. I have done it \n     for five years, and I do so again today.\n       At each of these breakfasts, from our shared experiences \n     and our prayers, God's grace always seems to come, bringing \n     strength and wisdom and peace. Today I come more than \n     anything else to say thank you. First, thank you, Connie \n     Mack, for your wonderful message and the power of your \n     example. I also thank all of you here for many things in the \n     last five years and ask your help in helping us to work \n     together to make our nation better, and the work that God has \n     sent me to do and you to do.\n       I thank you for helping me to strike blows for religious \n     liberty--with the work so many of you in this room have done \n     to help us to protect the rights of federal employees, to \n     follow their faith at work, our students in school. In \n     particular, I want to thank Reverend Don Argue, the former \n     President of the National Association of Evangelicals and \n     Rabbi Arthur Schneier and the Roman Catholic Archbishop of \n     Newark, Theodore McCarrik, who next week will go to China to \n     look into religious practices there and to begin a dialogue \n     there in hopes that a part of our relationship with China \n     will be about our concern for the kind of religious liberty \n     we have practiced here this morning. (Applause.)\n       I thank so many of you in the community of faith who have \n     worked with the government in partnership to help move poor \n     families from welfare, from welfare to work, to honor the \n     Scripture that our friend Dorothy Height read today. And I \n     ask more of you to join in. I thank those of you who have \n     been responsible for working with me--and I see Senator \n     Grassley out there and Harris Wofford is here--to bring \n     communities of faith into the circle of national service.\n       We now have 5,000 young Americans working with religious \n     organizations earning the Americorps scholarship to go to \n     college with after they serve with their community of faith \n     wherever they live in America. And the Congress has provided \n     for many more positions, and I ask you to help us to enlist \n     more young Americans to give meaning to their lives, to live \n     out their faith, and to help make our country a better place.\n       I thank you for the prayers, the letters, the scriptural \n     instruction that I have gotten from so many of you and many \n     others around this country in recent weeks and indeed in the \n     last five years. And I ask that they continue.\n       Finally, I couldn't help thinking when Connie Mack was \n     talking that what we all need very much is to take what we \n     feel when we're here every year and keep it close with us \n     when we leave here every year--day in and day out, week in \n     and week out, in good times and bad. And I ask for your help \n     in that.\n       We have a difficult decision we are facing now, as a \n     country and our administration, because of the concern all \n     Americans have that we not expose our children, if we can \n     help it, to the dangers of chemical and biological warfare. \n     And last night I came across a scripture verse that a friend \n     of mine sent me in the last 72 hours that I had not had the \n     chance to read--a prayer of King Solomon that I ask you to \n     keep in mind as we face this decision. Solomon said in I \n     Kings, ``I am only a little child, and I do not know how to \n     carry out my duties. Your servant is here among people you \n     have chosen--a great people--too numerous to count or number. \n     So you give your servant a discerning heart to govern your \n     people and to distinguish between right and wrong, for who is \n     able to govern this great people of yours.''\n       I also ask for your prayers as we work together to continue \n     to take our country to higher ground and to remember the \n     admonition to Micah, which I try to repeat to myself on a \n     very regular basis. I ask your prayers that I and we might \n     act justly and love mercy and walk humbly with our God. Thank \n     you very much. (Applause.)\n       Sen. Akaka. Thank you very much, Mr. President, for that \n     wonderful message of gratitude and prayer. Thank you for \n     sharing your wisdom and inspiration. And thank you for making \n     the time to join us this morning. And I want you to know that \n     we are praying for you.\n       To offer the benediction, I'm thrilled to welcome back to \n     the National Prayer Breakfast a man whose presence inspires \n     all of us to good and whose wisdom brings us comfort and \n     hope, Dr. Billy Graham. We love you, Dr. Graham. (Applause.)\n       Dr. Graham. Thank you very much. And as far as I'm \n     concerned, I give all the glory and praise to God. \n     (Applause.) It's been my privilege to be at many of these \n     prayer breakfasts, I suppose more than any other person. \n     (Laughter.) In fact, they told me that when I was interviewed \n     by Senator Sam Nunn the other day about the history of the \n     prayer breakfast, that they thought I was the oldest person \n     that had attended the prayer breakfast for so long. And I \n     suppose that's right. And they couldn't find any others that \n     had been to so many, and so they asked me if I would be \n     interviewed for the Archives--(laughter)--and the history of \n     the prayer breakfast. (Laughter.)\n       But I don't know when I've been so moved at a prayer \n     breakfast as this one. I feel the Holy Spirit is bringing us \n     together and speaking to us. (Applause.) Not only different \n     religious backgrounds, but different political backgrounds. \n     And here I see members of all parties smiling, listening to \n     the Word of God, listening to this magnificent word on the \n     love of God an the love that he can put in our hearts.\n       And when the President spoke, I could not help but think of \n     the various times that I've had the privilege of being with \n     him alone to talk, read the Bible and pray. And I know that \n     he's sincere in what he had to say. And to Vice President \n     Gore and to all of you that are here, many of you, I look at \n     you and I think back to times we've been together in years \n     past, in your state, in your town. I'm an evangelist. I \n     travel from place to place and preach the gospel. And it's \n     the same gospel I started with. The human heart is the same. \n     The gospel is the same. It never changes, that God loves \n     you no matter who you are. (Applause.)\n       So I'm going to ask that we have this closing prayer \n     together.\n       Our Father and our God, as we come to the close of another \n     National Prayer Breakfast, we pause to give you thanks for \n     the opportunity we have had to come apart from our daily \n     tasks and turn our minds and our hearts to you. Give us a \n     holy dissatisfaction with anything less than your perfect \n     will that we heard expressed a few moments ago.\n       Help us to see ourselves as we truly are in your sight, as \n     men and women who are subject to the temptations of pride and \n     power and flesh and who need your forgiveness and your \n     strength. Help us remember that you teach us that we're all \n     sinners and everyone who is in this place needs repentance \n     and forgiveness, including me.\n       May we all come to the cross. And by your grace, help us to \n     turn to you for the forgiveness and mercy we need. We thank \n     you for the promise of the Bible, that if we truly confess \n     our sins that you're faithful and just to forgive us our sins \n     and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\n       As we leave this place, help us to find in you the strength \n     we need to live as we should. Give us motives that are pure, \n     lips that are honest, lives that are blameless, and hearts \n     that are filled with compassion and love.\n       We pray for the millions of the hungry and poor in our \n     world and for the thousands even in our own land and for all \n     who are oppressed, that we will not be deaf to their cries. \n     We pray today especially for President and Mrs. Clinton, for \n     Vice President and Mrs. Gore, for the Cabinet, for members of \n     the Supreme Court, for the Congress and all others to whom \n     you have given responsibility in our land, and for their \n     families who many times have to bear the burden of \n     responsibility.\n       Give them strength and courage, integrity and wisdom, as \n     they face the complex problems of our nation and our world. \n     And, O Lord, we pray that we will be faithful in praying that \n     if it be thy will that thou would bring peace to the Middle \n     East. And we pray that if it be thy will, that we'll not have \n     war, as President Yeltsin has warned us about.\n       Send the strong driving wind of the Holy Spirit across our \n     land, to bring us a new breath of joy and freedom in serving \n     you. May we see a national, an international revival. Renew \n     our vision. Restore our faith. Rekindle our desire to love \n     and serve you and serve each other. As we leave this place, \n     may we commit ourselves afresh to him who alone is the way, \n     the truth and the life.\n       And now, may the Lord bless you and keep you, the Lord make \n     his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you, the Lord \n     lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace. In the \n     Name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen. \n     (Applause.)\n       Senator Akaka. Thank you. Thank you very much, Dr. Graham. \n     This concludes the 46th National Prayer Breakfast. I ask all \n     of you to please rise and remain standing until the President \n     and Mrs. Clinton and Vice President and Mrs. Gore depart from \n     the ballroom. (Applause.)\n       I thank all of you for your participation and your \n     cooperation. Trust in God and carry his love with you and \n     share it with others today and every day. Thank you very\n\n[[Page S3735]]\n\n     much. This concludes the National Prayer Breakfast. \n     (Applause.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/28/senate-section/article/S3730-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I became an official \ncosponsor of S. 1645, the Child Custody Protection Act introduced by \nSenator Abraham. This bill addresses a very critical problem impacting \nour nation's families and their children, abortion. Under this bill, \nadults who take children across state lines to receive an abortion \nwithout the knowledge of their parents would be committing a federal \noffense.\n  Currently, 22 states require parental notification if a minor is \ngoing to receive an abortion. Yet, each and every day adults help \nthousands of children travel across state lines to receive abortions in \nstates which do not require the notification of a parent.\n  Being an ardent opponent of abortion, I am gravely concerned about \nthe children who are being taken by adults, who are not their parents, \ninto different states to receive abortions. This process is wrong and \nmust be stopped. We cannot allow adults to circumvent state laws by \ntransporting a minor across state lines for an abortion without \nparental consent and involvement.\n  The decision to have an abortion is a critical decision, one which I \npersonally hope that women of all ages would elect not to have. \nHowever, despite an individual's personal opinion on abortion, the \nmajority of Americans, myself included, believe it is imperative for \nminor children to involve their parents in this life altering decision. \nAccording to a 1996 Gallup poll, 74 percent of Americans supported \nrequiring minors to get parental consent for an abortion. According to \nthe Supreme Court, ``the medical, emotional, and psychological \nconsequences of an abortion are serious and can be lasting; this is \nparticularly so when the patient is immature.'' Clearly, our nation's \nchildren should not be kept from their parents when making an important \nlife decision with such broad ramifications as an abortion.\n  This is why I am cosponsoring Senator Abraham's bill, the ``Child \nCustody Protection Act.'' This bill would make it a federal offense to \ntransport a minor across state lines with intent to avoid state laws \nrequiring parental involvement in a minor's abortion.\n  It is my firm belief that we must pass this law and stop people from \nbypassing the laws of our individual states. This legislation protects \nour children from making a life altering decision without the guidance \nof their most trusted advisors, their parents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/28/senate-section/article/S3735-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO THE NATIONAL ORDER OF WOMEN LEGISLATORS\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and \ncommend the National Order of Women Legislators and the Georgia Chapter \nof the National Order of Women Legislators as they celebrate today 60 \nyears of accomplishments since the organization was founded in 1938.\n  This year also marks the 150th Anniversary of the first Women's \nRights Convention ever held to discuss the prohibitions then in force \non women voting, holding public office, owning property, signing \nofficial documents, and receiving a formal education.\n  The women who have served in the National Order of Women Legislators \nand the Georgia Chapter of that organization have overcome gender \nbarriers and are true champions of the women's rights movement. I \napplaud these women for fighting for and delivering to the women of \nthis nation the right to vote, and a vital voice in local, state and \nnational government.\n  The Declaration of Sentiments issued by the 1848 convention held in \nSeneca Falls, New York, launched a movement that unleashed and enhanced \nthe myriad of talents and intellectual abilities already possessed by \nwomen throughout the United States. The resulting Women's Rights \nMovement has had a profound and undeniable impact on all aspects of \nAmerican life, and has opened new and well deserved opportunities for \nwomen.\n  I would especially like to commend the spirit and hard work of \nRebecca Latimer Felton, the first Georgia woman elected to the United \nStates Senate in 1992, two years after women gained the right to vote; \nFlorence Reville Gibbs, the first Georgia woman to serve in the United \nStates House of Representatives (1940-1941); Viola Ross Napier, the \nfirst woman to serve in the Georgia House of Representatives (1923-\n1926); Susie Tilman Moore, the first woman to serve in the Georgia \nState Senate (1933-1934 and 1939-1940); and Grace Towns Hamilton, the \nfirst African American woman elected to the Georgia House of \nRepresentatives (1966-1984).\n  I am honored to serve in the United States Senate with nine \nremarkable female Senators--Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Susan Collins \n(R-ME), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Mary \nLandrieu (D-LA), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Carol Moseley-Braun (D-IL), \nPatty Murray (D-WA), and Olympia Snowe (R-ME). I also commend the 55 \nfemale members of the U.S. House of Representatives and female members \nin the Georgia State Legislature.\n  Members of National Order of Women Legislators serve as role models \nfor women throughout this nation and the entire world. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me today in saluting and congratulating the National \nOrder of Women Legislators and the Georgia Chapter of the National \nOrder of Women Legislators for setting a positive example to all \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/28/senate-section/article/S3735-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO THE HOLLIS/BROOKLINE STUDENTS FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION IN \n                        ``WE THE PEOPLE . . .''\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to 27 students from Hollis/Brookline High School for winning \nthe right to represent New Hampshire in the ``We the People . . . The \nCitizen and the Constitution'' national competition in Washington, D.C.\n  As the New Hampshire state champions, the Hollis/Brookline students \nwill compete against more than 1200 students from across the United \nStates in a three-day national competition May 2-4, 1998. Students will \ndemonstrate their knowledge of the Constitution and its relevance to \ncontemporary issues in front of simulated congressional committees \ncomposed of constitutional scholars, lawyers, journalists, and \ngovernment leaders.\n  The distinguished members of the Hollis/Brookline team are: Meghan \nAmber, Wayne Beuner, Randy Brown, Jonathon Davies, Meredith Edmunds, \nJaima Elliott, Emily Gagne, Sara Godshall, Laura Hacker, Alex Harris, \nNicola Huns, Craig Kimball, Sarah Kirby, Anna Klein, Brannon Klein, \nMaya Levine, Sara Liebling, Kass Litwin, Heidi Packard, Amy Rattin, \nJared Rosenberg, Nadine Schneider, Carrie Spaulding, Kent Springfield, \nAnja Helene Stronen-Lien, Amy Tozier and Amanda Vormelker. Their \nteachers, Helen Melanson and Joel Mitchell, deserve special recognition \nfor their role in preparing these students for this intense \nconstitutional testing. I applaud them for their commitment to \nenriching the lives of these students.\n  As a former high school civics teacher myself, I recognize the value \nof instilling an understanding of the Constitution in students. The \n``We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution'' program \nprovides an excellent opportunity for students to gain an informed \nperspective about the history and principles of our nation's \nconstitutional government. I wish these young constitutional experts \nfrom Hollis/Brookline High School the best of luck in preparing for the \nnational finals. It is an honor to have them represent New Hampshire, \nand I wish them luck as they prepare to be America's leaders in the \ntwenty-first century.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator \nJeffords and Senator Reed, I would like to submit this statement given \nby Ms. Raynice Brumfield of Washington, D.C. for the Record. Ms. \nBrumfield testified at this morning's Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee hearing on Reading and Literacy Initiatives. I commend her \nfor the progress she has made as a participant of the D.C. Head Start \nToyota\n\n[[Page S3736]]\n\nFamily Literacy Program. Her testimony was very moving and she is a \nsuccess story for others to emulate.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Ms. Brumfield's testimony be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The testimony follows:\n\n  Testimony of Raynice Brumfield, District of Columbia Public Schools \n             Head Start ``Toyota Family Literacy Program''\n\n       Ms. Brumfield. Thank you Senator Jeffords and members of \n     the Senate Committee, for inviting me to share my story with \n     you. By virtue of the fact that I can sit before you to take \n     part in this occasion, proves that without a program like the \n     Toyota Family Learning Tree, I would still be just stuck in \n     the house, taking care of my two small children, faced with a \n     future that didn't look bright.\n       I am Raynice Brumfield. I am a 25 year old single parent \n     with four children; James 10, Delonte 8, Kiara 5, and Tyrone, \n     age 4. I was born in Washington, D.C., and attended the \n     public schools there. When I was 15 years old I became \n     pregnant with my first child. Between the ages of 15 and 17, \n     I worked at various jobs. I soon found that I could not make \n     enough money to afford food, clothing, baby supplies and \n     living expenses. At age 17, I became pregnant with my second \n     child. By 19, I enrolled in one of the District of Columbia's \n     public vocational schools. I dropped out of that school \n     because the staff was not sensitive to the needs of young \n     mothers, and I did not feel safe in that environment. I \n     started to receive Public Assistance when I was 19, and soon \n     became pregnant with Kiara, and the next year, Tyrone.\n       The opportunity to further my education, while being close \n     to my children, seemed like a dream come true. On September \n     30th, 1996 my children and I started school. The adult \n     education teacher (Mrs. Grace Blackwood), and the parenting \n     instructor (Mrs. Irene Ball), greeted me warmly. I was quiet, \n     scared, and very unsure of myself.\n       When I entered the program my reading and math levels were \n     at a second grade level. My teachers, and the program's \n     coordinator, Mrs. Peggy Minnis, made the other parents and me \n     feel like we could accomplish anything. They made sure that \n     we maintained a positive self esteem. We were encouraged to \n     set goals, and they helped us work to meet each goal. The \n     work was hard, but soon it became a daily routine, for my \n     children and I to sit at the kitchen table, learning \n     together. As my reading skills improved, I began to enjoy \n     reading stories to my children at home, and going into their \n     classroom to practice and share my new skills with any child \n     who wanted to crawl up in my lap, to hear me read. The harder \n     I worked, the easier it became to help my older children with \n     their homework. I began taking part in the activities at \n     their school. My children's home library grew from 2 or 3 \n     books, to over 40. Reading stories or telling stories to my \n     children has helped in their language development and \n     provided me with practice in reading.\n       The parenting course helped me understand child \n     development. Understanding the stages that my children were \n     going through, helped me to be patient, understanding, and \n     able to predict their behavior. I learned that there are \n     whole new worlds that my family and I can explore for free. \n     We visit these new worlds every weekend inside the public \n     library. I tell my children that even though we don't have a \n     lot of money, we can still visit far away places and people. \n     Most importantly, we enjoy these adventures as a family. All \n     of my children have their own library cards. I've become a \n     responsible citizen who has a voter registration card and I \n     vote.\n       As a result of being in the Toyota Family Literacy Program, \n     new worlds have opened up for me and my family. Worlds that \n     were once just part of my day dreams. . . . are now a \n     reality. I am proud to tell you that I now read on a 10th \n     grade level, and my math skills have increased to a 9th grade \n     level. I received an award from my children's school, which \n     honored me as being, ``Most Active Parent in Schoolwide \n     Activities.'' I have volunteered more than 200 hours in my \n     children's school. My children's report cards and teacher \n     comments are no longer negative, but positive. I was invited \n     to speak at last year's 27th Annual Congressional Black \n     Caucus Legislative Conference in Washington, DC, by New \n     Jersey's Representative Donald M. Payne. I shared how Toyota \n     through the National Center for Family Literacy and the Head \n     Start Program are helping to improve literacy in the African \n     American community by focusing on young children and their \n     parents. That speech was placed on the E-mail system of every \n     congressman and representative in Congress. Now the most \n     powerful people in the United States have heard about the \n     wonderful work that all of you in this room have dedicated \n     your lives to.\n       In January, the Head Start Program invited me to be a guest \n     speaker at their staff development activities. Again, I told \n     how family literacy programs make futures bright. I just took \n     the GED examination on the 16th.\n       My adult education teacher encouraged me to apply for an \n     intensive training program through the YWCA's Non-Traditional \n     Jobs For Women Program last school year. I was accepted into \n     the program, and have completed the training, which prepared \n     me to be trained as a carpenter, plumber, mason, or \n     electrical worker.\n       Upon notification of having passed the GED, I have been \n     promised priority consideration for a non-traditional job at \n     George Washington University (in the District of Columbia) \n     through a partnership that has been set up between our \n     program and the university.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination on \nthe Executive Calendar: Calendar No. 578.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the nomination be confirmed; \nthat the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any \nstatements relating to the nomination appear at the appropriate place \nin the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action; and that the Senate then return to legislative \nsession.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination was considered and confirmed, as follows:\n\n\n                     department of veterans affairs\n\n       Togo Dennis West, Jr., of the District of Columbia, to be \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on February 24, 1998, the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs held a hearing on the nomination of Acting Secretary \nof the Department of Veterans Affairs Togo D. West, Jr. be the \npermanent Secretary of that agency. The committee carefully evaluated \nthe nominee and his statements before the committee. It reviewed Mr. \nWest's submissions of his background and financial interests and the \ninvestigation completed on all Presidential nominations and conducted \nby the Federal Bureau of Investigation. As a result, the committee \nvoted unanimously on April 21 to report favorably to the full Senate \nthe nomination of Togo D. West, Jr. to be the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs has been without a permanent \nSecretary since Jesse Brown resigned in July 1997. This is too long a \nperiod for any department of the Federal government to be without its \nsenior leader and manager. It is especially true for the Department of \nVeterans Affairs which is in a period of major transition\n\n[[Page S3737]]\n\nof its health program from inpatient to outpatient care in a period of \na declining real budget. In addition, the Department's administration \nof its benefits programs has been seriously challenged and is in need \nof major restructuring and effective leadership. Also, the Department, \nlike other federal departments and agencies, faces a major hurdle in \nadjusting its computer-based information systems to the Year 2000.\n  It appears to me that Togo D. West, Jr. has the prerequisite \nqualifications to meet these challenges, to lead the Department, and to \nprovide the health and benefits services which our veterans have come \nto expect and deserve.\n  Mr. West has been serving as Acting Secretary since January 2, 1998, \npursuant to a December 2, 1997, Presidential directive under authority \nof the so-called ``Vacancies Act,'' 5 U.S.C. 3348. He concurrently has \nbeen serving as Secretary of the Army, a position he has held since \nNovember 1993. He relinquishes that position upon being sworn in as \nSecretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  Mr. West's background is extensive and impressive. He was \ncommissioned a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Field Artillery Corps \nupon graduation from college and following law school, he was called to \nactive duty in the Army's Judge Advocate General Corps. In 1975, he \nserved in the Department of Justice as an Associate Deputy Attorney \nGeneral and in 1977 he was named General Counsel for the Navy. In 1979, \nhe served as the Special Assistant to the Secretary of Defense and \nDeputy Secretary, and in January 1980 was appointed General Counsel of \nthe Department of Defense.\n  Mr. West is an articulate and dedicated public servant. I believe \nthat he will serve well the Department and our country's veterans. \nTherefore, I thank my colleagues for their support of this nomination.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I'm delighted to join the Chairman of \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Mr. Specter, in bringing before the \nSenate the nomination of Togo D. West, Jr., to be Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs and urging his confirmation.\n  Mr. President, Togo West has a long history of serving his country \nand America's service members. He began his career as an Army lawyer \nfrom 1969 to 1973, first as part of the Army Judge Advocate General's \nCorps and later with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army \nfor Manpower and Reserve Affairs. He left the Army in 1973, but never \nstrayed far from public service. In 1975, he served in the Department \nof Justice as Associate Deputy Attorney General. In 1977, he was \nappointed to serve as the Department of the Navy's General Counsel. \nFrom there, he also served as the Special Assistant to the Secretary \nand Deputy Secretary of Defense, and in 1980 he was appointed General \nCounsel of the Department of Defense.\n  Most recently, Togo West served our country as Secretary of the Army, \na position he held beginning in 1993, until President Clinton appointed \nhim Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs on January 2, 1998. As \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, West will be responsible for \nsafeguarding and improving the VA's system of delivering health care \nand benefits to America's 26 million veterans. VA is the second largest \nfederal agency, employing almost 235,000 people, many of them veterans \nthemselves.\n  Togo West will be filling the vacancy left by Jesse Brown, the former \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs. Jesse Brown has always been a tireless \nveterans advocate, and his leadership and energy are missed by veterans \nand others who also fight on behalf of veterans.\n  Mr. President, Togo West has a wonderful opportunity to serve the \nveterans of our Nation in this new capacity. He has demonstrated \nhimself to be a person of the highest integrity with extraordinary \nleadership skills. President Clinton has shown great confidence in him, \nhis work, and his commitment to veterans by nominating him to serve in \nthis important position. I concur with the President who has said that \nTogo West ``has always understood the special responsibility we owe to \nour men and women in uniform both during and after their years of \nservice.'' His unique perspective and experience will serve him well in \nmeeting the challenges that lie ahead.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of the confirmation of Togo West. I thank \nmy colleagues for their unanimous support of this nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/28/senate-section/article/S3736-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I transmit also, for the \ninformation of the Senate, the report of the Department of State with \nrespect to the Treaty.\n  The Treaty is one of a series of modern mutual legal assistance \ntreaties that the United States is negotiating in order to counter \ncriminal activities more effectively. The Treaty should be an effective \ntool to assist in the prosecution of a wide variety of modern \ncriminals, including those involved in terrorism, other violent crimes, \ndrug trafficking, money laundering, and other ``white-collar'' crime. \nThe Treaty is self-executing, and will not require new legislation.\n  The Treaty provides for a broad range of cooperation in criminal \nmatters.
