I rise to make brief remarks about an important topic. \nThe topic is the way in which we control our deployment of the \nresources of the American people. That is just another way of saying it \nis about spending.\n  Over and over again, we come to the end of the fiscal year for the \nFederal Government and we are threatened with the absence of a spending \nplan. In the absence of a spending plan, we experience what are called \nGovernment shutdowns. It is at a time like that, when we have the \npotential for shutdown because we do not have any spending plan, that \npeople begin to load up the budget with things they want. They know \nthat the threat of a shutdown makes it more likely that things which \ncould not pass muster on their own, which would not really be justified \nin the cold, hard light of reason and in the inspection and \nexamination of normal debate, would be included.\n\n  This is one of the reasons the deficit has become so high; under the \npressure of the deadline and potential of a Government shutdown people \nare able to get spending plans enacted which simply divert resources, \nwaste resources,\n\n[[Page S3700]]\n\nand spend more resources than we have. It exacerbates the deficit; it \nhurts the potential of this country; it shows the absence of discipline \nwhich is indicative of the irresponsibility of the Congress.\n  We should not allow that to happen. We should not put ourselves in a \nsituation where we come to the end of the fiscal year and the President \ncan say, if you do not put $10 billion or $11 billion or $14 billion \nmore in the budget, I will veto the spending plan altogether, and we \nwill end up with a shutdown and the American people will be held \nhostage until you agree to the plan for more spending.\n  When people are held hostage the debate does not focus on the merits \nof spending issues, it focuses on the pain of the people who are held \nhostage without Government services. We desperately need to develop a \nway in which to handle our budget and appropriations process that does \nnot allow the people to be held hostage by the President at the end of \nthe year. The President should not be able to say, I will veto anything \nyou send unless it has great expansions of programs to which you would \nnot otherwise agree.\n  It is with that in mind that I rise today to support what will be \ndebated in this Senate, and I hope will be enacted shortly, and that is \na continuing resolution. A continuing resolution is the way for us to \nhave a spending plan which will be in place if we do not reach one in \nthe ordinary budget and appropriations process. And it is a way of \nsaying we will continue spending at some ratio of the previous levels, \neven in the absence of a budget for next year until we come to an \nagreement.\n  The real virtue of this is simply that it will allow us to debate \nissues about spending in the next budget even at the close of a budget \nyear without the potential of the American people being held hostage to \na shutdown.\n  I think that is a wise thing to do. That way we will look at each \nissue on its merits instead of looking at the pain that might be \ninflicted upon the country if the President vetoes a budget, shutting \ndown the country and saying unless you do what I say, I am going to \nkeep it shut down and see to it that these people have more injury and \nmore pain.\n  We have been through that. We had the longest shutdown in history \nbecause of disagreements between the Congress and the President.\n  Now, there is a proclivity to say, well, it was the Congress' fault. \nWell, the Congress did pass a budget, but the President vetoed that \nbudget. We do not want to be in that position again. So we need to put \nin place a continuing resolution, to do it now in the dispassionate \ncool of spring and not at the time at the end of the year when the \nPresident can say, well, if you do not do it my way, it is my way or \nthe highway. You just send everything home. The people would be held \nhostage, and we would not really debate the issue on its merits.\n  It is with that in mind I support the effort that is being made by \nthe Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] to provide a basis for a \ncontinuing resolution. I think it is the kind of responsible Government \nthat helps us represent the people well and keeps us from \ninappropriately, improperly spending the resources of taxpayers based \nupon demands that are made at a time when urgency causes people to make \ndecisions that merit would not justify.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed \nto speak for 15 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank, you Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk today about something that I think will \nbe coming up next week, and that is the supplemental appropriations \nbill. This will be the first appropriations bill that has come to the \nfloor this year. So I think it is wise for us to set the policy for how \nwe are going to handle appropriations for the full year.\n  All of us remember 1995 and the time that Government shut down, \nputting Government employees in a situation of not being quite sure if \nthey would get paid, not being able to work even if they wanted to. We \nhad people who had planned for family vacations who were not able to \nget into the Washington Monument or the Smithsonian or many of our \nnational parks. As we begin to set the policy for how Congress is going \nto handle appropriations this year, I think it is most important we set \nthe ground rules to have a functioning Government at a reasonable level \nso there will not be any fears of a Government shutdown; So that \nagencies can plan in case some of the appropriations bills are not \npassed by September 30.\n  Now, many people know that we have 13 different appropriations bills. \nEach appropriations bill goes forward for its particular agency or \ngroup of agencies. Many times we face the end of the fiscal year when \nsix appropriations bills are passed and signed by the President and \nmaybe seven are not yet finished because there are still negotiations \nbetween the President and Congress. There is no question that there are \ndifferent priorities between the President and Congress in many areas. \nThe defense bill, for instance, is one that usually is the last to pass \nbecause there will be a difference on how we prioritize our defense \nexpenditures. It could also happen in the case of other agencies and \nother appropriations bills.\n  I think that it is just time that we set the policy. Senator John \nMcCain and I have introduced a bill called the Government Shutdown \nPrevention Act. We are going to offer this bill to the upcoming \nsupplemental appropriations bill because we think this is the \nappropriate time and the appropriate place to say this is how we will \nhandle it this year.\n  This is good government. It is responsible government. We have some \nvery important supplemental appropriations. We are going to, hopefully, \nbe helping the flood victims of North Dakota and other disaster victims \nthat have met with tragedies during the first part of this year. We are \ngoing to be making sure that our troops in Bosnia have the funding that \nthey need, without taking so much from our defense budget that our \nother young men and women are not able to be trained.\n  So these are important supplemental appropriations. I think it is \nmost important that we also take care of the business of governing, and \nthat we say, right now, there is not going to be a Government shutdown. \nThere is not going to be a disruption in services. We will fund \nGovernment at 98 percent of the 1997 spending levels. That 2 percent \nleaves Congress the ability to do what it is going to do in the \nnegotiations that might occur after September 30 and not spend money \nthat has not actually been appropriated. I think that is most important \nif we are going to have all the options that Congress should have \nregardless of whether it has reached an agreement with the President.\n  Now, all of us hope that we will have an agreement. But we believe it \nis not in anyone's interest to be up against a September 30 deadline \nwhen all of a sudden you have the hammer over people and lives being \ndisrupted all over America. So you do things that are not based on the \nmerits of the argument between spending in one area or spending in \nanother. You do things because you have this artificial hammer hanging \nover your head, saying people's lives are going to be disrupted. They \nare not going to be able to get passports, they will not be able to \ntake their vacations. They will not be able to assure that veterans \nbenefits will be paid. Federal employees will not know for sure that \nthey will get paid, although in my wildest imagination I cannot imagine \nany Congress not paying our Government employees. That is what we are \ntrying to do with the Government Shutdown Prevention Act.\n  I think it is important we start talking about it now because this \nwill be part of the debate next week. I would like to see this \namendment put on in a bipartisan way, unanimously. I would like to see \nthat everyone agrees that this is a reasonable approach.\n  We have talked to many people about it in Congress, on both sides of \nthe rotunda, trying to come up with the right percentage. Many people \nwanted to go lower than 98 percent of previous year's funding. Many \npeople were concerned about not having enough of an incentive to \ncontinue to negotiate. But I felt that 75 percent was not reasonable. I \nthink we want to make sure that the\n\n[[Page S3701]]\n\nGovernment that is going to keep running can run on a reasonable basis. \nIf anyone doesn't think 98 percent is reasonable, welcome to the real \nworld. Is there a family in America that hasn't had to make do with 2 \npercent less to spend? Is there a small business in America that hasn't \nmade a 2-percent cut in their budget?\n  So if a Government employee tells me that the agency can't run at the \n98-percent level, I would say that they are not qualified to manage \ntheir agency. We can save money to make sure that we are planning for \nthe future. And that is another reason why I think we ought to pass \nthis legislation right now. I think we should let our Government \nagencies know that if there is a disagreement in October, plan now to \nknow that you are going to be able to operate at a 98-percent level. \nSo, you can plan ahead, and if you need to make provisions, you can do \nit now. I think that is another good reason for us to do it early, \nrather than waiting until some other appropriations bill comes up to \nthe floor, which might be in June or July. That is not as much planning \ntime. So we are talking about good government. We are talking about \nresponsible governing and trying to handle the issues for which we are \nresponsible as a U.S. Congress in a responsible way.\n  Now, I think this is something that the Democrats would probably \nwelcome because they have said, on the occasions where the potential \nfor a Government shutdown has come, that they think this is not a \nresponsible way to run a railroad. They have said that in many heated \ndebates. I hope that they will come along and work with us--and I think \nthey will, frankly. I think there are some Democrats who want to \nsupport this. Nobody has focused on it a whole lot because we have had \nthe chemical weapons treaty for this week. But as people start to focus \non it next week, I hope they will look at this and support it.\n  So what we are talking about is a safety net, a funding mechanism for \nfiscal year 1998 that would trigger on October 1, 1997, if any of the \n13 appropriations bills have not been agreed to by the President and \nCongress. This is good government. This is responsible government, and \nI hope that we can do it in a bipartisan way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I want to take the floor this morning \nto make a few comments in favor of the Government Shutdown Prevention \nAct, which we hope will be a part of the supplemental appropriations \nnext year, which will be offered next week by Senator McCain and \nSenator Hutchison and which, it seems to me, embodies the elements of \ngood government.\n  We had a pretty contentious discussion in the last Congress about how \nbest to get a balanced budget. It led to a conclusion that no one was \nhappy with. It involved several temporary shutdowns of the Federal \nGovernment. We think it is important that that be avoided for the \nfuture. Everybody now understands that was not a good result, and the \namendment which will be offered by Senator McCain and Senator Hutchison \nwould prevent that.\n  It would simply provide 98 percent of the fiscal 1997 appropriations \nbill level and will be subject to all of the terms and conditions of \nthe prior year's bill, with a specific prohibition on initiating any \nnew projects or activities. To put it another way, if we are unable to \nreach an agreement, it provides for a reasonable funding level to avoid \nthe Government shutdown.\n  It seems to me this is something we ought to pass on a bipartisan \nbasis unanimously. Obviously, the American people are not interested in \nseeing the Government shut down again. They are also interested in \nseeing us reach bipartisan agreement to balance the budget, which we \nall hope will happen. But the McCain-Hutchison bill will eliminate the \nthreat of a Government shutdown and leverage the President to garner \nadditional funding for his priorities. It is a good-government \nproposal. It makes it clear that those on my side who thought the \nGovernment shutdown might be good leverage in the past decided that it \nisn't and that it should not be pursued.\n  It keeps the pressure an all of us to go forward to enact the \nappropriations bills, because that is what we would ultimately hope \nwould happen in the course of this year as well. I think, Mr. \nPresident, this is clearly something that ought to be coupled with the \nsupplemental appropriations which, presumably, we will be dealing with \nnext week.\n  So I would like to add my strong support to the efforts of Senator \nMcCain and Senator Hutchison and commend them for their work on this \nimportant issue and suggest that the Senate, hopefully, will pass this \nunanimously at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak on several matters that are at \nleast somewhat related.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3699-6", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CHILDREN OF ST. ANN\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, Mr. President, I would like to welcome, \nso that this would be part of the Congressional Record, the really \nbeautiful children of St. Ann Episcopal Church in the South Bronx who \ncame here yesterday for a visit. These are wonderful children. They \nwere written about in Jonathan Kozol's book ``Amazing Grace: The Lives \nof Children in the Conscience of a Nation.'' I wish to let those \nchildren know that it was really wonderful to have them here in the \nNation's Capitol and I am sure that someday some of them will serve in \nthe Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3701-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. On a second topic that is clearly related to this \ntopic, Mr. President, I had an opportunity to talk to Senator Bumpers \nand Senator Cochran, who are going to be very key in the appropriations \nbill, who are working on this supplemental appropriations bill, and I \nwould like to thank them for their effort to really restore adequate \nfunding for the Women, Infants, and Children Program. I think Senator \nCochran and Senator Bumpers are very committed to doing it. Both the \nWashington Post and New York Times had editorials yesterday.\n  The problem is what we get coming over from the House as opposed to \nan additional $76 million that the White House now realizes it needs to \nmake sure that 180,000 women and infant children are not falling \nbetween the cracks with inadequate care. This has to do with avoiding \nlow birthweight, childhood anemia, this has to do, frankly, with the \nwhole issue of infant mortality. I cannot think of anything more cruel \nthan for us not to fully fund this program. It works. There has not \nbeen one study by anybody, anywhere that has made the case that we must \nnot invest in nutrition for our children.\n  I am really hopeful that when we mark this bill up next week on the \nSenate side we will get it right and we will not turn our gaze away \nfrom the conditions of children. Too many children are malnourished. \nToo many women who are expecting children are malnourished.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3701-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3701-S3702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONFIRMATION OF ALEXIS HERMAN\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The third point, Mr. President--and I just have four \nto make in a short period of time--I come to the floor today to also \nurge my colleagues to move forward with final confirmation of Alexis \nHerman as Secretary of Labor. Really, I think it is time to let her go \nfree.\n  Mr. President, you and I are both on the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee. By unanimous vote, we passed her out of the \ncommittee. She is eminently qualified. We have a lot of work to do. We \nhave a controversial TEAM Act that is going to be before us. We have \nthe bill which we spent a lot of time on, the comp-time, flextime bill \nthat has passed out of committee and that is going to come before us. I \nhave been the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Employment and \nTraining. I think Senator DeWine is doing an excellent job. We are very \nserious about moving forward with this job training, work force \ndevelopment bill, but we do not have a Secretary of Labor.\n\n[[Page S3702]]\n\n  Quite frankly, I do not think that people in the Senate should be \nholding her hostage. They may agree or disagree with a particular \nExecutive order by the President. I do not come here to debate that, \nalthough I agree with the President on what he has done. But the point \nis, it is just absolutely outrageous to hold her hostage, and it is \ntime to free her. It is time to let Alexis Herman, who is eminently \nwell qualified to be Secretary of Labor, become Secretary of Labor.\n  Please remember, this is a Cabinet-level position connected to the \nconcerns and circumstances of the vast majority of people in this \ncountry who are focused on living wage jobs, who are focused on \nemployment conditions, and who are focused on being able to make a \ndecent living for their children, who are focused on economic security \nfor themselves and their families. This is no small position. It is \ntime to let her go forward.\n  Mr. President, I know that if that does not happen, we will have a \nmajor confrontation here in the Senate and I wish we would not have to \nhave it. I hope we do not get to that point, but really it is time to \nlet her free and it is time to no longer hold her hostage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3701-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DISASTER RELIEF\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. My last point, Mr. President, which is again related--\nand I see my colleague from North Dakota has now come to the floor--is \nthat one of the things I hope we will do next week--the sooner the \nbetter and I hope we will do it right--is, please, colleagues, help all \nof us out from the States of North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and \nsome other States as well. Many of the people who we truly love have \njust been devastated by this flooding. It really seems of Biblical \nproportions. It is unbelievable what has happened.\n  We are now trying to put together a disaster relief bill to enable \npeople to get back on their own two feet, to be able to rebuild their \nlives, and to rebuild our communities. The bill that is coming over \nfrom the House Appropriations Committee takes us in that direction, but \nwe have to do better on the Senate side. This is, of course, evolving. \nWe do not know the extent of the damage yet. But I ask my colleagues, I \nplead with my colleagues, please give us all of your support. We are \ngoing to have to especially make sure that we get the assistance \ndirectly to individuals.\n  For a lot of our small businesses that have been completely wiped \nout, completely wiped out--people have just lost their homes--right now \nwe do not have near the direct grant assistance we need, and some of \nthe loan programs just will not help them get back on their feet. All \nof us are working very hard on this. This is truly an example of there \nbut for the grace of God go I.\n  Every time there has ever been a disaster relief bill come to the \nfloor of the Senate, I have never hesitated to support it because I \nalways know that this could happen to anybody.\n  Nobody in South Dakota or North Dakota or Minnesota asked for this. \nPeople did not ask for their towns to be under water, did not ask to \nlose their homes, did not ask to be refugees, and did not ask to have \ntheir small businesses wiped out. If there is ever a role for \nGovernment, it is to try to help people that really need help.\n  Mr. President, I just urge all of my colleagues, please, help us out, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike. Please let us do well for the people \nin our States.

Mr. President, I rise today to again update my colleagues \non the extraordinary set of disasters that we have experienced in my \nhome State of North Dakota.\n  As the President knows, we have had really an extraordinary set of \nevents. First of all, the toughest winter in our history with over 10 \nfeet of snow that fell in North Dakota, the most we have ever had, \nfollowed by, in the first week of April, the most powerful winter storm \nin 50 years that saw nearly 2 feet of snow fall in much of the State. \nIt was accompanied by an ice storm that took down the electrical grid \nfor 80,000 people in my State who were without power for a week.\n  On top of that, there were 70-mile-an-hour winds that were \ndevastating. Then we followed that with a flood that has been termed a \n``500-year flood.'' But we are now told in testimony yesterday the \nNational Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration indicated it was \na 1,000-year flood.\n  In the midst of all that, the city of Grand Forks, a city of 50,000, \nis almost entirely evacuated, the largest evacuation of a city that we \nhave seen in the United States in anyone's memory. Virtually the entire \ncity, 95 percent of the city, has been evacuated and have been told \nthey may not be back in their homes for as much as a month.\n  Truly an extraordinary set of events.\n  Today, I would like to thank President Clinton for traveling to North \nDakota to see the devastation firsthand. I would also like to thank the \nCabinet officials who traveled with the President, including Health and \nHuman Services Secretary Donna Shalala. Donna has a twin sister who \nlives in North Dakota and so has a special interest and concern about \nour State.\n  Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman was there. Housing and Urban \nDevelopment Secretary Cuomo was there, and Transportation Secretary \nSlater. I said to Secretary Slater, who has been there three times in \nthe last 3 weeks, that he about qualifies for paying North Dakota \nincome tax he has been there so often. And, of course, the head of \nFEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, James Lee Witt, has also \nbeen there three times in the last 3 weeks. We deeply appreciate the \nhelp that he has brought to our State.\n  Also with us were high officials of the Corps of Engineers, who have \nwaged a valiant fight. Let me just say that they were fighting this \nflood in 83 spots up and down the Red River Valley. They won many of \nthose battles. We lost a fight in Grand Forks, but I want to make clear \nit was not because the corps did not wage a valiant and heroic effort. \nI think everyone in our State would say the Corps of Engineers has just \ndone a superb job.\n  Mr. President, we now face the difficult task of recovery. We will be \nconsidering a disaster supplemental bill in the committee next Tuesday.\n  I want to just share briefly with my colleagues photographs from \nGrand Forks and from other parts of eastern North Dakota so people can \nsee for themselves what has happened.\n  This shows part of downtown Grand Forks. As someone said to me, it \nlooks like Dresden after the firebomb. After the flood completely \nswamped the city, 90 percent of the town was flooded, a town of 50,000 \npeople. A fire then broke out that burned much of three blocks of \ndowntown Grand Forks.\n  As you can see, this is one of the buildings that was gutted. \nIncluded in buildings that were destroyed were the newspaper, Grand \nForks Herald, which has already announced plans to rebuild, and also \nthe largest bank was destroyed. So we have had just one set of \nextraordinary occurrences after another.\n  I talked to one man who called me. He said, ``Senator, I'm over in \nDetroit Lakes, MN. My home has been destroyed. I did not have flood \ninsurance because I was outside the 100-year flood plain. Nobody \nthought there was any threat to us. My business has been destroyed. All \nof my inventory is gone. I was trying to reach my insurance agent to \nfind out if I had any coverage, but of course I have no idea where he \nis. He's been evacuated to some other town.''\n  He said, ``I tried to call my banker, but my bank burned down. So I \nhave no idea what the status of my accounts are there in terms of \nwhat's happened to receipts. I have 80 employees, and I'm responsible \nfor their livelihood. I have no idea where they are. They were \nevacuated to different towns.''\n\n  He said, ``My wife turned to me when we were considering all this, \nand she said, `Well, you know, let's remember what's important. We have \nour lives. We're healthy. And we can come back.' ''\n  That is the attitude that has pervaded this community. I am just \ngoing\n\n[[Page S3703]]\n\nto say how proud I am of the people who have that attitude--that we are \ngoing to rebuild, we are going to come back. But it is not going to be \neasy, Mr. President.\n  This picture shows a wider shot of the fire devastation. Here you can \nsee an entire row of buildings that are absolutely gutted. By the way, \nthey have already started the process of tearing down these buildings \neven though the flood water remains.\n  This is a picture taken in the residential district. It shows a house \nthat has been floated right off of its foundation. There are thousands \nand thousands of homes flooded in this community. Ninety percent of the \ncommunity--I think roughly 12,000 homes--many of them are absolutely \ndestroyed. They are up to their eaves as you fly over much of this \ncommunity. All you see are rooftops, and many homes have been forced \nright off their foundations.\n  The pressure and the current running here looks placid. It looks \nplacid, but in fact there is a very strong current. My colleague, \nSenator Dorgan, just took a boat tour with the Coast Guard. They told \nhim if anybody falls out of this boat, you are in deep trouble because \nthe current is so strong it will suck you right down. So these are the \nconditions that people are having to deal with in Grand Forks.\n  This is another shot down one of the streets leading to the \nUniversity of North Dakota. You can see these vehicles are completely \nengulfed in the flood water. As Senator Dorgan said, as he went in this \nboat, at one point they hit something, and they realized they had gone \nover a car in this boat as they went through the flood waters. In some \nplaces the water is 10 feet deep.\n  This is a picture of a church and graveyard. This is not in the city. \nThis is out in the country. This shows how widespread the flooding is. \nThis is miles from the city of Grand Forks. Yet you can see on the \ngravestones how deep the water is. And it is still there.\n  This is a shot, and the last picture I will show, and it perhaps is a \nlittle hard to make out because it is a shot that was taken and \nprovided to us by CBS News. I took a CBS News crew with me on a \nhelicopter tour north of Grand Forks. This is something that is an \nuntold story. The focus, understandably, has been on Grand Forks \nbecause of the remarkable set of events there. The untold story, now \ntold by CBS News because they were the first to see it, is what has \nhappened north of Grand Forks. Perhaps it is hard to make out. But what \nyou are seeing here, as far as the eye can see--and we are up in a \nhelicopter; this is a picture taken out of the helicopter--as far as \nthe eye can see, it is water.\n  It is the most remarkable thing I have ever seen. We were at many \nplaces as we flew north from Grand Forks, which is 75 miles from the \nCanadian border, and we flew within 8 miles of the Canadian border. The \nentire way the river has expanded--not just river flooding but overland \nflooding from the extraordinary snowfall. The combination has led to a \nbody of water 30 miles wide. As far as the eye can see, it is water.\n  You can see, here are some roads that are built-up roads. These are \nroads that are on raised elevations. You can see where they are flooded \nas well even though they are 3 to 4 feet above the farmlands. So you \ncan see this water is 3 to 4 feet deep, in some places as much as 8 \nfeet deep, and 30 miles wide. It is simply extraordinary.\n  Mr. President, I will end the presentation there just to say we will \nbe considering the disaster supplemental next week. I ask my colleagues \nto help us pass that expeditiously and to provide the assistance that \nis so desperately needed, not only in North Dakota but neighboring \nMinnesota and South Dakota as well.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 20 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank our friend and \ncolleague from North Dakota for his excellent presentation. All of the \ncitizens in that part of the country have the extraordinary admiration, \nI think, of all Americans, certainly my region of the Nation, for their \ndetermination and courage and perseverance in facing this extraordinary \nact of nature.\n  We just want you to know from our area of the country that we want to \ncooperate and help and assist and will support your initiatives and \nother initiatives to try to help and assist the people who in so many \ninstances lost so much but still have not lost their spirit. So we are \nfull of admiration for their inner strength and for their resolution. I \nthink all Americans have been very moved by what has happened out \nthere, and we are eager to try to provide whatever help and assistance \nwe can.\n\n  I thank the Senator very much for his statement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3702-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3703-S3704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TOBACCO NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the short weeks since negotiations to \nsettle litigation against the tobacco industry began on April 3, 28,000 \nmore Americans have died from smoke-related illnesses and 69,000 \nchildren in the United States began smoking. One in three of these \nchildren will eventually die prematurely because of their tobacco \naddiction. That is the magnitude of the harm that cigarettes have \ncaused in just 22 days.\n  The well-documented history of deceit and misrepresentation by the \ntobacco companies should make any Member of Congress extremely \nskeptical about the industry's good faith in these negotiations. No \nindustry in America has a worse reputation than tobacco, and no \nindustry in America has done more to earn such a highly negative image.\n  The tobacco industry has knowingly peddled an extraordinarily \naddictive drug to the American public for decades. It has targeted \nchildren with massive advertising and marketing schemes designed to \nhook them on smoking. It has concealed the harmful ingredients in their \nproducts. And it has repeatedly lied about its activities to Congress \nand the Nation.\n  Just last week, we learned from one of the Liggett documents that the \nmajor tobacco companies knew as early as 1958--1958--that smoking \ncaused lung cancer. Given this record of deceit and manipulation, our \ncurrent skepticism of the industry is clearly warranted.\n  Research by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia \nUniversity has revealed that the harm the cigarette companies have done \nhas extended even beyond the extraordinary death and destruction their \nproduct creates directly. Cigarettes are a very significant gateway \ndrug leading to cocaine and heroin addiction. Children who smoke are 12 \ntimes more likely to use heroin. Children who smoke are 19 times more \nlikely to use cocaine. Even worse, the younger the children are when \nthey begin smoking, the more likely they are to move on to illegal \ndrugs.\n  It is not because their executives are suddenly experiencing pangs of \nconscience over their past behavior that the tobacco companies have \ninitiated these settlement negotiations. The real reason is obvious. \nBig Tobacco desperately needs a strategy to avoid huge judgments for \nsmoking victims in pending court cases, to evade massive public \ndisclosure in those cases of the industry's scandalous behavior, and to \nprevent effective new Government regulation of the industry.\n  The industry sees that the tide is finally turning against tobacco. \nThe combined efforts of the Food and Drug Administration, State \nattorneys general, public interest litigators, and public health \nadvocates have had a dramatic impact. The Liggett settlement has \nalready exposed some of the industry's darkest secrets to public \nscrutiny. Each new public survey shows an overwhelming majority of \nAmericans view the industry as evil.\n  At long last, courts are about to hold tobacco companies financially \naccountable for decades of injury to individual smokers and the public \ntreasury. We have crossed the Rubicon in the war against tobacco. And \nthe industry knows it. That is why Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco have \ncome to the table seeking a cease-fire. They want to purchase peace at \nthe lowest possible price, with the smallest possible change in their \nmalignant behavior.\n  That does not mean we should be unwilling to talk. It does mean we \nshould not loosen our grip on the regulatory and litigation steps which \nhave brought the tobacco industry to the negotiation table. We should \nhold firm to\n\n[[Page S3704]]\n\nour demands both for fundamental change in the way the tobacco industry \noperates and for financial compensation from the industry in a \nmagnitude commensurate with the harm its misconduct has caused.\n  The tobacco industry strategy is now to entice its adversaries into \nnegotiations by making a series of quick concessions--especially their \nacquiescence in public health regulation. What is striking about their \nconcessions is that most of them are within the power of the Federal \nGovernment to impose tomorrow. We do not need industry consent to \nimplement most of these public health protections. All Congress needs \nis the will to act. What the industry is offering to do is merely call \noff its lobbyists.\n  According to those participating in the negotiations, the tobacco \nindustry will agree to abide by the current FDA rule, and will agree in \nprinciple to significant further restrictions on their marketing \npractices. As part of a settlement, the industry has said it is ready \nto accept the following things:\n  First, much stronger warnings about the addictiveness and health \ndangers of smoking on each pack of cigarettes;\n  Second, full disclosure of cigarette ingredients;\n  Third, elimination of vending machines sales;\n  Fourth, additional restrictions on the advertising it can engage in; \nand\n  Fifth, expanded FDA jurisdiction over tobacco.\n  In essence, after years of opposition, the industry has conceded that \nall of these restrictions are reasonable. These concessions will stand \non the public record regardless of the outcome of the talks. The \nindustry cannot credibly return to its former position. It is within \nCongress' power to enact each of these reforms now--and we should do \nso. Congress does not need the tobacco industry's consent before we \nlegislate to protect the public health.\n  What the tobacco industry has not agreed to--and what is essential to \nthe public health--is full authority for the FDA to regulate nicotine \nas an addictive drug. Such authority would give the FDA the power to \norder cigarette manufacturers to reduce the level of nicotine in their \nproducts.\n  The evidence strongly suggests that tobacco companies have been \ndeliberately manipulating and strengthening the level of nicotine to \nmake cigarettes more addictive. It is time to reverse the process and \nreduce nicotine levels. This too is within Congress' power to enact \ntoday.\n  For a generation, the tobacco industry has been remarkably successful \nin evading such restrictions. No current settlement can anticipate \nevery marketing trick the industry will use in the future.\n  Therefore, Congress should accept no restriction on the authority of \nthe FDA or State government agencies to impose additional restrictions \non the industry as warranted by future events.\n  If the tobacco industry is sincere in its promise not to target \nchildren, it should agree to a results test. Substantial financial \npenalties should be imposed on the industry each year that tobacco use \nby minors does not decline by a specific percentage. Industry dollars \nshould be used to fund a national education campaign to publicize the \naddictiveness of tobacco and the health risks of smoking.\n  The financial settlement reportedly offered by the tobacco industry--\n$300 billion over 25 years--sounds enormous at first blush. People hear \nthe $300 billion and don't register the 25 years. They are offering $12 \nbillion a year. That number pales in comparison to the harm the \nindustry causes. According to the Congressional Office of Technology \nAssessment, cigarettes cost the United States $68 billion a year in \nhealth care costs and lost productivity.\n  Some 419,000 Americans die each year due to smoking-related \nillnesses. Smokers lose an average of 15 years of their life. At \ncurrent smoking rates, 10.5 million people will die prematurely due to \ntobacco during those years. Collectively, they will have lost 157 \nmillion years of life. Suddenly the industry's settlement offer does \nnot sound large anymore.\n  If a financial settlement to compensate for past injuries is ever \nagreed to, payment should be made from the tobacco companies' profits, \nincluding the profits from their nontobacco subsidiaries. That would be \nthe source of payment for any court judgment. It should similarly be \nthe source of payment for any settlement. Compensation should come from \nthe pockets of the wrongdoers.\n  Any increase in the tax on tobacco products--and I believe there \nshould be a substantial one--should be used to fund needed initiatives \nto improve the Nation's health. No settlement proposal should seek to \nlimit or cap, either directly or indirectly, Congress' authority to \nenact future tobacco tax increases. The cost of treating smoking-\nrelated diseases and the cost of lost productivity caused by those \nillnesses amount to $2.59 for each pack of cigarettes sold in the \nUnited States. We have a long way to go to recover those costs.\n  Such a tobacco tax increase should be large enough to discourage \nchildren from starting smoking. Higher tobacco taxes are one of the \nmost effective weapons in reducing smoking amongst young people.\n  For generations, tobacco companies have targeted teenagers for a \nlifetime of addiction. It is especially appropriate therefore that \nrevenue from a tobacco tax increase should be used to provide \naffordable health insurance coverage for the Nation's 10 million \nuninsured children. Senator Hatch and I have proposed a plan to do \nthat, and we intend to do all we can to see that this Congress enacts \nit.\n  We also hear that the industry wants blanket immunity from suit for \nits decades of willful wrongdoing as the price of a settlement. If that \nis the price, there will be no settlement. It would be unconscionable \nto deny people poisoned by tobacco their day in court. Each year, \nmillions of Americans learn that they have diseases caused by smoking. \nIn too many cases, it is beyond our power to restore their health. We \nmust never permit the tobacco industry to extinguish their right to \njustice as well.\n  The industry's current settlement proposals are utterly inadequate. \nWhether measured by the scope of regulation to protect the public \nhealth or the amount of financial compensation for past wrongs, tobacco \ncompany proposals fall far short of a reasonable offer. I am confident \nthat those representing the public interest will never accept such a \nlopsided settlement. Certainly, no one should think for even a moment \nthat Congress will put its stamp of approval on such an outrageously \ninadequate plan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3703-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3704-S3710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, we want to take some time this morning \nto talk a little bit about an issue that is very current, is always \ncurrent, but particularly current because the trustees of Medicare have \ngiven their annual report. So we want to take some time and talk a \nlittle bit about an issue that all of us are very much interested in. I \nthink, universally, we want to keep health care for the elderly. But \nthe difficulty has been in facing up to some of the realistic changes \nthat have to be made if, indeed, we are going to continue to have \nMedicare.\n  The conflict has always been a political one, frankly, between those \nwho say Medicare is the third rail of politics--touch it and you are \ndead. So nobody wants to talk about it. At the same time, there is a \ngrowing recognition, a growing certainty, that unless you make some \nchanges, this program will not be available for the elderly in years to \ncome. So there will be several of us talking about that.\n  First, I would like to yield to my friend, a very strong spokesman on \nthis and other issues, the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming for \nbringing this special order to the floor and to the attention of our \ncolleagues.\n  For those who are watching this morning, yesterday, the Medicare \ntrustees issued a report that was no surprise but, clearly, once again, \nreaffirmed to the administration and to the Congress of the United \nStates that there is no good news when it comes to the strength and \nstability of the Medicare trust funds. What we had hoped for was just \nnews. Knowing that it wasn't going to be good, the question was how bad \nwas the bad news going to be?\n\n[[Page S3705]]\n\n  Two years ago, the trustees forecasted that the Nation's Medicare \nProgram would be bankrupt, out of money, by the year 2002. Just last \nyear, the trustees revised that prediction, saying bankruptcy would \ncome sooner, in the year 2001. CBO has also predicted that the trustee \nfund would be broke by 2001, that it would run a deficit. It is now \nrunning a deficit. It did for the first time this past year, and it \nwill run a $10 billion deficit this year. In other words, more money is \nbeing pulled from the trust fund than is now flowing into the trust \nfund to make it safe and secure.\n  So let's face it. Our Medicare system is in critical condition, and \nit deserves to be treated as a patient with an illness. In this \ninstance, we--the Congress of the United States and the President--are \nthe doctor. Or, another way to say it, Madam President, is we sit on \nthe board. We are the board of trustees, and the President is the \nchairman of the board.\n  It is our responsibility to fix the problems that are now very, very \nclear, and which have been repeated for 5 years in a row by the \ntrustees of Medicare. Two-thirds of these trustees are appointed by the \nPresident--this President. It is their job to report to him, as they \ndid yesterday, and to the Congress on the health of Medicare. And they \nhave reported that the health is not good at all. So, for 5 years \nrunning, not only have we received these reports, but the \nadministration has received the identical reports.\n  Last year, recognizing that, we dealt with it. We looked at a 30-\nyear-old health insurance program that provides health insurance \ncoverage for 35 million Americans and said, in that 30-year history, it \nreally hasn't had major overhaul or reform to fit modern health care \nneeds and to fit modern seniors; therefore, we ought to do something \nabout it. And we did.\n  That reform went in the balanced budget down to the White House, and \nthe President vetoed it. For a year after that we saw television ad \nafter television ad saying that the Congress of the United States had \nbeen irresponsible, that somehow they were trying to destroy Medicare \nas we know it for the stability and the security of our seniors when, \nin fact, we had offered a variety of modern options that would not only \nprovide seniors with adequate health care and health care coverage but \nwould address the deficit that, once again yesterday the trustees, \nappointed by this President, said, ``Mr. President, Congress, we report \nto you that this sick patient called `Medicare' is growing sicker by \nthe day and that it is still a 2001 bankruptcy, but it is not going to \nbe late in 2001 now. It is going to be early in 2001.''\n  My guess is, if we do nothing this year, the trustees will come back \nnext year and say, ``Well, it is not going to be early 2001 now. It is \ngoing to be late 2000.''\n  What is the point of our discussion here today? The point is that we \nare prepared, as a Congress of the United States, to work with this \nPresident to reform Medicare, to save it, to secure it, to strengthen \nit, and to modernize it for the senior citizens of this country.\n  I mentioned 35 million Americans being covered. By the year 2001, it \nis going to be 38 million Americans. So there is always a growing and \ngreater dependency on this program. It clearly is our responsibility to \naddress it, and to address it in the right and appropriate fashion. \nThat is a bipartisan approach. That is the President and the Congress \nof the United States sitting at the same table. That is not one party \ntrying to lead over another. I am sorry, the House and the minority \nleader of the House, it is not a political game anymore. You are not \ngoing to get any more mileage by demagoging or by pulling the programs \nout and sticking them under the general fund and allowing them to \nincrease beyond the rate of private health care in this country.\n  It is time that we must come together as a group--the board of \ntrustees, those responsible for the strength and security of Medicare--\nand address it in the appropriate fashion.\n\n\n                 THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I want to address one other issue \nbriefly. It is going to become one that all of us will be increasingly \ninvolved in as this month plays out and as the House works on it. The \nSenate will soon deal with the supplemental appropriations.\n  My colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, has just entered the \nChamber. She, I, and the leader all have recognized the importance of \nthis supplemental appropriations. But we also recognize the importance \nof avoiding the kind of budget battles in the future that allowed the \nshutdown of Government a couple of years ago.\n  So the Senator from Texas has introduced what I call--and I believe \nshe calls--a ``safety net'' funding mechanism for 1998 that will \ndisallow Government shutdowns. We call it a ``continuing resolution.'' \nWe simply say the budget process goes on and the appropriating process \ngoes on, and, while we work out our differences with this \nadministration, let us pass a continuing resolution that is 98 percent \nof 1997 levels so that we continue to gain our savings toward a \nbalanced budget, but we can turn rationally to the Government itself \nand say, ``We are not going to hold you out as hostage. It is important \nthat we work cooperatively together.''\n  I hope that we will continue to look at this. It is time that we deal \nwith it directly. The bill is clearly about politics as usual, and it \nwould change the whole dynamics of the debate. It would allow us to \nwork in a timely and appropriate fashion on the necessary \nappropriations bills. Twenty-seven days of Government shutdown in \nDecember 1995 and January 1996 furloughed over 800,000 Federal \nemployees. There was a lot of political posturing. But in the end \nnobody gained, and a good number of people got hurt. The Congress of \nthe United States and the President weren't doing what they should have \ndone.\n  The Government Shutdown Prevention Act as a continuing resolution \ncoupled with the supplemental will build that very kind of safety net \nso we can go ahead to continue to work together in a bipartisan manner \nas we work to resolve our budget differences, strike a budget that is \nbalanced by the year 2002, and deal with the Medicare crisis impending \nby the reports of the trustees of just this past day.\n  These are important issues that the Senate of the United States and \nthis President must come together on. I hope we can do that in the next \nmonth, especially on supplementals. But I also hope the President \nrecognizes that Medicare really doesn't deserve to be tinkered with nor \nnibbled around the edges anymore as a way of solving the problem.\n  We don't need a 1-year or a 2-year fix. We really need a long-term \nreform approach that strengthens, maintains, and offers a variety of \noptions for the seniors of our country so they can have the \nunderstanding that this Congress has dealt with their concerns in a way \nthat should not alarm but assures them a strong and a safe program.\n  I thank my colleague from Wyoming for establishing this special \norder. And I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, thank you very much.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grams pertaining to the introduction of S. 652 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I would like to return to our \nconversations about Medicare, and I am very pleased to have my fellow \nSenator from Texas here. Senator Gramm has been chairman and continues \nto be chairman of the task force on health care, and I am particularly \npleased he has joined us this morning to talk about Medicare and \nMedicare reform.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank Senator Thomas for his leadership \ntoday by asking people to come talk about Medicare. I am the chairman \nof the of the Finance Committee's Health Care Subcommittee, which has \njurisdiction over Medicare. I wanted today to come over and talk about \nMedicare in light of the report issued yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock \nwhich reaffirmed that Medicare is in the red for the first time in its \nhistory and that the trust fund which funds the hospital care portion \nof Medicare will\n\n[[Page S3706]]\n\nbe totally insolvent in 4 years. The cumulative debt that will be \nimposed on the American people by the existing Medicare program in the \nnext 10 years will rise to $1.567 trillion--that is ``trillion'' with a \n``T.'' Obviously, a lot of people were alarmed by this report. I agree \nwith virtually everything that the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, Secretary Shalala, said, except one comment. That one comment \nwas when she sought to reassure people that there was no current crisis \nin Medicare. Madam President, if this is not a crisis, I would like to \nknow what a crisis looks like.\n  What I would like to do today, very briefly, is to outline the \ncrisis. I am a firm believer in the old Biblical admonition, you shall \nknow the truth and the truth will make you free. So I want to start \nwith the bad news, because if we do not understand this problem, there \nis no way we can fix it. Then I would like to conclude with the good \nnews. The good news is that as bad as the problem is, we can fix it. We \ncan strengthen Medicare for existing beneficiaries, and more \nimportantly, we can restructure Medicare to guarantee that it is going \nto be there for our children and our grandchildren. But we cannot do \nany of these things if we are not willing to make tough decisions.\n  Part of the problem we face is that the Medicare has been too \npoliticized with fear. It has been used as a partisan issue. The \nPresident has probably been more irresponsible than any public official \non this issue. What we are going to have to do--and by ``we,'' I mean \nall Members of the Senate, but specifically I mean Republicans--is set \naside all of the partisanship on Medicare. We are going to have to \nforget the bitter experience of the last election where the President, \nin essence, said to the American people, ``There is no problem, this is \nsimply Republicans who want to cut your benefits.'' We can pout about \nit, but pouting will not solve the problem. What we have to do is to \nget on with the solution.\n  Let me try to define the problem. If this sounds overwhelming, it is \nbecause the problem is overwhelming.\n  First, Medicare was enacted in 1965, and when it started, it was to \nbe funded by a 0.7-percent tax on the first $6,300 of earnings of all \nAmerican workers. That was going to pay for Medicare. In fact, the cost \nprojection for Medicare made in 1965 for the year 1995 was only off by \na margin of 100 to 1. In other words, the program turned out to be 100 \ntimes more expensive than was originally predicted when Medicare went \ninto effect.\n  We started with a 0.7-percent tax on the first $6,300 a year you \nearned to pay for Medicare, but have since raised that tax on a \ncontinuing basis. Today it is 2.9 cents out of every dollar of income \nearned by every American worker. Yet, despite that massive increase in \ntaxes, the Medicare trust fund is still exhausted; it is in the red. \nThe trust fund is not only in the red, but all of the existing assets \nwill be depleted in 4 years.\n  When you add up the both parts for Medicare, the part that pays for \nhospitals and the part that pays for doctors, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan accounting branch of the \nCongress that looks at these numbers, we are looking at roughly $1.6 \ntrillion of debt in Medicare within a decade. That is the crisis.\n  Unlike a lot of crises that we talk about in Congress, this is not \nsomething that is going to happen in sweet by-and-by. This is something \nthat is happening right now.\n  I have a chart that shows the estimates that are made by HCFA, a part \nof Health and Human Services and obviously, part of the Clinton \nadministration. This chart shows the financial health of the Medicare \ntrust fund beginning in 1995, where we had a very slight surplus. That \nnow is virtually exhausted, and unless we make dramatic changes in \nMedicare, this exploding red chart shows what is going to happen in \nterms of the debt of the Social Security trust fund.\n  For example, 32 years from today, the debt of Medicare, simply the \nhospital part of the program, will be over $11.5 trillion. I don't know \nhow to define a trillion dollars, but I have a constituent who knows \nwhat a billion dollars is, Ross Perot. I may have a few constituents \nwho know what a million dollars is, and most of us know what a thousand \ndollars is. But not many of us know what a trillion dollars is.\n  Let me put it another way. In 32 years, unless we do something, the \ndebt of one-half of the Medicare program will be over twice as big as \nthe whole current national debt. Needless to say, whether you are a \nDemocrat or Republican, liberal or conservative, whether you work for \nthe Urban Institute think tank or whether you work for the Cato \nconservative think tank, everybody who has looked at this problem with \nany degree of scientific basis concludes one thing: This is not \nsustainable. Twenty-five years from now, if we don't change this \nprogram, we are going to have to triple the payroll tax in order to pay \nthese benefits.\n  I want to remind you that the average American family now is paying \nover 15 cents out of every dollar they earn in payroll taxes and, at \nthe margin of the last dollar they earn, 28 cents out of every dollar \nin income taxes. If such an explosion in the tax rate at a moment where \nwe have the highest tax rate in American history, as we do today, \ndoesn't frighten you, it should.\n  What is causing this problem? There are really two causes. The first \none is an explosion in Medicare per capita costs. It is easy looking \nback at 1965--when many of us were not in the Senate and when some of \nus were in college and not worried about this problem--and criticize \npeople who wrote the Medicare program. But in retrospect, the structure \nof the system makes no sense. I will give you only one example.\n  On hospital care, a big component of Medicare critical to our \nseniors, if you are in a hospital for up to 60 days, you have no \ncopayment. Every penny of the hospital bill, except for a deductible, \nis paid by the taxpayer, but on the 61st day, you become responsible \nfor a copayment of $190 a day. On the 91st day, it goes up to $380 a \nday, and on the 150th day, they throw you out in the street. If you \nhave been in a hospital for 61 days, you are sick. If you have been in \na hospital 61 days, the presence of a copayment is not going to change \nyour behavior, because you are already very, very ill.\n  What this irrational structure has done is it has forced our seniors \nto dig into their pockets and pay between $1,100 and $1,300 for what is \ncalled medigap insurance. My mother pays about $1,100 a year for a \nmedigap policy that fills up all these gaps in Medicare so she doesn't \nhave to worry about losing her home if she ends up in the hospital for \nan extended period of time. But once she has paid for this medigap \npolicy, she then has no copayments and no deductibles on anything other \nthan prescription drugs.\n  So what we have done is set up a system where the copayments are at \nthe end of the system, inducing people to have great risk, but they do \nnot change anybody's behavior. Instead, force people to spend a lot of \nmoney to guarantee against it, but once they spend the money, health \ncare to them is free.\n\n  There are a lot of reforms we need in Medicare, but two are obvious \nto a blind person. No. 1, we need to give our seniors the ability to \npick and choose among competing alternatives, not just an HMO in places \nwhere one is available. They need to have a whole range of other \noptions that people can choose. The Federal Government needs to do \nsomething in Medicare which long ago everybody else started to do, and \nthat is bargain. The Federal Government with Medicare is the largest \nconsumer of health care in America, and it is the only consumer that \ndoes not bargain on the basis of price.\n  The second thing we need to do is reform the current Medicare policy \nto put the deductibles and copayments up front. I know this sounds \nextraordinary, but I want to mention it today. As the debate unfolds, I \nwill talk a great deal more about it. We could take the amount that the \naverage senior is now spending on health care, including what they \nspend on medigap insurance, copayments, deductibles, and \npharmaceuticals--which is not covered, and instead have a simple \ndeductible of $1,000 and copayments of 20 percent, with a cap on those \ncopayments of $1,000. Doing this would change the system in a way where \nthe average senior would not be spending 1 penny more than they are \ncurrently spending. But by changing the incentive, we could save enough \nmoney to pay for pharmaceuticals for all of our seniors. The\n\n[[Page S3707]]\n\ncost of such a drug benefit is $62 billion over the next 5 years. That \nis how inefficient the system is.\n  So we want to defend the benefits and defend the seniors, but we have \nto be willing to fix a system that is broke. If we do those things, we \ncan stop the explosion of per capita costs, and we can actually improve \nthe system, in my opinion.\n  That is only part of the problem. The next part of the problem is a \ndemographic time bomb, and let me explain how it came about and how big \nthe problem is and then talk about how we fix it.\n  When Medicare was written, something extraordinary was going on in \nAmerica. It was 1965, and what we call the baby boomer generation was \njust beginning to enter the labor market. This chart I have shows the \nbirth rate in America from 1930 to 1985. It is a pretty extraordinary \nchart. What happened is that the birth rate was relatively low in the \nDepression. There was a little spike during the war. But when Americans \ncame home from the war--while economists were worried about whether \nwere we going back into the Depression or what the future was going to \nlook like--Americans decided the future was going to be great. One of \nthe things they started doing was having babies at an unprecedented \nrate since the colonial period.\n  In fact, a number of Members of the Senate today were born as part of \nthis baby boom generation.\n  When Medicare was written, it was the first year a baby boom group \nhad entered the labor market. In fact, these first baby boomers, born \nin 1946--causing this big spike--came into the labor market the same \nyear that Medicare was written. That year four times as many new \nworkers came into the labor market as had come in just 2 years before, \nand as far as they could see, it did not look like it was ever going to \nend.\n  However, had they actually gone over to the Census Bureau and looked \nat the data, they would have seen it had already ended. But, when you \nare spending money and making people happy, you do not want bad news; \nyou want good news. The good news was we were about to have this \nexplosion of new American workers, and so Congress decided that we \ncould fund Medicare by simply using a transfer payment, almost like a \nchain letter, and I do not intend to be critical. They decided that \nthese workers are so numerous--and wages immediately after the war had \ngrown twice as fast as they had grown in the modern era--that we can \nsimply tax them and begin providing medical benefits for retirees \nimmediately, funding this as a transfer payment.\n  Now, this system worked great until these baby boomers started to \nnear retirement. This chart is an extraordinary chart because you can \nsee where we are. The people who are retiring today were born in 1932. \nYou can see from this chart the birth rate in 1932--in fact, here it \nis, 65 years ago. The birth rate in 1932 was relatively low, and in \nfact this year only 200,000 people are going to retire. This is as good \nof a year as we are going to get.\n  In fact, these should be the best years in the history of Medicare. \nThese are really the fat years since there are relatively few retirees \nand every baby boomer is still in the work force.\n  Let me just use a story from the Bible. Remember Joseph, Jacob's son, \nwho was the favorite son of his father because he was real smart. His \nfather bought him a multicolored coat. You remember the story. His \njealous brothers kidnaped him, hid him in a well and sold him into \nslavery in Egypt. One day the Pharaoh of Egypt dreamed of seven fat \ncows and seven skinny cows. The seven skinny cows ate the seven fat \ncows. Nobody could interpret the dream. Then he hears about Joseph, \nthis guy who can interpret dreams. He sends for Joseph, and he \ninterprets the dream. He explains that there will be 7 years of plenty \nfollowed by 7 years of drought. The Pharaoh commissions Joseph to set \nup stores of grain during the years of plenty. He stores the grain, and \nthen the drought comes, and the people are happy.\n  Now, today we are in the fat years. We have all these baby boomers \nstill working. We have the lowest number of people retiring that we \nhave had in the recent past or that we will ever have again in the \nhistory of the country. Yet in the midst of the fat years we are broke. \nIn the midst of the fat years there is no grain being stored. We have \nguaranteed benefits to a whole generation of Americans, and we have not \nset aside a penny to pay for them.\n  Whereas only 200,000 people are going to retire this year, 15 years \nfrom today 1.6 million people are going to retire, and that number is \nnot going to change for 20 years. The impact of that is cataclysmic--\ncataclysmic.\n  Now we are beginning see apologists write letters and say, OK, look, \npeople like this guy Gramm and a lot of other people are saying we have \nthis terrible problem. We are going from 5.9 workers when Medicare \nstarted per retiree to 3.9 workers per retiree today to 2.2 workers per \nretiree by 2030. People who say, don't worry about it might agree that \nwe are about to have this huge number of people retire and claim a \nbenefit for which we cannot pay. But, they say, we can rejoice in the \nfact there are fewer children, and since the average family spends \n$110,000 on things for their children before they are 18, we could get \nthem to give us that money so that we could spend it on somebody else. \nWe might be able to solve this problem with additional taxes.\n\n  Well, look, here is the problem. We do spend mammoth amounts of money \non our children, but we are joyful givers in doing giving to our \nchildren. People do not feel the same way about paying taxes. We are \npretty efficient in spending money on our children most of the time, \nyet our Government is not terribly efficient.\n  That is the problem. I do not care how you try to gloss over it, this \nis a big problem. Solving this problem is going to cost more money in \nreal, inflation-adjusted dollars than it cost to win World War II.\n  So what is the good news? The good news is the following. No. 1, \ntoday, the average 22-year-old worker, who is paying 2.9 percent of \ntheir income into Medicare, and is paying for Social Security benefits, \nunless we do something and do it quickly, will never get the kind of \nbenefits I would. It would not be possible to get the kind of benefits \ntheir parents are getting today. But if they simply took 1.3 percent of \ntheir wages and invested that in an annuity that earned a 3.0-percent \nreal rate of return--a pretty conservative rate of return--they would \nhave assets when they retired at 65 big enough to fund a private health \npolicy that would cover everything Medicare covers.\n  Now, think about it. The average 22-year-old today is paying over \ntwice what they would have to pay if they could simply set aside part \nof their income to pay for their own retirement health care. In fact, \nthe average 39-year-old worker, if allowed, could put that 2.7 percent \ninto a real investment, instead of giving it to Medicare, and could \nfund their health care in retirement.\n  Now, what we are going to have to do to fix Medicare is the \nfollowing. We are going to have to, first of all, set up a system where \nyoung workers can put at least part of what they are paying into \nMedicare today in a real trust fund that will guarantee them some \nhealth care benefits. If we do not do that, we are simply going to have \na generation that is going to pay for benefits that they never get.\n  So the first thing we have to do in dealing with this long-term \nstructural problem is to take at least part of the tax for Medicare \nbeing paid by young people and set up a real trust fund for them.\n  Second, we are going to have to admit that we have an unfunded \nliability on Medicare of $2.6 trillion. Now, swallow hard and think \nabout that number. That is the number that we owe because we guaranteed \nthese benefits, and we never set aside any money to pay for it.\n  What we are going to have to do is take part of the premiums of young \npeople and invest them to guarantee their benefits. Over the next 50 \nyears we are going to have to come up with $2.6 trillion to pay off \nthis debt we have. That is a lot of money, but let me tell you, if we \nset up a transition program, we could do it.\n  Let me conclude with this point. We are in the midst of a budget \ndebate. You are going to hear in the next few weeks debate on the floor \nof the Senate about the budget, and you are going to hear people \ntalking about cutting Medicare or politicizing the Consumer Price Index \nto cut Social Security to pay for balancing the budget or to pay for \ntax cuts.\n\n[[Page S3708]]\n\n  We are not going to make money by saving Medicare. We are not going \nto make money by saving Social Security. Anybody who thinks that by \nsaving Medicare we are going to enable ourselves to spend money on \nother things simply does not understand the problem. It is going to \ncost money to save Medicare. It is going to, 20 years later, cost money \nto save Social Security. And if we want to balance the budget, we are \ngoing to have to do it by having less bureaucracy and less Government. \nEvery penny we save in reforming Medicare has to go to save Medicare. \nIf we ultimately, as a result of decisions by economists and not \npoliticians, change the Consumer Price Index and we save money on \nSocial Security, every penny of that money has to go to strengthen \nSocial Security. We cannot let Congress go out and spend it on \nsomething else because the problem is already a severe problem, and \nevery day we put it off it gets worse.\n  Let me conclude with the Fram oil filter argument. If today we \ndecided to fix Medicare and change the system to stop the explosion in \nper capita cost, then get Medicare benefits purchased by the Government \nas purchased as efficiently as medical care purchased by the private \nsector, then we set up a 50-year transition program that allowed us to \npay off the money we owe to provide the benefits to current \nbeneficiaries of Medicare, it would cost us about $2.6 trillion, which \nis about half of the existing Federal national debt. We owe the money \nwe committed. We are going to have to pay it. But if we wait 10 years \nto do anything, that unfunded liability is going to rise to $3.9 \ntrillion. And if we wait 20 years to do anything, it is going to rise \nto $6.1 trillion, which is bigger than the current national debt.\n  So what we have to do in Medicare is this. First, we have to admit \nthat we have a terrible problem, and it really boils down to two \nthings. No. 1, we do not have a system that is efficient and that \nencourages economy, and we have to change it. No. 2, we have a huge \nunfunded liability because Congress has guaranteed all these benefits \nyear after year after year. At the very moment when we ought to be \npiling up big surpluses to pay for these benefits, the system is going \nbroke.\n  So we have all these guarantees and we have not a penny to pay for \nthem. And we are going to have to pay for them. Nobody is arguing that \nwe forfeit on these commitments we made.\n  Now, I know, as we get into this debate, there will be people on the \nfloor of the Senate and there will be many professional advocate groups \nthat will say, my goodness, you are talking about these big debts. \nDon't you realize this is Medicare, and it is wonderful and it is \ngreat? That is like when you are trying to call the fire department \nbecause the house is on fire, and somebody says, well, it is burning, \nbut isn't it a beautiful house? Isn't it great and don't we want to \nkeep it the way it is? Well, the point is it is on fire.\n  The second thing we have to do is to come up with a long-term funding \nmechanism. All these issues can be demagoged. All of them can be very \nrich politics for somebody who wants to exploit them. But look at the \ncost of doing that. The cost is dramatically changing the real income \nof our children and grandchildren.\n  If we do not deal with Medicare now, if we do not deal with Social \nSecurity 15 years from now, we are going to have the first generation \nin American history that is going to have lower living standards.\n  I am not saying these problems are easy to deal with. When you \nguarantee a benefit and you do not set aside money to pay for it, when \npeople start claiming it, there is no easy out. But the point is, there \nare things we can do. And we have been putting off and putting off and \nputting off doing something about Medicare. The time has come to start \nmaking some tough decisions.\n  And it seems to me, Mr. President, that on the day when we have just \ngotten another report from the Social Security trustees and from the \nMedicare trustees basically saying, ``Alert. Medicare is going to be \ninsolvent in 4 years,'' and it is going to have a cumulative debt for \nthe hospital and physician portions of about $1.6 trillion over the \nnext 10 years, the time has come to do something.\n  I hope we can do it on a bipartisan basis. As chairman of this \nsubcommittee, whether we have a budget or not, my goal is going to be \nto try to do something about Medicare. This is not a budget problem. \nThis is not about the deficit. This is about maintaining the viability \nof a program that is critically important.\n  As I said yesterday at a press conference, there are a lot of things \nI am going to do in my life that I do not want to do. But I am never \ngoing to pick up the phone and call my 83-year-old mother, and say \n``Momma, Medicare went broke today. It went broke because Congress \ndidn't want to tell anybody that there was a problem, and we didn't \nhave enough courage to do something about it.''\n  I am going to talk about this problem a lot because 4 years from now \nall America is going to know about it. And 4 years from now every \nMember of the Senate who is still here is going to have to answer the \nquestion: Where were you when all this happened? Where were you when \nall this was going on? Why didn't you say something about it? Why \ndidn't you do something about it?\n  I am going to say a lot about it. I hope to do something about it.\n  I want to thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity today to \ncome over.\n  This is a speech that is going to have to be given many, many times. \nThe first reaction, when you get news like this, is denial. I guess it \nis sort of like going in to see the doctor, and the doctor says, \n``Well, I hate to tell you this, but you've got a debilitating disease \nthat can ruin your life.'' I mean, the first thing we all want to do is \nsay, ``No. You have messed up this test. This is somebody else's test. \nThis can't be me. I am a guy that works out. I run. I say my prayers. \nIt's not me.''\n  But in my concluding remark, let me say that while this is the doctor \nsaying, ``You've got a debilitating disease and it can ruin your \nlife,'' the important thing is that the doctor also is saying, ``but I \ncan cure this disease. I can cure this disease. But the cure involves \nyou changing your lifestyle. You're going to go on a diet.''\n  Now it is up to us. I am ready to do both. And I am confident \nultimately Congress will--ultimately we will fix this problem. If we do \nit now, the burden is going to be heavy but it is going to be bearable. \nIf we delay it we are going to end up ultimately denying some benefits \nand we are ultimately going to lower the living standards of the next \ngeneration. Both those things can be avoided. I hope we can avoid them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to, first of all, thank Senator Gramm \nof Texas for his leadership in dealing with this Medicare funding \ncrisis that faces our country. The comments that he just made ought to \nillustrate to us why it is incredibly important for the Senate and the \nHouse to work very quickly to address the challenge set forth in the \nreport issued yesterday by the President's trustees on Medicare.\n  As Senator Gramm pointed out, and I will quote from the trustees' \nreport:\n\n       The Part A Hospital Trust fund will be able to pay for \n     benefits for only about four years [until 2001] and is \n     severely out of financial balance in the long range. The \n     trustees urge enactment of legislation this year to further \n     control program costs and extend the life of the trust fund.\n\n  Clearly, Mr. President, the time is upon us. We cannot wait any \nlonger. What I am going to talk about briefly today is the fact that we \nhave some proposals that are very short range and very minor in their \nimprovements, while Senator Gramm is taking a longer look at the \nproblem here toward the end of fixing it for a long time so that we do \nnot have to keep putting these Band-Aid, short-range approaches into \neffect.\n  The primary problem is caused by the aging of the baby-boom \ngeneration. Instead of this generation providing the workers who are \nsupporting, with taxes, a relatively smaller number of people in \nretirement, those baby boomers are going to be the retirees who need \nthe medical care, and they will not be supported by as large a group of \nworkers as exists today.\n  The Medicare part A hospital program is already starting to feel this \nbaby-boom bulge. As I said, it is caused\n\n[[Page S3709]]\n\nby the rapidly aging group of baby boomers turning 65 and becoming \neligible for Medicare.\n  Medicare will hospitalize 200,000 more seniors this year than last \nyear. And the net increase will get larger and larger until it plateaus \nsomewhere between the years 2012 and 2032. During that 20-year period, \nthe system will experience a steady net increase of 1.6 million new \nseniors per year. Think of that, Mr. President, 1.6 million baby \nboomers retiring each year for 20 years, creating this huge bulge of \nretirees that are going to be eligible for Medicare benefits.\n  And at the same time, during this same period, the relative number of \nworkers is going to be decreasing so the payroll tax revenues will \ndramatically decline. Without prompt congressional action and \nPresidential support--it is obvious; and the trustees made this point \nyesterday--Medicare will soon be unable to fulfill its commitment that \nour Federal Government has made to our retiree population.\n  Let me discuss briefly the two plans of the parties. Neither the \nRepublican plan or Democratic plan, frankly, were sufficient last year \nto deal with this problem.\n  The Democratic plan relied primarily on provider reimbursement \nreductions to reduce costs. That means we just pay the hospitals and \ndoctors less money to do the same thing. Well, there is a point beyond \nwhich that does not work. Obviously, the hospitals and doctors do not \nhave to treat these patients and they will conclude after a point that \nit simply is not cost efficient for them to do so and they are not \ngoing to do so.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican plan also relied, to a certain extent, \non reductions in reimbursement to providers though less heavily than \nthe Democratic plan.\n  The Republican plan also had another feature which was good and that \nwas that there had to be some real reform in the system. And \ncompetition was the centerpiece of that reform. The idea was that you \ncontrolled costs by having increased competition among those who were \nproviding the benefits to the Medicare patients. You create different \nproducts--products that have names like PPO's, preferred provider \norganizations; PSO's, provider sponsored organizations; and Medicare \nsavings accounts, MSA's; to go along with the HMO's, the hospital \nmanaged organizations; and others that provide the care to the seniors \nthrough different mechanisms, different combinations of hospitals and \nphysicians, sometimes in what are called capitating plans, sometimes in \nother kinds of plans, but all of which are competing with each other \nand therefore through that competition costs are kept in line.\n\n  The Republican plan also included medical malpractice reform to curb \nthe high costs of defensive medicine practiced by physicians and \nhospitals as a means of avoiding liability lawsuits.\n  The Congress and the President have acknowledged the need to slow the \nrate of increase in Medicare costs. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, the President's current proposal would save about $89 \nbillion over 5 years. The Republican plan last year would have saved \nabout $105 billion over the same period, along with the savings \nattributed to increased competition. But the key point here is that no \none contends that either of these plans will achieve long-term \nsolvency. More is needed to save Medicare than just greater reductions \nto reimbursement providers.\n  As I said, the overload of the system begins in about the year 2010 \nwhen the first wave of this baby-boom generation begins to retire. And \nthe President's plan does not even make it to that year. The \nPresident's savings only work to about the year 2007. Then you would \nhave to start all over. The Republican alternative is better but it \nstaves off bankruptcy only until about the year 2012. So clearly, \nbefore this baby-bulge meltdown occurs we have to have longer-range \nreform.\n  Regardless of the reimbursement to provider reductions or product \ncompetition structural reforms something more will have to be done \nbecause there just are not enough workers that will support the growing \nnumber of retirees.\n  To put it in perspective, Mr. President, in 1964 there were 3.5 \nworkers for every beneficiary. And the total has grown to 37 million \nbeneficiaries. The Medicare trustees estimate that by the year 2030 \nwhen the last baby boomer turns 65 there will be only 2.2 workers per \nbeneficiary. So the current system which functions on a transfer-\npayments basis made directly from worker to beneficiary is clearly \nunsustainable. That 2.2 workers cannot possibly pay all of the expenses \nto run the Federal Government, all of the retirement benefits for \nSocial Security and in addition to that support this growing group of \nseniors for their health care needs.\n  It is time to investigate whether an investment-based health care \nsystem may be part of the solution to this approaching meltdown. This \nis the subject that Senator Gramm was talking about a few minutes ago. \nHis investigation is into several proposals that would ensure the long-\nterm solvency of the Medicare Program.\n  And one of those proposals would allow workers to create their own \nmedical IRA, an individual retirement account, for medical purposes by \nredirecting some or all of their payroll tax--it is now 2.9 percent--\ninto a savings account for medical purposes. His idea is that each \nemployee's account would grow over his or her working life and would \npay for health care after retirement.\n  A series of studies have been done here at Texas A And economists \nthere in studying this have reached some interesting conclusions. For \nexample, assuming a real rate of return of 3 percent--a very low rate \nof return on investment--a 22-year-old person could direct 1.3 percent \nrather than the current 2.9 percent of their payroll tax into a medical \nIRA, and at age 65 this person could purchase a policy that would \nprovide roughly the same coverage that Medicare provides today. So you \ncould put much less money that you are earning into this payroll tax \nand still come out the same place when you retire.\n  If the real rate of return were the Standard & Poor's average over \nthe last 70 years of 6.5 percent, a 22-year-old would have to invest \nonly 0.4 percent of his or her wages to achieve the same result. So you \ncan see that a real investment in an IRA-type investment by people \nwould provide the same benefit at far less cost if the rate of return \nwere even no better than the average that has existed over the last 70 \nyears.\n  Obviously, this kind of proposal would have to address some \ntransition costs, the costs of converting from the current system to an \ninvestment-based system as well as Medicare's unfunded liability which \nis estimated today to be $565 billion. Without reform, this amount is \nprojected to reach $3.9 trillion in 10 years, and in 20 years $6 \ntrillion.\n  Clearly, we cannot allow this system to continue. We are going to go \nbankrupt taking care of our Medicare population if we do not invoke \nfundamental reform.\n  So the Congress and the President, both, must heed the trustees' \nwarning, work together to protect current beneficiaries, while also \nworking to provide a secure retirement for today's workers who are \ngoing to need something better than the Medicare system that is in \nexistence today. We are going to need some kind of innovative program, \nsuch as that suggested by Senator Gramm, to enable them to invest a \nsmall amount today, which over time will grow to an amount that will \ntake care of them in their retirement years.\n  Increased Medicare product competition and medical IRA's funded by \ninvesting the payroll tax represent two of the many potential \ncomponents of reform. We need to develop a consensus on these reforms \non how to protect the current beneficiaries and the new group of baby \nboomers. If we begin doing it today, by the time the problem is really \nupon us, we may have a system in place that will provide this \nprotection. If all we do today is support another short-range solution, \nwe are going to find ourselves in true bankruptcy by the time the baby-\nboom generation retires.\n  I commend the efforts of Senator Gramm of Texas in bringing this to \nour attention, in bringing innovative solutions to the floor. I hope my \ncolleagues and I will be able over the next several weeks to put this \ninto legislative form so in the long run we will have solved the \nproblem, and future generations here will not have to worry about it \nthe way we have to struggle with it today.\n\n[[Page S3710]]\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, yesterday, the Medicare and Social Security \ntrustees released their annual reports on the actuarial status of both \ntrust funds--a report which is actually due on April 1 of each year. \nThe board of trustees has six members: the Secretaries of Treasury and \nLabor; the Commissioner of Social Security, and two public trustees \nappointed by the President.\n  As expected, there are no surprises in yesterday's reports, and there \nis no good news.\n  As most Americans know by now, the Medicare hospital insurance [HI] \ntrust fund is close to bankruptcy. In fact, the trustees' report \nconfirms that the expected bankruptcy date remains just 4 years away--\nin 2001. The problem is pretty basic--more money is flowing out of the \nHI trust fund than is flowing in. Trust fund assets are quickly being \ndepleted. In 2001, they're gone.\n  Although most attention is focused on the impending bankruptcy of the \nHI trust fund, the trustees report that the supplemental medical \ninsurance [SMI] trust fund (Medicare part B) is also a serious problem. \nSMI spending is a blank check on the Treasury. Over the past 5 years, \nSMI spending has grown 14 percent faster than the economy. Without \nsavings in part B, we cannot say we have affectively tackled the \nproblem of fixing Medicare. In the words of the public trustees, part B \ngrowth is unsustainable over time.\n  In bringing about a lasting solution that will protect and preserve \nthe Medicare Program, all the Medicare stakeholders will have a role to \nplay--hospitals, doctors, nursing homes, beneficiaries, and others. The \npublic trustees appointed to represent the public expressed this \nchallenge. They stated that, ``Medicare cannot stay exactly as it is \nand it is misleading to think that any part of the program--beneficiary \npremiums, providers payments, controls on utilization, covered service \nor revenues--can be exempt from change.''\n  I agree with the trustees' recommendation that a bipartisan advisory \ngroup should be put together to craft a long-term solution to \nMedicare's fiscal crisis. In fact, in February, with Senator Pat \nMoynihan, I introduced a bill to address Medicare long-term challenges \nby establishing a national bipartisan commission on the future of \nMedicare. This Medicare commission would serve as an essential catalyst \nto congressional action, consolidating bipartisan support, and \nultimately lead to a solution that will preserve and protect the \nMedicare Program for current beneficiaries, their children, and \ngrandchildren.\n  Although the financial plight of the Medicare Program is urgent, we \nmust also be mindful of the longer term--but no less serious--problems \nof Social Security. Beginning about 2012, payroll taxes will no longer \ncover benefits. We must surely act sooner than later if we are to avoid \na crisis in Social Security.\n  We need to assure the trust in the trust funds remains, not just for \ntoday's beneficiaries, but also for tomorrow's. We must ensure that \nMedicare and Social Security will be there for our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for coming \nthis morning to talk about Medicare. I want to take a couple of minutes \nto sum up and make some comments with respect to my views on Medicare.\n  First of all, I cannot think of a more important issue to deal with, \none that is more difficult to deal with, one that has been put off \npolitically because of the difficulty of dealing with it. But certainly \nthe time has come to which we have to face up to doing it. I think it \nis likely that we will.\n  Over the last several years, particularly in the last election, it \nwas used as an election issue. The President and the administration \ngenerally said those Republicans simply want to do away with Medicare, \nwant to cut it. That is not the point at all. I think most everyone \nknew at the time that was not the point at all. Some very unfactual \nthings were said. Now most anyone who has paid any attention at all to \nthe system, to the status, has to say, ``Look, we have to make some \nchanges. If we do not make changes we will not have the results we \nneed.'' And the results we have seen are an increasing challenge to the \nvalidity of the program, and the fact that the program will not last \nover another 4 years.\n  So the report of the trustees is there--trustees appointed, most of \nthem, by the President--who have laid out the facts, who have said the \ngood news is that it still will expire in 2001, the same year it was \nsaid to expire last year. The bad news is that it is no better than it \nwas and we are 1 year closer to it. That report is there. It is \nprojected that the program will go broke in 4 years. This confirms what \nwe have known over a period of time. Now the time has come to do \nsomething. We ought to take advantage of this opportunity. We can make \nsome changes. I think both the Senator from Arizona and the Senator \nfrom Texas indicated we have a difficult issue, but we can make some \nchanges. The longer we wait, the more difficult it will be to rectify \nthe problem.\n  We have already begun to move into the area of giving some choice to \nseniors. I think that is a great idea. If we are going to have choice \nof managed care, for example, which has brought down the costs in many \ncases, we have to do something about the payments that are made \ncurrently. The payments for Medicare, HMO's in some counties in New \nYork are $750 a month. Those same payments in Wyoming, and in North and \nSouth Dakota are $220. We do not have the opportunity in our States to \nuse managed care. Furthermore, those high payments have allowed the \nbenefits in this New York county to be greater than the benefits in \nWyoming for a program that has all been financed by the same payments \nfrom everyone--2.9 percent. That is unfair. We need to change it. There \nare aging and disabled persons who depend on it. We need to do \nsomething. We need to give some flexibility. We need to be able to use \nsome managed care plans.\n  We also need to take a long look at fraud and abuse. We had some \nhearings a couple of years ago, and I am sure things have not changed, \nwhere nearly 10 percent of this enormous fund was lost in fraud and \nabuse. We can do something about that.\n  Mr. President, I simply again want to thank my friends for coming \nhere. I think we have to focus on this program. The sooner we find some \nsolutions, the less severe any changes will have to be. We can, indeed, \ndo that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3704-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3710-S3712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record various op-ed pieces that relate to yesterday's debate on \nthe Chemical Weapons Convention.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Apr. 22, 1997]\n\n                    On My Mind--Matter of Character\n\n                          (By A.M. Rosenthal)\n\n       For collectors' of flips, flops, mistakes and outrages in \n     the conduct of American foreign policy, last week was a \n     treasure trove, pure heaven. For the national interest it was \n     a pure mess.\n       Three times the Clinton Administration floundered or \n     double-talked itself into loss of credibility--and on three \n     of the more important international issues facing the \n     country: the treaty on banning chemical weapons, the struggle \n     against state-sponsored terrorism and the war on drugs.\n       The most immediate issue is the treaty prohibiting \n     production, storage and use of chemical weapons.\n       This should have been a breeze. Americans could normally be \n     counted on to support international outlawing of chemical \n     weapons, which the U.S. has already forsworn. But a lack of \n     candor at home and of political courage with our allies has \n     made it a tossup as to whether it will pass when it comes up \n     for a Senate vote on Thursday.\n\n[[Page S3711]]\n\n       Written into the treaty are loopholes that are deal \n     breakers for many senators. Article 10 alone would break it \n     for me.\n\n\n                     Article 10 and other outrages.\n\n       The article mandates that all signatory countries have the \n     right to the ``fullest possible exchange'' of all materials \n     and information about ``protections'' against chemical \n     weapons. Those materials and techniques could show terrorist \n     nations how to produce chemical weapons that could evade the \n     defense of their chosen victims. Iran just loves Article 10.\n       Since the treaty was first proposed in the Reagan \n     Administration, four important facts have become part of \n     international reality.\n       One: Some of America's friends like Russia and Germany, \n     have sold techniques and components of weapons of mass \n     destruction to countries bitterly hostile to the U.S. Two: \n     Under Presidents Bush and Clinton, the U.S. has not shown the \n     willpower to stop or punish the ``friendly'' sellers or their \n     customers. Three: China has become a major rogue distributor, \n     to major rogue nations. And four: America has not been able \n     to stop that either.\n       Article 10 would permit salesmen of death to peddle \n     chemical-weapon materials and techniques entirely legally, by \n     labeling them ``defensive.''\n       The answer that the Secretaries of Defense and State gave \n     was that the treaty will go into effect whether the U.S. \n     likes it or not, so we should sign and keep an eye on it from \n     the inside.\n       There's a far better way. The senate should adopt a \n     proposed amendment making actual U.S. participation \n     conditional on the President obtaining deletion of Article 10 \n     and some other loopholes.\n       The week's outrage on state-sponsored terrorism sacrifices \n     the right of Americans to get important non-classified \n     information. Washington decided to withhold a white paper \n     about Iranian terrorism it had planned to make public. This \n     came after a German court found Iran guilty of terrorism \n     against Iranian dissidents in Germany, and as information \n     pops up that Iran was involved in the slaughter-bombing of an \n     American military installation in Saudi Arabia.\n       The white paper was withheld because the State Department \n     does not want to upset European nations that have tried to \n     use ``engagement'' to persuade Iran to behave sweetly, a \n     policy the U.S. says has failed. Hello? State, are you all \n     there?\n       Drugs: Mexico now is the major transporter of marijuana and \n     Colombian cocaine into the U.S. The hotshot general who \n     headed Mexico's antidrug effort has been arrested as the \n     secret agent of the drug cartels. The Mexican Government had \n     allowed this traitor to go to Washington for embraces and \n     top-secret briefings with his American counterpart, Gen. \n     Barry McCaffrey, without informing any American that their \n     man was about to be jailed.\n       Bonded to Mexico by Nafta and the peso bailout, an \n     embarrassed White House decided not to lift Mexico's \n     certification as a country doing its best to fight drugs.\n       Mr. Clinton plans to visit Mexico next month. Instead of \n     preparing Mexico's public to hear some hard truth about their \n     country's contribution to the drug war, last week the \n     Administration began almost apologetically making nicey-nice \n     to Mexico, to put the visit in the ``right light'' for Mr. \n     Clinton.\n       Underlying these fumbles, mistakes and outrages are not \n     simply defects of policy but of character: the inability to \n     face and correct mistakes and the addiction to evasion and \n     denial. As at home, so abroad.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 24, 1997]\n\n                            Review & Outlook\n\n\n                           chemical reactions\n\n       Before today's vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention, we \n     hope that some Senator will twist his tongue around the 20 \n     chemicals listed nearby and read their names into the record. \n     This list makes two important points about what's wrong with \n     the treaty.\n       First is that many ordinary chemicals can be put to deadly \n     use. The chemicals on this list can be used in such mundane \n     products as laundry soaps, ink and fumigation agents--or they \n     can be used in lethal weapons. Bear this in mind when you \n     hear the President assert that the CWC will ``banish poison \n     gas from the Earth.''\n       The second point is that the CWC not only will permit trade \n     in these 20 potentially deadly chemicals, it will require it. \n     American companies currently are restricted from exporting \n     these dual-use chemicals under the terms of an organization \n     called the Australia Group, which is made up of 29 Western \n     countries committed to ensuring that their exports don't \n     contribute to the spread of chemical weapons.\n       But Articles X and XI of the CWC require member countries \n     to transfer chemicals and technology to any other member \n     country that asks. This goes a long way toward explaining why \n     the Chemical Manufacturers Association is so loud in its \n     support of the treaty.\n       Senators who are still considering how to vote might \n     consider whether selling such chemicals to China or Iran or \n     Cuba will help make the world safe from chemical weapons--or \n     make the world a more dangerous place?\n       Trade in these 20 precursors for chemical weapons agents, \n     now regulated, would be permitted under the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention:\n       3-Hydroxy-1-methylpiperidine, Potassium fluoride, 2-\n     Chloroethanol, Dimethylamine (DMA), Dimethylamine \n     hydrochloride, Hydrogen fluoride, Methyl benzilate, 3-\n     Quinuclidone, Pinacolone, Potassium cyanide, Potassium \n     bifluoride, Ammonium bifluoride, Sodium fluoride, Sodium \n     bifluoride, Sodium cyanide, Phosphorus pentasulfide, \n     Diisopropylamine (DIPA), Diethylaminoethanol (DEAE), Sodium \n     sulfide, Triethanolamine hydrochloride.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From The Wall Street Journal, Apr. 22, 1997]\n\n                            Review & Outlook\n\n\n                             Lott's Mirrors\n\n       Trent Lott's problem with the impending Senate vote on the \n     chemical weapons treaty vote is not merely that it binds the \n     U.S. to deal with the likes of Cuba and China. The larger \n     question for Republicans is whether they can cope with the \n     Clinton Presidency, a political hall of mirrors invariably \n     reflecting any given reality back into the body politic as \n     something slightly off-center.\n       So with the chemical weapons treaty. The issue is being \n     represented to the public as a huge vote on foreign policy, \n     which typically means an austere, almost hyper-\n     intellectualized debate free of the usual, grimy domestic \n     constituencies. We should be so lucky.\n       If that were true, this treaty would already be dead. The \n     Senate today is full of men and women who've never had the \n     opportunity before to vote on one of these arms-control \n     projects. Some of them must be wondering how the subject ever \n     got so mystical. We ourselves have watched arms-control \n     tiltings since the days of Camelot, and we'd like to reassure \n     the younger class of Republican Senators that if they feel \n     there is a certain ``lightheadedness'' about this effort, \n     their instincts are correct.\n       President Clinton was panting over the weekend. ``There is \n     no such thing as perfect verifiability,'' he said of the kind \n     of weapons a Japanese cult cooked up in a bathtub. His \n     ``bottom line''--will we go from leading the fight against \n     poison gas to joining the company of pariah nations this \n     treaty seeks to isolate?''--sounded like something from an \n     AFL-CIO commercial on Social Security. And of course, even a \n     flawed treaty would be ``an advance over no treaty at all.''\n       This is liberal sentimentalism at its worst. It says, Our \n     hearts are in the right place, so let's not let a bunch of \n     operational details get in the way of doing the right thing. \n     Presumably this policy woolly-mindedness, in both domestic \n     and foreign politics, is precisely what the current crop of \n     Republicans came to Washington to stop. And that they did \n     with the welfare reform act.\n       So why all the drama over this vote?\n       Mainly because the real drama is in watching Trent Lott \n     figure out which path he should take in leading the \n     Republicans safely through the Clinton hall of mirrors \n     between now and the off-year elections in 1998. Just ahead, \n     there is the budget mirror, the capital-gains mirror, the MFN \n     mirror, the Helsinki mirror and any other issue that might \n     require the Republicans to balance on a tree limb with Bill \n     Clinton.\n       The case for waving through a terribly flawed chemical \n     weapons treaty is that a grateful Bill Clinton will be \n     inclined to do deals with the GOP on the budget, capital \n     gains and the like. This strategy inevitably casts Trent Lott \n     as the President's errand boy, the Charlie Brown of politics, \n     willing to believe that this time Bill Clinton won't pull the \n     ball like Lucy of the promises--that he won't double-cross \n     Mr. Lott as he did on the CPI adjustment, that he won't sic \n     Bob Rubin on a capital-gains cut the way he did on the \n     balanced budget amendment.\n       The only reason that Beltway Republicans would consider \n     playing this game again with so unreliable a partner as Bill \n     Clinton is their belief that absent deals of some sort, the \n     Democrats in 1998 will accuse them of obstruction and \n     failure, all the while running TV ads about Republicans and \n     ``poison gas.''\n       Until a few weeks ago, the treaty almost certainly would \n     have passed for these reasons. But then the broader interests \n     of the Republican Party stepped forward to be heard. Jack \n     Kemp and Steve Forbes came out against the treaty. Four \n     former GOP Secretaries of Defense--Weinberger, Cheney, \n     Rumsfeld and Schlesinger--testified against it. Grass-roots \n     conservatives such as Grover Norquist and Gary Bauer joined \n     the active opposition.\n       These people want, as do we, the party's legislative \n     accomplishments to reflect identifiable Republican beliefs. \n     Notwithstanding the participation of Republican \n     Presidents, arms control today is an idea flowing entirely \n     from a Democratic liberal's view of the world. This \n     chemical weapons treaty perfectly reflects that view. It \n     is a state of mind that would regard Senator Lott's \n     objection to sharing chemical-weapons defense technology \n     with Iran as a ``killer amendment,'' and that would solve \n     the Lott objection by promising only to give Iran \n     ``emergency medical supplies.''\n       We're about to go through a few days of high Washington \n     drama before the vote as all eyes focus on the \n     ``undecideds.'' This group now includes GOP Senators Hatch, \n     Bennett, Nickels, Hutchison, Abraham, Santorum and of course \n     Majority Leader Lott. We suspect most of this group knows the \n     treaty should fail on its merits. The larger question is what \n     they believe should define the Republican Party--what they \n     see in the mirror, or reflections from the mirrors Bill \n     Clinton puts before them.\n\n[[Page S3712]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, Apr. 21, 1997]\n\n                  Kirkpatrick: The Threat Will Remain\n\n       Ratifying the Chemical Weapons Convention will not prevent \n     the manufacture or use of chemical weapons because the \n     convention is neither verifiable nor enforceable. Proponents \n     attempt to dismiss the many loopholes in the treaty with the \n     assertion that nothing is perfect. But perfection is not the \n     question.\n       Proponents also seek to minimize the fact that the rogue \n     states and countries with the most highly developed programs \n     either have not signed or have not ratified the treaty--\n     Syria, Iraq, North Korea, Libya have not signed at all. \n     Russia, which has the most chemical weapons, has not \n     ratified, and China has not completed the ratification \n     process. Of course, signing will not prevent signatories from \n     breaking their promises not to produce noxious gases, as \n     Russia has recently broken a promise to the United States.\n       Will U.S. ratification make the world safer? Did the \n     Maginot line make France safer? To the contrary.

I cherish this sense of lessened threat. But we are \n     not so safe that we can afford to create a false sense of \n     security by pretending that we have eliminated the threat of \n     chemical weapons. President Clinton said, ``We will have \n     banished poison gas from the Earth.'' It will not be so.

The Banking Committee is discharged from S. \n562, and under the previous order the Senate can proceed to consider \nthat bill.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 562) to amend section 255 of the National \n     Housing Act to prevent the funding of unnecessary or \n     excessive costs for obtaining a home equity conversion \n     mortgage.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Lehn \nBenjamin be admitted to the floor for the purposes of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to support the legislation \nknown as the Senior Citizens Home Equity Protection Act. Now, that is \nlegal jargon for saying that we have a real problem, one that is, on a \ndaily basis, getting worse and worse, one that is exposing our most \nvulnerable homeowner population--our senior citizens--to very, very \nserious abuses.\n  Let me, if I might, just explain to you the problem without going \nthrough all of the intricacies of this legislation, which I might add \nis supported and cosponsored by approximately 25 of my colleagues. The \nbill's cosponsors are about equally divided, Republicans and Democrats, \nand include just about the entire Banking Committee.\n  Who are these people who are being scammed, who are being victimized? \nThey are our parents, our grandparents, our senior citizens. They are \nelderly homeowners in America who are being induced by some people who \nmasquerade as estate planners. This is not an attack on estate \nplanners. This is not an attack on those financial consultants who give \npeople advice. This is an attempt to stop thieves, con artists and \nswindlers, masquerading as helpers to the elderly, but who are nothing \nmore than rip-off artists.\n  What do they do? Congress, through HUD, has initiated a program of \nreverse mortgages whereby many seniors who are cash poor and who have \nequity in their homes, people who have paid off their homes, and find \nthemselves without the ability to pay their taxes, to keep up their \nhome, or to take care of their daily needs, people have utilized \nreverse mortgages whereby they can go to the bank. They might have \n$100,000 value in their home and may receive a $50,000 mortgage which \nthey may take out on a monthly basis or they may take out the entire \namount and thereby budget for themselves their needs.\n  Now who is a typical borrower of this reverse mortgage plan? What is \nthe profile? They are 76 years old. They are with less means than a \ntypical elderly home owner. Their annual income is $10,400 per annum. \nOne-quarter of them have incomes of less than $7,700. Mr. President, 78 \npercent of the total income that they have comes from Social Security.\n  What do the scam artists do? Today, because of the availability of so \nmuch credit information and information with respect to the lives of \nevery citizen, they solicit those people who are elderly, who own their \nown home. Many of them are living alone. Sixty percent of these people \nthat use the HUD reverse mortgage program need to use it because they \ndo not want to be forced to sell their homes and leave their \ncommunities. That is where their friends and neighbors and relatives \nlive. Sixty percent are females living alone, 12 percent are males \nliving alone. So, fully over 70 percent are elderly who are living \nalone.\n  So they get a profile on these people and they literally go door-to-\ndoor and say, ``We are in the business of financial consulting. If you \nwould like, we could help you obtain a mortgage, a reverse mortgage, \none you do not have to pay back. Only when you eventually sell your \nhome or if you pass away, will the proceeds come due, and we can get \nyou $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000.'' For this advice, they often charge \nthese people 10 percent of the mortgage loan amount. Most times they \nnever tell them that there will be any kind of a fee, nor do they \nadvise them that this information is available free, or that HUD will \nmake this available, or send them the information.\n  So literally, because they know of this program, they are able to go \nout and take as much as 10 percent for a $50,000 mortgage for \ninformation that is available at no cost, and literally do nothing but \nrelieve the people of their money.\n  Here is, Mr. President, an advertisement. They are not happy just \ngoing door-to-door or by telemarketing themselves. They are now \nfranchising, franchising, this kind of thievery. Here is an \nadvertisement called ``America's Trust, Inc.--Tap into a totally new \nmarket of opportunity. Duplicate the system that allowed us to expand \nby 400 percent in 60 days.'' It goes on to say if you want to become \none of our door-to-door solicitors or one of our telemarketers, why, \nyou can earn a 3-percent commission, and, by the way, you can do \nliterally dozens of these referrals on a weekly basis and we will give \nto you a 3-percent commission, because they give them 3 percent and \nthey keep 7 percent. And this poor homeowner is paying money for a \nservice that virtually gives them nothing, but just refers them to a \nGovernment program. That is wrong.\n\n  Mr. President, that is why we are seeking to pass this legislation \nthat would stop unscrupulous high-pressure middle men from preying on \nelderly homeowners by exploiting the reverse mortgage program.\n  I have explained to you what the problem is. The bill will put an \nimmediate stop to the practice of predators taking advantage of senior \ncitizens. HUD's Federal Housing Administration Conversion Mortgage \nProgram, known as HECM, is a reverse mortgage program. It allows \nseniors age 62 and older to borrow against the equity in their homes. \nIt is a great program; it has assisted approximately 20,000 people. \nBut, again, we find the masquerader coming and preying on the elderly. \nThe average person is 76 years old and has an average income of \n$10,400. These homeowners are tracked down and enticed to apply for a \nreverse mortgage and conned into paying thousands of dollars for this \nservice, which HUD provides for free. They are totally unregulated \ncompanies, often changing names and locations.\n  The following are true examples: One 75-year-old woman who resides in \nsouthern California read a brochure about reverse mortgages at a senior \ncitizens center. She contacted the so-called information service, one \nof these scam artists, who met with her and referred her to a lender. \nThe FHA-approved lender then handled the loan for her. She was \nsurprised and shocked to learn that she now had to pay $5,200 to the \nso-called information service for that referral. That is just wrong.\n  Another elderly woman, also in California, was called by a \ntelemarketer\n\n[[Page S3713]]\n\nwho persuaded her to apply for the HUD reverse mortgage program. This \nperson called himself an estate planner. She paid the planner $5,500 \njust for the referral--no other services. She paid a 10-percent fee \njust for them saying, ``Here, call HUD.''\n  Here is another heartbreaking story. A 91-year-old California widow \nwith cataracts was solicited for a reverse mortgage. While she \noriginally refused, she said she was eventually worn down and agreed. \nDue to her cataracts, she was unable to read the mortgage documents, \nand nobody explained to her what she was signing, and she ended up \npaying a 10-percent fee. She states that she would not have applied for \nthe mortgage had she known she would be paying a 10-percent fee.\n  This is what goes on and on and on. There are stories about people \nwho are literally coerced, because of their age, to invest their \nmortgage proceeds in annuities they had no real reason to want or need. \nThese practices must be stopped. This bill will provide HUD the ability \nto issue an immediate interim order, setting rules and regulations so \nthat legitimate estate planners can continue, and those high-jinx \nartists who are abusing and defrauding--and actually franchising--what \nis left of senior citizens' assets will be precluded from doing so.\n  HUD--and I have spoken to Secretary Cuomo who, within an hour of the \nfinal passage of this legislation, will enact those rules and \nregulations that will prevent these scam artists from dealing with FHA-\napproved lenders. They will no longer be permitted to do that. The \nlender will be precluded from working with anyone who is receiving \nthese types of commissions. Now, HUD has attempted to do this. The \ncourt system has said, no, you must follow proper rulemaking \nprocedures. That is why we are here. That is why it is a situation of \nsome exigency, because every day, every hour, we have more and more \nseniors who are potentially being victimized. So it is an urgent \nquestion of time.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nMcCain and Senator Domenici be added as cosponsors to S. 562.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I simply want to say that no one has \nworked harder in bringing this matter to light and sponsoring this \nlegislation than Senator Bryan. He has pointed out that there are 12 \nmillion elderly homeowners who own their homes free and clear, and what \nhas taken place is that they have become targets of these people who \nmasquerade as estate planners. There are tens of thousands of older \nhomeowners who are house-rich but cash-poor and have successfully \nutilized this program. But we have to see to it that we keep these scam \nartists from moving in further. The success of the reverse mortgage \nprogram has opened the door to scam artists that are moving into our \ncommunities.\n  To date, fortunately, this has not become a situation that is \nwidespread. Hopefully, we will be educating people by speaking to them \ntoday and telling them to watch out. But, more importantly, we should \nsee to it that they have the protections afforded by this legislation. \nLet me also say that the State of Nevada has many senior citizens who \nare potential targets. Obviously, the Senator from Nevada is very \nconcerned.\n  Mr. President, one who has worked tirelessly in this matter has been \nSenator Dodd. I yield the floor to my friend and colleague, Senator \nDodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York. Let me \nbegin these brief remarks by commending our colleague, the chairman of \nthe Banking and Housing Committee, Senator D'Amato, for pushing this as \neffectively and expeditiously as he has. We know it is hard to get on \nthe agenda here with all the other matters we have to consider. The \nfact that we are considering this legislation as quickly as we are is a \ncredit to him and also to the leadership of the majority leader, \nSenator Lott, and the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle. It is \nnoncontroversial because all of our colleagues, I think, recognize what \nis being done to senior citizens.\n  Senator D'Amato has rightfully pointed out the tremendous work done \nby Richard Bryan, our colleague from Nevada, who has been deeply \ninvolved in this issue. Also, Andrew Cuomo, the Secretary of Housing \nand Urban Development and his staff have done an excellent job on this \nissue. He has worked hard to prevent scam artists from taking advantage \nof elderly Americans in these reverse mortgage opportunities. So many \npeople can rightfully sit at the table and take credit for where we are \ntoday--about to pass critical legislation that will help our senior \ncitizens.\n  Mr. President, everyone in this country needs a safe and secure place \nto live; that is a dream as old as the Republic. In recent years, the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development has developed a number of \ninnovative programs that are helping many more Americans achieve the \ndream of home ownership. The National Home Ownership Strategy, a \npublic-private partnership of 62 organizations, has helped to increase \nhome ownership to a rate of 65.6 percent, Mr. President. That is the \nhighest rate in 15 years. As an aside, I am very hopeful that we will \ncontinue to work on creative ideas, under the leadership of the \nchairman of the committee, and others, to increase home ownership in \nmore of our disadvantaged areas. We have subsidized rents for years, \nand there has been real value in that, in providing decent shelter for \npeople. I would like to see us do more to subsidize equity and \nownership. Nothing does more to clean up a street or a neighborhood \nthan people who have an equity interest or financial interest in what \nhappens to the buildings on their block.\n  I know the chairman and others have expressed a strong interest in \nthis. So maybe we can move even further than we already have, and \nincrease home ownership rates even higher.\n  The bill we are considering today will help protect homeowners. It \nwill protect senior citizens who have worked hard, struggled to save, \nand built decent homes for their families. Our senior citizens fought \nvery hard to get their homes. These are people who didn't have the \nadvantages of a lot of new opportunities that banks provide, and that \nHUD has provided, to get out and make those downpayments on that first \nhome. These are our retired citizens now, who have fought to keep their \nhomes, who held two, three, four jobs to do so, and paid off those \nmortgages. They are sitting there holding their home free and clear of \nany debt. And now, as a result of that, financial institutions very \ncreatively are offering the reverse mortgage, which the chairman has \ntalked about, and are saying you can borrow against that equity in \norder to take care of medical bills, groceries, or heating bills you \nmay have, and other things that come up. It is a very creative idea to \nbe able to reverse a mortgage, in effect, for things that people need.\n  But what happens, of course, when something like this comes along, \nthere are always the thugs who try to take advantage of people. This is \nnothing new. They are always out there. They run around and go door to \ndoor, literally, Mr. President, where these elderly people live and rip \nthem off, as the chairman pointed out passionately this morning. These \nare people who have worked hard and done everything right and live \nalone, in some cases, and their family may be removed and they don't \nget the kind of advice they should be getting. You can say ``caveat \nemptor, buyer beware; you ought to do a better job.'' But it is \ndifficult. They are frightened and scared, and some fast-talking \nsalesman comes in with a quick deal and they don't know the difference.\n  As a result of the chairman's efforts this morning and the unanimous \nsupport that I think we are going to have from all of our colleagues \nhere, we are going to slam the door on these scam artists--loan sharks \nis really what they are. That is simple terminology that most people \ncan understand.\n  So I am very pleased, Mr. President, to join my colleague from New \nYork, and others, this morning in urging the adoption of this \nlegislation and urging the House, which I hope will move quickly on \nthis, so that we can submit this bill to the President for signature. I \nknow the President strongly supports our efforts here as well.\n  This is a good example of a Congress working together to take care of \na\n\n[[Page S3714]]\n\nproblem that exists in the country. This legislation will provide our \nelderly citizens, our seniors, with the security of knowing that the \nreverse mortgage, which they are taking out for their needs, will not \ncost them more than it should. So I am delighted to be a cosponsor of \nthis. I commend the chairman again, and others, for their work. I thank \nthe Housing and Urban Development Agency, under the leadership of \nAndrew Cuomo, for being so supportive. I look forward to the passage of \nthis bill, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleague and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me commend Senator Dodd for his \nleadership in this and say to him that, No. 1, it is absolutely \nimperative that we see to it that our senior citizens are protected. If \nyou stop and look at the numbers that I have indicated to you, 72 \npercent of all of these seniors live in their homes alone. For the most \npart, they are widows or widowers. What targets, what inviting targets \nthey are. They are struggling to keep their homes, and these scam \nartists come along and say, ``We have the way for you to do it.'' Well, \nthere is a way provided by the reverse mortgage program, without being \nripped off for $5,000 or $6,000. They are bandits. We are going to make \nthis immoral, horrible practice now illegal. Technically, they have \nbeen able to get away with this. This legislation will give to \nSecretary Cuomo the ability to prevent this. He has said to us that, \nwithin 1 hour of Congress giving him that authority, he will exercise \nthat authority. So that is the least we can do.\n  I ask that Senator Helms be added as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Let me say that Senator Dodd has mentioned something \nthat I think we can do, and that is we will attempt to do two things. \nFirst, where we have struggling communities that are working to upgrade \nthemselves, we can and should be able to make the kind of investment \nthat for not much in the way of dollars will lead to revitalization.\n  I have met with people in the community today from Riverhead, Long \nIsland, where a self-help program is attempting to take some of the old \nhomes, in many cases that have been abandoned, and upgrading them. They \nare doing this on their own initiative. They are doing this without any \nFederal funds.\n  It seems to me that through an enlightened program of revolving \ncredit that we could provide a minimal amount of money--not tens of \nmillions--but in some cases $100,000, or maybe something in the area of \nseveral hundreds of thousands of dollars, which communities could use \nin their own self-help programs to purchase distressed properties, \ncoupled with low-rate mortgages for first-time home buyers. They want \nto be in a position where they can say to their communities, ``Help us \nrehabilitate these distressed properties'' and then provide young \npeople the opportunity of homeownership that otherwise might not be \navailable.\n  I am looking forward to working with Senator Dodd in this area. \nSometimes it is a small program in a community that can grow and \ndevelop a pride that can bring about increased support for \nhomeownership in that community.\n  I am looking forward to working to do that. I think the potential is \nunlimited. We have an obligation to attempt to do that. We don't need \nbig national organizations that sometimes become counterproductive. \nThey are worried about their own image, and they have lost sight of how \nto help smaller communities help themselves as opposed to Big-Brother \nGovernment coming in and saying, ``By the way, we can give them some of \nthese tools.''\n  So I share this with you because I was so impressed by Mrs. Stark, \nwhose husband is the local supervisor in the Town of Riverhead, who \nsaid ``This is what we are doing, Senator.'' I said, ``You know, we \nshould be part of this to try to provide that opportunity.''\n  We are talking about an important subject, protecting the elderly. We \nhave an obligation to see to it that we protect them, but also to give \nreal opportunities to young families as well.\n  I look forward to working with my friend and colleague on this.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I know of no one else in the majority who \nseeks to speak to this issue. We would yield back all of our time.\n  Mr. DODD. On behalf, Mr. President, of Senator Sarbanes of this side, \nwe yield back this time as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is before the Senate and open to \namendment. If there be no amendment to be proposed, the question is on \nthe engrossment and third reading of the resolution.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, was read \nthe third time, and passed as follows:\n\n                                 S. 562\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Senior Citizen Home Equity \n     Protection Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS; PROHIBITION OF FUNDING OF \n                   UNNECESSARY OR EXCESSIVE COSTS.\n\n       Section 255(d) of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. \n     1715z-20(d) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D); \n     and\n       (C) by inserting after subparagraph (B) the following:\n       ``(C) has received full disclosure of all costs to the \n     mortgagor for obtaining the mortgage, including any costs of \n     estate planning, financial advice, or other related services; \n     and'';\n       (2) in paragraph (9)(F), by striking ``and'';\n       (3) in paragraph (10), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (4) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(11) have been made with such restrictions as the \n     Secretary determines to be appropriate to ensure that the \n     mortgagor does not fund any unnecessary or excessive costs \n     for obtaining the mortgage, including any costs of estate \n     planning, financial advice, or other related services.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION.\n\n       (a) Notice.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     shall, by interim notice, implement the amendments made by \n     section 2 in an expeditious manner, as determined by the \n     Secretary. Such notice shall not be effective after the date \n     of the effectiveness of the final regulations issued under \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Regulations.--The Secretary shall, not later than the \n     expiration of the 90-day period beginning on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, issue final regulations to implement \n     the amendments made by section 2. Such regulations shall be \n     issued only after notice and opportunity for public comment \n     pursuant to the provisions of section 553 of title 5, United \n     States Code (notwithstanding subsections (a)(2) and (b)(B) of \n     such section).\n\n\n                               section 2\n\n  Mr. MACK. I would like to engage the chairman of the committee in a \ncolloquy to further define the purpose of section 2 of the Senior \nCitizen Home Equity Protection Act. Section 2 would authorize new \ndisclosure requirements by amending the existing eligibility \nrequirements of HUD's home equity conversion mortgage [HECM] program. \nThe National Housing Act would be amended to ensure that to be eligible \nfor FHA insurance a home equity conversion mortgage shall have been \nexecuted by a mortgagor who has received full disclosure of all costs \nto the mortgagor for obtaining the mortgage, including any costs of \nestate planning, financial advice or other related services.\n  Is it correct that this section would authorize HUD to require HUD-\napproved housing counseling agencies and FHA-approved lenders offering \nthe HECM program to ask potential borrowers a series of questions aimed \nat determining if they have been or are about to be charged unnecessary \nor excessive fees by a service provider?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. That is absolutely correct. Questions asked should \ninclude: has the prospective reverse mortgage recipient made or signed \nany agreement or contract authorizing any fees to a third party? Does \nthe homeowner have the intention to or made any commitments to a third \nparty to use the reverse mortgage proceeds to purchase any annuities, \nlife insurance policies, or for other investment purposes? Has the \nhomeowner been referred to the HUD-approved housing counseling agency \nor FHA-approved lender by a third party broker?\n  Mr. MACK. Is it also the intent of the legislation that any third \nparty broker should be required to inform the homeowner of the \navailability of information and assistance regarding the HUD home \nequity conversion mortgage program at little or no cost from HUD, HUD-\napproved housing counseling agencies and FHA-approved lenders?\n\n[[Page S3715]]\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes, that is the intention. S. 562 also includes a \nrequirement for disclosure to the mortgagor of the costs of all \nservices related to obtaining the HECM loan, including estate planning \nand financial advice. HUD should implement this disclosure requirement \nin a reasonable manner. HUD will not be required to mandate disclosure \nof the costs of services of persons such as attorneys or accountants \nwho are in the business of giving professional advice. For fees not \nrequired to be included in the mortgagee's good faith estimate under \nthe Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, mortgagees should be \npermitted to rely on inquiries made to the mortgagors to determine if \nmortgagors have received the necessary disclosure of cost.\n  Mr. MACK. Would the Senator please describe the implementation \nrequirements of S. 562?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I would be pleased to do so. I believe the National \nHousing Act currently gives HUD the power to protect elderly homeowners \nseeking home equity conversion mortgage loans, including the authority \nto regulate or prohibit unnecessary or excessive fees that mortgagors \npay to third parties for referrals to HECM lenders and related \nservices. Due to the urgent need to protect elderly homeowners, S. 562 \nwill require HUD initially to implement these provisions through an \ninterim notice in the Federal Register. HUD will also be required to \nproceed with formal notice and comment rulemaking and issue a final \nrule within 90 days. If needed to meet the 90-day target, HUD may \nprovide an abbreviated public comment period.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, many of our senior citizens are once again \nbeing targeted by scam artists. This time, senior citizens are being \ncharged excessive fees by so-called estate planners who provide \ninformation on reverse mortgages and charge 8 percent to 10 percent of \nthe loan.\n  More than 12 million elderly homeowners own their homes free and \nclear of mortgages. This implies the availability of a potentially \nlarge market for home equity conversion programs. Reverse mortgages, \none of the hottest financial products of the 1990's for seniors, allow \nhomeowners to tap into the equity in their homes and use that equity as \na source of income. They work much like traditional mortgages, only in \nreverse. Rather than making a payment to your lender each month, the \nlender pays the homeowner. Depending on the loan, a reverse mortgage \nbecomes due with interest when the homeowner moves, sells the property, \nor dies.\n  The reverse mortgage program provides tens of thousands of older \nhomeowners, who are ``house-rich, but cash-poor,'' the opportunity to \nturn their home equity into spendable cash to deal with major financial \nsetbacks such as home repairs, significant health costs, or basic \nliving needs. Reports of abusive practices should not diminish the \nvalue of this product. Rather, we must find a way to protect senior \nhomeowners from scam artists who prey on the vulnerabilities of elderly \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, senior citizens across the country are being charged \nscandalous fees for information that can be obtained free from HUD. \nAccording to HUD, many older Americans who sign contracts with estate \nplanning services and are charged large fees are unaware that the same \ninformation is available from HUD at no cost. Generally, estate \nplanners fees range from 6 to 10 percent of the loan amount. This \ntranslates into $3,000 to $5,000 for a $50,000 loan or $6,000 to \n$10,000 for a $100,000 loan.\n  Pauline and Jim Mitchell both 79 years old from Henderson, NV were \nforced to spend most of their savings when Pauline's mother--who was \nstricken with Alzheimers--moved in with the Mitchells for 7 years \nbefore she passed away last year. When the Mitchells were approached by \na door-to-door salesman about obtaining a reverse mortgage to pay off \nexpenses, they were extremely interested. What they did not know, \nhowever, was that it would cost them $4,500. It was not until they \nreceived their lump sum check of $31,000, did they realize that $4,500 \nhad been taken out--in addition to the normal closing costs. That \nrepresents a 12 percent commission above and beyond closing costs--for \na service they could get for free if they had contacted HUD or the \nlender directly. At most, they should have been charged a few hundred \ndollars referral fee--not $4,500.\n  Mickey Kimberlin and her husband James from Las Vegas were charged \n$4,000 for information about a reverse mortgage. The Kimberlins were \ninterested in obtaining a reverse mortgage to help pay for mounting \nfamily medical bills. When they were contacted by a representative of \nAmerica's Trust Inc. of San Juan Capistrano in California, they did not \nrealize they would be charged 8.5 percent of the loan.\n  The Senior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act will protect senior \ncitizens receiving a HUD home equity conversion mortgage from further \nexploitation by these predator lenders. Our legislation will no longer \nallow scam artists to hide outrageous reverse mortgage fees. Full \ndisclosure of the costs and the ability of HUD to prevent excessive \nfees are important and necessary steps to take to protect senior \ncitizens seeking reverse mortgages.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation to protect our Nation's senior citizens.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I strongly support the Senior Citizens \nHome Equity Protection Act and commend Chairman D'Amato and Secretary \nCuomo for identifying this problem and moving so quickly to develop a \nsolution. The act will give HUD the tools it needs to put an end to the \nunethical practice of charging senior homeowners what has amounted to \nmillions of dollars for information which HUD provides for free on the \nHome Equity Conversion Mortgage Program.\n  The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Program enables seniors, who have \nbuilt up equity in their home, to borrow that equity to meet medical \ncosts, make repairs on their homes, or meet their daily living \nexpenses. Working with participating lenders, FHA insures this loan, \nsmoothing the way to complete the transaction. Homeowners receive \npayments from lenders on a monthly basis, in a lump sum, or as a line \nof credit. The size of the loan depends on the owner's age, the \ninterest rate, and home's value, but the average size of the loan is \n$42,465. Lenders recover their loan plus interest from the sale of the \nhome when the owner dies or moves. Typically, the seniors that use this \nprogram depend largely on social security, perhaps supplemented by a \nvery modest pension. For them, this program provides an invaluable \nservice.\n  The initial demonstration program was authorized in the 1987 Home and \nCommunity Development Act, which I supported. Many of the roughly \n20,000 reverse mortgages made to date have been made to low- and \nmoderate-income seniors who have been able to build up equity in their \nhomes over the years but now live on fixed, restricted incomes. This \nprogram enables them to turn a valuable but nonliquid asset into cash \npayments to supplement their resources. Clearly this is an important \nprogram that contributes significantly to the quality of life for our \nsenior citizens. It is unthinkable that this important Federal program \nand the people it is intended to serve are being exploited by certain \nestate planning agencies who charge seniors 6-10 percent off the top of \nthis loan--which, on the average $42,000 loan, can amount to over \n$4,000. This is tantamount to taking away the equity that seniors \nworked so hard to put into their homes over the years. In fact, HUD \nreports that some of these operators pressure seniors into taking out \ntheir equity in lump sums, just so the estate planner can collect their \nfee up front. A little over 77 percent of householders age 65 and older \nare homeowners--or 15.7 million senior Americans. The companies \ninvolved in this practice claimed to have done close to a thousand of \nthese deals and have the potential to do much more harm if this is not \naddressed.\n  As a nation we have long encouraged and recognized the value of home \nownership--the stability it creates in communities, the asset it \nbecomes to the owner, and the security it provides over time. I have \nlong supported programs that increase home ownership among low- and \nmoderate-income people, such as the Home Investment Partnership Program \nand affordable housing goals for Government sponsored enterprises, such \nas Fannie Mae. It is the\n\n[[Page S3716]]\n\nlow- and moderate-income senior homeowners to whom the reverse mortgage \nprogram is so important.\n  In Maryland, we are making a special effort to increase the home \nownership rates in low-income communities because there is no better \nway to start climbing the ladder of economic opportunity. A few weeks \nago, HouseBaltimore, a partnership between the city of Baltimore, the \nBaltimore Empowerment Zone, and Fannie Mae announced that they have \nincreased the number of low- and moderate-income homeowners in the city \nof Baltimore by 6,000 over the last 3 years. Earlier this month, the \ncity of Baltimore was awarded a home ownership zone grant of over $5 \nmillion. The zone will create 322 new home ownership opportunities, 242 \nnewly constructed units, and 80 rehabilitated units. These so-called \nestate planners undermine these efforts by taking a portion of this \nvaluable asset away from senior Americans.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator D'Amato and my colleagues on the \nBanking Committee for their responsiveness and willingness to undertake \nthis effort, enabling HUD to take swift action and stop this practice. \nWe need to continue to ensure all of our citizens live in decent, safe \nhomes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Senior \nCitizens Home Equity Protection Act. This bill will help protect low-\nincome seniors from being gouged by people who are charging them \nmassive and unnecessary referral fees when they receive a reverse \nmortgage through the Federal Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Insurance \nDemonstration Program.\n  The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Insurance Demonstration Program \nis a Federal program to benefit low- to moderate-income seniors that \nwas authorized by section 417 of the Housing and Community Development \nAct of 1987.\n  HECM provides an FHA guarantee for a special type of home equity loan \nfor homeowners who are 62 years of age or older. HECM permits a senior \ncitizen to borrow against the equity of his or her home. The senior \nreceives cash through a reverse mortgage by either: First, a lump sum \npayment, second, a lifetime guaranteed monthly payment, third, a line \nof credit, or fourth a combination of monthly payment and line of \ncredit. The HECM loan is repaid after the senior citizen passes away by \nhis or her estate.\n  Since the program's inception, approximately 20,000 loans have been \nclosed. HECM is a good program, because it permits low-income seniors \nwho are homeowners to be able to conveniently tap into their home \nequity. The median age of the participants is 76 years old and the \nmedian income level is approximately $10,000 a year.\n  Unfortunately, a few companies are calling up seniors to let them \nknow about the availability of HECM and then charging them a referral \nfee of 8 to 10 percent of the total loan. This is a scam, as the senior \ncould contact a lender or HUD directly and not have to pay such a fee.\n  The Senior Citizens Home Equity Protection Act responds to this \nproblem. This bill amends section 255 of the National Housing Act to \npermit HUD, which manages this Federal program, to define and prohibit \nexcessive referral fees for the HECM program.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill, and I commend Senator \nD'Amato for bringing this bill before us today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am an original cosponsor of the \nSenior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act because I do not believe we \ncan sit idly by while senior citizens are charged excessive and \nunnecessary fees for seeking to access the equity in their homes. It is \nan unconscionable practice.\n  The Senior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act provides basic consumer \nprotections for working people in their senior years who want to obtain \na reverse mortgage so that they may live with a level of economic \nsecurity. Reverse mortgages benefit people who have worked their entire \nlives, have managed to buy their own homes, but who do not have much \nextra income to live on after they retire.\n  Under a reverse mortgage, the owner of the home gives a lender a \nmortgage on the home. The homeowner receives either a lump sum of money \nor monthly payments in return. The funds do not have to be repaid until \nthe home is sold or the homeowner dies. The FHA's Home Equity \nConversion Mortgage Program guarantees these reverse mortgages.\n  This is a good program for some seniors and one which the Government \nsupports. Unfortunately, there are some who are taking advantage of \nseniors and charging them excessive fees to complete the reverse \nmortgage transactions, including fees of up to 10 percent of the loan \namount. The way these scams work is that mortgagors will offer to serve \nas financial advisors to senior citizens and then charge them \nexorbitant fees for providing the seniors with public information about \nthe HUD reverse mortgage program.\n  Those seeking a reverse mortgage generally do not have much income to \nspare. The average borrower is 76 years old and has an annual income of \n$10,400. Charging a $10,000 fee for a $100,000 reverse mortgage, as is \ndone, is highway robbery.\n  The Senior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act is not complicated \nlegislation. There are only two provisions. The first provision \nrequires that the senior has received ``full disclosure of all costs to \nthe mortgagor for obtaining the mortgage, including any costs of estate \nplanning, financial advice, or other related services.'' This will \nprovide seniors with the information they need to make sound judgments \nconcerning the value of the services they are receiving.\n  The second provision provides that the HUD secretary has the \nauthority to impose restrictions to ensure that a lender does not \ncharge excessive, or unwarranted costs to the borrower for providing a \nreverse mortgage. This is a basic protection that allows HUD to police \nthe bad actors who are ruining reverse mortgages as an option for too \nmany seniors.\n  HUD tried to address the problem, but a court ruled that the \ndepartment had to go through its normal procedure to issue a rule \ngoverning fees charged by the advisers. Formal rulemaking can take as \nlong as 6 or 7 months. We do not have 6 or 7 months. Every day seniors \nface the prospect of losing part of the equity in their homes because \nthese scams are allowed to continue. This legislation will put an end \nto the scams.\n  I thank Senator D'Amato for introducing this bill, I am proud to be \nan original cosponsor, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the Senior Home Equity Protection Act so that we can quickly \nenact this simple but crucial legislation.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I felt compelled to speak today on \nbehalf of S. 562 which I support as a cosponsor. It is a good bill and \napparently long overdue. This legislation provides protections to \nhomeowners who are receiving reverse mortgages by ensuring that there \nare no unnecessary or excessive costs charged for obtaining the \nmortgage.\n  I state that this bill is apparently overdue because of the \nhorrendous stories we have heard about the elderly being charged \noutrageous fees simply to find out information about the reverse \nmortgage program. Because the reverse mortgage program is only \navailable to individuals over 62 years of age, these so-called scam \nartists are preying on older citizens who typically are cash-poor and \nin need of additional dollars, sometimes for health care costs or home \nimprovements.\n  A reverse mortgage is a loan that works backwards. It is beneficial \nfor those who are house-rich but cash-poor. Instead of receiving a \nlump-sum amount that must be repaid in monthly installments, the \nhomeowner gets to borrow money based on the equity in his home and \nnothing has to be repaid until the owner moves or dies. When the home \nis sold, the loan, along with the accrued interest, is repaid from the \nproceeds.\n  Some of the estate planning companies who provide information on the \nreverse mortgage have been charging referral fees of up to 10 percent \nof the amount of the loan that is eventually taken out by the \nindividual. The exorbitant fees being charged are outrageous. These \ncompanies have been preying on our country's older citizens, and this \npractice must be stopped.\n  Just a few weeks ago, the Secretary of HUD, Andrew Cuomo, attempting \nto halt these practices, issued a departmental directive preventing \nlenders\n\n[[Page S3717]]\n\nwho insure loans through the FHA from dealing with the referral \ncompanies. However, just 10 days after the announcement of HUD's \ndirective, a Federal judge here in Washington set the directive aside \nawaiting further hearing. While some of the mortgage originators have \nindicated that they have stopped dealing with the estate planning firms \nby their own initiative, many of us in the Senate want better \nsafeguards.\n  Senate bill 562 ensures that the practice of charging exorbitant fees \nin the reverse mortgage program are halted by doing two things. One, \nthe bill requires that all fees and costs associated with the reverse \nmortgage program be disclosed to the homeowner. Two, the bill gives \nauthority to the Secretary of HUD to ensure that the homeowner does not \npay any unnecessary or excessive costs for obtaining the mortgage. This \nwould include any costs of estate planning, financial advice, or other \nrelated services. S. 562 does not set prices or products in the reverse \nmortgage program, it only acts as a safeguard from excessive costs.\n  I am proud to say that my State is home to the largest servicer of \nthe FHA reverse mortgage. Wendover Funding, a Greensboro based mortgage \nbanker, is the Nation's largest wholesale lender and administrator of \nthese loans. Wendover currently services more than 11,500 reverse \nmortgages, representing approximately 60 percent of the market. Of \nthese, Wendover has funded more than 400 loans to seniors in North \nCarolina.\n  Many believe that FHA's involvement provided much-needed consumer \nprotection to the reverse-mortgage industry. Lenders who make FHA-\nbacked loans have to abide by strict rules on rates and set-up fees and \ncan't charge any hidden fees to make extra money. Unfortunately, some \nof the estate planning companies who refer the borrowers to the FHA \nlenders have not had the same restrictions put upon them.\n  The several unscrupulous companies that have scammed thousands of \nunnecessary and exorbitant fees from elderly citizens have forced this \nCongress to act. The protections placed in S. 562 will ensure that \nsenior citizens are no longer taken advantage of when they are looking \nat this new source of income. Our grandparents, as they face longer \nyears of needed income and want to stay in their homes, will be able to \ndo so and still be protected.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I urge my colleagues support.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the Senior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act introduced by Senator \nD'Amato, and to thank Chairman D'Amato for moving so quickly in \nresponse to the needs of the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment in efforts to crack down on the exploitation of our \nvulnerable low-income senior citizens.\n  The Senior Citizen Home Equity Protection Act will assure that a \nhomeowner pursuing a HUD home equity conversion mortgage, or reverse \nmortgage, is not charged unnecessary or excessive costs for obtaining \nthat mortgage. The median age of reverse mortgage applicants is 76 \nyears. Most of these borrowers are very low-income, Social Security \ndependents, typically seeking additional funds for basic needs and \nmedical expenses. Information on the program and the application \nprocess is provided by HUD free of charge. Yet, some businesses have \nbeen convincing seniors of services and counseling required before \nreverse mortgages can be secured. Many of these middlemen charge up to \n10 percent for services that seniors do not realize are unnecessary.\n  S. 462 clarifies HUD's authority to appropriately restrict \nunnecessary or excessive costs related to the origination of a reverse \nmortgage. I believe it necessary to grant this regulatory authority to \nend fraudulent business activity so that legitimate business interests \ncan be protected and the loan program can remain a viable alternative \nfor seniors to turn to in the financial marketplace.\n  My State of South Dakota recently remedied State law to allow for \nparticipation in HUD's reverse mortgage program, at the urging of the \nSouth Dakota AARP and the South Dakota Bankers Association. While we \nhave been fortunate not to have felt the impact of these deceitful \nbusinesses in South Dakota, I am a strong supporter of this legislation \nto prevent the spread to my State, now that seniors can pursue these \nreverse mortgages.\n  Senator D'Amato worked closely with HUD Secretary Cuomo to ensure \nthat seniors can be protected while the viability of the loan program \nremains intact, and I urge my colleagues to support the Senior Citizen \nHome Equity Protection Act.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I know of no one else in the majority who \nseeks to speak to this issue. We would yield back all of our time.\n  Mr. DODD. On behalf, Mr. President, of Senator Sarbanes of this side, \nwe yield back this time as well.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe bill was passed.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3712-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me speak, if I might, to an issue of \ncritical national importance--an issue that has plagued the people of \nthe State of New York, most particularly those in Long Island. I am \ntalking about Nassau and Suffolk County, the communities of Long \nIsland. A major county is described legally as a county that has more \nthan 250,000 women, for the purposes of compiling these statistics. And \nthey are dreadful statistics because we are talking about the incidence \nof breast cancer. Long Island has had an unenviable position of being \nranked No. 1 in the incidence rates of breast cancer in years gone by.\n  It is incredible. As a result, the National Institutes of Health has \nundertaken a very comprehensive study, one of the first of its kind, \nwhich says we will look to see what environmental factors may be \ncontributing to these high rates of breast cancer. They are undertaking \nthat study. Some $5 million has been allocated. Mr. President, that $5 \nmillion is not enough, even though it is among the most sophisticated \nstudies being undertaken.\n  Recently, some very real questions have arisen as it relates to what \nimpact there may be as it relates to radioactive materials, radio \nnuclides, and other materials that may have gained entry into the \ngroundwater system, or that may, as a result of being dispersed in the \nair, some of these radioactive materials out in Brookhaven, Long \nIsland. What impact has this had, if any?\n  Indeed, it seems to me, if we were to spend $5 million, that is not \nan inconsequential sum. But one of the most comprehensive studies \nundertaken--this is a study that will take over 5 years; not to \ncomplete this study, addressing all concerns, as it relates to the high \nrate of breast cancer on Long Island, would be wrong. The scientific \ncommunity will not have completed its chore. And part of that is to be \nable to say to the public we have examined the situation.\n  Brookhaven National Lab--and it seems we may have an additional \nresponsibility--has been run under the aegis of the Department of \nEnergy. May I say here and now that it has been run abysmally as it \nrelates to the impact of its operation on the community.\n  Over the years, there has been a litany of abuses of burying of waste \nmaterials, hazardous waste, of creating almost a dump site of \nindifference to the operation of this lab where, indeed, the water \ntables have been impacted and have actually had radioactive materials--\ntritium--discharged; and the reports of leaks, and the reports of these \ndischarges have been systematically withheld from the public. The lab \nhas operated with an indifference to public health--``The public be \ndamned'' attitude. I commend the Assistant Secretary for Energy, who \nhas come in to look at what can be done to straighten this fiasco out. \nThe scientists have\n\n[[Page S3718]]\n\nbeen more concerned with the success of their project than they have in \nterms of what the operational impact is. You would think some of the \nworld's leading scientists would know that to even pose a threat to \ncontaminate the drinking water, the drinking supply system, is just \nunconscionable. Yet they have been there with total indifference.\n\n  So I mention this because there is a real reason why that study \nshould be expanded. The NIH has done an outstanding job with the funds \navailable. They have not had sufficient funds.\n  That is why it was last Wednesday I spoke to Senator Stevens, \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee. We are going to be \nundertaking a supplemental appropriations on this floor.\n  By gosh, let me tell you when we have disasters, we should take care \nof them. This is a disaster. We should see to it that there are the \nnecessary funds. Not only on Long Island, but we have another facility \nin Seneca, NY. It is a small community with an incredibly high \nincidence of breast cancer.\n  Why do I mention Seneca? There is very direct Government \nresponsibility because we operated a huge storage depot there for all \nkinds of materials, such as atomic, et cetera. Some of them are still \nclassified and are stored there. It has one of the highest rates of \nbreast cancer in the Nation. They should be included. The people of \nthat community should have a comprehensive study.\n  I have requested of Senator Stevens consideration that we increase \nthe NIH funding. We are not talking hundreds of millions. But we are \nasking, and I have asked him. Hopefully they will include some $15 \nmillion so that Long Island's study can be brought to a successful \nconclusion so that they can monitor the operation as it relates to \nwhether radioactive materials have had any impact on the groundwater \nand in the incidence of breast cancer and to the health of Long Island.\n  So whether it be Seneca, or whether it be my colleagues who seek \nfunding from other parts of the country, California, New Jersey, or \nwherever it might be, the State of Florida, where people would come and \nsay, ``We want to know. Are there environmental factors that are \ncontributing to the higher rates?'' We should be doing this.\n  I want to commend Senator Stevens for his looking at this. I hope \nthat we will all be supportive.\n  So it is not a question of us appropriating money just so that we can \ndo this for Long Island. I am concerned about that, and Seneca in \nupstate New York, but, indeed, the people of this Nation.\n  I can't think of a better allocation of resources than to use this to \nascertain with definitiveness with the best science available so the \ncommunities can raise their children with a piece of mind that there \nare hazards that can be avoided and are identified.\n  I just leave you with one chilling statistic as it relates to the 3 \nmillion people who live in Nassau County and Suffolk County. More than \nhalf of them are women. Women who live on Long Island for more than 40 \nyears are 70 percent more likely to come down with breast cancer than a \nwoman of comparable age, et cetera, and background who lives there for \n20 years. Why? That is why there are so many of us who think there are \nsome very real environmental factors that must be considered.\n  So I hope that all of my colleagues could support this increase of \n$15 million, which is a very modest sum, to expand the NIH; and, yes, \nto earmark for breast cancer research to ascertain what impact the \nenvironment may have in causing the higher incidence.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues for being so generous in \npermitting me the opportunity of making this presentation in morning \nbusiness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just returned from my home State of \nNorth Dakota. And I know my colleague has spoken as well about the \nchallenges that we are facing in North Dakota and in our region as a \nresult of the disasters that have occurred. I wanted to visit with my \ncolleagues and explain to those who watch these proceedings what is \nhappening in this State, and in this region.\n  North Dakota, as everyone knows who has watched the news in the last \ncouple of weeks, has been dealt about as tough a blow as you can deal a \nState or region with a series of tough storms, floods, and fires.\n  It is normally, for those who visit and especially those of us who \nlive there, a State blessed with enormous beauty and with sturdy, \ndetermined, and wonderful people. But for much of the past 6 months our \nState has been hit with some of the worst weather known to man. We have \nbeen hit with five to seven major blizzards, and additional minor \nblizzards, during this winter.\n  This photograph is of a farmer in North Dakota who stands on flat \nground. But as you can see, the snowdrift is somewhere around 15 to 18 \nfeet high on his farm. He sent me the picture just to demonstrate what \nkind of snow has come to his farm, and what these blizzards and winds \nhave done to him. These nine blizzards that we have seen have dropped 3 \nyears' worth of snow in North Dakota, and in 3 months. Anyone who knows \nabout North Dakota winters knows that we have some pretty difficult \ndays in the winter from time to time.\n  But when you give us 3 years' worth of snow, over 10 feet of snow in \na several-month period, that is an enormous quantity of moisture, and \nif that was not bad enough, that 3 years' worth of snow this winter \narrived after 4 straight years of rainfall that was far above normal. \nSo that snow fell on a ground that was already saturated. So when the \nspring thaw came, there was nowhere for melting snow to go.\n  Most Americans have now seen on the front pages of their newspapers \nand on their television sets and heard on radio news programs the \nresult of all this. Today I want to report to you on some of the things \nthat you may not have seen.\n  This is an aerial view of Harwood, ND. This is just a few miles north \nof Fargo, ND. This is land that is in the Red River Valley, some of the \nmost fertile land in our entire country. It is flat as a table top. \nThere is not a hill that you can see anywhere. And you can see what has \nhappened. This city of Harwood, incidentally, is one of the only cities \nthat built a little ring dike and you can see that this city is dry. It \nis a very small community but the flood is all around it. It gives you \nsome dimension of this flood. I have flown over the flood about three \nor four times in the last week or so and all you see are miles and \nmiles and miles of water. And you cannot see any evidence of a river. \nThe tiny river, which is the Red River, normally not very substantial \nat all, has now become a 200-mile lake.\n  I want to talk to you about the scope of the disaster. There isn't \nanything that I have seen, and I have seen a fair number of disasters, \nboth in North Dakota and around the country, that compares with it. It \nis deeper, it is wider and it is longer reaching with longer-term \nimplications than any I have ever seen, and it touches almost everybody \nand everything. The people who keep statistics on these things tell me \nthat about 20 percent of North Dakotans have been severely affected by \nthis ongoing disaster. The damage to property alone will likely exceed \n$1 billion and probably run into the several billions of dollars if you \ninclude all of the other ancillary problems that will result from this \nincluding preventing planting for agricultural crops and more.\n  Property damage is just one part of the story, and one of the reasons \nI have come to the Senate Chamber today is to say that even though we \nhave lost a staggering amount of property in these floods, much more \nthan property has been and is being destroyed. This is a challenge to \nour State and our region's economy that is unlike any other challenge I \nhave ever seen.\n  It is really a significant blow to an economy of a region in our \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S3719]]\n\n The disaster is, of course, in our cities but it is also on our farms. \nYou have seen the pictures of the cities and you perhaps know that \nGrand Forks, ND, the second-largest city with 50,000 people, is now \nvirtually a ghost town.\n  Two days ago, in the City of Grand Forks--and this picture, by the \nway, is a picture of one of the bridges. None of the bridges are usable \nin Grand Forks. All of the bridges are closed and most of them are \nunderwater. This is just before this bridge went underwater. But you \nwill see the Red River inundates all of the buildings on all sides of \nthe river.\n  Two days ago I was in a boat on the main street of Grand Forks, ND, \nwith the water, I would guess, up to a person's neck. I was not out \nstanding in it. I was in a Coast Guard boat. We ran over a car, as a \nmatter of fact, ran over the top of a car and did not know what we hit. \nWe knew we hit something with this Coast Guard boat, and we looked back \nand saw there was an antenna, a radio antenna of a car sticking out of \nthe water about 2 inches. That is how we knew we hit a car in this \nboat. Cars are under the water, submerged under the water on the main \nstreet of this town. And it demonstrates what this town faces. It is a \ncommunity of 50,000 people where there is no water, no sewer system, \nand no electricity in most of the town. Virtually all of the people \nwere evacuated during this flood.\n  So when you go through this community, you discover a town of 50,000 \npeople with no one home and most of the houses and businesses submerged \nor with water up to their windows, in some cases up to the eves \ntroughs. Most people have seen pictures of the destruction of this \ncity. And it is only one city, as you know.\n  We have seen the destruction of the downtown area of Grand Forks, \nwith a fire in the buildings which destroyed nearly a city block. This \nis a picture of the firemen in Grand Forks who were fighting the fire \nin waist-deep floods. I talked to the fire chief and to some firemen \nand almost nowhere will firefighters be confronted with standing in \nice-cold water, water up to their waist and their chest, water filled \nwith sewage, water filled with fuel, standing their trying to fight a \nfire, incidentally, without water in their fire hoses. Some of these \nvaliant firefighters were trying to fight a fire that was destroying an \nentire city block with fire extinguishers because that was all the \ntools they had at their disposal.\n  Well, you have seen the pictures of what occurred in downtown Grand \nForks. That is only part of the story. The other part of the story is a \npicture of North Dakota farms. This is a picture of a North Dakota farm \nand, of course, it looks like a picture of the Great Lakes. There is, \nindeed, a barn and a silo, but all of the rest of what is farmland now \nappears for all other purposes like a lake because it is all \nunderwater.\n  We have a substantial disaster on our farms. During all of these \nmassive blizzards and the flooding, farmers and ranchers in North \nDakota alone have lost over 150,000 head of cattle--150,000 head of \nlivestock dead from these storms.\n  By itself, that would categorize this winter as a pretty tough \nwinter, but there is much more. The damage to farm buildings, farm \nhomes, barns, and granaries from the most recent blizzard alone is \nestimated to be about $21 million, according to early estimates.\n  As you know, about 2\\1/2\\ to 3 weeks ago, just as the spring thaw \nbegan to occur and just as calving season began in North Dakota on our \nfarms and ranches, we were hit with a blizzard that dumped up to 20 and \nin some cases 24 inches of snow on our State, with 50 and 60 mile an \nhour winds and another whiteout blizzard where people could not see. Of \ncourse, now all of that is beginning to melt and it has caused, along \nwith all of the other moisture, the catastrophic flooding in our State.\n  This is another picture of what is farmland, probably land on which \neither wheat or sugar beets or potatoes are grown in the Red River \nValley. Now, we are at a time of the year when people should be in the \nfields with tractors and seeders, planting. Instead, their fields are \nflooded. We have 1.7 million acres under water at this point and much \nof those 1.7 million acres of flooded farmland will probably not be \nplanted this year at all. That is a very difficult blow to our \nagricultural economy.\n  Where oceans of wheat would wave in the wind, we now have oceans of \nwater this spring in the Red River Valley. And when the water does \nrecede, it is still going to take weeks to get into those fields. It is \ngoing to be touch and go as to whether much of them will be planted \nthis year.\n  Those are some statistics and images of the disaster with respect to \ndead cattle, inundated farm land, ravaged cities.\n  Much of the disaster is also taking place in our small towns. Towns \nlike Pembina and Drayton, and Harwood and scores like them in North \nDakota, all have had to fight these floods in 1997. In fact, in Pembina \nand Drayton right now as I speak the crest is just beginning. Up in the \nPembina area, they are fighting like the devil to try to save their \nhomes. They have been evacuated. They have had to abandon most of the \nsandbag lines, and it appears that this entire city will have to be \ncompletely evacuated, and whatever the flood does to Pembina it does to \nPembina. All of us are hoping and praying that that small community is \nable to get through this, but because of the evacuation we will not \nknow what the fate of Pembina, ND, is until the water is gone.\n  There is a meeting this weekend that President Clinton is hosting \nwith President Ford and President Bush and Colin Powell and others on \nthe issue of voluntarism. That meeting could probably learn a lot from \nthe last several weeks in North Dakota. The general who heads the Corps \nof Engineers told me that up and down the Red River Valley, in \nWahpeton, Breckenridge, Fargo-Moorhead, and on, he said he has never \nseen a more aggressive flood fight by people than he has in the Red \nRiver Valley this year. Thousands and thousands of people have decided \nto volunteer their time to be on sandbag lines and to do all of the \nthings that are necessary to help build dikes and try to fight this \nflood. So what I want to do is talk a little about the people in North \nDakota as well, and some of the real heroes in our State that we do not \nhear quite as much about.\n  I have described a little about all of these volunteers. I want to \ntalk a little about some of them as well.\n  I spoke in this Chamber one day some while ago after we had another \none of those whiteout blizzards in North Dakota, the kind that came \nraging in and no one could see their hand in front of their face. That \nis called a whiteout blizzard, the wind blowing 50 miles an hour and \nsnowing. You cannot see a thing. It is dangerous and takes lives and \nkills livestock.\n  I told them about a fellow named Don Halvorson, who is a farmer near \nGrafton, ND, and a woman named Jan Novak, who was going home from work \nat 10 in the evening. She drove into this whiteout blizzard outside of \nGrafton, ND, could not see, and pulled off the road and became stuck. \nThere she was at 10 or 11 at night in a desperate blizzard, \ntemperatures were way below zero with massive winds. And she told me \nthat she prayed and prayed and she worried very much that she may not \nsurvive this.\n  The county sheriff got a call from Jan Novak's husband who said that \nhis wife had not returned home and he was very worried about her being \nlost in the blizzard. The county sheriff began a search with members of \nlaw enforcement and they discovered that they could not search because \nthey could not see anything either. They could not be on the roads \nbecause there was no visibility. They began to call the farms up and \ndown the line where she might have driven, and they called a farm that \nwas operated by Don Halvorson and his wife. Don was in bed; it was 3 \na.m. They woke him up and asked him if he had seen Jan Novak. He did \nnot know her, of course. But they said she was out in this blizzard and \nhad not been heard from. And he, of course, said, no, he had not seen \nher, and he went back to bed.\n  He told me that he laid there but could not sleep, and so at 3:30 \na.m. he got back up. He bundled himself up, went out in this whiteout \nblizzard, got on his tractor that had a cab over it. And in his tractor \nwithout visibility beyond his front wheels he went up and down the \nroads looking for Jan Novak, for 3 hours. And at 6:30 in the morning \nJan Novak said she thought at that\n\n[[Page S3720]]\n\npoint she may not get out of this. And her head was bowed and she was \npraying in her car in the middle of this raging blizzard, and this Don \nHalvorson drove up in his tractor. She saw the tractor and this fellow \nwho did not know her but could not sleep at 3:30 in the morning because \nsomeone was out there, rescued her, saved her life. And she said if you \never think prayers don't matter, when I saw this fellow I didn't know \ndriving this tractor, risking his life in this blizzard to save mine, I \nnow understand about the power of prayer.\n  You do not hear so much about heroes these days, I suppose, but \npeople like Don Halvorson really deserve to be mentioned because they \ndo things for each other that save lives and make life better. And the \nonly way you can really survive in these tough times is to have people \nlike Don Halvorson and Jan Novak and others who care about each other.\n  Another hero is Jeff Differdin. He is a Valley City snow plow \noperator. During the blizzard just 3 weeks ago, Jeff drove his snow \nplow up and down interstate 94--the interstate had long been closed; \nnobody could see anything--searching for a car that had been stranded \nfor more than 6 hours. They were worried about the safety of the people \nin that car.\n  The visibility was so poor, he learned later that he once had driven \nwithin 8 feet of that car but couldn't see it in a whiteout blizzard. \nHe kept looking, kept looking, risked his life and finally found that \ncar and saved all of the occupants.\n  I was in Mandan, ND, and met the fellows who went out and saved a \nlittle boy in the middle of a raging blizzard, with a snowbank 15 feet \nhigh over a road. A little boy was suffering a severe and acute medical \nproblem and would have died from it had he not gotten to a hospital, \nexcept the problem was he was miles and miles and miles away from the \nhospital. And between him and the hospital, in a whiteout blizzard, was \na 15-foot snowdrift. Two ambulance crews and two road crews of \nvolunteers went looking for that boy. They plowed through from both \nsides of this 15-foot drift and got him out and got him to a hospital \nand saved his life. I talked about those folks a while ago on the floor \nof the Senate as well.\n  I would also like to talk just for a moment about the 27 members of \nthe Grand Forks Fire Department. I mean, they are real-life, big-size \nheroes of the last few weeks. That blaze that raged through downtown \nGrand Forks Saturday and Sunday, a lot of people don't know--they know \nthey fought a blaze, this fire department, under heroic conditions. A \nlot of people do not know, in those buildings, in the downtown that was \ndestroyed--and here is a picture of the firemen, you can see, fighting \nthe fire in water up to their waists, sewage-infested water, ice cold \nwater. An entire city block burned. I saw that block the other day from \na boat, sitting right in front of it. It looks like the pictures of \nDresden in World War II. These firemen saved the lives of 20 people, \npulled them out of those buildings and fought that fire for 16 hours in \ncontaminated, freezing water, so cold it was causing hypothermia.\n  They did not have, as some fire departments do, waterproof hip-\nwaders. That is not what they were standing in that water in. They did \nnot have, necessarily, all the right equipment. And they did not have \nwater to fight the fire with. One of those young firemen said to me, \n``You know, normally water is our ally. When we see a fire, as \nfirefighters, we know what we are going to do. Water is our ally. We \nwere standing in waist deep water and had no water to use.'' So they \nimprovised. A portable water gun was brought in and mounted on a nearby \nparking garage, and they fought it with that for a while and with their \nfire extinguishers. They had to hook up the water gun, groping around \nin the dark to find a fire hydrant. They plugged it in, and then the \nwater main failed, so they fought the fire with fire extinguishers.\n  Then they got big crash trucks in from the Grand Forks airport and \nfrom the Grand Forks Air Force Base on a flatbed trailer. It was raised \nup so they could bring it in through the water. One of the Grand Forks \nFire Department's own pumper trucks was brought in, hauled by a 5-ton \nNational Guard truck. At that point the firefighters finally began to \nmake some headway, after an entire block of downtown Grand Forks was \ndestroyed.\n  These folks fought that fire as beams were falling and bricks were \nfalling and crashing into the surging flood water that was raging \naround them. This flood water that they are in, I must tell you, the \ncurrent is so incredibly strong that when they go down an intersection \nand face the current, they have to crab a boat deeply into the \nintersection, just to get across the intersection. That describes the \ncurrent, and these folks were standing in that current fighting this \nfire. Even as they fought this fire by getting some helicopters to come \nin and dump some fire retardant chemicals on those burning buildings, \nthose firefighters were still there, underneath those helicopters, \nfighting that fire.\n  I cannot think of a more difficult set of circumstances in which \nsomeone would ever have to fight a fire, but they did, for 16 hours. \nThey limited the loss. Yes, they lost a city block and they lost some \nother buildings and they have had to fight other fires since, home \nfires in a city of 50,000 where no one lives and where homes had to be \nevacuated.\n\n  The Grand Forks Fire Chief, Richard Aulich, and 27 members of his \ndepartment, are people, I think, who an entire nation would say \nrepresent the finest in public service and heroism.\n  The more than 100 workers from the Corps of Engineers, public \nservants, Federal employees--more than 100 workers from the Corps of \nEngineers were waging flood fights in 80 locations up and down the Red \nRiver Valley.\n  There were also 11 people in the basement of a building in Grand \nForks who kept a telephone service working, a building that was flooded \nlike the rest of town. These 11 people stayed in that building 5 days \nto keep telephone service working. It was critical for public safety. \nThey are heroes, employees of U.S. West, who kept telephone service for \nthe FAA, for FEMA, for all the emergency workers. They kept it up and \noperating during that entire flood.\n  In Fargo, ND, in the middle of the night, Sylvia Hove's son-in-law \ndiscovered that the dike in her backyard was leaking and he put in a \ncall to the police department. He flagged down, actually, Fargo Police \nOfficer Lt. John Sanderson, and then Lt. Sanderson radioed for help. At \n4 in the morning, Sgt. Wayne Jorgenson and a number others showed up. \nThey had just completed working an exhausting shift. But rather than \ngoing home, they rushed to Mrs. Hove's home and they sandbagged \nfuriously at 4:30 in the morning on this ruptured dike and prevented \nthe dike from breaking. Eventually that dike broke and Sylvia lost her \nhome. I know Sylvia Hove. They fought a valiant fight. The point is, at \n4:30 in the morning when a leak developed, they put out a call and \npolice officers just finishing their shift rushed to that scene to help \nsandbag.\n  There are legions of heroes in North Dakota, fighting this battle \neven today, whose names we will not know and I cannot give here because \nthey are ordinary people who, in extraordinary times, demonstrated \nuncommon courage.\n  I want to mention the men and women at the Grand Forks Air Force \nBase. I have talked about how much a part they are of the community in \nGrand Forks. There is no better example of that than what they have \ndone. I was at the Air Force base where they have three hangars where \nevacuees from the city are living on cots, 1,000 people in each hangar. \nBut more than that, the people who live on the Air Force base have \nactually gone to the hangers and said, ``Come live in our homes,'' and \ntaken people into their homes. The day before yesterday there was a \nfarmer and his wife from Thompson, ND, 15 miles away, who were standing \noutside of the hangar. They said, we have come because we know there \nare evacuees. We have taken one family in and we have room in our home \nfor a second family and we have come to get them and offer them our \nhome. That's the kind of thing that was happening on the Grand Forks \nAir Force Base.\n  There are boys and girls from our high schools, junior high schools, \nsenior high schools and colleges, from all over the Red River Valley \nwho have worked their hearts out sandbagging, helping save their towns. \nThere is an 8-year-old girl and her 7-year-old brother who squatted on \nthe ground for 2 hours\n\n[[Page S3721]]\n\nat ``Sandbag Central'' in Fargo, holding empty sandbags open as the men \nand women filled those sandbags.\n  Two men from back East here, who were going to Montana to take new \njobs, heard the radio reports and diverted in North Dakota and showed \nup in Fargo and said they were there to help fight the floods, and they \nspent their days sandbagging rather than driving to the next job. There \nwere the women who baby-sat for free and caregivers and others, men and \nwomen, who helped other moms and dads with child care to fight the \nflood; employers who gave workers time off. The North Dakota colleges \nand universities--incidentally, who have dismissed for the year--made \ntheir facilities available for the flood fight.\n  What is happening here is North Dakotans and others who have come to \nour State have reached out and responded in this crisis. They have \nhelped sandbag. They have donated money and canned goods and clothes. \nAll of these efforts in their own way are heroic.\n\n  As I finish, again, 2 days ago, when I was in Grand Forks, ND, and I \ntook a boat tour of the downtown, a fellow who--President Clinton came \nto North Dakota on Tuesday. I appreciated it. It was a wonderful thing \nfor him to do and was a real morale booster for people who were \nterribly tired and fatigued but still facing this crisis. As I came out \nof this boat the day before yesterday, there was a fellow laying on the \ngrass in Grand Forks. The Coast Guard had just pulled him out. He had \nbeen in his home all of these days. When the evacuation order came, he \nwas stubborn. He said, ``I am not leaving my home.'' He was up there in \nthe second floor and would not leave. So for days he was there with no \nelectricity, no water, stuck in his home. He said, ``I saw this current \ngoing down the street. My home is flooded. I saw this current.'' He \nsaid, ``I saw dead cows come past my home. I saw telephone poles. I saw \nice jams the size of semi trucks come past my home.''\n  Then he said, ``You know, you really need to tell the President what \nis happening up here.''\n  I said, ``Sir, the President was just here yesterday.''\n  He said, ``You're kidding me.''\n  Of course, he had been out of radio contact with anybody and had no \nidea what was happening in his city, because he had been living in the \nmiddle of that flood.\n  The extraordinary spirit, I think, and the steady strength of North \nDakotans as they endure and persevere to meet this crisis is something \nthat all Americans will remember.\n  I want to close just with two requests.\n  Those who have written to my office and my colleagues' offices asking \nhow they can help--there are many ways they can help. Yesterday, \nsomeone sent a letter to my office with a check for $1,000 made out to \nNorth Dakota. What he said was 60 years ago, as a young man, this \nfellow had been helped by a North Dakotan. He said, ``I have never \nforgotten it, so I just want to pay North Dakota. I want to help North \nDakota. Please send this to the right place.''\n  This morning as I just left my office, a couple of other envelopes \nshowed up from people around the country saying, ``Can you get these to \nthe right place to help North Dakotans?'' What a wonderful thing it is.\n  I will just tell people, the Red Cross is doing wonderful work in our \nState, and the director of the Red Cross indicates they need help. The \nSalvation Army is, as always, doing wonderful work. And other \ncharitable organizations that do this kind of relief work do a great \ndeal of work in this kind of crisis. They just do a wonderful job. I \nencourage people to be supportive of them.\n  I ask, as the north part of North Dakota now and the Canadian \nprovinces who are, even this morning, evacuating, I believe 15,000 \npeople in Winnipeg, I ask the American people to offer their prayers of \nstrength and hope to the people who are continuing to fight this flood. \nThis region of the country will suffer the consequences of these \ndisasters for some long while. We have met with the President. We \nvisited again yesterday with President Clinton. We have been meeting \nwith appropriators. Congress, on a bipartisan basis, is working on a \ndisaster relief bill we will mark up on Tuesday in the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, of which I am a member. I think this Congress \nwill do what it has done in all previous disasters, extend the helping \nhand of our country to say to a region, North Dakota, South Dakota, and \nMinnesota, ``You have been dealt a tough blow, but you are not alone. \nThe rest of the country understands and is prepared to help, is \nprepared to help you recover and get back on your feet.'' That is part \nof the generous spirit of our country, to reach out and help others in \ntimes of need.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to express the common sentiment \nof the Senate, and that is the great respect and esteem we have for the \npeople of the Northwest in their great trials in this historically \nunprecedented flooding, and particularly to indicate how hard and \ntirelessly their Senators are working to make sure the people of \nAmerica respond to their needs--Senator Dorgan and Senator Conrad of \nNorth Dakota, Senator Daschle and Senator Johnson of South Dakota, \nSenator Wellstone and Senator Grams of Minnesota. So we are all \nadmirers of the great courage of the people of the West.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3718-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3721-S3722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE SENIOR CITIZEN HOME EQUITY PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. REED. I would like, if I may, to talk about Senate bill 562. I am \npleased the Senate took favorable action today. This legislation, the \nSenior Citizen's Home Equity Protection Act, would protect seniors from \nunscrupulous market activities of a very small group of business \npeople. We have, throughout the United States and through the auspices \nof HUD, introduced a program called the reverse mortgage program. This \nallows seniors who have their house mortgage paid off, they have all \nthe equity in the home, rather than selling the home to confront the \ncosts of being a senior, they are allowed through this program to \nessentially go to the bank and have a monthly or a lump sum payment in \nlieu of the equity in their home. This allows many seniors to stay in \ntheir homes. It allows them to meet the needs of health care and all \nthe pressing needs of seniors.\n\n  What has happened though is that a group of unscrupulous operators \nhave come in, under the guise of estate planning, and now are charging \nexorbitant fees to inform seniors of this reverse mortgage program, \nsometimes collecting up to $10,000. What is particularly alarming, \nindeed, and particularly reprehensible is the fact that all of this \ninformation is absolutely free from the HUD office in their locality.\n  So what this legislation proposes to do--I am so pleased it was \nfavorably responded to this morning--is to give HUD the authority to \nstep in with very, very stern measures to preempt these practices, to \nmove these unscrupulous operators out of the marketplace, and allow \nseniors to reap the full benefit of the reverse mortgage program.\n  In my State of Rhode Island, over 500 seniors have taken advantage of \nthe reverse mortgage program. In fact, we had our State program in \nplace before the Federal program was initiated. Much of the effort at \nthe Federal level has been led by the Assistant Secretary for Housing, \nNick Retsinas, who is a Rhode Islander and who in fact was a leader in \nRhode Island for this program. So we in Rhode Island understand very \nwell the effect and the efficacy of this program.\n  Our Rhode Island Housing and Mortgage Finance Corporation, RIHMFC, \nhas done a remarkable job promoting these programs and also a \nremarkable job of policing these programs because we have not seen any \nevidence in Rhode Island of these scandals. However, throughout the \ncountry, as I indicated before, these unscrupulous operators have tried \nto move in and take advantage of very vulnerable seniors.\n  We know so many seniors are house rich but cash poor. They have \nequity in their home but do not have the means to make ends meet each \nweek. This reverse mortgage program should help them. It should not be \nan opportunity to be taken upon or set upon by unscrupulous operators.\n\n[[Page S3722]]\n\n  In Rhode Island, for example, the Providence Journal reported a \ntypical story, that of George Tarbox and his wife. Mr. Tarbox and his \nwife were the perennial house rich and cash poor family. They purchased \ntheir home in 1958. They paid off the mortgage, but they were facing \nvery difficult circumstances. They were on a fixed income, like most \nseniors. And they needed the resources to simply live. The choice \nbetween eating and buying medicine is very difficult. The reverse \nmortgage program allowed them to meet their needs. They were able to \npay off their original mortgage. They were able to make their daily \nexpenses. They were able to get the proceeds and resources that they \nneeded to live. And this is just a typical story, a very, very good \ntypical story of the effectiveness of the reverse mortgage program.\n  Today, with action on S. 562, we are sending a very strong message \nout to those unscrupulous operators who might try to prey on seniors \nthat we are going to take a tough, tough hard stand. This program is \nthere. It is for seniors. It is not for speculators. It is for seniors. \nIt is not for those who prey on seniors. And it allows seniors to have \naccess, through their home, to the resources they need to lead lives of \ndecency and dignity.\n  I am so pleased with Senator D'Amato and Senator Mack for their \nleadership on this, and for my colleagues who joined in sponsoring this \nlegislation. I hope that it will move quickly through the Congress, the \nPresident will sign it, and we will give HUD the tools that it needs to \neradicate this detestable practice, and allow the seniors of America to \nfully enjoy what they have worked so hard for, their homes and the \nproceeds of their homes.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator suggest the absence of a \nquorum?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I do suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it is not my intention to \nuse the full 30 minutes, I say to any colleague who may be waiting or \nintending to speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3721-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SYMPATHY FOR FLOOD VICTIMS\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, first of all, I will \ncomment on the remarks made by the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota, Senator Dorgan, during the time that I was in the chair \nregarding the terrible tragedy of the floods in North Dakota, \nMinnesota, and the West. He did an outstanding presentation in terms of \nthe extreme acts of heroism that have taken place in that region of the \ncountry.\n  One of the great things about America and the American people is the \ncapacity that they have to reach back in times of great crisis--whether \nit be war, flood, earthquake, or whatever --and help their neighbors. \nCertainly, Senator Dorgan captured in great detail and with a great \npersonal touch that terrible tragedy. Of course, our hearts and prayers \nare with them as they go through this terrible time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3722-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Also, Mr. President, I want to comment on \na piece of legislation that two of my colleagues, Senator McCain, and \nthe Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, introduced regarding the \nprevention of the Government shutdown.\n  We went through this game, as you know, last year, and wound up \nhaving the Government shut down and innocent people, who were doing a \ngood job in their capacity working for the Government, were caught in \nthis whipsaw of conflict between the Congress and the President.\n  Senator Hutchison and Senator McCain have brought forth this \namendment, this idea, which essentially will see that that does not \nhappen. I am a bit surprised, given the amount of criticism that we \ntook from the President on the Government shutdown--he gave us most of \nthe blame, although he, I think, deserves equal credit, if you will--at \nthe opposition, stated opposition to this amendment by the President. I \nhope the President could support a proposal which eliminates the threat \nof a Government shutdown as we work toward getting a budget agreement.\n  Basically, it locks in place spending at last year's appropriation \nlevels until we do it, and not shut down the Federal Government. I hope \nthe President will reconsider that and endorse this proposal which I \nbelieve will be attached to the supplemental, and see that we do not \nhave a Government shutdown again, and that Congress and the President \nget together and do what the American people want them to do, which is \ncome to a budget agreement that balances the budget, that really \nbalances the budget by the year 2002--no smoke and mirrors--and that we \nget entitlement reform, we get some tax relief for the American people, \nand do it all.\n  If there is gridlock because we do not get that agreement, then the \npeople who are trying to run the Federal Government, from passing out \nthe Social Security checks to immigration, visas and so forth, that we \ndo not get those people again caught in that conflict.\n  I commend my colleagues for that and am pleased to be a supporter of \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3722-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3722-S3724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TERM LIMITS FOR FEDERAL JUDGES\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, earlier this week I \nintroduced a piece of legislation that no doubt will create some \ndiscussion, if not controversy, around the country. It involves the \nterm limits for judges--Federal judges.\n  This is something that, of course, would change the Constitution, so \nit would be a constitutional amendment. For over 200 years we have had \nlifetime appointments for judges, so I did not expect to have 100 \nSenators and all Members of the House, and everybody writing in, all \nover America, supporting this proposal, as soon as I introduced the \nproposal.\n  However, I do hope, as people think about it and carefully consider \nit, they begin to realize how important I think this change to our \nConstitution would be. I think, frankly, Jefferson and Hamilton would \nsupport the amendment if they were here today, because if they could \nlook back on history and see what has happened in the Federal \nJudiciary, I think they would agree with me it is time we put term \nlimits on judges.\n  Senator Shelby of Alabama has joined me in this effort. We call it \nSenate Joint Resolution 26. It is a constitutional amendment for term \nlimits for judges. When I introduced the amendment a couple of days ago \nI did not have the opportunity, because of debate on the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, I did not have the opportunity to make a few \nremarks. I want to take this time to do that.\n  Mr. President, the Framers of our Constitution intended that the \njudicial branch, which was created by article III in the Constitution, \nwould have a limited role. That was their strong belief, that the role \nbe limited, and that they be an equal partner in the three parts of our \nGovernment. They believed in the necessity of judicial restraint, and \nthey recognized, and said so, the danger of judicial activism.\n\n  Now, in Federalist No. 48, James Madison wrote that to combine the \njudicial power with executive and legislative authority would be the \nvery definition of tyranny. Madison's own words--``The very definition \nof tyranny.'' To repeat, to combine the judicial power with executive \nand judicial authority would be the very definition of tyranny.\n  Thomas Jefferson said, ``The very notion that the Supreme Court \nshould have the final word on constitutional questions is a very \ndangerous doctrine, to consider the judge as the ultimate arbiters of \nall constitutional questions.'' He also said, ``It is one which would \nplace us under the despotism of an oligarchy,'' meaning government of \nthe select few. Very interesting that Jefferson and Madison, of all \npeople, would be saying that.\n\n[[Page S3723]]\n\n  It is interesting to look at the debate as the Constitution was \nwritten. Some people like to decide what they think the intent of the \nFounding Fathers was as we look at these court decisions that have been \nmade over the past couple hundred years, but it is interesting to look \nat what they said. Sometimes what they said, what they actually said, \nthe Founding Fathers, and what other people think they meant are not \none and the same and are totally different.\n  Another founder, in Federalist No. 78, Alexander Hamilton, argued \nthat the judicial branch ``will always be the least dangerous to the \npolitical rights of the Constitution. Courts have neither force nor \nwill but merely judgment, and can take no active resolution whatever.''\n  That was Hamilton.\n  Even as he advocated the ratification of the Constitution, and he was \none of the strongest advocates as the Federalist Papers prove, he also \nissued a warning. The courts, he said, must declare the sense of the \nlaw. If they should be disposed--they being the justices, the judges--\nto exercise will, will, instead of judgment, the consequence would \nequally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the \nlegislative body.\n  So, what a judge's personal view is, what his or her pleasure is in \nterms of a decision is irrelevant, is not the issue. It is what the \nbest judgment in terms of the interpretation of the Constitution is. \nMr. President, 200 years after Alexander Hamilton issued this warning, \nit is abundantly clear that the abuse of judicial power that he feared \nhas become a reality. If Hamilton were here today, I believe he would \nbe the first to recognize it.\n  Instead of applying law as they find it in a neutral manner, which is \na judge's role, exercising what Hamilton called their judgment, \nactivist judges are in effect substituting their own policy views, in \nwhat Hamilton called their will, for the policies established by the \npeople through their elected representatives in the political branches \nof the Government.\n  Now, Mr. President, I have been in the Congress for 13 years and I \nhave thought a lot about this. Thirteen years ago I thought about \nintroducing an amendment to do this, but I did not. I sat back and \nsaid, Maybe this will change, maybe I am wrong. Maybe Hamilton was \nwrong. Maybe it is not as bad as I think. The truth of the matter is, \nit is worse than I thought.\n  Finally, the last 2 or 3 weeks I finally made up my mind that the \ntime has come, and I think there is a lot of proof to show and to \ndemonstrate that the time has come. Let me give some examples, and this \nis not meant in any way to impugn the integrity of the three justices \nthat I will mention. They were fine individuals who acted as they saw \nfit to interpret the Constitution. I want to make a point here. \nJustices Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun have all taken their personal \nopposition to the death penalty and read it into the Constitution.\n\n  Now, the Founding Fathers discussed capital punishment as they wrote \nthe Constitution. They mentioned capital punishment in the \nConstitution. The death penalty is explicitly mentioned and its \nconstitutionality is unquestionable in the due process clauses of both \nthe 5th and 14th amendments to the Constitution. Yet, these three \nJustices rendered decisions time and time again because of their \npersonal opposition to the death penalty. Whatever anyone's view is of \nthe death penalty is not relevant when a matter comes before the Court, \nif the intent of the Founders and the Constitution itself says that the \ndeath penalty is constitutional. What a personal view is--for or \nagainst it--is irrelevant. Yet, decisions were made because of their \npersonal opposition to the death penalty. That is judicial activism.\n  Evidently taking their cue from Supreme Court Justices who feel free \nto ignore the plain meaning of the Constitution, judges on the Federal \ncourts of appeals have also engaged in what amounts to legislating from \nthe bench.\n  More examples:\n  Two U.S. courts of appeals--the ninth and the second circuits--have \ndiscovered in the post-Civil War 14th amendment a heretofore unknown \nconstitutional right to physician-assisted suicide. They have just \ndiscovered this.\n  Now, that is a pretty bizarre reading of the 14th amendment that \nsimply cannot be justified by the language, it cannot be justified by \nthe meaning, and it cannot be justified even by the history of the \nconstitutional provisions in question. Yet, the ninth and second \ncircuits, two U.S. courts of appeals, have discovered that, now, in \nthis post-Civil War 14th amendment, we now have a constitutional right \nto physician-assisted suicide. Where does it say that in the \nConstitution? It doesn't matter to these judges whether it says it or \nnot. Likewise, Federal district judges have repeatedly abused their \nauthority by blocking the implementation of entirely constitutional \nmeasures enacted through State ballot referenda simply because they \ndisagree with the policy judgments of the voters. Now, again, that is \nnot the role of a Federal judge. Just since 1996, a single Federal \ndistrict judge, who had been an activist with the ACLU before going on \nthe bench, blocked the implementation of the California civil rights \ninitiative. However you feel about the initiative, for or against, \nisn't the issue. The California voters passed it in the State. Earlier \nthis month, in reversing the judge's order, the U.S. Court of Appeals \nmade the compelling comment that ``A system which permits one judge to \nblock, with a stroke of a pen, what 4,736,180 State residents voted to \nenact as law, tests the integrity of our constitutional democracy.''\n  Who said that, because a judge is appointed to a court of the Federal \nGovernment, they are omnipotent, that they are flawless, that they are \nperfect? I don't recall that in the Constitution. I don't recall that \nin the discussions of the Founders. Judges are human beings, and they \ncan be wrong. Consider the Dred Scott case in 1857, if you think judges \nare perfect. There will be some out there, probably from the American \nBar Association, who will notify me over the weekend, or on Monday, \nthat they are, because I am sure they are opposed to this amendment. \nBut in 1857, the Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney was sitting on \nthe Court when a black former slave by the name of Dred Scott tried to \nbring a case before the Supreme Court for his freedom. Taney wrote the \ndeciding majority decision, and he said Dred Scott couldn't sue in \nFederal Court because he was ``property,'' not a human being. Now, was \nthat Justice right in that decision? No, he was not right, but he did \nit and there was no recourse because he was a lifetime appointee.\n  There are many more examples, Mr. President, of activist judges who \nhave taken control of prisons and school districts. There was the \nfamous Kansas City case, where a judge raised the taxes of the city of \nKansas City to pay for school busing. Activist judges have ordered tax \nincreases, and they have created new rules to protect criminal \ndefendants that result in killers, rapists, and other violent criminals \nbeing turned loose to continue to prey on society.\n  Almost every time you hear about some horrible murder, a violent \ncrime against another member of our society, almost every time, if you \nread below the headline, you will find that this person was out on \nparole, or was released by a judge and given a second chance. He \nprobably had a difficult childhood, so we have to give him another \nchance to kill or rape somebody else, or beat somebody else up, or \nabuse some child. We have to give him a third chance and a fourth \nchance. Time and time and time again, over the last 30, 40 years, these \njudges have put these animals back on the street to prey on us and prey \non us and prey on us. But they are perfect, these judges--lifetime, no \ntouch; you can't do anything about it. It is time, Mr. President, that \nwe stop it.\n  Former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese estimates that over 100,000 \ncriminal cases each year cannot be successfully prosecuted because of \nthese court-created rules. You can't even prosecute some of these \npeople because of these rules. Judicial activism has become such a \nsevere problem that one of the leaders of the House, Representative Tom \nDeLay of Texas, has even suggested that we ought to consider using the \nconstitutional power of impeachment to remove activist Federal judges \nfrom office.\n  Now, I understand Congressman DeLay's concern. It is a justifiable \nconcern, but I think there is a better way to do this, which is to \nlimit their terms--limit their terms. That way,\n\n[[Page S3724]]\n\nafter a Federal judge has served 10 years--and that is what my \namendment does, limit the term to 10 years--if the President wants to \nreappoint a judge who does some of these horrible things I have talked \nabout, and that person can get through the Senate confirmation process, \ngood luck. But at least we would have had the opportunity, as the \nelected representatives of the American people, to say, hold on, this \nperson has made decisions that are ridiculous and we are not going to \ntolerate it.\n  The term limits for judges amendment would end the life tenure for \njudges on the district court, circuit courts, and the Supreme Court--\nall three levels of the Federal judiciary. They would be nominated by \nthe President, and with the advice and consent of the Senate they would \nbe appointed for 10-year terms. They could be reappointed. The good \nthing about this proposal, Mr. President, is that no President of the \nUnited States would have the opportunity to reappoint a judge because, \nas we all know, the President's term is limited to two terms, 8 years. \nHe or she could also serve up to an additional 2 years of a President \nwho left office, if that person were the Vice President. So the maximum \nthey could serve would be 9 years and 364 days. Therefore, that same \nPresident would not have the opportunity to reappoint a judge.\n  Now, my amendment does not remove current judges from office--we do \nhave a grandfather clause--but it would get things started, and we \nwould begin to have this opportunity to see some change.\n  Activist judges are routinely violating the separation of powers by \nusurping legislative and executive powers. This is a widespread abuse \nof judicial authority, and it is serious enough to warrant a \nconstitutional response. Term limits for judges would establish a check \non the power of activist judges, and no longer could they abuse their \nauthority with impunity. Under the term limits for judges amendment, \njudges who used their offices by imposing their own policy views, \ninstead of interpreting the laws in good faith, could be passed over \nfor new terms by the President, or rejected for reappointment by the \nSenate if the President persisted in offering the name up.\n  The term limits for judges amendment would make the President and the \nSenate more accountable to the people for their judicial selections. \nNow, you are going to hear the argument--and probably many listening to \nme now are already thinking it--that ``this is just going to interject \npolitics; politics is now going to be in all the court decisions, and \nall judges are going to make decisions based on politics so they can be \nreappointed.''\n  Stop and think about that argument. If a judge is good and if a judge \nis honest and has integrity and makes a decision in his or her mind \nbased on what is right, under the Constitution, if that's the case--and \nI would think that all of us would like to think that every judge fits \nthat mold--but if that's the case, then, why would a judge make a \ndifferent decision if that judge knew they were only going to be there \nfor 10 years or life? What difference does it make? The point is, if \nthey are good and they think it is a right decision under the law, then \nyou make your decision whether you are going to be there 1 day or 100 \nyears. What difference does it make?\n  The opposite has happened, Mr. President. What has happened now is \nthat judges, knowing that they can't be touched, knowing that they have \na lifetime appointment, are now making decisions that are political. \nThey are imposing their will upon the American people, rather than \nactually judging the Constitution and interpreting the Constitution as \nthe Founding Fathers suggested.\n  With all due respect to the criticism, the modern-day judiciary is \ntoo independent and too unaccountable to the taxpayers and to the \npeople who pay their salaries and pay for their courthouses all over \nAmerica. They are insulated by life tenure and free, for all intents \nand purposes, from any threat of impeachment. You have to commit a high \ncrime to be removed from office as a Federal judge; we all know that. \nVery few judges in history have had that happen.\n  These activist judges, because of almost impunity, feel free to \nimpose their political will on all of us, without having to answer to \nanybody. I believe that judges appointed for 10-year terms would be far \nmore likely to follow that law rather than imposing their political \nwill. The best way to go for a judge serving a 10-year term, who would \nlike to serve another 10, would be to follow the law and not his or her \nown political agenda. Follow the law. That is what we put you on the \nbench to do, to follow the law. That applies to a conservative judge as \nwell as a liberal judge. No conservative agenda, no liberal agenda. \nFollow the law. If you follow the law, you will get reappointed. If you \ndon't follow the law and you follow your agenda, you don't.\n  It is interesting, when you talk to those who oppose this amendment, \nthey are very aggressive in saying, ``Well, these judges are fine \npeople and you are impugning the integrity of judges.'' There will \nalways be--unless Congress changes it--nine slots on the Supreme Court. \nThe world is not going to come to an end if one judge leaves and \nanother takes his or her place. We are not irreplaceable. So that is \nnot a valid argument. It is very bogus. If one judge leaves--or if it \nis the Supreme Court, one Justice leaves--another judge or Justice \ntakes his or her place.\n  So what? It doesn't have to be the same person for life making these \ndecisions.\n  So, Mr. President, I just want to notify my colleagues that I welcome \ntheir support. I don't expect the door to be beaten down over the next \nfew days. But I am going to be very, very aggressive and very, very \npersistent in taking this case to the American people that it is time \nfor a change in our Constitution. No one wants to amend the \nConstitution unless it is absolutely necessary. But I think if every \nAmerican citizen would look at what has happened with some of these \noutrageous judicial decisions by activist judges who have gone far \nbeyond what the intent of the Constitution was, they would recognize \nthat it is time for a change.\n  Hamilton said it, Madison said it, and Jefferson said it; three \npretty distinguished Founding Fathers, if I do say so myself. They \nwarned us. I read for you their quotes. We know how they felt.\n  I think it is time that we pursue this. I intend to take this case to \nthe American people because I have seen polls on this that indicate \nthat over 85 percent of the American people support term limits for \njudges. We have term limits for the Presidents. A lot of people favor \ntrying to pass term limits for Members of Congress. Why not term limits \nfor judges? Why does the world come to an end, and why does \nconstitutional democracy of the United States of America come to an end \nbecause we don't have lifetime judges? That is ridiculous. The argument \nis silly.\n  The Founding Fathers warned us on the possibility of this. And some \nwill say, ``OK. Why didn't they put in the Constitution that we have \nterm limits?'' Because they could not possibly imagine what judges \nwould have done in the past 200 years.\n  But I guarantee that if Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison could vote \ntoday they would be voting for this amendment, and they would be \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3722-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3724-S3725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, Samuel Johnson said that ``Adversity has \never been considered the state in which a man most easily becomes \nacquainted with himself.''\n  On April 7, Arch L. Madsen, a remarkable broadcast pioneer, died at \nthe age of 83 in Salt Lake City. Arch's contributions to the world of \nradio and television were made all the more noteworthy by the \nformidable personal challenges he overcame. In rising above adversity \nwith the help of an extraordinary woman, his wife Peggy, Arch \ndiscovered the potential within himself that only she and God knew \nexisted.\n  The half-century public career of Arch Madsen is a matter of record. \nHe was president of KSL radio and television stations, founder and \npresident of the Bonneville International Corp. media empire, and an \ninfluential member of national and international bodies fighting for \nfreedom of speech. He was appointed by President Reagan to the nine-\nmember Board for International Broadcasting overseeing the operations \nof Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. It was Arch's dream that truth \ncarried on airwaves across the Iron Curtain would lead those on the \nother side finally to throw off the yoke of totalitarianism. He lived \nto see his dream fulfilled in Europe.\n  For the inspiring story of Arch's private world we are indebted to \nhis son, Erik H. Madsen, who spoke at the funeral on April 12.\n  I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from Erik's remarks be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the excerpts were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Remarks of Erik H. Madsen\n\n       I spoke at my mother's funeral, and I thought that was \n     fair. I didn't think that I would be speaking at my father's \n     funeral. But I've always done every reasonable thing that \n     he's asked me to do. And so I'm here at his request.\n       I am well qualified to speak about him, because I probably \n     knew him as well as anybody still living. I am his oldest \n     child and he was a master of delegation. Therefore I have \n     been his servant, and slave and gofer longer than any other \n     living person. There is a saying that no man is a hero to his \n     valet. But my father was a hero to his gofer. . . .\n       He used to tell me that when he met my mother, he was a \n     totally defeated and broken man. And I believe that he was.\n       His physical handicaps have already been mentioned. He had \n     polio at the age of five, and this made him physically weak \n     in general.\n       He was emotionally scarred. He grew up in almost a frontier \n     situation, on a farm, where he was expected to do the work of \n     a normal person. And often, he had very little power to do \n     it.\n       He was educationally disadvantaged. He had a high school \n     diploma and two quarters at BYU. But he confessed to me that \n     when he was a senior in high school, they had called him into \n     the office and encouraged him not to seek any further \n     education. Nevertheless, he persisted and went to the BYU. \n     When he was dismissed from the BYU for his inability to pay \n     his tuition, he was again told by the representative of the \n     college that he was really not college material and that he \n     should focus his life on manual labor. However, being \n     extremely weak, he found that focus impossible to pursue.\n       Because he had been somewhat shunned by his peers and \n     frequently persecuted by them, his skill lay mainly in \n     occasionally clowning. And I think this may have developed \n     later in life into his remarkable flamboyancy. But, he was \n     uncomfortable in society.\n       And he was destitute. Shortly after my mother met him, he \n     was admitted to the county hospital for malnutrition, because \n     he couldn't earn enough money to buy the food he needed for \n     adequate nutrition. He dressed in worn out overalls--the \n     clothing of a destitute person.\n       His career aspirations were limited. He knew how to build \n     radio sets. And so, he thought that he might become some kind \n     of low level radio technician.\n       His religious faith was broken. He believed in God. But he \n     felt so inferior that he didn't think that he would ever be \n     able to do enough to qualify for God's love.\n       It was in this condition, while he was working as a janitor \n     in one of my mother's father's businesses, that she met him. \n     If we were to meet him today, as he was then, we would think, \n     ``This is truly an oddball. He is a nerd. He just doesn't fit \n     into normal society at all. He is one of those physically \n     weak, mentally weak souls, who has come here with a defective \n     mind and a defective body. He's not going to live very long. \n     And it's going to be sad.'' That's what we would have \n     thought.\n       No one could understand what my mother saw in him. On their \n     first date, all he could think to do was to talk about how to \n     build radio sets. So, he taught her how to build radio sets. \n     And we still have a drawing on a napkin which she saved from \n     their first date, showing his explanation to her of a radio \n     circuit.\n       On their second date, he talked about how it might be a \n     good thing for her to look into the LDS church. He told her \n     that he really couldn't get too involved himself because he \n     was not good enough. But he told her that she might get \n     involved, and perhaps find someone else who would be suitable \n     for her to marry in the temple.\n       My mother saw that if she married my father she would have \n     to give up her family's approval and wealth, which would have \n     provided her with a lifetime of leisure and security. But she \n     said that she saw qualities in him that interested her. He \n     seemed to be a hard worker, to work long and diligently, and \n     she thought she could totally trust him. She believed that he \n     would be faithful to her for his life, that he would be \n     faithful to his marriage vows.\n       When they were married, things looked bad for them. No one \n     thought their marriage would even last. How could my mother \n     give all this up? And how could my father earn enough to \n     provide for two people, when he couldn't even provide for \n     himself. . . .\n       There are four themes of my father's life that I would like \n     to briefly illustrate. They were important to his success.\n       The first theme is about the technician. My father was a \n     man who solved electronic problems. The key to his progress \n     was that first, he never stopped studying about how the \n     physical laws worked, and later about how political, economic \n     and social laws worked. How the world worked. But he always \n     felt outclassed by those with a far better education. And so \n     he had discovered a secret weapon--he would pray. And he \n     would pray like nobody else. He would continuously and \n     obsessively pray until I think he did weary the Lord. And \n     then it was given to him to know the answer, which usually \n     came to him in terms of seeing something. He often saw far \n     beyond that thing, far, far into the future. Not everything \n     that would happen, but just a laserlike view. He usually saw \n     something technical.\n       An example of this occurred when I was 8 years old and I \n     didn't really think much about it at the time, but I \n     remembered it and I even wrote it down. He had asked me to \n     build a crystal set. And when I finally got it right (because \n     you see he gave me the directions and said build it and left) \n     it worked. And I asked him, ``How does it work?'' And he \n     said, ``The electrons have to run through certain patterns in \n     order to receive the signal. There are patterns inside the \n     crystal which make them do this.'' And I asked him, ``What \n     are the patterns?'' And he said, ``We don't really know what \n     they are, but they are probably like the patterns we make \n     with our tubes, and resistors, and wires.'' And then he said \n     something else. He said, ``Someday men will put patterns in \n     crystals. They will be far more complex than any patterns we \n     can find in a natural crystal. We'll put whole radio \n     receivers and television receivers into one tiny crystal.'' \n     And I said, ``Why do you think this?'' And he said. ``I \n     prayed about something a little different from this and then \n     I saw it. It will certainly happen.'' And I said, ``When?'' \n     And he said, ``Probably in your lifetime, but I'm not really \n     sure. When I see into the future, I can't tell exactly how \n     far I've seen. So, it could be anytime.'' I forgot about this \n     experience until the transistor was invented and then, I \n     guess what you'd call the computer chip appeared. And I \n     remembered everything he'd said about the crystal.\n       And so this theme of my father's life is sort of a \n     testimony of the power of prayer, at least to me. And of the \n     reality that God answer prayers and inspires men to see and \n     know things which would normally be invisible and unknowable. \n     This is one of the great gospel truths which enabled my \n     father to succeed. Many people throughout the world have \n     wondered at his vision. It wasn't his vision. I mean, it \n     wasn't his IQ. He received it from a higher source.\n       The second theme is love. My father attributed all his \n     successes to my mother. We often talked about why this was \n     so. He always said, ``When I knew that your mother loved me \n     and believed in me, my view of the world changed. I decided \n     to do everything I could to live up to her love and faith in \n     me. I decided to believe that God loved me too. I decided to \n     love myself, and to be as good as I could be, and to do all \n     the good that I could in this world.''\n       The scriptures indicate that God personifies love. John \n     said ``Let us love one another,\n\n[[Page S3726]]\n\n     for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God \n     and knoweth God.'' (1 John 4:7-8).\n       So, my father learned to know God because of the love of \n     one other person. It's a great example. We all could help \n     each other in this way. My father loved my mother. He loved \n     the Lord and the church and many people of many creeds and \n     nationalities. And many of the honors that have come to him \n     have come because he just reached out to these people.\n       The third theme is: My father included people. He tried to \n     understand them, communicate with them, and bring them into \n     involvement with all of the good things that he could.\n       My mother told me a story which illustrates this theme in \n     an unusual way.\n       At the conclusion of a meeting of the Interamerican \n     Association of Broadcasters in South America, there was a \n     celebration of the achievements and agreements which had been \n     accomplished. The principal participants were broadcasting \n     leaders from Catholic countries. They were all Roman \n     Catholics. They were standing in a circle, and each of \n     them was given a large cup filled with strong, alcoholic \n     drink. Each man in turn proposed a toast and then drank \n     the whole cup. There were no substitute drinks available. \n     As the turn worked its way around to my father, my mother \n     thought, ``What can he do but refuse?'' It would have been \n     easy for him to say, ``I am a member of the Church of \n     Jesus Christ, and we do not consume alcohol.'' The other \n     participants would certainly have understood. But it would \n     have put a little chill, a little distance between my \n     father and his colleagues. And remember, he wanted to be \n     included and to include them. Instead, when the turn came \n     to him, he proposed a toast just like everyone else. Then \n     he poured a little bit of the drink into his hand and \n     sprinkled it on his head. Then he said, ``I baptize myself \n     with our toast.'' This made perfect sense to all of them \n     because that is the way there were all baptized. They all \n     laughed, and slapped him on the back, and hugged him, and \n     gave him ``abrazos'' which is what they do.\n       By seeing life from their Catholic point of view, he had \n     accepted them, and he had accepted their toast, and he had \n     still kept the word of wisdom. So, he had a certain way of \n     including others.\n       In every business that he managed, he tried to include as \n     many employees in the process of continuing education and \n     training and career advancement as he could. He believed in \n     his own personal growth and he included those he worked with \n     in growth. He offered them opportunities to participate in \n     seminars and conferences, to implement the things that they \n     had learned, and to advance and grow in their careers.\n       He involved himself and included many others in worthwhile \n     charitable, humanitarian, economic and civic associations.\n       Even his vigorous efforts to communicate the benefits and \n     blessings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints \n     were expressions of his desire not to prove something, but \n     just to include others in one of the very best things in his \n     life.\n       I suppose that this theme of including others is really \n     just an extension of the theme of love that we talked about \n     before. But it is a special kind of love that we need a lot \n     more of in this world. And my father was a good example for \n     us to follow.\n       The fourth theme is that of commitment and hard work. My \n     father always gave 100 percent effort. He was always fully \n     committed to that which he believed in. He was an exhausting \n     person. He totally exhausted my mother and all of his \n     children. He exhausted his co-workers.\n       And, by the way, he was not a physically strong man. It was \n     the power of his spirit that exhausted us all. His spirit \n     picked up his body and carried it around.\n       A little story illustrates this. When I was away at \n     college, occasionally my father would come through town, and \n     he would invite me to go to lunch or dinner. Once he showed \n     up for lunch with two tired looking younger men who \n     introduced themselves as follows: ``I'm John Doe. I'm Mr. \n     Madsen's morning assistant. I work with him from 5 AM to 2 \n     PM''. The other said, ``I'm Jack Doe. I'm Mr. Madsen's \n     afternoon assistant. I work with him from 2 PM to 11 PM.''\n       Noticing that they looked tired, I asked them how they were \n     holding up. John Doe said that they were trying very hard. \n     They were trying very hard to talk my father into getting a \n     third man. Because they just couldn't keep it up much longer.\n       No one could ever wonder about my father's commitment. Now \n     this wasn't all good. He was a workaholic. And his life was \n     quite out of balance. It was hard on him. And it was hard on \n     the people around him. But it was the only thing he knew. \n     Remember, he thought he was worthless. And he never thought \n     he had done enough. So he just kept trying to do enough. And \n     no one could ever wonder about his commitment.\n       It is written in the Book of Revelation: ``I know thy \n     works, that thou art neither hot nor cold. I would that thou \n     wert cold or hot. So then, because thou art lukewarm and \n     neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth.'' \n     (Revelation 3:15,16)\n       In other words, the Lord will reject the half-hearted \n     worshiper.\n       My father, Arch Madsen, flamboyant, impetuous, out of \n     balance, and racing almost out of control everyday of his \n     life, lived a life that was hot. It was incandescently hot.\n       These illustrations show a few of the themes of my father's \n     life. There are many other themes, important ones, which we \n     cannot discuss today. Some examples are:\n       He was gracious in victory;\n       He was gracious in defeat;\n       He was kind to his enemies;\n       He always looked for blessings and opportunities in the \n     disaster of his life. He tried many things and failed often. \n     In a way, his life could be viewed as a series of \n     tribulations and disaster, which turned into blessing as he \n     struggled with them and as the Lord helped him.\n       This is not to say that he was perfect. He had glaring \n     weaknesses and flaws. We just don't want to talk about them \n     today.\n       But these four positive themes we have talked about today \n     communicate to me two testimonies.\n       The first is a testimony to the love and faith and courage \n     that he had. The love and faith and courage of a week, \n     severely handicapped person. A person who, seeing the \n     hopelessness of his situation, once he knew that he was \n     loved, once he knew that somebody loved him and that God \n     loved him, didn't do the rational thing, the prudent thing. \n     Instead of giving up, he impetuously attacked, and he never \n     stopped.\n       The second testimony is now amazing it is what the Lord can \n     do through the life of even the humblest, weakest, most \n     handicapped person--if that person will try to live the \n     gospel with all the energy that is in him, each and every day \n     of his life.\n       In the Doctrine and Covenants it is written, ``Behold, the \n     Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind, and the willing \n     and obedient shall eat the good of the land of Zion in these \n     last days (D 64:34).\n       Arch Madsen's life is also a call to repentance to all of \n     us who are lukewarm. Whose hearts are set partly upon \n     righteousness and life and partly upon worldliness and death. \n     The whole world is starving for the life and happiness which \n     only comes from living the gospel.\n       Will we fully live the gospel, and send out a message of \n     its blessings?\n       Will we try to communicate it as vigorously as my father \n     did?\n       The last stanza of the song he loved ``To Dream the \n     Impossible Dream,'' goes like this:\n\n     And the world will be better for this,\n     That one man, scorned and covered with scars,\n     Still strove with his last ounce of courage,\n     To reach the unreachable star.\n\n       And, in the Book of Revelation it is written: ``And he that \n     overcometh, and keepeth my works to the end, to him will I \n     give power. . . . And I will give him the morning star \n     (Revelation 2:26,28) I, Jesus . . . am the bright and morning \n     star (Revelation 22:16).\n       I believe and I pray that Arch and Peggy Madsen do keep his \n     works to the end, and I feel certain that they will be given \n     the morning star.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3725-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. McCathran, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3726-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 12:54 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1225.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat the conducting of certain games of chance shall not be treated as \nan unrelated trade or business; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\nTHE UNRELATED BUSINESS INCOME TAX CHARITABLE GAMBLING EXEMPTION ACT OF \n                                  1997\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 651, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code to exempt charitable gambling \nactivities from Federal unrelated business income tax [UBIT].\n  Charitable gambling consists mostly of games such as pull tabs and \nraffles. The difference between charitable and regular gambling is \nwhere and how the profit is spent. Most of the income derived from \ncharitable gambling games are spent in communities to fund activities \nsuch as Boy and Girl Scouts, Head Start, and city and school programs.\n  In fact, charitable gambling and bingo games have become one of the \nmost important sources to provide funding for many activities in \ncommunities for people of all ages. In my home State, Minnesota, \ncharitable gambling pumped up $77.5 million in profits into a variety \nof community and charitable causes in 1995. The beneficiaries include \nyouth recreation and eduction, as well as organizations serving the \nsick, handicapped, retarded and disabled and many other community \nprograms.\n  Many charitable gambling games are set up solely for the purpose of \nraising money for public projects, thus reducing the burden on \ntaxpayers. For example, Minnesota Belle Plaine Friends of the Library \ncharitable gambling was started 4 years ago for the purpose of helping \nfund a new library in town. Today, they have donated more than $105,000 \nto the library project.\n\n  In 1978, President Carter signed into law a bill that classified \nbingo income as related business income. As a result, this charitable \ngame is not subject to the Federal UBIT. But the law did not include \nother forms of charitable gambling. Consequently, the income of these \ncharitable gambling games is taxed under the UBIT.\n  Taxes take a big bite out of charitable gambling income. It has \nseriously undermined nonprofit organizations' ability to provide \nfinancial assistance for local activities. Here is an example of the \nrevenue loss. Last year, the Minnesota American Legion donated $103,000 \nto the Cancer Research Center at the University of Minnesota. However, \nunder current law, the income is subject to the UBIT. Only $5,150 of \nthe $103,000 was a deductible contribution, and $97,850 was taxed at \nrates up to 38 percent.\n  This is simply not fair. Charitable donations should be encouraged, \nnot penalized, to fund more local initiatives, projects and programs \nthat benefit our communities. That's what the bill is all about.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS (for himself and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 652. A bill to facilitate recovery from the recent flooding of the \nRed River of the North and its tributaries by providing greater \nflexibility for depository institutions and their regulators, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n         THE DEPOSITORY INSTITUTION DISASTER RELIEF ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to speak about a subject this \nmorning dealing with the flood situations back in Minnesota, and North \nDakota and South Dakota as well.\n  Mr. President, as you know, over the past several weeks, towns and \nfarms in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota have been battered \nby the flood waters of the Red River and Minnesota River. It is \nimpossible to describe the devastation the floods are causing in \nMinnesota and North Dakota because the enormity of the damage is far, \nfar beyond what anyone has ever had to put into words.\n  As I made my third trip into the flood disaster area this week, \ntraveling with President Clinton and my colleagues in the Minnesota and \nNorth Dakota congressional delegations, I found myself searching for \nadjectives but finding none that could reflect the loss and heartache \ninflicted upon our neighbors. Their lives have been shattered. Entire \ncommunities--homes, schools, churches, hospitals, libraries--have \nliterally been washed away. Thousands of residents have no home to go \nhome to, so they crowd into shelters, unsure what the river will leave \nbehind when it finally releases its hold. Many cannot sleep because \nthere is so much uncertainty. They cannot bathe because there is no \nrunning water. They cannot make plans because there are so many \nunanswered questions.\n\n  At the moment, it does not seem like much of a life. By nature, \nMinnesotans are a stoic people. In a land where the temperatures can \nplunge to 30 degrees below zero in mid-winter and soar past a hundred \nin the summer, we have learned how to get on with life without too much \ncomplaining. But for many, the veneer is wearing a little thin. It is \nhard to be stoic when you have lost your home and your job. It is hard \nto look forward to tomorrow when all you have got is a cot on the floor \nof an airplane hanger, where you may be living for weeks.\n  Mr. President, I am working with the Governor of Minnesota and my \nfellow Senators in the flood area to assess\n\n[[Page S3728]]\n\nhow to address the needs of these deserving people. Part of our effort \nwill be to get the funds and assistance to rebuild through the \nsupplemental appropriations bill that we will pass next week. Part of \nit will be the efforts of myself and my staff to listen to the concerns \nof our constituents, and to make sure they get speedy assistance from \nthe agencies that are administering the State and Federal relief \nefforts.\n  I would like to announce this morning that I am opening a new, \ntemporary office in Crookston, with FEMA and other members of our \ndelegation, and my staff will be immediately available to help out in \nthe flood relief projects that are currently underway.\n  While I will be involved in many efforts to ease the suffering of my \nconstituents, I am here today to introduce--with my colleague from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Johnson--the Depository Institution Disaster \nRelief Act. This bill will complement the other relief efforts by \nmaking it easier for farmers, homeowners, small businesses, and local \ngovernments to rebuild from the devastation brought by the floods.\n  The Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act will help speed up the \npace of recovery for the flooded farms and towns. Our legislation will \npermit homeowners, farmers, and small businesses to have faster access \nto a larger pool of credit from the banks and credit unions that serve \ntheir communities, by ensuring that there will be no regulatory \nroadblocks to local lending. It will permit Federal banking and credit \nunion regulators to make temporary exceptions to current laws that act \nto reduce access to banks and credit unions in disaster areas. It will \nalso permit Federal regulators to provide temporary relief from \nregulations so that it is easier for flood victims to get loans.\n  The temporary regulatory relief offered by this bill is strictly \nlimited to those counties in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota \nthat have been declared Federal disaster areas. Because of its targeted \nscope and limited duration, it will permit flood victims to rebuild \ntheir homes, farms, and businesses without compromising the integrity \nof our banking system.\n  When I served in the House of Representatives, I authored similar \nlegislation in 1993 during the Mississippi River flooding. My \nlegislation received bipartisan support, and was signed into law by \nPresident Clinton as part of the supplemental appropriations bill for \ndisaster relief. Since this legislation worked well to help flooded \ncommunities rebuild in 1993, I will ask Chairman Stevens to include \nthis bill as part of the emergency supplemental that the Senate will \nlikely be considering next week. I urge my colleagues to support my \neffort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill's \nprovisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act of 1997\n\n\n                                Purpose\n\n       Over the past several weeks, towns and farms in Minnesota, \n     North Dakota and South Dakota have been demolished by the \n     flood waters of the Red River of the North. Because of the \n     extreme level of flood damage, President Clinton has declared \n     these areas to be eligible for federal disaster relief \n     pursuant to Section 401 of the Disaster Relief and Emergency \n     Assistance Act.\n       The Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act (``DIDRA'') \n     will significantly speed up the pace of recovery for the \n     flooded farms and towns. DIDRA will permit homeowners, \n     farmers, small-businesses and local governments in the flood \n     disaster areas to have faster access to a larger pool of \n     credit from the banks, thrifts and credit unions that serve \n     their communities. DIDRA will do this by permitting federal \n     financial institution regulators to make temporary exceptions \n     to current laws that (l) hamper the ability of banks, thrifts \n     and credit unions to reopen their doors to depositors, (2) \n     slow down the lending process and (3) reduce the availability \n     of credit.\n\n\n                         Summary of Provisions\n\n                      Section 1--Title of statute\n\n       The bill is called the ``Depository Institution Disaster \n     Relief Act of 1997'' (DIDRA). This bill contains provisions \n     that are substantially identical to temporary emergency \n     relief legislation that was signed into law in 1992 and 1993.\n\n            Section 2(a)--Exceptions to Truth in Lending Act\n\n       The Federal Reserve Board may make exceptions to the Truth \n     In Lending Act (TILA) for loans given by a bank, thrift or \n     credit union that is in the disaster area. The exceptions \n     must be made within 180 days of enactment of DIDRA, and may \n     only last a maximum of one year. For example, this permits \n     the Federal Reserve Board to permit consumers to receive the \n     proceeds from their loans 3 days faster by permitting them to \n     sign preprinted forms that waive their 3 day right of \n     rescission period pursuant to Section 125 of TILA (15 U.S.C. \n     1635).\n\n      Section 2(b)--Exceptions to Expedited Funds Availability Act\n\n       The Federal Reserve Board may make exceptions to the \n     Expedited Funds Availability Act (EFAA) to any bank, thrift \n     or credit union in the disaster areas, so that they may \n     restart their check processing operations sooner. The \n     exception must be made within 180 days of enactment of DIDRA, \n     and may only last for a maximum of one year. For example, \n     this permits the Federal Reserve Board to let a bank, thrift \n     or credit union restart serving its customers even though the \n     disruption from the flooding makes it need more than one \n     business day to process cash deposits and government checks \n     as required by Section 603 of EFAA (12 U.S.C. 4002).\n\nSection 3--Exception to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to Permit the \n             Deposit of Insurance Proceeds in Bank Accounts\n\n       Farms, businesses and local governments in the flood \n     disaster areas will be receiving large amounts of insurance \n     proceeds. This money will invariably be deposited in banks, \n     thrifts and credit unions for a short duration until the \n     money is used for rebuilding. Unfortunately, the depositing \n     of large amounts of insurance proceeds may cause banks and \n     thrifts to be deemed undercapitalized pursuant to Section 38 \n     of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) (12 U.S.C. \n     1831o). This could cause credit to dry up in the disaster \n     areas, as Section 38 would automatically require a depository \n     institution to file a capital restoration plan with the FDIC, \n     even if the insurance proceeds were invested in assets \n     creating little additional risk to the depository \n     institution. Section 38 of the FDIA would compel a depository \n     institution to obtain formal approval from the FDIC in order \n     not to be restricted in its lending policies. Section 3 of \n     DIDRA permits the OCC, the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC \n     and the OTS to subtract insurance proceeds from the \n     depository institution's assets when they calculate whether \n     the depository institution meets the FDIA's minimum leverage \n     standards (i.e., equity capitalization requirements). Any \n     exception that the regulators make to Section 38 of FDIA will \n     expire after 18 months.\n\n    Section 4--Authority of Regulators to Act Quickly to Facilitate \n                       Recovery in Disaster Areas\n\n       Within 180 days after the enactment of DIDRA, a qualifying \n     regulatory agency is given the flexibility to take any \n     actions permitted under its existing statutory authority to \n     facilitate recovery in the disaster area without being \n     delayed or impeded by (1) having to provide a general notice \n     of proposed rule-making in the Federal Register, (2) having \n     to hold a hearing, (3) being restricted by time limits with \n     respect to agency action or (4) having to meet certain \n     publication requirements. However, within 90 days of taking \n     an action, the qualifying regulatory agency must publish in \n     the Federal Register a statement that (1) describes what it \n     did and (2) explains the need for the action.\n\n Section 5--Sense of Congress re: Exceptions to Appraisal Requirements\n\n       The Depository Institutions Disaster Relief Act of 1992 (PL \n     102-485, Oct. 23, 1992) amended the Financial Institutions \n     Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (FIRREA) to give \n     regulators the authority to waive certain appraisal standards \n     in disaster areas. The waiver of certain appraisal standards \n     for real estate loans in disaster areas will (1) permit homes \n     to be rebuilt faster by expediting the lending process and \n     (2) lower the cost of receiving loans to rebuild such homes. \n     Section 1123 of FIRREA (12 U.S.C. 3353) currently permits the \n     OCC, OTS, FDIC, Federal Reserve Board and NCUA to waive such \n     appraisal standards for 3 years in disaster areas.\n       Section 5 of DIDRA states that it is the sense of the \n     Congress that these federal regulators should exercise their \n     authority under Section 1123 of FIRREA to temporarily waive \n     such standards.\n\n                     Section 6--Limitation of DIDRA\n\n       DIDRA shall not limit the authority of any federal agency \n     under any other provision of law.\n\n                         Section 7--Definitions\n\n       This section defines certain terms used in DIDRA: (1) \n     appropriate federal banking agency, (2) Board, (3) Federal \n     financial institutions regulatory agency, (4) insured \n     depository institution, (5) leverage limit, and (6) \n     qualifying amount attributable to insurance proceeds.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, we need to assure the people of Minnesota \nand North Dakota that the Senate stands behind them,. . . . and that \nthe entire Congress and the President stand behind them as well.\n  I urge swift action on my legislation and the emergency supplemental \nappropriations, which I expect will have the overwhelming, bipartisan \nsupport of my colleagues when it comes to the floor.\n  Minnesota Governor Arne Carlson and his staff have been here in \nWashington these past two days, working\n\n[[Page S3729]]\n\nwith my staff and that of my colleagues to ensure Federal officials are \ndoing everything in their power to help our residents put their lives \nback together.\n  Director James Witt and his team at FEMA have been outstanding. I can \nsay with confidence that everyone here understands the gravity of the \nsituation and the magnitude of the work that remains.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I am proud to be an original \nsponsor, along with my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Grams, of the \nDepository Institution Relief Act of 1997. This act represents a small \nmeasure that we in Congress can undertake to help alleviate some of the \nsuffering caused in South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota by the \nnatural disasters of this past winter and spring.\n  South Dakotans are a hearty stock, and during my years serving the \npeople of South Dakota, I have repeatedly witnessed their ability to \novercome any obstacle Mother Nature throws their way. However, I don't \nbelieve I have ever seen South Dakotans rise to the occasion in quite \nthe manner they are right now. I recently toured the disaster areas of \nSouth Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota with both President Clinton \nand Vice-President Gore and viewed terrible scenes of cattle stranded \nin fields, dead cattle across the area, flooded highways, communities \nlining up to pile sandbags, and people forced to stay in motels because \ntheir homes are in such danger. The devastation caused to Grand Forks, \nND will not soon be forgotten by those who witnessed nature's awesome \nfury first-hand. The situation in South Dakota also was far worse than \nI expected. During my recent tour, I saw a compelling combination of \nthe furor of Mother Nature and the determination of South Dakotans, \nNorth Dakotans, and Minnesotans to survive yet another battle with this \nawesome force. Mother Nature--as only she can do--had changed the rules \nof the game and given the residents of our region more water than \ninitially anticipated and more than we could safely handle.\n  But, through it all--through all the heart-wrenching, indiscriminate \nloss of property, possessions, and livestock--folks in our South Dakota \ncommunities have pulled together. The scene in my home State, and \nacross the region, is something that nearly defies description, but \nclearly will not be forgotten for many years to come. As the flood \nwaters begin to recede, and these hard-working folks begin to rebuild \nshattered lives, I rise to seek the support of my colleagues in \nproviding certain regulatory relief that will greatly enable this \nprocess. As we did in response to previous tragic flooding along the \nMississippi River in 1992 and 1993, let us now undertake to do for the \nresidents of South Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota through the \nDepository Institution Disaster Relief Act of 1997.\n  This act will enable lending institutions--banks, credit unions, and \nthrifts--to help the people most severely affected by this disaster to \nbegin the arduous process of recovery. The bill permits the regulatory \nagencies to waive some of the regulations which delay the procedures \nfor helping these people. The major provisions will allow consumers to \nreceive loan proceeds 3 days faster than they ordinarily would, helps \nlending institutions reopen for business quicker even though the \ndisruption from the flooding may require more than 1 day to process \ncash deposits and government checks, and loosens capitalization \nrequirements that will be buffeted by the large amounts of insurance \ndeposits that will shortly be flowing through the region. We also call \nupon Federal regulators to use their ability to waive certain appraisal \nstandards for real estate loans in the disaster areas. These actions \nwill enable the regulating agencies to work with the primary lending \ninstitutions to make it easier for the impacted citizens to begin the \nstrenuous and extremely difficult process of recovery.\n  Mr. President, my region has just suffered a 500-year flood right on \nthe heels of the worst winter in memory. As the valiant residents of \nSouth Dakota, North Dakota, and Minnesota begin to rebuild their lives \nand homes, I urge the Congress to take these minimal steps to help that \nprocess.\n  The Depository Institution Disaster Relief Act of 1997 represents an \nimmediate, concrete step we can and should take in that direction. I \nurge my colleagues to support our efforts to attach this important \ndisaster relief bill to the supplemental appropriations bill which will \nbe considered by the Senate in the near future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 653. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction from gross income for home care and adult day and respite \ncare expenses of individual taxpayers with respect to a dependent of \nthe taxpayer who suffers from Alzheimer's disease or related organic \nbrain disorders; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                        alzheimer's legislation\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 654.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nrequire States to adopt and enforce certain guardianship laws providing \nprotection and rights to wards and individuals subject to guardianship \nproceedings as a condition of eligibility for receiving funds under the \nMedicaid Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        the guardianship rights and responsibilities act of 1997\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I introduce a package of three \nbills which will have a significant impact on the lives of American \nfamilies.\n\n  The first bill I am reintroducing today provides a tax credit for \nfamilies caring for a relative who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. \nToday, ``Alzheimer's'' is a household term. But it was not always so. \nFor many years, victims of Alzheimer's disease and their families \nstruggled in isolation against this illness. However, President \nReagan's poignant disclosure in 1994 that Alzheimer's disease was \nattacking him as he entered the ``twilight years'' of his life captured \nthe collective heart of our Nation, and brought new attention to this \ndevastating disease. We have come a long way from when I first came to \nCongress over 18 years ago, when there was not a single piece of \nlegislation devoted to Alzheimer's disease. Thankfully, that has \nchanged.\n  Alzheimer's disease is now the most expensive uninsured illness in \nAmerica. The financial costs are staggering. Alzheimer's will consume \nmore of our national wealth--approximately $1.75 trillion--than all \nother illnesses except cancer and heart disease. The number of \nAmericans affected by Alzheimer's is rising and will continue to rise \ndramatically, from 4 million today to over 14 million by the middle of \nthe 21st century.\n  In addition to the significant financial costs related to caring for \na family member with Alzheimer's disease, there is also a tremendous \nemotional cost as well. It is a cost born by the millions of spouses, \nchildren, relatives, and friends of Alzheimer's victims who see their \nloved ones slowly overwhelmed by the disease.\n  We can, however, lessen both the emotional and financial costs of \nthis disease by passing the bill I am reintroducing today which will \nprovide some relief to Alzheimer's patients and their families. My bill \nwould allow families to deduct the cost of home care and adult day and \nrespite care provided to a dependent suffering from Alzheimer's \ndisease.\n  The second bill I am reintroducing today will strengthen the \ndependent care tax credit and restore Congress' original intent to \nprovide the greatest benefit of tax credit to low-income taxpayers. My \nlegislation expands the dependent care tax credit, makes it applicable \nfor respite care expenses, and makes it refundable.\n  The increase in women entering the work force and the aging \npopulation have brought a corresponding increase in the need for both \nchild and elder care. Expenses incurred for such care can significantly \nstrain a family's budget. In 1993, full-time child care costs averaged \napproximately $4,000. Managing these costs is difficult for many \nfamilies, but is exceptionally burdensome for those in lower income \nbrackets.\n\n[[Page S3730]]\n\n  In 1976, Congress enacted the dependent care tax credit to help low- \nand moderate-income families alleviate the burden of employment-related \ndependent care. Over the years, the DCTC has provided significant \nFederal assistance to millions of families with child and adult \ndependent care expenses.\n  Under current law, parents can deduct up to $2,400 annually for \nemployment-related child care expenses for one children, and up to \n$4,800 for two or more children. Parents can deduct an amount equal to \n30 percent of their child care expenditures if they have earnings below \n$10,000, with the percentage decreasing on a sliding scale to 20 \npercent if their income is above $28,000. The credit is nonrefundable, \nmeaning that an individual can only receive the credit if he or she \npays taxes.\n  Unfortunately, the value of the dependent care tax credit for low- \nand moderate-income families has eroded in recent years. This is \nlargely due to the lack of inflationary indexing and refundability.\n  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 provided for inflationary indexing of all \nthe basic provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that determine tax \nliability except for DCTC. As a result, fewer and fewer families with \nincomes low enough to take advantage of the maximum credit amount, 30 \npercent, have any tax liability.\n  The result is a shift in DCTC benefits away from low-income families \nand toward moderate-income families. Fewer and fewer low-income \nfamily's annual income reach the tax threshold necessary to receive the \ntax credit; and those low-income individuals who do reach the threshold \nlose out on the maximum credit available. Therefore, rather than \nhelping low-income families with dependent care expenses, which was \nCongress' original intent, the DCTC is evolving into assistance for \nless needy middle-income families.\n  I believe it is critical to get the DCTC back on track helping those \nfamilies most in need in our country. If we do not address these issues \nnow, each year increasing tax thresholds will prevent more and more \nlow-income individuals from benefiting from the DCTC.\n  The legislation I am reintroducing would make the adjustments \nnecessary to restore this important benefit to low-income individuals \nand families. It indexes the DCTC to inflation, and makes it refundable \nso that those who do not reach the tax thresholds still receive Federal \nassistance for their dependent care expenses.\n\n  My legislation, however, goes even further to help families \nstruggling with dependent care expenses. Recognizing the realistic \ncosts of dependent care, my bill raises the DCTC sliding scale from 30 \nto 50 percent of work-related dependent care expenditures for families \nearning $15,000 or less. The scale would then be reduced by 1 \npercentage point for each additional $1,000 more of income, down to a \ncredit of 20 percent for persons earning $45,000 or more.\n  Finally, this legislation expands the definition of dependent care to \ninclude respite care, thereby offering relief from this additional \nexpense. A respite care credit would be allowed for up to $1,200 for \none qualifying dependent care and $2,400 for two qualifying dependents. \nThe credit for respite care expenses would be available regardless of \nthe caregiver's employment status.\n  Congress intended the dependent care tax credit to help low- and \nmoderate-income families manage the costs of dependent care assistance \nwhich is vital to so many families' economic livelihood. However, each \nyear that we do not address the issues of inflationary indexing and \nrefundability, we deny those very families assistance, and, instead, \nhelp families with greater financial means.\n  The third bill I am reintroducing today is the Guardianship Rights \nand Responsibilities Act of 1997, which establishes a bill of rights \nfor adults who, because of physical or mental incapacity, become wards \nof the courts.\n  Wards are individuals whose legal rights, decisionmaking authority, \nand possessions have been transferred to the control of a guardian or \nconservator based on a judgment that the person is no longer capable of \nhandling these affairs. This legal system severely limits an \nindividual's personal autonomy and has considerable problems and \nwidespread abuses. Horror stories abound about guardians who force \nunnecessary nursing home care, embezzle assets or otherwise abuse their \nwards.\n  The Guardianship Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1997 would \nrequire States to adopt and enforce laws to provide basic protection \nand rights to wards as a condition of receiving Federal Medicaid funds. \nIt would assure due process protections such as counsel, the right to \nbe present at their proceedings, and to appeal decisions. Also required \nwould be: Clear and convincing evidence to determine the need for a \nguardianship; adequate court monitoring; and standards, training, and \noversight for guardians.\n  This legislation will help to protect the most vulnerable elderly and \ndisabled from exploitation, and will help to assure them the highest \npossible autonomy. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthese important bills.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Enzi, \n        Mr. Helms, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Roth, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 656. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nexclude from the definition of employee firefighters and rescue squad \nworkers who perform volunteer services and to prevent employers from \nrequiring employees who are firefighters or rescue squad workers to \nperform volunteer services, and to allow an employer not to pay \novertime compensation to a firefighter or rescue squad worker who \nperforms volunteer services for the employer, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n         the volunteer firefighter and rescue squad worker act\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to once again introduce the \nVolunteer Firefighter and Rescue Squad Worker Act.\n  The purposes of this legislation, which was S. 324 in the 104th \nCongress, are to preserve the spirit of volunteerism in our communities \nand to assist our volunteer firefighters and rescue squad workers in \ntheir mission to provide vital life-saving and property protection \nservices in their communities.\n  Under current law, it is illegal for a firefighter or rescue squad \nworker to work on a volunteer basis for the same community which \nemploys him or her during the workweek. My bill would amend the Fair \nLabor Standards Act of 1938 to reflect the realities of the work force \nof the 1990's by excluding from the definition of ``employee'' \nfirefighters and rescue squad workers who are performing volunteer \nservices, thus removing the need to pay these volunteers overtime pay \nfor those hours volunteered.\n  The need for this legislation stems from a 1993 U.S. Department of \nLabor ruling that a career firefighter cannot serve as a volunteer \nfirefighter within the same county in which he or she is employed. My \nlegislation would allow professional firefighters and rescue squad \nworkers to volunteer their services during off-duty hours and to waive \novertime pay. The bill specifically prohibits employers from requiring \nfirefighters and rescue squad workers to volunteer when they would \notherwise be entitled to receive overtime compensation, and it requires \nthat any agreement by such employees to waive their right to overtime \ncompensation be put in writing. I have also added new anticoercion \nlanguage to the bill to specifically define behavior that would be \nconsidered coercive.\n  Historically, volunteer fire and rescue services have played an \nimportant role in our communities. Millions of people, at some point in \ntheir lives, have depended upon the services of such volunteers to \nprotect life and property. In many cases, it is the professional \nfirefighters and rescue workers who volunteered their expertise and \ntraining to their communities as a way of giving something back to \ntheir friends and neighbors. The current law, in comparison, does not \neven allow a firefighter or rescue worker to respond to an emergency \nwithout FLSA regulation.\n  Moreover, many municipalities and counties rely upon volunteer \nservices because they lack the funds to operate a full-time \nprofessional and rescue service. I am concerned that until this bill is \npassed, many of our citizens will lack the level of protection that \nwould voluntarily be provided by these professionals. This problem is \nespecially\n\n[[Page S3731]]\n\nacute for rural areas where fire and rescue units are less common and \nmore remote.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senators Cochran, Enzi, Helms, \nHutchinson, Roth, Sessions, and Thomas, who are cosponsors of this \nlegislation. I hope my other colleagues will support this important \nlegislation to return an important resource to localities to protect \nthe property, and indeed the very lives, of Americans across our great \nnation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 656\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 2. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Volunteer Firefighter and \n     Rescue Squad Worker Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to permit \nretired members of the Armed Forces who have a service-connected \ndisability to receive military retired pay concurrently with veterans' \ndisability compensation; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n               the military retirement equity act of 1997\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, current law--grounded in a century-old \nstatute--requires individuals in receipt of disability compensation \nfrom the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, to offset by an equal \namount any retired military pay for which they are eligible. The offset \nrequirement discriminates unfairly against disabled career soldiers by \nrequiring them, in effect, to fund their own disability benefits.\n  To correct this gross inequity, Senator Jeffords and I are \nintroducing legislation today that would eliminate the offset on a \ngraduated scale based on the inverse of the retiree's disability \nrating.\n  For example, a veteran who is 80 percent disabled would have to \noffset his retirement pay by the amount equal to 20 percent of his \ntotal VA disability. This compromise would establish the right of a \ndisabled military retiree to receive at least a portion of his earned \nmilitary retirement.\n  Current law is problematic because it ignores the proper distinction \nbetween military retirement and disability compensation entitlements. \nWhereas the former is paid to recognize a soldier who has dedicated 20 \nor more of his or her years to our country's defense, the latter is \ndesigned to compensate a veteran for injury incurred in the line of \nduty. Because the two types of compensation serve two entirely \ndifferent purposes, receipt of one should not displace receipt of the \nother.\n  Concurrent receipt is fundamentally a fairness issue. The present law \nsimply discriminates against career military personnel. Career military \nretirees are the only group of Federal retirees who are required to \nwaive their retirement pay in order to receive VA disability pay.\n  The unequal gap between the compensation received by disabled \nservicemembers who choose different career paths is patently clear.\n  Disabled veterans who choose careers in military service will see, \nupon retirement, their earned retirement benefits reduced proportionate \nto their receipt of VA disability payments. Conversely, disabled \nveterans who elect to leave military service and go into either other \nFederal employment or the private sector will, upon retirement, \ncontinue to receive their full disability payments, along with any \nearned retirement benefits.\n  This inequity needs to be corrected. Over the past several years, the \nCongress and the Department of Defense have sought to deal with this \nissue in a variety of ways. In the past, many attempts to rectify this \nsituation have been accompanied by staggering cost estimates. This \nlegislation represents an effort to ease the offset burden on retired \ndisabled servicemembers while avoiding significant deficit expansion.\n  It is also supported by veterans service organizations, including the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, the American \nLegion, and the Paralyzed Veterans of America. Although these \norganizations would prefer a complete elimination of the offset, they \nall welcome this effort as a step in the right direction.\n  We now have an opportunity to show a measure of our gratitude to all \nthose remarkable men and women who have sacrificed in the name of \nfreedom and democracy.\n  These dedicated servicemembers deserve our special commendation, both \nfor having suffered while serving our country and for continuing to \nwork in the Armed Forces until retirement. It is time for Congress to \nreverse the law that prohibits career military personnel who are \nwounded or injured during service to our country from receiving earned \nretirement benefits. I hope the Senate will consider this legislation \nexpeditiously and end, at long last, this unfairness by finally passing \nthis bill, or something like it, into law in the near future.\n  Mr. President, this legislation represents an honest attempt to \ncorrect an injustice that has existed for too long. By allowing \ndisabled veterans to receive military retired pay and veterans \ndisability compensation concurrently, with an offset that is inversely \nrelated to the degree of disability, we can restore some fairness to \nFederal retirement policy in a cost-effective manner. Common sense \ntells us that this is the right thing to do.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Military Retirement \nEquity Act of 1997 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 657\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, current law requires retired military \npersonnel individuals in receipt of disability compensation from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, VA, to offset any retired military pay \nfor which they become eligible. Today Senator Daschle and I are \nintroducing legislation that would gradually eliminate this offset \nbased on the inverse of the retiree's disability rating. This offset \nrequirement unfairly discriminates against career soldiers who become \ndisabled by requiring them to fund their own disability benefits.\n  As an example, a veteran with 60-percent service-connected disability \nwould have to offset his retirement pay by the amount equal to 60 \npercent of his total VA disability. This compromise legislation would \nestablish the right of a disabled military retiree to receive at least \na portion of his earned military retirement while avoiding an \ninsurmountable cost that, under budget rules, would require an offset \nin other funding areas of the Department of Defense.\n  Current law does not take into account the obvious distinction \nbetween military retirement and disability compensation entitlements. \nMilitary retirement is paid to recognize a soldier who has dedicated 20 \nor more of his or her years to our country's defense. Disability \nbenefits are intended to compensate a veteran for injury for injury \nincurred in the lined of duty. Because these two types of compensation \nserve two different purposes, receipt of one should not prevent a \nveteran from receiving the other.\n  Congress has sought to deal with this issue over the years in a \nnumber ways--most of these attempts have brought with them unreasonable \ncost estimates. This legislation would ease the offset burden on \nretired disabled service members and still avoid significant expansion \nin the deficit. Also, because career military retirees are the only \ngroup of Federal retirees who are required to waive their retirement \npay in order to receive VA disability, the need to change current law \nis especially pressing. Inversely, disabled veterans who elect to leave \nmilitary service and go into either other Federal employment or the \nprivate sector will, upon retirement, continue to receive their full \ndisability payments, along with any earned retirement benefits.\n  This bill is supported as a step in the right direction by the \nNation's veterans service organizations, including the American Legion, \nVeterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, and the \nParalyzed Veterans of America.\n  Congress should move quickly to reverse this law prohibiting career \nmilitary personnel who are wounded or injured during their service from \nreceiving earned retirement benefits. I hope the Senate will act to end \nthis unfairness once and for all by passing legislation to ease the \noffset. In allowing disabled veterans to receive military retired pay \nand veterans disability compensation concurrently, with an offset that \nis inversely related to the degree of disability, we will restore some \nfairness to Federal retirement policy cost-effectively. Our veterans \nhave earned that and much more.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 658. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ngunrunning, and provide mandatory minimum penalties for crimes related \nto gunrunning; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  THE GUN KINGPIN PENALTY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleague \nfrom Illinois Senator Durbin, to introduce the Gun Kingpin Penalty Act \nof 1997. In introducing this bill, Senator Durbin and I hope that our \ncolleagues will soon join us in sending a clear and strong signal to \ngunrunners--your actions will no longer be tolerated.\n  Mr. President, recent numbers gathered by the Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms clearly demonstrate what many of us already knew \nall too well--several key North-South highways in this country have \nbecome pipelines for merchants of death who deal in illegal firearms.\n  My own State of New Jersey is proud to have some of the toughest gun \ncontrol laws in the Nation. But for far too long, the courageous \nefforts of New Jersey citizens in enacting these tough laws have been \nweakened by out of State gunrunners who treat our State like their own \npersonal retail outlet.\n  We learned from the ATF data that in 1996, New Jersey exported fewer \nguns used in crimes, per capita, than any other State--less than 1 gun \nper 100,000 residents, or 75 total guns. In contrast, Mississippi \nexported 29 of these guns per capita last year.\n  Meanwhile, an incredible number of guns used to commit crimes in New \nJersey last year came from out of State--944 guns were imported and \nused to commit crimes compared to only 75 exported--a net import of 869 \nillegal guns used to commit crimes against the people of New Jersey. In \nfact, the top six exporters of illegal guns used to commit crimes in \nNew Jersey supplied 62 pecent of the guns--585--and only one of those \nsix States--North Carolina--has strong gun control laws.\n  This represents a one way street--guns come from States with lax gun \nlaws straight to States, like New Jersey, with strong laws.\n  It is clear that New Jersey's strong gun control laws offer criminals \nlittle choice but to import their guns from States with weak laws. We \nmust act on a Federal level to send a clear message that this cannot \ncontinue and will not be tolerated.\n  Mr. President, once again this year Senator Lautenberg and I have \nintroduced our one-gun-a-month bill, which would go a long way toward \npreventing bulk sales and massive trafficking in firearms.\n  But today's bill is the next logical step--hitting illegal \ntraffickers where it hurts with tough mandatory minimum sentences that \nwill get these gunrunners off our streets.\n  The Gun Kingpin Penalty Act of 1997 would create a new Federal \ngunrunning offense for any person who, within a 12-month period, \ntransports more than five guns to another State with the intent of \ntransferring all of the weapons to another person. The act would \nestablish mandatory minimum penalties for gunrunning as follows:\n  A mandatory 3-year minimum sentence for a first offense involving 5 \nto 50 guns; a mandatory 5-year minimum\n\n[[Page S3733]]\n\nsentence for second offense involving 5 to 50 guns; and a mandatory 15-\nyear minimum sentence for any offense involving more than 50 guns.\n  Additionally, the bill contains two blood-on-the-hands provisions, \nwhich will significantly increase penalties for a gunrunner who \ntransfers a gun subsequently used to seriously injure or kill another \nperson. A mandatory 10-year minimum sentence is required if one of the \nsmuggled guns is used within 3 years to kill or seriously injure \nanother person. And a mandatory 25-year minimum sentence must be \nimposed if one of the smuggled guns is used within 3 years to kill or \nseriously injure another person and more than 50 guns were smuggled.\n  Finally, our bill adds numerous gunrunning crimes as RICO predicates, \nand authorizes 200 additional Treasury personnel to enforce the act--\nCongress must provide law enforcement with the resources to enforce the \nlaws we pass.\n  The fight against gun violence is a long-term, many-staged process. \nWe succeeded in enacting the Brady bill and the ban on devastating \nassault weapons. Last year, we told domestic violence offenders that \nthey could no longer own a gun.\n  And these laws have been effective: 186,000 prohibited individuals \nhave already been denied a handgun due to Brady background checks. Some \n70 percent of these people were convicted or indicted felons.\n  Traces of assault weapons have plummeted since the ban, and prices \nhave gone up. And not a single law enforcement officer has been killed \nwith an assault weapon in over a year.\n  Mr. President, I will soon be introducing a companion piece to this \nlegislation--the Gun Kingpin Death Penalty Act of 1997. That bill, \nmodeled after the drug kingpin legislation passed by Congress several \nyears ago, will allow for the Federal death penalty if a gunrunning \nkingpin commits murder in the course of his or her operations. As I \nsaid before, this is a many-staged fight, and we can never rest when it \ncomes to gun violence.\n  This problem will not just go away, and we cannot standby and watch \nas innocent men, women, and children die at the hands of criminals \narmed with these guns. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I \nask that the full text of the legislation be printed in the Record \nfollowing this statement. I yield the floor to my friend from Illinois \nSenator Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey and join him today in introducing the Gun Kingpin Penalty Act of \n1997.\n  Mr. President, Interstate 55 runs straight through Mississippi to \nMemphis and St. Louis before veering northeast into Springfield and \nChicago. And, in addition to carrying cars with their passengers and \ntrucks with their cargo, I-55 is a firearm freeway into my home State. \nGunrunners ship trunkloads of guns up I-55 for use by criminals.\n  Two years ago, one of those guns--that probably came into Illinois \nvia I-55--was used to shoot Chicago Police Officer Daniel Doffyn in the \nhead. Officer Doffyn was fresh out of the police academy. He was out on \na burglary call, and a Tec-9 from Mississippi killed him.\n  The legislation Senator Torricelli and I introduce today lets \neveryone know that we are committed to closing down the illegal \ngunrunning operations that put that Tec-9 into the hands of the man who \nkilled Daniel Doffyn.\n  And let no one underestimate the deadly impact of gunrunning across \nState lines. My home State of Illinois has tough gun laws. The local \nfirearms dealers, police, and licensing authorities work hard to make \nsure that felons cannot go into a store and buy guns. They also work \nhard to keep the illegal gun market under control.\n  But we have learned that one State alone cannot overpower the illegal \ngun market. Earlier this year we obtained data from the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms detailing the results of their efforts to \ntrace guns used in crimes. We analyzed that data and produced a report. \nThat report concluded that:\n  First, guns used in crimes are most likely to come from just a few \nStates with relatively weak gun control laws. Of the traceable guns \nused nationwide in crimes, 16,635 of the 47,068, or 35 percent, were \nout-of-State guns.\n  Second, in States with strong gun laws, criminals obtain many of \ntheir guns from other States with weaker gun laws.\n  Third, in States with lax gun laws, criminals obtain the majority of \ntheir guns from their home State.\n  Fourth, the trafficking of guns moves primarily in one direction; \nfrom States with weak gun laws to States with tough gun laws.\n  Fifth, when neighboring States have different levels of gun control \nlaws, the State with lax laws floods its stricter neighbor with guns.\n  In Illinois we can see how these conclusions play out. Illinois is a \nnet traced-guns importer. In 1996, Illinois accounted for a total of \n399 crime guns traced in all the other States combined. However, 1,596 \nguns from out of State were traced to crimes in Illinois. Thirty-five \npercent of the guns traced from crimes in Illinois were from out of \nState. And 10 percent of the guns traced from crimes in Illinois were \nfrom Alabama, Mississippi, and Texas. Mississippi is the top supplier \nof out-of-State guns to Illinois, 306, and Wisconsin, 75. In contrast, \nIllinois exported only two guns traced to crime in Mississippi.\n  In Mississppi, 268 guns involved in a crime were traced right back to \nMississippi. In contrast, 306 Mississippi guns were traced to crimes in \nIllinois. Overall, Illinois pays a heavier price for Mississippi's lax \ngun control laws than Mississippi does.\n  In contrast to the weak gun law States, Illinois has tough gun laws. \nThat's why per capita, Illinois barely plays a role in the gunrunning \nbusiness. States with laxer gun control laws are acting as exporters to \nIllinois. Illinois accounted for 2 percent of the gun exports traced in \ncrimes in other States. In contrast, Texas and Florida accounted for \nalmost 14 percent of those gun exports.\n  Mr. President, I believe that it is time to shut down the firearms \nfreeway to Illinois. That is why I am happy to sponsor this bill. This \nmeasure will let everyone know that we are quite serious about this, \nthat the gunrunning black market is not just a harmless little business \nventure. People who run trunkloads of guns into another State are doing \nso for the sole purpose of making money off selling guns to people they \nknow intend to use the gun in crime. This bill provides for a 3-year \nmandatory minimum for gunrunners. And the penalties will go up with the \nnumber of guns. If you run 50 guns, the penalty is 15 years. This \nlegislation also makes gunrunning a RICO or racketeering predicate. \nWith this tool in place, we can shut down entire gunrunning syndicates.\n  I believe that we should all easily support this measure. It is aimed \nat taking guns out of the hands of criminals.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nadditional material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 658\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

These profiteers legally buy weapons \n     in a state with mild gun laws, and then sell them illegally \n     in another state with tough rules.\n       When these smugglers load up their car trunks with piles of \n     lethal merchandise, they transfer countless weapons from \n     legitimate commerce to the black market--and the guns often \n     end up in criminals' hands.\n       A handful of states like Mississippi and Florida are \n     typical shopping stops for the nation's gunrunners, who then \n     sell the weapons in states like New York, New Jersey, and \n     Illinois--the losers in this deadly game of firearms \n     smuggling.\n       The five worst offenders per capita are Mississippi, South \n     Carolina, West Virginia, Nevada, and Kansas.\n       Several interstate highways are ``firearms freeways''--\n     favorite smuggling routes for gunrunners. Illegally \n     transported guns head north up I-95 from Florida, Georgia and \n     South Carolina to New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, or \n     north from Mississippi along I-55 to Illinois.\n       This independent analysis of data on 1996 firearms traces \n     makes several trends crystal clear:\n       1. Gunrunners' bazaars: Guns used in crimes are most likely \n     to come from just a few states with relatively weak gun \n     control laws. Just the top four states--Florida, Texas, South \n     Carolina, and Georgia--account for a quarter of the traces. \n     This trend is even more stark when analyzed based on \n     population: several small states provide far more than their \n     share of guns to criminals, and these states have \n     particularly weak laws.\n       2. Home sweet home: In states with strong gun laws, \n     criminals obtain the majority of their guns from other \n     states; in states with weaker gun laws, criminals obtain the \n     majority of their guns locally.\n       3. One-way streets: Illicit traffic along the ``firearms \n     freeways'' moves only in one direction: from states with less \n     gun control to those with more.\n       4. Love thy neighbor: When neighboring states have \n     different approaches to firearms regulation, the state with \n     lax laws floods its stricter neighbor with guns that are used \n     in crime.\n       These clear patterns show the urgent need for a nationwide \n     effort to stop gun smuggling between states. In particular, \n     Congressman Schumer is proposing tough new federal penalties \n     for gunrunning crimes and increased resources for \n     investigations of firearms trafficking.\n\n\n               findings: gunrunning is a national problem\n\n       The tables that follow this page tell the story of a \n     thriving illegal trade that crisscrosses the nation. The \n     customers for this business are street gangs and murderers, \n     drug dealers and muggers. The salespeople are interstate \n     gunrunners who exploit the discrepancies in different states' \n     gun laws to supply weapons on the black market. And the \n     suppliers are states where gun laws get a failing grade.\n\n                   Table 1: Guns crossing State lines\n\n       Table 1 shows how many guns sold in a particular state were \n     traced to crimes in other states by the federal Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms in 1996.\n       The table demonstrates how lopsided these figures are. The \n     two states that provide the most guns to criminals in other \n     states--Florida (1,243) and Texas (1,068)--account for almost \n     14% of all such traces, and the top four states account for a \n     quarter. A majority of the out-of-state guns (54.2%) come \n     from just the top ten states--more than the other 40 states \n     and Washington, DC combined.\n       Note that the numbers in Table 1 account for all guns \n     recovered by law enforcement and traced, not all guns used in \n     crimes. In reality, these states are selling far more guns to \n     criminals than indicated on the table.\n\n             Table 2: Guns crossing State lines per capita\n\n       Table 2 adjusts for population, more clearly demonstrating \n     the link between weak gun laws and the sale of guns used in \n     other states' crimes.\n       The ``export rate'' shows how many guns were traced from \n     crimes elsewhere per 100,000 state residents. In other words, \n     for every 100,000 Mississippi residents, 29 guns were sold in \n     Mississippi and traced to crimes in another state. For every \n     100,000 New Yorkers, 1.19 guns were sent to out-of-state \n     criminals.\n       Each state was rated on how strongly its rules crack down \n     on gunrunners' easy access to weapons. The ratings of state \n     gun laws are explained more fully in an appendix. Overall, 27 \n     of the states are rated ``very weak'' because they have no \n     significant restrictions beyond those required under federal \n     regulation, such as the Brady Law. Four of the states were \n     rated ``weak,'' four ``moderate,'' six ``strong,'' and ten \n     ``very strong.''\n       By controlling for population, Table 2 underscores the \n     dramatic impact of state gun laws on gun trafficking \n     patterns. None of the top ten states on Table 2 had \n     ``strong'' or ``very strong'' ratings. Six of the ten are \n     ``very weak.''\n\n             TABLE 1.--CRIME GUNS CROSSING STATE LINES--1996\n [State-by-State breakdown of guns used in out-of-State crimes by place\n                             of origination]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  Total\n            Rank                            State                exports\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1...........................

The medium-sized and large \n     states that dominate the top of Table 1 are responsible for a \n     vast proportion of the guns traced to crimes across the \n     country.\n       The top two states, Florida and Texas, supplied 14% of the \n     guns traced to crime in other states. These two states along \n     with South Carolina and Georgia account for a quarter of the \n     traces.\n       A majority of the guns traced across state lines in 1996 \n     (54.2%) came from just the top ten states--more than the \n     other 40 states and Washington, DC combined. Five of these \n     states have gun laws rated ``very weak'' (Florida, Texas, \n     Georgia, Ohio, and Mississippi).\n       In contrast, New York, New Jersey, Michigan and Minnesota, \n     four very large states with strong gun laws, accounted for \n     only 3.6% of those out-of-state guns.\n       Top-ranked Florida dealers sold about as many guns traced \n     to crime in other states (1,243) as did ten other medium-\n     sized or large states combined: New York (215), Michigan \n     (200), Missouri (155), Connecticut (134), Oregon (116), \n     Minnesota (106), Iowa (99), Massachusetts (90), New Jersey \n     (75), and Nebraska (54).\n       By controlling the data for population, Table 2 \n     demonstrates how weak gun laws attract gunrunners. Analyzing \n     the data on a per capita basis demonstrates that even quite \n     small states can be mother lodes for gunrunners--if their \n     laws are accommodating.\n       Adjusted for population, Mississippi supplied the most guns \n     traced to other states' crimes. The explanation: except for \n     some limitations on juveniles, Mississippi has no significant \n     gun control laws of its own. Mississippi was closely followed \n     as a gun-providing state by South Carolina, West Virginia, \n     Nevada, and Kansas. Three of these four states have gun \n     control laws just as weak as Mississippi.\n       On a per capita basis, the fewest out-of-state guns came \n     from New Jersey, New York, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Rhode \n     Island, Michigan and Minnesota. All these states except Rhode \n     Island were rated ``very strong;'' Rhode Island's laws are \n     ``strong.''\n       A gun traced to crime is twenty-five times more likely per \n     capita to come from Mississippi or South Carolina than from \n     New York or New Jersey.\n       Although New York's population is seven times larger than \n     Mississippi, Mississippi had three times more out-of-state \n     traces than New York.\n\n\nTREND 2: HOME SWEET HOME--In States With Lax Laws, More Crime Guns Come \n                             From In-State\n\n       In states with weak gun laws, criminals can shop at their \n     neighborhood gun store. By contrast, criminals in states with \n     tough gun control laws must obtain out-of-state guns on the \n     black market to perpetrate violent crimes.\n       More than three quarters of the gun traces from crimes in \n     South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida, Kansas, Ohio \n     and Texas lead back to dealers in the same state.\n       Less than one quarter of the guns traced from crimes in New \n     York (23.5%), New Jersey (21.2%) were bought in these states, \n     which have strict laws.\n       A majority (53%) of the crime guns traced to states with \n     ``very strong'' laws were purchased out-of-state. There were \n     13,760 guns traced to crimes in these 10 states (New Jersey, \n     New York, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan, the District of \n     Columbia, Illinois, Connecticut, and North Carolina).\n       Less than a quarter (23%) of the crime guns traced to \n     states with ``very weak'' laws were purchased out-of-state. \n     There were 15,046 guns traced to crimes in 26 of these states \n     (data for West Virginia was incomplete and not included in \n     this figure).\n\n\n    TREND 3: ONE-WAY STREETS--``Firearm Freeways'' Move In Only One \n                               Direction\n\n       The data shows how gunrunners use major interstate highways \n     as their smuggling routes. It also shows how those routes \n     move primarily in one direction--from states with less \n     stringent gun control to those with stricter rules.\n       I-95: The Most Travelled Highway in America Extends from \n     Southern Florida to Northernmost Maine:\n       North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida--the \n     four southernmost states on I-95--were the source of 1,199 \n     guns traced to crimes in the nine northeast states from \n     Pennsylvania to Maine. These same nine northeastern states \n     accounted for a total of just 64 guns traced to the four \n     southeastern states--95% fewer.\n       702 guns bought in South Carolina, Georgia, or Florida were \n     traced to crimes in New York or New Jersey. On the other \n     hand, just 11 guns bought in New York or New Jersey were \n     traced to crimes in South Carolina, Georgia, or Florida.\n       Despite distance of 1,200 miles, Florida was the largest \n     supplier of out-of-state guns traced to crimes in \n     Massachusetts (40 gun traces). In contrast, just three guns \n     from Florida crimes came from Massachusetts. Georgia was the \n     second biggest source for Massachusetts, sending 30 guns to \n     the Bay State, while not a single trace from any Georgia \n     crime led back to Massachusetts.\n       I-55: Beginning in New Orleans, I-55 Runs Alongside the \n     Mississippi River to Jackson, Memphis and St. Louis before \n     Veering East to Springfield and Chicago:\n       Mississippi is the top supplier of out-of-state guns to \n     Illinois (306) and Wisconsin (75). Illinois and Wisconsin are \n     home to only four guns traced to crime in Mississippi.\n       Of all the guns traced to Mississippi, there were more \n     linked to crimes hundreds of miles away in Illinois (306) \n     than at home in Mississippi (268).\n       Louisiana sold 89 guns traced to crimes in Illinois, \n     Michigan, Missouri, and Wisconsin. These four states combined \n     sent just six guns down to Louisiana.\n\n\n  trend 4: love thy neighbor--the borders between some states are hot \n                          zones for gunrunners\n\n       When a state with loose gun laws borders on one with \n     stricter rules, the lax state floods the tough neighbor with \n     firearms.\n       Kansas: Dealers in Kansas sold 238 guns that were traced to \n     crime in Missouri. Missouri, which has a gun permit \n     requirement rated ``strong,'' sent only three crime guns back \n     across the border to Kansas.\n       South Carolina: Dealers in South Carolina sold 430 guns \n     that were traced to crimes in North Carolina. North Carolina, \n     which has much stricter gun control laws, is home to only two \n     guns traced to crimes in South Carolina.\n       Ohio: Ohio is perhaps the gunrunners' favorite northern \n     state, spreading firearms to criminals throughout the region. \n     Ohio sold 235 guns that went north to Michigan criminals, but \n     only 26 traces went the other way from Michigan dealers to \n     Ohio criminals. Similarly, Ohio was the source of 226 guns \n     traced to crimes in Pennsylvania, Maryland, New York, New \n     Jersey and the District. These five jurisdictions were the \n     source of just 24 guns traced to crimes in Ohio.\n       Indiana: While 306 guns from Indiana were traced to crimes \n     in Illinois, only 41 Illinois guns were traced to crimes in \n     Indiana. Hoosier gun dealers also sold 50 guns traced from \n     Wisconsin (which sent 22 to Indiana) and 77 to Michigan \n     (which sent 17 to Indiana).\n\n\n                            notes on sources\n\n       This study analyzes the 47,068 guns which the federal \n     Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) traced to a \n     final retail purchaser in 1996. ATF traces firearms at the \n     request of law enforcement agencies; not all firearms seized \n     in crimes are traced, and some are traced by local \n     authorities rather than by ATF. ATF supplied raw data at \n     Congressman Charles Schumer's request and did not contribute \n     to the analysis contained in this report.\n       Of all the traces, 16,663--35%--were used in crimes outside \n     of the state where they were bought. This subset was used for \n     analysis on ``out-of-state'' guns.\n       Handgun Control, Inc. provided summaries of state laws on \n     gun control, but bears no responsibility for the rankings. \n     Supplementary information was obtained from law enforcement \n     authorities or government offices in various states.\n       Population data was based on the 1995 Census as reported in \n     the ``Statistical Abstract of the United States.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GLENN (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. DeWine, \n        Ms. Moseley-Braun, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 659. A bill to amend the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration \nAct of 1990 to provide for implementation of recommendations of the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service contained in the Great Lakes Fishery \nRestoration Study Report; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n\n\n       the great lakes fish and wildlife restoration act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, this week our nation celebrates the 27th \nanniversary of Earth Day. In 1970, the inaugural year of Earth Day, the \nNation's consciousness was raised about the plight of our environment. \nThe Great\n\n[[Page S3736]]\n\nLakes were held up as some of the worst examples of human abuse; Lake \nErie was given up for dead, the victim of unrestrained pollution and \nthe misuse of its precious natural resources. The Cuyahoga River caught \nfire and phosphate-based soap suds washed up on shorelines throughout \nthe Nation. The Great Lakes region responded to the alarm with \nunprecedented vigor.\n  In 1971 I headed the Governor's Task Force on Environmental \nProtection in Ohio, a forerunner to today's Ohio EPA. In a spirit of \nregional cooperation, the surrounding States, Native American Tribes, \nand Canada entered into collective agreements that recognized the Great \nLakes as a set of shared resources within a single ecosystem. Important \nenvironmental legislation was designed and implemented to combat \npollution and clean up the environment.\n  Since that time, water quality has improved dramatically and \nfisheries scientists are witnessing recovery of fish populations in \neach of the lakes. Lake Erie is experiencing rebounds in lake whitefish \npopulations thought impossible just 10 years ago. This past summer, the \nFish and Wildlife Service announced that lake trout populations in Lake \nSuperior are now self-sustaining, needing no further stocking. There \nare many success stories in the Great Lakes, suggesting the ecological \nhealth of our lakes is on the mend, but the job is not yet complete. \nDegraded habitats, reduced fish and wildlife populations, and the \nthreat from nonindigenous species still imperil the well being of our \nlakes.\n  Today my colleague from the House of Representatives, Congressman\nLa Tourette of Ohio, and I will introduce a bill into the House and \nSenate that will continue the recovery process of the Great Lakes and \ntheir associated natural resources. This bill, the Great Lakes Fish and \nWildlife Restoration Act of 1997 builds upon the Great Lakes Fish and \nWildlife Restoration Act of 1990. The 1990 act authorized the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service to undertake a comprehensive study to first, \nassess the status of fishery resources and their habitats and second, \nto gauge the effectiveness of management strategies used to protect \nthese resources. The study's findings recommend a definite course of \naction for the continued restoration of the region's natural resources. \nThe full implementation of the strategic plan for management of Great \nLakes fisheries and the institution of a comprehensive and standardized \necological monitoring system for all lakes are just 2 of 32 specific \nrecommendations set forth by the study.\n  The Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act represents a new \ngeneration of environmental legislation, one that recognizes the \ncomplexity and interrelatedness of ecosystems. This act seeks to \naddress natural resource management in a comprehensive and \nconscientious manner by building partnerships among the Great Lakes \nStates, United States and Canadian Governments, and Native American \ntribes. Through regional cooperation, I believe we can address the \nenvironmental and economic concerns of the Great Lakes basin and \ncontinue the recovery that began some 27 years ago. By supporting this \nlegislation, we in the Congress will be taking the right next step \ntoward responsible stewardship of the Great Lakes as we venture into \nthe new millenium.\n\n

I am proud to announce \nthat the class from Westminster Christian Academy will represent \nMissouri. These young scholars have worked diligently to reach the \nnational finals by winning local competitions in their home State.\n  The distinguished members of the team representing Missouri are: \nDavid Bradsher, Christopher Brown, Russell Bruch, Jessica Cozad, Tony \nCulella, Josh Darr, Elizabeth Erkmann, Lauren Gray, Joshua Hamer, \nMatthew Harris, Angela Heirendt, Joshua Hendricks, Sarah Henning, \nRachael Higby, Charles Hinderliter, Valerie Hopkins, Shauna Kruse, Nina \nLangenberg, Taylor Long, Stacey McDowell, Mark Pollitt, Kelly Reed, \nJordan Reinwald, Christine Shoemaker, Anna Suh, and Megan Turner.\n  I shall also recognize their teacher, Ken Boesch, who also serves as \ndistrict coordinator for the program, and Terry Taylor, the State \ncoordinator, who also contributed a significant amount of time and \neffort to help the team reach the national finals.\n  The We the People * * * The Citizen and the Constitution Program is \nthe most extensive educational program in the country developed \nspecifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the \nBill of Rights. The 3-day national competition simulates a \ncongressional hearing in which students' oral presentations are judged \non the basis of their knowledge of constitutional principles and their \nability to apply them to historical and contemporary issues.\n  Now in its 10th academic year, this constitutional studies program \nhas had more than 75,000 teachers and 24 million students participate \nnationwide at both the elementary and secondary school levels. Members \nof Congress and their staff enhance the program by discussing current \nconstitutional issues with students and teachers. The We the People * * \n* program provides an excellent opportunity for students to gain an \ninformed perspective on the significance of the U.S. Constitution and \nits place in our history and our lives. I wish these students the best \nof luck in the national finals and look forward to their continued \nsuccess in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3737-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING R. PAUL NELSON\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nremarkable educator from my home State of Michigan, R. Paul Nelson. Mr. \nNelson, the president of Aquinas College in Grand Rapids, MI, is \nretiring after 28 years of service to the Aquinas College community.\n  Paul Nelson joined Aquinas College in 1969, where he was responsible \nfor advising and retaining students. In 1975, Mr. Nelson became dean \nfor continuing education, where he implemented innovative programming \nin adult education. He helped to create Aquinas' Graduate Management \nProgram, which is now the largest masters degree program in western \nMichigan.\n  In 1984, Mr. Nelson became vice-president for student development, \nand he established a model career development program which used both \nfield experience and internships to help students explore and begin to \nattain their career goals.\n  In 1990, Paul Nelson was named president of Aquinas College by the \nboard of trustees. In his 7 years at the helm of this vibrant \ninstitution, Mr. Nelson brought to life his vision of an Aquinas \nCollege which serves as a ``faith and values-centered learning \ncommunity committed to educating the whole person for a life and career \nof service.''\n  Mr. Nelson has been an accessible leader whose remarkable ability to \nremember the name of any student he met on campus is well known. His \ndedication to educating people of all ages and promoting lifelong \nlearning should be a model for all who seek a career in higher \neducation. I have no doubt that his career will be an inspiration for \nfuture educators, students and administrators at Aquinas College.\n  Mr. President, I am honored by the opportunity to recognize the \nachievements of R. Paul Nelson, and hope my colleagues will join me in \nextending congratulations and best wishes to him on the occasion of his \nretirement as president of Aquinas College.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3737-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              LOYALTY DAY\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, on July 18, 1958, through Joint \nResolution 479, the Senate and the House of Representatives designated \nthe first day of May of each year as Loyalty Day. On this special day, \nAmericans celebrate the reaffirmation of their loyalty to the United \nStates of America in recognition of America's unmatched heritage of \nfreedom. I would like to join Americans across the land in this \ncelebration, particularly the fine Americans of Climax Springs VFW \nMemorial Post 3600 in Climax Springs, MO. Post 3600 will have their \n12th annual Loyalty Day parade on May 3, 1997.\n  On this important day of reaffirming our loyalty to America, we must \nreflect on what it truly means to be an American. Thomas Jefferson \nidentified the ideals so important to us when he said that all men are \n``endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among \nthese are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' Even in a time \nof great national trauma, Abraham Lincoln could echo these sentiments \nby stating that America is a nation ``conceived in liberty and \ndedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal,'' and \n``that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom * * * \nthat government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not \nperish from this Earth.''\n  The fundamental principle in these two statements by these two great \nAmericans is the significance of liberty in the American experience. \nThis historical commitment to freedom, most clearly seen in the lives \nof those who have fought and died for our country, deserves not only \nour loyalty but a celebration of that loyalty. That is the essence of \nLoyalty Day and I urge all Americans throughout this great land to join \nClimax Springs VFW Post 3600 in the celebration of the freedoms God has \nblessed us with in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3737-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3737-S3738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I supported Senate Executive \nResolution 75, a substitute for the resolution of ratification of the \nChemical Weapons Convention [CWC] offered by Senator\n\n[[Page S3738]]\n\nHelms. I thank my colleagues Senator Helms, Senator Kyl, and Senator \nBiden for their hard work over the last several days and their \nleadership in bringing the Chemical Weapons Treaty debate to the floor.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Dick Lugar for his support as we \nprepared for this debate. Senator Lugar's detailed analysis of the many \ncomplicated issues of the treaty have been invaluable. Without doubt \nthis treaty is better than when we started.\n  Mr. President, though new to this body, I am fully aware of the \nseriousness of the task before us and I appreciate the thorough quality \nof the debate.\n  I have studied this treaty and its components. I have reviewed a \ntremendous amount of associated materials provided me from all \nquarters.\n  I, like so many of my colleagues, even at this late moment in the \ndebate, still have outstanding concerns with certain provisions of the \nChemical Weapons Convention, most notably the effects articles X and XI \nwill have on our country. Yesterday, the President, in a letter to the \nmajority leader, basically stated that,\n\n       In the event that a state party or states parties to the \n     convention act contrary to the obligations under Article I . \n     . . I would, consistent with Article XVI of the CWC, and in \n     consultation with the Congress, be prepared to withdraw from \n     the treaty.\n\n  Mr. President, I am still not sure that the President will act, or at \nleast act decisively, when the situation warrants because our current \ntrack record of taking strong action when other nations violate \ntreaties and agreements with us is not good. Let me cite a few examples \nof what I mean.\n  The 1972 AMB Treaty. Recently, the President reaffirmed his \ncommitment to the outmoded ABM treaty in Helsinki. This agreement will \nlimit the ability of this Nation to deploy even a limited national \nmissile defense. Is this wise, given the way the Soviets responded to \nthe initial treaty by continuing to work on a new generation of ICBM's \nand associated warheads? Was not this treaty ironclad? Apparently not. \nWhat did we really do in the face of the violations? Nothing.\n\n  The Iran-Iraq war. Iraq, according to a conversation I had with \nformer Secretary of Defense under President Carter Jim Schlesinger, \nIraq has been and is a signatory to the Geneva Convention which since \nafter World War I has prohibited the use of chemical weapons, yet in \nthe Iran-Iraq war of the eighties, Iraq used poison gas as a way of \nstemming the human wave attacks of the Iranians. What was the reaction \nof the United States and of other Western Powers to this blatant \nviolation of the Geneva Convention? ``To avert our gaze'' might be a \nway to put it. Stated another way, we stood by and did nothing even \nthough the war was not one of international proportions.\n  There are other examples as well: Saddam Hussein chose not to employ \nhis chemical weapons against American troops for one reason only. It \nwas because of the reminder that President Bush provided him, rather \nthan our reliance on a treaty.\n  Oh yes, that reminder was, according to Secretary Baker, that the \nUnited States made it very clear that if Iraq used chemical weapons \nagainst United States forces, that the American people will demand \nvengeance, and that we had the means to achieve it. This is an example \nof where we were finally willing to do what was necessary.\n  Mr. President that is my point this evening. We are a superpower. We \nhave the means to achieve the ends required by our national interests \nshould it be required. The question then is whether this treaty \nachieves those ends, or whether this treaty will create a false sense \nof security; a phantom security that is provided by others whose \ninterests more often than not conflict with our own. I find it \ndifficult to believe that a rogue state with little means at its \ndisposal would be willing to divest itself of such weapons.\n  Mr. President, in 1987, former Senator Malcolm Wallop explained in \nhis book how arms control can be a delusion. We might stop and consider \nthis point before we vote because former Senator Wallop also reminds us \nthat Arms control presents four dangers: the falsehood that security is \nto be found in the promises of adversaries rather than in one's own \nprudence and preparedness; the falsehood that one should fear inanimate \nthings--weapons--rather than the evil men and regimes who would use \nthem for bad purposes; the falsehood that armaments are militarily \nvaluable only as bargaining chips in the arms control process; and \nfinally, the falsehood that U.S. strategic superiority is both useless \nand destabilizing to the world. Mr. President, I believe strongly in \nthis Nation. I believe strongly that our strength lies where it has \nalways been, both in the hearts of Americans, and in our own industry. \nI am not ashamed to admit I would rather be self-reliant because that \nmeans our confidence will be placed in Americans, not in some inspector \nfrom an international bureaucracy.\n\n  I, Mr. President, am not ashamed to admit that I am proud of the \nmilitary superiority our Nation enjoys, paid for by American taxpayers, \nand manifested in the men and women of our Armed Forces. They deserve \nthe best equipment, training, and protection this Nation can provide. \nIt troubles me that while we sit here ready to hand over the security \nfor chemical defense that rightfully belongs here, we are allowing the \nDepartment of Defense to reduce its chemical defense program. Finally, \nMr. President, I am not ashamed to admit that when our adversaries \nconsider chemical weapons we need to send a message just as strong as \nthe message that America sent to Saddam Hussein--we will respond, and \nwe will do so in an overwhelming and devastating manner. That is a \nmessage all state parties can understand. We shouldn't wobble, nor shy \naway from the responsibility to our citizens. People are responsible \nfor the proliferation of chemical weapons, not pieces of paper, and to \nthis end we are woefully overconfident if we think a simple piece of \npaper will stop the proliferation of chemical weapons.\n  Mr. President, the question is truly one of vigilance. Are we better \noff taking care of ourselves, using our own resources, empowering our \nown intelligence services to keep abreast of the threats abroad? I \nthink so.\n  I cannot agree with the proposition, that I read in the Washington \nPost recently, ``That standards and values violated are better than no \nstandards or values at all.'' America has standards and it certainly \nhas values. We are eliminating our chemical weapons and we must not \nrely unverifiable and unenforced international norms, which according \nto former Secretary of Defense Jim Schlesinger ``will induce a false \nsense of security in law-abiding societies.''\n  Mr. President, in closing I want to leave my colleagues with the \nwords of Senator Wallop: ``Unverifiable, unenforceable accords do not \npromote valuable international norms. The difference is that the former \nthreaten to make arms control a sham--an outcome that can translate \ninto incalculable harm to our Nation and its people.'' We should not \nenter into a treaty which we know at the start will not be honored. \nThis demeans the treaty process and only increases the likelihood that \nwe will fail in our duty to protect the security of this Nation. I \nthank the chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/25/senate-section/article/S3737-5", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          VOLUNTEER PROTECTION ACT OF 1997--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.
