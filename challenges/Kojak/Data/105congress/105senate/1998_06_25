This morning the Senate will resume consideration of the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. Under the previous order, \nSenator Wellstone will immediately be recognized to offer an amendment \nregarding Department of Defense schools under a 30-minute time \nagreement. I see he is here, ready to go.\n  At the expiration of that debate time, the Senate will proceed to \nvote on or in relation to the Wellstone amendment. Following that vote, \nthere will be 10 minutes for closing remarks with respect to the Inhofe \namendment, regarding the base closure issue, with a vote occurring \nfollowing that debate. There will then be 10 minutes for closing \nremarks with respect to the Harkin amendment that was debated last \nnight, which deals with the VA health care issue, followed by a vote in \nrelation to that amendment.\n  Therefore, three votes will occur beginning, I presume, shortly after \n10 o'clock this morning. Following those votes, it is hoped that \nMembers will come to the floor and offer and debate remaining \namendments, with the understanding that the bill will be concluded \nduring today's session. I believe that is possible. But once again, it \ntakes cooperation and commitment to agree to reasonable time limits and \nget to a conclusion on this bill so we can move to a number of other \nvery important issues that we are trying to get cleared, or \nappropriations bills.\n  We will make an effort to get short time agreements with regard to \nthe clean needles bill, the reading excellence bill, the drug czar \nreauthorization bill, perhaps the higher education bill, and any other \nappropriations bills that we may take up, plus some Executive Calendar \nitems we would like to be able to get done before we go home for the \nFourth of July recess, but they are all related to each other. If we \nget cooperation on the one side, there will be cooperation on the \nother; if we don't get cooperation and clearance on the bills, the \nExecutive Calendar will have to wait for another week, month, or year.\n  Also, the Senate can be expected to consider, prior to the \nIndependence Day recess, as I mentioned, the higher education bill. I \nthink we are very close to getting an agreement worked out on that. We \ncan expect votes throughout the day, into the night, and on Friday. \nThere will be at least two votes on Friday, and Senators need to be \naware of that.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7039-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7039-S7050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum).

The Senator is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I introduce this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Boxer. This amendment focuses on a real need in our \nArmed Forces. Really, we are talking about the children. We are talking \nabout the need to have comprehensive child care for our families who \nserve in our Armed Forces who, after all, are involved in very \nimportant service for our Nation.\n  Back in the 1980s this body began looking at the state of child care. \nThanks to the leadership of Senator Kennedy, funding was appropriated \nto build child-care centers that provided new services to families of \nmilitary personnel. Subsequently, the Department of Defense's child-\ncare programs have been able to provide quality--by the way, this is a \nmodel for the Nation--quality service to thousands of children of \nmilitary personnel. But, by 1995, we find out that there is really a \ntremendous need, and while there are some 299,000 children served, \nthere are 155,000 children of families that are requesting child-care \nservices. This amendment is an effort to bridge this gap.\n\n  For the parents of these 144,000 children--really, close to 155,000 \nchildren--requesting this, this is a huge issue. It is difficult to do \nwell when you are worried about whether or not your children have good \ncare, and this amendment speaks to this problem. If you don't have \npeace of mind while you are serving our country, if you don't believe \nyour child is receiving good care, what we are trying to do is provide \nthe necessary family support services.\n  There are a variety of different components that we are talking \nabout. We are talking about, of course, early childhood development. \nThat is to say, when both parents are working and you are trying to \nfigure out what you are going to do with your child--and, look, for our \nmilitary personnel, but also for all of our families--when both of you \nhave to work, you know full well that the most important thing is to \nmake sure that your child is receiving good child care. But for too \nmany citizens in our country, and for too many military families, they \nare not able to fill that need. This amendment takes us a long way \ntoward filling that need.\n  In addition, there is the issue of afterschool care for younger \nchildren who are going home, but going home alone, again, when both \nparents have to work, trying to fill that very important need for \nmilitary personnel; or there are occasions when there is a place to \ndrop a child off from time to time when a parent or parents need to do \nso. Now, it is not free. What we have is a sliding fee scale basis of \nchild care right now within the military, which is the way I think it \nshould be done. Actually, the average fee is about $65 per child per \nweek. It ranges from $35 to $88.\n  The funding for the child development program of the Department of \nDefense is about $295 million. About 52 percent of the children have \nbeen served. What we are now trying to do is move toward serving the \nchildren for the vast majority of these families by, over a year \nperiod, increasing the appropriations by $270 million.\n  The offset is as follows: We simply say, take one-tenth of 1 percent, \none-tenth of 1 penny of every dollar, which now goes to the Pentagon \nbudget, and just do an across-the-board cut. We have had studies that \ntalk about administrative expenses that go way beyond this in terms of \nadministrative waste. If you were just to make a cut in the waste and \nbe more efficient, one-tenth of 1 percent--and I make this appeal to my \ncolleagues--you could then appropriate this $270 million over a 5-year \nperiod. We would start with $41 million next fiscal year and, \nultimately, we would build up, by the year 2003, to $270 million.\n  What we are trying to do is to make sure that we meet a real need of \nour military personnel and their families. What we are trying to do is \nprovide the service for as close to all of the children of military \npersonnel as possible. What we are trying to do is build on the \nDepartment of Defense's child care program, which is a huge success. I \nhave had an opportunity to talk with the people that run that program. \nI am very proud of what they do, but it seems to me that one of the \nbest things we could do within the DOD budget is just simply say for a \nvery small--one-tenth of 1 percent--cut across the board, you can take \nit out of waste easily and we could then have $270 million over a 5-\nyear period, which would help--again, let me be crystal clear about \nthis--somewhere in the neighborhood of 150,000 children. Just think of \nhow many military families we could help through this amendment. I hope \nthat there will be support for this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nI share the Senator's concerns regarding the need to provide adequate \nresources to such worthy projects. Therefore, the bill we have before \nus fully authorizes the President's budget request for the Department \nof Defense Child Development Program. The committee has also \nrecommended an additional $23.0 million in this bill to construct five \nnew child care centers.\n  Unfortunately, the Defense budget has declined so dramatically over \nthe past several years that we cannot afford to reduce other programs \nbelow their current levels without significantly jeopardizing near and \nlong-term military readiness. Furthermore, I believe that this \namendment has some technical problems.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I need 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, let me say that, as usual, our \nfriend from Minnesota is fighting for a cause that is an important one. \nI think he is one of the leaders in this body of trying to make sure we \nhave enough money for child care, child development, and it is \nimportant that leadership exist in this area. I commend him on that.\n  The defense budget this year shows a greater than 10-percent increase \nin this\n\n[[Page S7041]]\n\narea. So I think the Defense Department is right when they give us the \nfacts and tell us that they have a program for significant improvement \nin child care, in part, by the way, because of the efforts of people in \nthis body many years ago. They have a projected significant increase \nover these years, in part, may I say, because of our former colleague, \nBill Cohen. Secretary Cohen was a leader in the effort to provide child \ncare in this Senate. He is totally dedicated to it in the military.\n  The DOD effort, the planned effort to significantly increase the \namount of child care, is requiring them to go off base frequently in \norder to do that, to get facilities off the site of the facility \nitself, and to go into the neighboring communities to get child care. \nBut they are on that course of action. They are doing that, and they \nshould. But they have put in this budget this year approximately a 10-\npercent increase in funding for child care. It is part of a significant \nincrease that has been projected over a number of years for child care, \nand it is in the hands of the Secretary of Defense, who, when he was in \nthe Senate, showed a tremendous commitment in this area and has \ncontinued that commitment as Secretary of Defense.\n  So the increases that are significant have been planned. They are \nproceeding in a planned way. The Defense Department feels that it is \nproceeding as quickly and as administratively feasible and efficiently, \nand I would, therefore, oppose the Senator's amendment.\n  I do so with some reluctance because of the subject matter. But \ndespite that reluctance, I feel that the Defense Department is \nproceeding on pace, in a planned way, and most importantly, proceeding \nin a way that involves a significant increase in expansion in child \ncare, despite the fact that the number of people in the armed services \nis being reduced, and it is all under the leadership of a Secretary of \nDefense who has shown a commitment to child care over the years.\n  So for those reasons I will oppose the Senator's amendment. But, \nagain, I express my feeling that, as he so often does, he is addressing \nan issue that is an important issue for the Nation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I appreciate both my colleagues' \nremarks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that excerpts from a CRS study be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [Excerpt from CRS Report for Congress, Sept. 14, 1995]\n\n       Military Child Care Provisions: Background and Legislation\n\n(By David F.

Mr. President, the Department of Defense had its own \ninternal study in 1995. I agree with my colleague from Michigan in his \npraise of our Secretary of Defense and his commitment.\n  I don't think the Secretary of Defense would disapprove of this body \ntaking yet another step forward in this area.\n  We had an internal study in 1995 where the DOD essentially said, \n``Look, we can only satisfy 52 percent of the need for child care of \nfamilies in the armed services.'' I am looking at almost 50 percent of \nthe families not able to get the care for their children that they \nneed. As far as how we do this, we are very clear that this gets phased \nin over a period of time.\n  As I said to my colleagues, we start next fiscal year with the $41 \nmillion, and then we gradually increase it, so that by the year 2003 it \nis $70 million. Overall it is $270 million, one-tenth of 1 percent of \nthe overall budget. There have been plenty of studies that say we spend \nway more than that in administrative ways.\n  I cannot believe that the Secretary of Defense, or certainly anybody \nwho is involved with the Department of Defense child care program, \nwould not say, ``Senators, if you are willing to take one-tenth of 1 \npercent across the board, and you will earmark that for expanding child \ncare services so that we can meet the needs of 155,000 children and \ntheir families, we are for it.''\n  I again appeal to my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Who yields time? If no one yields \ntime, it will be divided equally.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 55 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If my colleagues have essentially yielded their time, \nor may now reserve some of their time, let me try to summarize it.\n  Let me try to make this appeal again. We have a 1995 study which \nsays, ``Look, almost 50 percent of the families are hurting here. They \nneed the child care services.'' I have a Congressional Research Service \nstudy that says the same thing. We phase it in over a 5-year period. It \nis a total of $270 million, one-tenth of 1 percent of the overall \nPentagon budget.\n  Isn't part of our readiness making sure that these families of our \nmilitary personnel can feel secure that their children are getting good \nchild care? Can't we do this in our budget for our military families?\n  The medical evidence is overwhelming about the importance of early \nchildhood development. It is overwhelming about the development of the \nbrain. It is overwhelming that we ought to do better. This amendment \nenables us to do this. I guess I am disappointed in the opposition, \nalthough, of course, everybody has a right to take whatever view they \nwant to.\n  I make yet one final appeal to my colleagues to please support this \namendment. It is eminently reasonable, eminently balanced, and it \nreally does a world of good for military families.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield time to the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we spoke with the Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of Defense, Carolyn Becraft. She is in charge of their family \nprogram. They oppose this amendment.\n  When the Senator says he can't believe that the Defense Department \nwould not support this, or the people in charge of families and child \ncare would not support this amendment, we asked them what their \nposition was. Their position is that the child care program is funded \nin a way to expand the availability of child care in a planned way.\n  I want to emphasize that. We have a significant expansion in child \ncare in the Defense Department underway. It is because of the \ninitiative of many people within the Defense Department and outside, \nincluding Members of this body. It is under the supervision of a \nSecretary of Defense who is totally committed to child care. He showed \nthat when he was in this body, and he has continued to show that as \nSecretary of Defense. The Defense Department has this significant \nexpansion, which is ongoing in a planned way, and that is why they do \nnot support this additional increase.\n  That comes from the Assistant Secretary of Defense who is responsible \nfor dealing with the needs of families in the Defense Department.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 2 seconds.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me be clear to my colleagues. I \nbelieve in the basic discussion I have had that a lot of the men and \nwomen in personnel who are involved, I say to my colleagues, who are \nactually involved down in the trenches delivering child care programs \nwithin the Department of Defense child care program, will tell you, \n``Senator, $270 million over 5 years\n\n[[Page S7042]]\n\nwould do us a world of good, because we have almost 50 percent of the \nfamilies we can't serve.''\n  My colleague can get a statement from the director saying, ``Look, we \nare not in favor of this.'' I mean that can be the position that the \nDepartment takes. That is the position that maybe someone who \nadministers the program takes. But with all due respect, I have here a \nCongressional Research Service report. I will quote. This backs up the \ninternal 1995 DOD report.\n\n       In the 1995 survey, potential need for all the services is \n     estimated to be 299,278 child care spaces. Given that there \n     are currently 155,311 spaces, DOD is meeting about 52 percent \n     of the total potential need.\n\n  My colleagues come here to the floor and they say there is already a \nplan to meet this need. But there isn't a plan to meet this need. We \nare talking about a gap of 48 percent.\n  I will say it one more time. Just ask the families. Just talk to the \nfamilies. Ask that 48 percent what it feels like to not have adequate \nchild care, what it feels like when you both have to work and you don't \nknow whether your child is in really good child care, what it feels \nlike when you are both working and your child comes home alone from \nschool.\n  We could do a world of good. The evidence is clear. There is a huge \ngaping need here.\n  With all due respect, whatever official positions we get from DOD on \nthis, the fact of the matter is, I think, the evidence is irrefutable. \nWe have a 48 percent gap, and for 1 penny of 1 dollar, one-tenth of 1 \npercent across the board, look at the studies on administrative waste. \nWe could put $270 million into child care for our military families and \nmeet a huge need. That is the issue.\n  I hope there will be strong support for this amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, just 1 additional minute.\n  The source of these additional funds is across-the-board reduction in \nevery budget activity in the Defense Department. It is not aimed at \nsome category called ``waste.'' I think if there were such a category, \neverybody in this body would identify it. And I have spent a good part \nof my life seeking to identify it, have identified a lot of it, and we \nhave been able to get rid of a lot of it.\n  This amendment would take money from every budget activity, in a very \nsmall amount, which the Senator has identified. But those budget \nactivities for weapons systems are just as important as they are. \nResearch and development is part of that. Those budget activities \ninclude DOD schools, family support centers, commissaries. Families \nneed those things too.\n  So when the Senator makes an unallocated cut across each budget \nactivity, many of those budget activities are as critical to those very \nsame families as we are trying to help with our child care program.\n  Mr. President, again, I oppose this amendment. I hope it is defeated. \nBut I want to end on a positive note and again say how much we \nappreciate the strength with which the Senator from Minnesota supports \nthe kind of causes which are so important to the people of this Nation \nand to the people in the military.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Cardell \nJohnson, an intern in my office, be allowed floor privileges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me just say to my colleagues, this \nis one-tenth of 1 percent, and we have studies on administrative waste \nwithin the Department of Defense. That is my point. It is hard to \nbelieve that we could not take one penny out of $1 of the overall \nbudget and put it into child care to make sure that these families are \nable to receive the support that they deserve. With almost a 50-percent \ngap, according to CRS, a waiting list of 93,000 families for child \ncare, this is a great opportunity to help a lot of military families in \nprobably the most important way we can. All of us who have been parents \nand grandparents know that. So I hope my colleagues will support this \namendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second on the request \nfor the yeas and nays?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Wellstone \namendment No. 2902. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms), the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Hutchinson), and the Senator \nfrom Delaware (Mr. Roth), are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Hutchinson) is \nabsent because of a death in the family.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from Montana (Mr. Baucus), the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn), \nand the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Alan \nEasterling, a legislative fellow in my office, be allowed privileges of \nthe floor during this action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2981\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question \nreoccurs on the Inhofe amendment No. 2981, of which there will be 10 \nminutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, could I ask, who will be controlling the \ntime on the proponents' side of the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma controls the time \nfor the proponents.\n  The Senator from Indiana opposes the amendment and controls the time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding, for clarification, \nthat we have 10 minutes equally divided, and I would like to be \nrecognized to close debate on my amendment.\n\n[[Page S7043]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Senator from Indiana is going to speak in opposition \nto my amendment; if you recognize the Senator from Indiana first, so I \ncan close debate.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, very briefly, in the time we have, I don't \nenjoy opposing matters offered by my friend from Oklahoma, but I have a \nfundamental disagreement with him on this particular issue.\n  We do four basic things in defense: We pay for people and their \nquality of life; we research, develop, and purchase modern weapons and \ngive them the very best capabilities; we support the readiness of our \nforces; and we pay for infrastructure--the bases and all the \ninfrastructure for support.\n  We know four things: We know that our military people are underpaid \nand that their quality of life is suffering; we know they live in \ninadequate housing; we know we have a $10 to $15-billion-a-year \nshortfall in research, development, and modernization; we know that we \nhave strains in growing, cracks and fissures in our readiness; and we \nknow that we have too much infrastructure. The Department of Defense \nsays we cut personnel and everything else by 40 percent, infrastructure \nby 20 percent.\n  What this amendment does is send a message. It sends a message that \nwe will subordinate the interests of caring for our people, of \nsupporting new modernization of weapons, of making sure of our \nreadiness, in order that we keep the infrastructure that we have, in \norder that we protect civilian jobs and bases that the Department of \nDefense does not want and does not need.\n  It is exactly the wrong message to send to our service people, to \nsend to our national defense. It jeopardizes our national security. We \nwant to take reasonable steps to put in place a process to remove \nexcess infrastructure so we can address these three other critical \nneeds.\n  I yield to my friend from Arizona.\n  Mr. BYRD. Before the Senator speaks, would the Senator yield briefly?\n  Mr. COATS. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Supreme Court of the United States has \njust struck down the line-item veto by a vote of 6-3. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I and Senator Moynihan and Senator Levin may have some \ntime--say, not to exceed 30 minutes--following the three votes that are \nscheduled.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object, unless Senator Coats and I are given equal \ntime.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would love to give both of those Senators \ndouble the time. I make the consent that they have equal time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time just \nyielded to the Senator from West Virginia not be deducted from the time \nof the Senator from Arizona. I yielded because I was under the false \nimpression that the Senator was going to speak in favor of our position \non this amendment.\n  I am reluctant to fail to yield to the Senator from West Virginia, \nbut had I known he was asking for time for this purpose, I would have \nbeen sorely tempted not to yield. I probably would have, but I would \nhave been sorely tempted not to.\n  I appreciate the Senator's interest in that subject, however. I know \nwe have and will continue to have debates on that.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  I have a few words to say today about yesterday's colloquy between \nthe Senator and myself in which I clearly misunderstood the Senator. I \nthink we passed each other, but most of the fact that we passed each \nother was my fault, and I want to state that more clearly later today.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator for saying that.\n  Mr. President, if I could ask, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 3 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me just make a couple comments on this \namendment.\n  One, there seems to be some debate as to whether base closing \nactually saves money or not--one of the more bizarre and interesting \nand illogical arguments I have heard in my time in the Senate. If \nclosing bases didn't save money, after World War II we should have kept \nthe thousands of bases that we had across America open. Look, closing \nbases saves money; it just depends on when. The sooner we get about \nthat business, the sooner we will be able to have the money that would \ntake care of force modernization, retention of qualified men and women, \nand so many other urgent requirements for national defense.\n  Let me quickly add one of the practical effects of this amendment. It \nwould prohibit any installation from being closed for 4 years following \na realignment, where, as a result of the realignment, civilian \nemployment dropped below 225--not military presence, civilian \nemployment. My friends, there is nothing more revealing about the \namendment than that the focus is on civilian employment. That could \nmean no installation could be closed--it could remain open, could be \nforced to remain open, with no military presence at all, no military \npeople, but just 225 civilians, and the base being left open. It is \nincredible.\n  Let me finally say, the Secretary of Defense has recommended a \nPresidential veto of this bill if this amendment goes through, and I \nstrongly support that. This is a very dangerous thing for national \nsecurity.\n  I thank the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, very briefly, every single Member of this Chamber \nunderstands that eventually we will have to have the intestinal \nfortitude to reduce infrastructure if we are going to support force \nstructure. This amendment moves us in precisely the opposite direction. \nIf we don't have the fortitude to make those choices, let's at least \nlet our commanders have the flexibility so they can make the choices \nfor us in the interim.\n  Mr. President, virtually every Member of this body knows that another \none or two rounds of base closures will not only save money, but will \nsave billions. But many in the Congress have concluded unequivocally \nthat preserving jobs and infrastructure in their states and districts \nis more important than military readiness and modernization. Some are \nin fact determined to punish the Administration for its actions related \nto privatization-in-place at Kelly and McClellan Air Force Bases. But \nwho is being punished? We punish the nation's taxpayers when we fail to \nmake the best use of the resources with which they entrust us. We \npunish today's soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines whose readiness \ndepends on adequate funding for equipment, training and operations. We \npunish tomorrow's force as we continue to mortgage research, \ndevelopment, and modernization of equipment necessary to keep America \nstrong into the 21st century.\n  The amendment before us takes our parochialism and so-called \npunishment of the Administration even further. The amendment seeks to \nmake it even more difficult for DoD to shift personnel among bases, to \nallocate resources as efficiently as possible, to align our \ninfrastructure in the best manner for supporting the warfighter. \nRather, this amendment represents a flagrant attempt to frustrate the \nlegitimate efforts of our service leaders to reduce and realign their \npersonnel and facilities to meet changing security requirements and \nsave money.\n  The standards for allowable realignment and adjustment of people and \nfacilities are already significantly limiting for the services. Greater \nlimits on service authority to adjust its infrastructure, reassign \nindividuals and units, move forces and capabilities to where they are \nneeded when they are needed--does nothing but harm national security. I \nurge my colleagues to reverse this insidious trend of raw parochialism, \nof protecting jobs and land and buildings at the expense of our \nnation's security.\n  With that, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor today as a cosponsor \nof the amendment before us. This amendment would further reduce the \nSecretary of Defense's ability to close and realign\n\n[[Page S7044]]\n\nbases without the consent of Congress. The amendment also expresses the \nsense of the Senate that Congress should not authorize additional \nrounds of base closure until we have ceased operations at bases already \nmarked for closure.\n  I have listened carefully to the arguments of those opposed to this \namendment. In the immortal words of that great pop philosopher Yogi \nBerra, it feels like deja vu all over again. If memory serves me \ncorrectly, on this very bill last year, many of these same Senators \nused many of the same arguments we are hearing today. After listening \nto last year's debate, the Senate overwhelmingly rejected their \narguments. Little has changed in the intervening period. I believe the \nSenate should follow the same course this year.\n  Since 1988, Congress has authorized four rounds of base closure. As a \nresult of these authorizations, operations will be ended at 97 major \nmilitary installations in this country--nearly 20 percent of all U.S. \nbases. In addition, activities will be curtailed at hundreds of other \nmilitary bases around the country. These closures and consolidations \nwill take until 2001 to complete. As they did last year, opponents of \nthis amendment argue that we have not done enough. They argue that we \nneed to close more bases. They assert that previous rounds of base \nclosure have produced billions in savings and that future rounds will \ndo the same. And they again rely upon incomplete and questionable data \nfrom the Pentagon to back them up.\n  Last year, I joined with Senator Lott, the distinguished Majority \nLeader, and Senator Dorgan in pointing to base closure studies by the \nGeneral Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office that \nraised significant doubts about the Pentagon's data. After listening to \nour arguments, the Senate, by a vote of 66 to 33, adopted language \noffered by the Republican leader and myself requiring the Defense \nDepartment to submit a comprehensive report on base closure and to have \nGAO and CBO review this report.\n  The Pentagon recently issued its four-volume report on base \nrealignment and closure. Unfortunately, this report appears to be as \nshort on new information as it is long in word count. Despite the fact \nthat the report runs nearly 2000 pages, it fails to provide some of the \nbasic information required under the legislation adopted by Congress \nlast year. Moreover, since the Department chose to release its report \njust a short time ago, GAO and CBO have been unable to complete their \nreview prior to the Senate's consideration of this amendment.\n  Nonetheless, these organizations have already provided us with a \nconsiderable amount of information about the Pentagon's data on excess \ncapacity and base closure savings. First, let me briefly address the \nDefense Department's assertion that significant excess capacity \nremains. As the Cold War was winding down in the late-1980s, the \nDefense Department properly decided to reexamine our military strategy \nand force requirements. The Pentagon conducted a rigorous analysis \ncalled the Bottom-Up Review. This review spelled out the numbers and \ntypes of military forces this Nation would need to meet the security \nchallenges of the 1990s and beyond. In order to minimize disruptions, \nthis review set precise future targets on such force components as \nmilitary personnel for each service, combat ships, and fighting \naircraft.\n  Unfortunately, the Defense Department has never seen fit to produce a \nsimilar master plan on military bases. Despite the fact that the \nPentagon has stated since the late 1980s the approximate number and \ntypes of forces it will need well into the next decade, it has never \nchosen to specify the number and types of bases necessary to house this \nforce. Instead, DoD continues to make the case for base closures using \nquestionable calculations of excess capacity. We made this point last \nyear, and it remains valid today. According to a May 1, 1998 letter \nfrom GAO, ``precise measures of excess capacity are often lacking, and \nwe have noted that DoD needs a strategic plan to guide the downsizing \nof its infrastructure.''\n  As for savings from base closures, both GAO and CBO have issued \nreports that call into question the reliability of the Pentagon data \noffered up by the proponents of this amendment. According to GAO's most \ndefinitive base closure report, ``the exact amount of actual savings \nrealized from [base closings] is uncertain.'' GAO goes on to say that \nthe Defense Department's cost and savings estimates were, ``not of \nbudget quality and rigor.'' CBO stated, ``[it] is unable to confirm or \nassess DoD's estimates of cost and savings because the Department is \nunable to report actual spending and savings for [base closure] \nactions.'' In other words, both GAO and CBO have raised significant \nquestions about the accuracy of the Pentagon's accounting system for \nbase closures.\n  Mr. President, this is an extremely important issue. The outcome of \nthis debate will have important consequences for both our national \nsecurity and the scores of communities across this country that host \nmilitary facilities. I remain concerned about the impact that \nadditional base closures could have on our national defense. Once the \nPentagon closes a major military installation, that facility is gone \nforever. The Defense Department cannot simply reopen the doors to a \nmilitary base it has closed should a new military threat arise.\n  This debate will also have a major impact on our communities. \nEllsworth Air Force Base in my home state is an excellent example. This \nfacility and the people who run it have served this Nation well for 50 \nyears. Given the far-reaching ramifications of closing additional \nbases, it is critical that Congress make informed decisions when \ndeciding on the future of key facilities like Ellsworth and many others \nacross this country. Despite the best efforts of myself and the \nMajority Leader in last year's Defense Authorization bill to gain the \nnecessary knowledge, numerous important questions remain unanswered.\n  In addition to firming up the cost data, the Pentagon must provide \nthe Congress with rigorous analysis that spells out the number and \ntypes of bases it will need for the base force. Once the Pentagon has \ndone its homework, it will be appropriate for Congress to consider \ntaking action. I look forward to working constructively with the \nDepartment of Defense in the months and years ahead on the relationship \nbetween our national security and our base structure. Once the Pentagon \nhas its own house in order, I am prepared to revisit this issue. \nUnfortunately, that time has not yet come. Therefore, I ask my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. COATS. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask what the remainder of my time is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-two seconds left for the opponents and 5 \nminutes for the proponent.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, there is not a person in this Chamber who \nhas a stronger record for supporting defense than I do--not one Senator \non the Democrat side or the Republican side has a stronger record in \nsupport of defense.\n  No. 2, those individuals who are speaking against it, I wish we had a \nchance last night, we had a little bit longer for debate. This has \nnothing to do with base closures, because I approve of the BRAC \nprocess. Last night, I went into detail as to why I think that is the \nright process to use.\n  No. 3, the Senator from Arizona talked about ``measuring\" with \ncivilian employees. That is current law. We are not changing that. That \nis already in the law. That law, by the way, was put on the books by \nthe current Secretary of Defense when he was then in the U.S. Senate.\n  So, I only say that we have covered all these bases. It is something \nthat is significant. Yes, we do have excess infrastructure, but when we \nheard Secretary Peters and General Ryan say they didn't care what \nCongress said, they are going to go ahead and close the bases without \ngoing to Congress, I decided we had to do something to stop that. That \nis all this does--it makes them come to us instead of doing it without \nour consent or knowledge or without the BRAC process.\n  I yield the remaining time to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma closed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not correct. The Senator from Indiana\n\n[[Page S7045]]\n\nstill has 42 seconds, and the Senator from Oklahoma has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is my understanding that I made the request that I be \nrecognized to close debate on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was not the understanding of the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Oklahoma be \nallowed to close debate--for how many minutes?\n  Mr. INHOFE. One minute.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask that he be yielded 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Was that request for additional time for the Senator, or \nwithin the 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. My understanding was within the 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COATS. We have no problem with the Senator closing debate. I \ndon't think 42 seconds is going to swing things one way or another, \nunless I come up with something really clever.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from North Dakota, \nand if there is a minute remaining, I will take the minute after the \nother side has concluded their remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I shall not use all the time allotted to \nme. I just want to make a couple points.\n  There isn't any question, I say to my friend from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain, that the base-closing rounds have saved money. I don't think \nthere is a quarrel in this Chamber about that. Base closings save \nmoney. They do cost some money in the short term--there is no \nquestion--but they save money.\n  I have voted for four rounds of base closures, and it is likely that \nI will vote for additional base closures, because we need some \nrestructuring. But the real question is this: Will we have the \ninformation we need to make the right decision as we cast that vote?\n  As my colleagues will recall, both the Congressional Budget Office \nand the General Accounting Office are skeptical about the Defense \nDepartment's savings estimates. Let me share what the Congressional \nBudget Office said about this a while ago:\n\n       The Congress could consider authorizing an additional round \n     of base closures if the Department of Defense believes that \n     there is a surplus of military capacity after all rounds of \n     BRAC have been carried out.\n\n  Then the Congressional Budget Office says:\n\n       That consideration, however, should follow an interval \n     during which DOD and independent analysts examine the actual \n     impact of the measures that have been taken thus far.\n\n  About a couple dozen of the bases that have been ordered to close are \nnot yet closed. We ought to finish the job we have done in the previous \nrounds before we begin a new one.\n  I have another question about this issue, and I think all of us \nshould bear this question in mind. What does the Defense Department \nmean by requesting two additional base-closing rounds at the same time \nthat folks at DOD are talking about building and developing new \nsuperbases? Where? How big? At what cost? Let's answer some of those \nquestions before we proceed.\n  Finally, let me respond to the remarks of the Senator from Arizona \nabout civilian employees. The civilian employee standard has been in \nlaw for some 20 years. This amendment modifies it or adjusts it some. \nBut as a standard for the Department's authority in this area, the \nnumber of civilian employees is not new.\n  So I am happy to join the Senator from Oklahoma in authoring this \namendment.\n  Again, I think some base closings will save money. I think we will do \nthat at some point, but this is not the time. We have nearly 30 that \nwere ordered closed that are not yet closed. Let's finish that job.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield 10 seconds to Senator Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we spoke on this late last night, around \n9:30, 10 o'clock. The Senator from Virginia expressed his opposition to \nthe amendment. I referred to the letter from the Secretary of Defense. \nI will read one sentence:\n\n       This proposal would seriously undermine my capacity to \n     manage the Department of Defense.\n\n  Bill Cohen is a man we all know, a man we unanimously supported. I \nthink it is a testament to him that we defeat this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter from Secretary Bill Cohen be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express the Department \n     of Defense's strong opposition to an amendment to the fiscal \n     year 1999 Defense Authorization Bill that has been proposed \n     by Senators Inhofe and Dorgan. If enacted, this amendment \n     would further restrict the Department's already limited \n     ability to adjust the size and composition of its base \n     structure. The Department will have views on other provisions \n     in the Authorization Bill as well, but I want to draw your \n     attention to this particular amendment before the Senate \n     completes consideration of your bill.\n       The Department can undertake closure and realignments only \n     after first complying with the requirements of 10 USC 2687. \n     As a practical matter, section 2687 greatly restricts the \n     Department from taking any action to reduce base capacity at \n     installations with more than 300 civilians authorized. The \n     amendment being proposed would extend the application of \n     section 2687 to an even greater number of installations.\n       This proposal would seriously undermine my capacity to \n     manage the Department of Defense. Even after eight years of \n     serious attention to the problem, we still have more \n     infrastructure than we need to support our forces. Operating \n     and maintaining a base structure that is larger than \n     necessary has broad, adverse consequences for our military \n     forces. It diverts resources that are critical to maintaining \n     readiness and funding a robust modernization program. It \n     spreads a limited amount of operation and maintenance funding \n     too thinly across DoD's facilities, degrading the quality of \n     life and operational support on which readiness depends. It \n     prevents us from adapting our infrastructure to keep pace \n     with the operational and technical innovations that are at \n     the cornerstone of our strategy for the 21st century. In \n     short, this amendment would be a step backward that would \n     harm our long-term security by protecting unnecessary \n     infrastructure.\n       I urge you to oppose the Inhofe/Dorgan amendment during \n     floor consideration of the Authorization Bill. Its passage \n     would put the entire bill at risk. Congress has given me the \n     responsibility to organize and manage the Department's \n     operations efficiently. I need to preserve my existing \n     authority to fulfill that responsibility.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield our remaining time to the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this amendment, if adopted, will dig us \ninto a deeper hole. We are not authorizing a new BRAC round in this \nbill. That is not before us. This amendment will make it more difficult \nfor the Secretary of Defense to realign bases that he currently can \nwithout a BRAC round.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One and a half minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I agree with the very letter of what the \nSenator from Michigan said. He is right. It does make it more difficult \nfor the Secretary of Defense to close the realigned bases without \ncoming to Congress or without going through the BRAC process.\n  I have to say, respectfully, to my colleague from Virginia that the \nletter he read from was referring to a previous version--a much \nstronger bill. We have moderated this language quite a bit. I also say \nthat is the same individual that put this into law 20 years ago \nhimself.\n  Third, this doesn't stop the 2001 BRAC process. It does not stop. We \ncan still do it. It just says we don't need to decide in this bill \nwhether or not we are going to have a 2001, and it could just as well \nbe done next year.\n  Lastly, the comment that was made that this would draw a veto, this \nis used every year. I have very serious doubts that the President of \nthe United States, on the defense authorization bill, is going to veto \nit on the basis of an amendment that is supported by both the majority \nleader, Trent Lott, and the minority leader, Tom Daschle.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Is there a request for a \nrollcall vote?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S7046]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

The Senate will now resume the Harkin \namendment, No. 2982, with 10 minutes of debate.\n  First, we will have the Senate come to order. We will not proceed \nwith debate and the vote until we can get Senators to take their \nconversations to the Cloakroom.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary procedure?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes, and \nthe Senator from South Carolina is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the amendment I offered last night--Mr. \nPresident, there still is not order in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There continues to be a fairly high level of \ndiscussion. Will Senators to the left of the rostrum please take their \nconversations to the Cloakroom.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the President for getting order in the Chamber.\n  This amendment I offered basically transfers $329 million from the \nDepartment of Defense to the Veterans Affairs' medical account. The \nveterans' needs are very clear. We have a declining population, they \nsay, of veterans, so why do they need that much money? That may be true \nfor World War II vets. But now we have the Vietnam vets coming on \nboard. Plus, our vets are living longer and are sicker than the general \npopulation. Plus, we have the problems with medical inflation.\n  Yesterday, during the debate, mention was made that the veterans \naccount got more than a 12-percent increase from last year. I checked \nthat out. That was based on a Washington Post article regarding the VA-\nHUD appropriations. But when I looked at the total budget account for \nVeterans Affairs, from 1997 to 1998, there was less than a 1-percent \nincrease in Veterans Affairs. That is for the total veterans budget. \nThere was even less than that in the medical account budget for our \nveterans.\n  What my amendment seeks to do is to put some money into the veterans' \nbenefits in the medical account. This chart shows that out of our \ndiscretionary dollar, we spend about 50\\1/2\\ cents of each dollar for \nmilitary, but for veterans' benefits, about 3\\1/2\\ cents.\n  My amendment will take the alarmingly large amount of one-eighth of 1 \npenny--one-eighth of 1 penny--of the entire Defense Department budget \nto put where it is needed to help care for our sick and elderly \nveterans. That $329 million will simply keep the current level of \nservices. It will not expand it.\n  Lastly, this amendment will authorize the Secretary to transfer the \nmoney. It doesn't mandate. Two years ago, the comptroller general of \nthe Department of Defense said they could not account for over $13 \nbillion in DOD spending. They couldn't even find it. Then we had recent \ntestimony this year from the IG's office regarding accounting \nprinciples. This will authorize the Secretary to transfer the money. \nWhere will the Secretary get the money? You never know. Maybe they will \nget better accounting principles, maybe they will find some of these \nbillions of dollars for which they haven't been able to account.\n  Right now the Secretary cannot take that money and put it into \nveterans. This amendment will allow him to do so. It doesn't mandate \nit, but it allows it.\n  Lastly, I note with some interest an article that appeared in this \nmorning's Washington Post. It points out that the House yesterday voted \nto buy $431 million worth of airplanes that the Pentagon didn't even \nrequest. They didn't even request the C-130s. What the Pentagon did \nwant is a squadron of F-18s, our carrier-based aircraft, because the F-\n14s are getting old. Over 32 have crashed since 1991. Yet, we are going \nto buy $431 million worth of C-130s.\n  If anyone is saying that DOD doesn't have the $329 million to take \ncare of our veterans, I say nonsense. Of course, we do. I will make the \npoint once again that taking care of veterans' medical needs is part \nand parcel of our ongoing military budget, and it ought to be viewed in \nthat manner.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, the \nChair will run the clock.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I oppose this amendment offered by Senator Harkin, and \nI will make my statement short. We have had the debate on defense \nspending, and I do not need to repeat those arguments. The level of \ndefense spending was set with the Administration in the budget \nagreement. This agreement was widely supported by this body and should \nnot be disregarded. Some of my colleagues have argued that the money \nfor defense is unnecessary and they have always found other uses for \nthis money. Thankfully, Mr. President, this body has not agreed with \nthese arguments and has provided the resources necessary to meet our \nnational security needs.\n  Mr. President, the budget agreement does not fully fund defense. The \nbudget agreement represents what funds are available. The fact is, Mr. \nPresident, our Armed Forces have been reduced. Since the end of the \ncold war, the active military end strength has been reduced from 2.2 \nmillion men and women to a little over 1.4 million. Annual defense \nspending continues to decline from the build up of $400 billion to \nabout the $260 billion, in equivalent, inflation adjusted dollars.\n  Mr. President, I am not opposed to increasing the funding for \nveterans' health care, but not at the cost of our national security. We \nhave been warned of funding problems in defense. We must not further \nreduce defense spending, but instead, reverse the downward trend we \nhave experienced over the last decade in defense spending. I sincerely \nhope we will heed the\n\n[[Page S7047]]\n\nhard lessons we have already learned, and not have to learn the same \npainful lesson over and over?\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge all of my colleagues to oppose this \namendment and not further aggravate a serious underfunding of our \ndefense.\n  I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 48 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment is supported by veterans' \ngroups, including the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Blind Veterans \nAssociation, and the Vietnam Veterans of America.\n  The veterans have fulfilled the duty they had to serve our country. \nNow it is up to us to fulfill our duties, our obligation, and our \nsolemn promise: Provide for our veterans.\n  Regardless of how you cut this issue, the health care of our veterans \nis a matter of our national security. What does it say to young people \ntoday entering the service who may serve in the Persian Gulf, or who \nknows where, to defend our national interest if they see how we treat \nthe veterans of our past wars?\n  This amendment will simply keep the current level of services in the \nmedical account section of our veterans budget. We should do no less \nthan that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired. The Senator from South \nCarolina has 2 minutes 40 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2982. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Roth) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Hutchinson) is \nabsent due to a death in the family.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Notwithstanding the pending business, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be permitted to enter into a colloquy with some members \nof the Armed Services Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          the aegis/nmd study\n\n  Mr. KYL. I would like to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished \nmanager of the Defense Authorization bill and several other members of \nthe Armed Services Committee who share my concerns about the Pentagon's \nfailure to date to respond to a requirement established first by the \nCommittee in its action on last year's DoD bill, and then by the \nconferees on that legislation.\n  The first of these requirements was for the Defense Department to \nprovide a study of the contribution that the Navy's Upper Tier--or \nTheater Wide--anti-missile defense program, based on the AEGIS fleet \nair defense system, could make to protecting the United States against \nlong-range ballistic missiles. The due date for this report was \nFebruary 15, 1998.\n  The conferees added to this requirement by directing the Department \nto report by that same date on ``the feasibility of accelerating the \ncurrently planned Navy Upper Tier deployment date of fiscal year 2008'' \nincluding an estimate of ``the cost and technical feasibility to \noptions for a more robust Navy Upper Tier flight test program, the \nearliest technically feasible deployment date and costs associated with \nsuch a deployment date.''\n  Mr. President, many of us believe that the AEGIS Option may be the \nmost expeditious, capable and cost-effective way to begin providing \nballistic missile defense--not only for our forces and allies overseas \nbut for the American people, as well. This is the case because the \nNation has already spent nearly $50 billion building and deploying \nvirtually the entire infrastructure we need to field the first stage of \na world-wide anti-missile system.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Would the Senator yield?\n  I want to commend the Senator from Arizona for his leadership in \nidentifying and encouraging this important program.\n  I too have, as a member of the Armed Services Committee, looked at \nthe issue of our vulnerability to missile attack and concluded--as has \nmy friend from Arizona--that it is one of the most serious shortcomings \nwe have in our entire military posture.\n  I too have concluded that there is nothing we could do that would be \nfaster or more effective than the AEGIS Option in terms of defending \nour people against the sorts of threats we now read about practically \nevery day--from the thirteen ICBMs China has pointed at our cities, to \nthe possibility of an accidental Russian missile launch, to the Indian, \nPakistani, Iranian and North Korean missile programs, to Saddam \nHussein's VX never gas-laden missiles and so on.\n  Does the Senator know why the Pentagon has not provided the \ninformation we requested last year? Our bill specifically said \nFebruary.\n  Mr. KYL. It is my understanding that this study has been complete for \nsome time--well over a month. In fact, in early May, the President's \nkey NSC staffer in the defense and arms control field, told a public \nmeeting that it was ``in the mail.'' The staffer seemed to be saying \nthat his office as well as the Defense Department had finished \nreviewing it and would be providing it promptly. Lt. Gen. Lyles did \nbrief me on the study, and he has kept a dialogue open with my staff, \nbut our preference is to receive the report.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Has the Senator any indication about the cause of the \nfurther delay?\n  Mr. KYL. I am advised that the study has been objectively perfomed. \nAs a result, it confirms what the Senator from Oklahoma and I and \nothers have been saying for some time: The Navy's AEGIS system can \ncontribute significantly to protecting the United States against \nmissile attack--and do so relatively quickly and inexpensively.\n  Weeks and months have now gone by, the DoD authorization bill is \nnearly at\n\n[[Page S7048]]\n\nthe end of the legislative process and the delay has kept Members in \nthe dark about an important opportunity we have for adding promptly and \ncost-effectively to our Nation's defense.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. As the Senator from Arizona knows, I took \nthe lead as Chairman of the Armed Services Committee's Strategic \nSubcommittee in drafting these reporting requirements. I think that, if \nwhat the Senator has been told is accurate, the Administration's \nconduct would not only be unresponsive to the mandate of Congress, but \nirresponsible with respect to our national defense.\n  It would be completely unacceptable if Congress were to be denied \ninformation it has sought, not because the information is unavailable, \nbut because its conclusions are inconvenient to an Administration that \nis determined to do everything it can to prevent the deployment of \nmissile defenses.\n  As Chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee it is my \nresponsibility to ensure that missile defense programmatic decisions \nare based upon solid information and facts. The report we are currently \ndiscussing is key to my subcommittee's future decisions on program \ndirection and funding for missile defense. This report is one part of \nthe process of examining our NMD program objectively, comparing the \nmerits of each and deciding where future resources should be applied.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to identify myself with the statements of my \ndistinguished friends and colleagues from Arizona, Oklahoma, and New \nHampshire on this matter. I have been privileged to have a long \nassociation with the Navy, an association that continues to this day in \nmy capacity as Chairman of the Armed Services Committee's Seapower \nSubcommittee.\n  Over many years, I have watched the AEGIS system develop and mature \nas a formidable fleet air defense capability. I am persuaded that even \ngreater returns can be realized from the wise investment our Nation has \nmade in this system by adapting it not only to provide defenses against \nrelatively short-range ballistic missiles but against the long-range \nones that threaten our own people, as well.\n  I believe we need to receive the contents of the requested study of \nthe AEGIS Option forthwith. I will be happy to work with the Chairman \nof the Committee, with the Chairmen of our Strategic Subcommittee and \nour Readiness Subcommittee and with others like the Senator from \nArizona to ensure that we find out at once where this document is and, \nto the maximum extent possible, that we share its conclusions with the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Let me say, Mr. President, that I would find it \nunconscionable if the Department of Defense were to be deliberately \nwithholding a study that we sought in connection with our legislative \nresponsibilities. We need to get to the bottom of this matter and I \nintend to do so.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would say to the Chairman that I hope he would agree to \nconsider taking some stern measures in the conference committee if this \nstudy--which is now over four months overdue--continues to be kept from \nthe Congress. One option that could be in order would be to ``fence'' \nthe funds for the Office of the Secretary of Defense until such time as \nthe AEGIS study is provided to us in both a classified and unclassified \nform.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I for one would be prepared to support \nsuch a measure, should that prove necessary.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I can assure my colleagues that we will get this study \none way or the other and I appreciate their excellent work on this \nissue.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma and the \nSenator from Virginia for their strong leadership on this matter.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nTexas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise to alert my colleagues to a problem \nthat I am trying to find a solution to. In the big scheme of things, I \nguess you might say this is not an overwhelming problem. But given that \nwe are talking about the leadership of the Navy in the future, I think \nit is of enough significance that attention ought to be focused on it.\n  In addition, I believe it is indicative of a problem within our \nmilitary that I am seeing over and over again throughout the various \nbranches of the armed services. I wanted to bring it to the attention \nof my colleagues today.\n  We currently give Navy ROTC scholarships to the best and brightest \nstudents in America. Students from all over the country compete for \nthese scholarships. I know many of my colleagues are probably not \nfamiliar with how the system works, but I want to try to explain it \nbecause you have to understand it to understand the problem that I am \nraising today.\n  How the process works is, individual students apply to the Navy for \nan ROTC scholarship. They are evaluated on a nationwide basis. The Navy \npicks people who have technical skills in an academic capacity, people \nwho the Navy believes will make outstanding naval officers. I think it \nis fair to say that Navy ROTC scholarships are among the most competed \nfor scholarships in America. They carry great prestige. They also carry \na commitment to pay tuition fees and expenses at the college or \nuniversity that scholarship recipients attend. So they are important \nmonetarily. They are important because they represent a highly prized \nscholarship, and they are important because they end up funding the \nfuture leaders of America's Navy.\n  We are in the midst of a Pentagon effort to change policy with regard \nto Navy ROTC scholarships. The new policy is basically a movement \ntoward limiting the number of individuals who can get a Navy ROTC \nscholarship and still go to the college or university of their choice. \nThere are 69 colleges and universities in 68 programs in America that \nparticipate in the Navy ROTC program.\n  How it works is, young men and women win the scholarship. They then \nmust accept the scholarship. Then they submit the names of the five \ncolleges or universities that they choose in order. And then the Navy, \nbased on whether or not other students previously accepted it, decided \nto attend those universities, tells them where they can apply.\n  This has produced a new policy, which is that several of our programs \nfind themselves with two or three times as many students who have won \nthe NROTC scholarship who want to attend that university. But what is \nhappening is, they are now being told under this policy in the Navy \nthat they won the scholarship, they won it based on merit, they have \nchosen to attend a college or university that participates in the \nprogram, but because 25 other people chose that college or university \nbefore they did, that the Navy has made a value judgment that we don't \nneed more than 25 people to attend VMI on an NROTC scholarship, or to \nattend Texas A under an NROTC scholarship.\n  This problem is further compounded by the fact that there is no logic \nto the distribution of these programs. For example, my guess is that in \nTexas we probably have 200 kids a year who win NROTC scholarships. We \nhave four NROTC scholarship programs. And if these caps of 25 each are \nenforced, it would mean that half of the kids in our State who win \nNROTC scholarships would have to go to another State, to another \nschool, in order to be able to receive the scholarship that they \nchoose.\n  Compare this to very small States where they might actually have 2 or \n3 recipients but at their college or university they have 25 slots \nwhere people can choose that school.\n\n  This produces a terrible inequity. It creates an especially difficult \nproblem for schools that are high on the list of people who win these \nscholarships.\n  In fact, in an internal memo, the Navy has said that one of the \nreasons they want to set these caps is that they have estimated that if \nthey allowed people who win the scholarships to choose the school they \nwould attend, 250 people would attend MIT and 250 recipients would \nattend Texas A University.\n  My question is, What is the problem? My question is, Why has the Navy \ndecided that they are going to try to limit the ability of people who \nwin NROTC scholarships to choose the college or university they attend \nthat participates in the program?\n  We, under this new rule, at Texas A will probably have three times \nas many kids from our State who want to\n\n[[Page S7049]]\n\nattend Texas A who have won an NROTC scholarship. And the Navy is \ngoing to tell them that, because 25 people chose Texas A before they \ndid, they can't attend Texas A Or, all over the country there are \ngoing to be tobacco kids who win an NROTC scholarship who want to go to \nMIT, or who want to go to Notre Dame, another very popular program in \nthe NROTC program, and they are going to be told that they can't attend \nthose schools because the Navy has decided to set a quota to require \nthem to go to schools that they don't want to attend.\n  Why are the quotas being imposed? This is the most incredible part of \nthis quota policy. It shows you what you get into when the Navy tires \nof recruiting warriors, when the Navy tires of recruiting people who \ncrush tires, when the Navy tires of recruiting people who keep Ivan \nback from the gate, and when we are socially engineering in the \nmilitary services of this country.\n  What is the logic of this? One supposed logic of it is racial \ndiversity.\n  Here is the interesting paradox that I want my colleagues to \nunderstand. I just pick out Texas A because I am from Texas A At \nTexas A, we train and commission with NROTC 60 percent more Hispanic \ngraduates who go into the Navy than the NROTC program does on average. \nBut yet we are being discriminated against in students who want to come \nto Texas A in the name of racial diversity? How does that make any \nsense?\n  The second reason for limiting the ability of students to choose to \nattend a school is because of tuition costs. Of those schools that are \nnow above the cap: MIT, $24,265 a year; University of Colorado, $11,502 \na year; University of Southern California, $21,832 a year; University \nof Notre Dame, $21,027 a year; Texas A University, $2,594 a year.\n  So we have a policy in the Navy that discriminates against students \nwho want to go to Texas A when we have 60 percent more Hispanics \ncommissioned in the Navy out of Texas A than the average NROTC \nscholarship. And, yet, the argument for these quotas is racial \ndiversity. The second argument is high tuition costs. Yet, of all \nschools in the country that are over this new quota in terms of \nstudents wanting to enroll at them, Texas A has a tuition which, on \noverage, is one-tenth the level of other schools that are overenrolled.\n  So I alert my colleagues to the fact that we have a major problem \nwith the NROTC program. Now, what I believe we need to do is the \nfollowing. I believe that we need to change the policy. We say we have \na nationwide competition, we pick the best and the brightest, and then \nwe say to the best and the brightest that they have the right to \nchoose.\n  I believe we ought to have a policy with regard to NROTC scholarships \nthat if a young man or woman wins a NROTC scholarship based on national \ncompetition and they want to go to VMI, they should have the right to \ngo to VMI. And if they are admitted, they ought to be able to enroll at \nVMI. The fact that 25 other students have chosen VMI should make no \ndifference. I do not think it is right to make students who win \nnational scholarships go to colleges that are not their first, or even \ntheir second, choice.\n  Finally, another amazing thing in this Navy memo, they are talking \nabout how they are concerned about people applying for scholarships. In \nthe 1992-1993 academic year, we had 7,667 students in America, high \nschool seniors, apply for NROTC scholarships. Today, we have only 5,037 \napplying. Why is that? Why have we had a dramatic drop in the number of \nyoung students--young men and young women--who have applied for NROTC \nscholarships?\n  The reason is the Navy is not letting them go to the school of their \nchoice. When you win one of the most prestigious scholarships in the \ncountry and you don't even end up getting your second choice as a \nschool to go to, obviously that dampens the willingness of people to \napply. I do not think quotas ought to be used in choosing where \nchildren go to school in America. This is a national program. They use \nnational tests. They have national standards. When someone wins an \nNROTC scholarship, the fact that we say to people in my State that half \nof the kids in Texas who win an NROTC scholarship have to go outside \nTexas in order to get the scholarship, and when three times as many \nwant to go to Texas A than we allow to go to Texas A because we \nhave a quota that says A can only allow 25 to enroll, even though 75 \nmay choose Texas A as their first choice, that is fundamentally \nwrong.\n  The interesting paradox is that the argument for the quota--racial \ndiversity and holding down costs--clearly does not apply to Texas A, \nbecause we commission 60 percent more Hispanics than the NROTC program \nin general does, and our tuition costs are one-tenth the level of other \nschools that are over the limit in terms of the ability of people to \nattend those schools.\n  Mr. COATS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. COATS. I have discussed this with the Senator from Texas, and I \nthink he has many valid points. I would like to offer my services as a \nmember of the committee in working with him on this question. I think \nthat this does need to be addressed. I think the Senator's points are \nlegitimate. I am hopeful that we can sit down with the Department of \nthe Navy and discuss how we can better address this. I understand their \nconcerns, but I think the Senator's concerns need consideration. \nSurely, we can find a way--it is beneficial to the Navy, I believe, to \nfind a way to address both the Senator's problems, along with theirs.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me conclude by saying I had not \nmentioned to the Senator, and I want to make it clear that so far as I \nknow he was unaware prior to making that statement that one of the \nuniversities in America that is over this quota is Purdue University. \nRight now, they are six slots over the quota, which means that if this \nquota ends up being rigidly enforced, there will be 24 young men and \nwomen who wanted to go to Purdue who will not be able to attend because \nthe Navy says they want them to go somewhere else.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield on that, the \nSenator had my attention on the issue before, but if he had any doubts \nabout it, that has been resolved. He certainly has my attention now and \nwe will work together to resolve, fix this problem.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I see Senator Byrd in the Chamber, and I \nwant to stop. I do congratulate Senator Byrd on the Supreme Court \nruling on the line-item veto. Senator Byrd had taken the position all \nalong that the Court would strike down the line-item veto. I think what \nit says to those of us who are concerned about the line-item veto and \nconcerned about spending is that we need to amend the Constitution, \nthat we need a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. I think \nit is our obligation now to go back and try to get that amendment to \nthe Constitution passed.\n  But I congratulate Senator Byrd. He is the greatest scholar in the \nSenate. He is guardian of this institution, more than any other person \nwho has served here during my adult lifetime. His position was \nvindicated in the Court today, and I want to get out of the way and let \nSenator Byrd talk about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senators from \nWest Virginia, New York, and Michigan are recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, would Senators allow me to do a UC on \nbehalf of the majority leader and Senator Thurmond?\n  But I first associate myself with the remarks about Senate Byrd being \nthe greatest scholar. Clearly, I am not a runner-up, but the Senator \nfrom Texas is, and for him to make that humble statement has taken a \nlot of courage.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thought it was pretty clear myself.\n  Mr. WARNER. I also wish to thank the Senator from Texas for sounding \ngeneral quarters on this ROTC thing, Naval ROTC. We have to look into \nthat.\n  Now, Mr. President, I understand--\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator withhold one second?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may yield \nwithout losing the right to the floor on my own part, Mr. Moynihan's \nand Mr. Levin's, until the colloquy and the action that is about to be \ntaken has been taken.\n\n[[Page S7050]]\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Meanwhile, I ask unanimous consent that during the remarks of Mr. \nMoynihan, Mr. Levin, and my own remarks, former counsel for the U.S. \nSenate, Mr. Michael Davidson, be allowed the privilege of the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I ask \nunanimous consent that immediately following the 1 hour special order, \nthe following Senators be recognized in order to offer the following \namendments:\n  Senator Dodd, regarding Reserve retirement, 10 minutes for debate, \nequally divided, and no second-degree amendments in order; Senator \nMurray, relating to burial, for up to 10 minutes, equally divided, no \nsecond-degree amendments in order; Senators Murray and Snowe, regarding \nDepartment of Defense overseas abortions, 1 hour, equally divided, with \nno second-degrees in order prior to the vote; Senator Reid, relating to \nstriking Senator Kempthorne's language, 2 hours, equally divided, with \nno second-degrees in order; Senator Harkin, regarding gulf war illness, \n30 minutes, equally divided, with no second-degrees in order prior to \nthe vote.\n  I finally ask unanimous consent that any votes ordered in relation to \nany of the above-mentioned amendments be delayed, to occur in a stacked \nsequence at a time determined by the majority leader after consultation \nwith the Democrat leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I beg the \nSenator's pardon; I was distracted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia reserves the \nright to object.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I think this has been cleared on both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank all Senators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7039-5", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SUPREME COURT'S LINE-ITEM VETO DECISION\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the U.S. Supreme Court earlier today \nannounced in its ruling in the consolidated cases of Clinton v. New \nYork and Rubin v. Snake River Potato Growers that it has found the \nLine-item Veto Act to be unconstitutional. It did this by a vote of 6 \nto 3. It is with great relief and thankfulness that I join with \nSenators Moynihan and Levin--and I am sure that if our former \ncolleague, Senator Hatfield, were here he would join with us--in \ncelebrating the Supreme Court's wise decision. Mr. President, the \nFounding Fathers created for us a vision, set down on parchment. Our \nConstitution embodies that vision, that dream of freedom, supported by \nthe genius of practical structure which has come to be known as the \nchecks and balances and separation of powers. If the fragile wings of \nthe structure are ever impaired, then the dream can never again soar as \nhigh.\n\n  Today, the Supreme Court has spared the birthright of all Americans \nfor yet a while longer by striking down a colossal error made by the \nCongress when it passed the Line-Item Veto Act. For me and for those \nwho have joined me in this fight, a long, difficult journey is happily \nended. The wisdom of the framers has once again prevailed and the slow \nundoing of the people's liberties has been halted.\n  Every year, we in this Nation spend billions upon billions of \ndollars, we expend precious manpower, we devise greater and more \ningenious weapons, all for the sake of protecting ourselves, our way of \nlife and our freedoms from foreign threats. And, yet, when it comes to \nthe duty--and we all take that oath with our hand on the Holy Bible and \nour hand uplifted, we take that oath and say ``so help me, God'' that \nwe will support and defend this Constitution. And so when it comes to \nthe duty of protecting our Constitution, the living document which \nensures the cherished liberties for which our forefathers gave their \nlives, we walked willingly into the friendly fire of the Line-Item Veto \nAct, enticed by political polls and grossly uninformed popular opinion.\n  Now that the Supreme Court has found the Line-Item Veto Act to be \nunconstitutional, it is my fervent hope that the Senate will come to a \nnew understanding and appreciation of our Constitution and the power of \nthe purse as envisioned by the framers. Let us treat the Constitution \nwith the reverence it is due, with a better understanding of what \nexactly is at stake when we carelessly meddle with our system of checks \nand balances and the separation of powers. If we disregard the lessons \nlearned from this colossal blunder, we might just as well strike a \nmatch and hold that invaluable document to the flame. Unless we take \ncare, it will be our liberties and those of our children and \ngrandchildren that will finally go up in the thick black smoke of puny \npolitical ambition.\n  Edmund Burke once observed that, ``abstract liberty, like other mere \nabstractions, is not to be found.''\n  If we, who are entrusted with the safeguarding of the people's \nliberties--and that is what is involved here--are careless or callous \nor complacent, then those hard-won, cherished freedoms can run through \nour fingers like so many grains of sand. Let us all endeavor to take \nmore to heart the awesome responsibility which service in this body \nconveys, and remember always that what has been won with such \ndifficulty for us by those who sacrificed so much for our gain can be \nquickly and effortlessly squandered by less worthy keepers of that \ntrust.\n  Mr. President, let me read just a few brief extracts from the \nmajority opinion. And that opinion was written by Mr. Justice Stevens.\n\n       There is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes \n     the President to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.\n\n  That is elemental. I am editorializing now--that is elemental.\n  Continuing with the opinion written by Mr. Justice Stevens, and \nconcurred in by the Chief Justice and four other justices:\n\n       What has emerged in these cases from the President's \n     exercise of his statutory cancellation powers, however, are \n     truncated versions of two bills that passed both Houses of \n     Congress. They are not the product of the ``finely wrought'' \n     procedure that the Framers designed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7050-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7050-S7057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       If the Line-Item Veto Act were valid, it would authorize \n     the President to create a different law--one whose text was \n     not voted on by either House of Congress or presented to the \n     President for signature. Something that might be known as \n     ``Public Law 105-33 as modified by the President'' may or may \n     not be desirable, but it is surely not a document that may \n     ``become a law'' pursuant to the procedures designed by the \n     Framers of Article I, [section] 7, of the Constitution.\n       If there is to be a new procedure in which the President \n     will play a different role in determining the final text of \n     what may ``become a law,'' such change must come not by \n     legislation but through the amendment procedures set forth in \n     Article V of the Constitution.\n\n  I close my reading of the excerpts from Mr. Justice Stevens' majority \nopinion. Let me read now, briefly, certain extracts from the concurring \nopinion by Mr. Justice Kennedy. He says this:\n\n       I write to respond to my colleague JUSTICE BREYER, who \n     observes that the statute does not threaten the liberties of \n     individual citizens, a point on which I disagree. . . . The \n     argument is related to his earlier suggestion that our role \n     is lessened here because the two political branches are \n     adjusting their own powers between themselves. . . . The \n     Constitution's structure requires a stability which \n     transcends the convenience of the moment. . . . Liberty is \n     always at stake when one or more of the branches seek to \n     transgress the separation of powers.\n       Separation of powers was designed to implement a \n     fundamental insight; concentration of power in the hands of a \n     single branch is a threat to liberty.\n\n  The Federalist states the maxim in these explicit terms:\n\n       The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive and, \n     judiciary, in the same hands . . . may justly be pronounced \n     the very definition of tyranny.\n\n  Others of my colleagues may wish to quote further.\n  So what is involved here--what the Court's opinion is really saying--\nwhat is involved when we tamper with checks and balances and the \nseparation of powers, that structure in the Constitution? What is \nreally involved are the liberties of the people.\n  Blackstone says it very well in chapter 2 of book 1. Chapter 2 is \ntitled ``Of the Parliament.''\n\n[[Page S7051]]\n\n  Blackstone said the same thing that the Court is saying:\n\n       In all tyrannical governments, the supreme magistracy, or \n     the right both of making and of enforcing the laws, is vested \n     in one and the same man, or one and the same body of men; and \n     wherever these two powers are united together, there can be \n     no public liberty. . . .\n\n  There it is. There can be no public liberty where these two powers \nare united in one and the same man or one and the same body of men.\n  That is what the Line-Item Veto Act sought to do; namely, to unite \nthe power of making law with the power of enforcing the law in the \nhands of one man: the President of the United States.\n  Let me close with this excerpt from my own modest production titled \n``The Senate of the Roman Republic'':\n\n       This is not a truth that some people want to hear.\n\n  See, I was talking about the line-item veto. I spent years in \npreparation for this battle, and those years of preparation went into \nthe writing of this treatise. I quote:\n\n       This is not a truth that some people want to hear. Many \n     would rather believe that quack remedies such as line-item \n     vetoes and enhanced rescissions powers in the hands of \n     presidents will somehow miraculously solve our current fiscal \n     situation and eliminate our monstrous budget deficits. Of \n     course, some people would, perhaps, prefer to abolish the \n     Congress altogether and institute a one-man government from \n     now on. Some people have no patience with constitutions, for \n     that matter.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleagues.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I rise to praise the Constitution, but also \nappropriately perhaps in this setting, the Senate's foremost expositor \nand defender of that document, the Honorable Robert C. Byrd, who has \ntoday helped write a page in the history of liberty. I mean no less, \nand I could say no more.\n  In 1995, led by Senator Byrd, Senator Levin, Senator Hatfield and \nothers, we pleaded with the Senate not to do this, not to enact this \nlegislation. We said it is unconstitutional.\n  That is a large statement. We did not say it was unwise or \nunseasonal. We said it was unconstitutional. We take an oath to support \nand defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, \nforeign and domestic, and domestic enemies can arise from ignorance, \nwell-intentioned ignorance.\n  This surely was the case, because the bill passed 69 to 31.\n  It passed in the face of the clearest injunction from George \nWashington in 1793 who said, I must sign a bill in toto or veto it.\n  Senator Byrd, along with the Senator from New York and Senators Levin \nand Hatfield, chose, with two Members of the House, to sue the \nGovernment of the United States declaring this act to be \nunconstitutional. The Court held we did not have standing, although two \nJustices dissented. Justice Stevens, who wrote today's opinion, said in \nhis dissent in that earlier case that we did have standing, and that \nthe measure is unconstitutional. This was so plain to a scholar and a \njudge.\n  I will take just a moment to add and to emphasize Senator Byrd's \ncitations of the writers at the time the Constitution was composed.\n  In the Federalist Papers, Madison at one point asks, given the \nfugitive existence--that nice phrase--of the Republics of Greece and \nRome, why did anybody suppose this Republic would long endure? Because, \nit was answered, we have a new ``science of politics.'' The ancients \ndepended on virtue to animate the people who govern. We have no such \nillusions. We depend on the clash of equal and opposed opinions and \ninterests--the conflict of opposings interests and the separation of \npowers, those two fundamental ideas. And we wrote them into the \nConstitution: article I, the legislative branch; article II, the \nexecutive branch. And the court decisions in this matter, too, have \nhearkened back to those early times.\n  I was struck by the opinion written by Judge Hogan, who earlier this \nyear was the second judge of the U.S. District Court for the District \nof Columbia to hold this statute unconstitutional. He cited Edward \nGibbon, whose ``Decline and Fall'' was published in 1776.\n  Here is Gibbon's passage as cited by Judge Hogan:\n\n       The principles of a free constitution are irrecoverably \n     lost when the legislative power is nominated by the \n     executive.\n\n  And that is exactly the direction we were moving in.\n  Justice Kennedy, in this morning's opinion, quoted a passage from the \nFederalist Papers in which Montesquieu, in the ``Spirit of the Laws,'' \nis cited:\n\n       When the legislative and executive powers are united in the \n     same person or body, there can be no liberty.\n\n  Liberty is what Senator Byrd was talking about. Liberty is what was \nupheld by the Supreme Court of the United States today, and liberty is \nwhat was put in jeopardy, I am sorry to say, Mr. President, by this \nbody, by the other body, and by the President who signed the \nbill. Liberty was put in jeopardy. Liberty has prevailed.\n\n  Let us learn from this. Let us not just let it go by and think \nnothing happened. Something did happen. A smallish group opposed it, \ntook it to court, were rebuffed, took it to court again. We were there \nas amici and prevailed. But had we not, what would have happened? Had \nRobert C. Byrd not been here, what would have happened to our \nliberties? Not to our budget. These are inconsequential things compared \nto that fundamental.\n  And so, sir, I rise to express the honor I have felt in your company \nand hope that history will long remember and largely note what was done \ntoday in the Court at the behest of the sometime majority leader, the \ndistinguished upholder of our Constitution, Robert C. Byrd. Not as a \nman but as a man speaking for the ideas and principles on which the \nConstitution of the United States is based.\n  Finally, sir, I express thanks to our counsel, Michael Davidson, \nLloyd Cutler, Alan Morrison, Charles Cooper, and Louis Cohen--some of \nthe finest attorneys in our country--who have helped us with this \nmatter, and have generously done so on a pro bono basis. Professor \nLaurence H. Tribe at the Harvard Law School, and Dean Michael J. \nGerhardt of Case Western University School of Law, were also of great \nassistance, as were others.\n  I celebrate the moment and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the victory which we celebrate today is \ntruly a victory for the American people and our Constitution. It has \nbeen a matter of real pride for me to be associated with Senators Byrd \nand Moynihan in the effort that we have made, first when we went to \ncourt to challenge the line-item veto and were parties where it was \nruled we had no standing, and the substantive issue was then delayed to \nthe decision of the Court today. But then when, as Amicus, we banded \ntogether--no longer was Senator Hatfield there, who is no longer a \nSenator, who was with us I know in spirit, and who had been with us in \nour first effort--to file an amicus brief to point out and to argue the \nfundamental premise of this Constitution's Article I.\n  The article that relates to enactment of laws is that the only way a \nlaw can be made, modified, or repealed is if the Congress is involved. \nAnd Congress may want to give the President the power to repeal a law \nor modify a law or even enact a law on its own. We may want, for \nwhatever momentary reason we have, to give a President the power to \nmake, modify, or repeal a law, but, thank God, we have a Constitution \nwhich says we cannot do that. And, thank God, we have a Supreme Court \ntoday which upheld that very fundamental provision of the Constitution.\n  What we tried to do--the Congress tried to do--in this law was to \ngive the President the power to repeal a law which he just signed. What \nthis law tried to do, and thankfully was not allowed to do, was to give \nthe President the power to create a law today with his signature, a \nbill which had passed both Houses and which became law when he affixed \nhis signature. But then this Line-Item Veto Act said that if he, within \na certain number of days, wanted to modify that law, unless Congress \nacted to do something to the contrary, that he could unilaterally, on \nhis own,\n\n[[Page S7052]]\n\nwithout congressional involvement, change the law of the land.\n  Now, when we were all kids we learned about this Constitution and \nwhat those magic words ``law of the land'' meant, and what they mean \ntoday, and what, the Good Lord willing, they will always mean in this \ncountry--``law of the land''--all of us bound by it equally, no matter \nwhat our station or income or power, all bound by those words, ``law of \nthe land.''\n\n  When the President affixes his signature to a bill, that bill then \ntakes on that power, in a free society, of being the law of the land. \nWhat the line-item veto bill, in the form we passed it, tried to do was \nto then say, ``Well, yes, it's the law of the land today, but the \nPresident can undo that law by himself, without congressional approval, \nif he does it in a certain number of days, in a certain type of way.''\n  The Supreme Court said today that that cannot stand. The fundamental \nreasons have been cited by Senator Byrd, the mentor of all of us \nrelative to the Constitution, and in so many other ways, and also cited \nby Senator Moynihan. The fundamental reason is, as the Federalist put \nit, as James Madison put it, that there could be no liberty where the \nlegislative and executive powers are united in the same person.\n  It is so fundamental, we often forget it. We should never forget it. \nThe Supreme Court emblazoned it again on the constitutional \nconsciousness of this country today. There can be no liberty where the \nlegislative and executive powers are united in the same person. What \nthis bill tried to do was to unite that power in the President by \nsaying that he could make a law today as part of the legislative \nprocess, of which he must be a part, but then alone, as the executive, \nundo that law tomorrow--he could repeal a law on his own.\n  That is what this Congress tried to give a President of the United \nStates. What a power. And what a road that would have taken us down. To \nthink that we would even consider giving a President the power to \nrepeal or modify the law of the land on his own without congressional \ninvolvement, changing a law which had been properly enacted and \npresented--to think that we would do that is almost unimaginable. We \ntried, Congress did, and, thank God, we failed.\n  I want to close by again thanking Senator Byrd for his leadership. I \nwill always treasure a copy of the Constitution which he has inscribed \nto me, the same Constitution which he carries with him every day of his \nlife, in his pocket, which he has so often on this floor brought out to \nmake a point. I want to thank him.\n  I want to thank Senator Moynihan and Senator Hatfield. I want to \nthank the counsel who represented us on this amicus brief that we just \nfiled successfully: Mike Davidson, Linda Gustitus, Mark Patterson.\n  I also want to thank, on behalf of all of us, the attorneys who \nrepresented us in our earlier effort, where we did not succeed because \nof a technical reason but where we nonetheless established that \nbeachhead which today led to victory. And those lawyers were Mike \nDavidson, at that time as well; Lloyd Cutler; Lou Cohen; Alan Morrison; \nand Chuck Cooper.\n  I also wish to thank Peter Kiefhaber. Although he is not a lawyer, he \nhas one of the keenest legal minds--if you will excuse me--that I have \never seen. With their help, and the help of many others in this body, \nbut mainly with the leadership of Senator Byrd, the position today was \nsustained that our liberty has been preserved in the most fundamental \nway.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the Senators has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Didn't Senator Coats and I have time allotted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senators both \nfrom Indiana and Arizona will now be recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the Senators allow me to close our \ncomments on this highly important subject? I will be brief.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from West \nVirginia be allowed to speak for as long as he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona. I also \nthank the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and the Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Coats, for their steadfast support of that in which they \nbelieved and concerning which we disagreed.\n  I have, from time to time, found myself wrong in life, and I have \nlearned some lessons in being wrong. But Senators Coats and McCain \nnever faltered in their efforts. They were very worthy protagonists of \ntheir cause. I salute them, admire them, and respect them.\n  Mr. President, if I may add just this: we should learn a lesson by \nthis experience. We have a duty as Members of the Senate to support and \ndefend the Constitution. Some of us read it differently, understand it \naccording to our own lights differently, perhaps.\n  We should understand that it is up to us to fight to preserve that \nConstitution, to protect it, to support it, to defend it. We should not \npass off to the Supreme Court of the United States the duty that is \nours as elected representatives of the people in this country--a duty \nwhich is ours, to study the Constitution, to study its history, the \nconstitutional history of America, study the history of American \nconstitutionalism, to study the history of England, to study the \nhistory of the ancient Romans, to study the colonial experience, to \nreflect upon the church covenants, to reflect upon the Bible and its \nteachings of that federation, the twelve tribes of Israel. We should do \nour very best to uphold that Constitution and again not to depend upon \nthe Supreme Court of the United States to do our work. We should not \nhand off our responsibility to the Supreme Court.\n  In this instance, I am proud of the Supreme Court. At no moment in my \nlife have I ever been more proud of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates than I am today. God save that honorable Court!\n  I close, if I may, with the lines written by Henry Wadsworth \nLongfellow in ``The Building of the Ship.'' I think they are most \nappropriate for this occasion:\n\n     Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!\n     Sail on, O Union, strong and great!\n     Humanity with all its fears,\n     With all the hopes of future years,\n     Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\n     We know what Master laid thy keel,\n     What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,\n     Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,\n     What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\n     In what a forge and what a heat\n     Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!\n     For not each sudden sound and shock,\n     'T is of the wave and not the rock;\n     'T is but the flapping of the sail,\n     And not a rent made by the gale!\n     In spite of rock and tempest's roar,\n     In spite of false lights on the shore,\n     Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!\n     Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,\n     Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,\n     Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,\n     Are all with thee,--are all with thee!\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senators from \nArizona and Indiana are recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, there is a line that has entered American \nslang, and that is, ``That is a tough act to follow.'' Mr. President, I \nthink that certainly applies now when I make my remarks following those \nof our most distinguished Senator of the U.S. Senate, Senator Byrd.\n  Senator Byrd, I know that Senator Coats will say this for himself, \nbut both of us appreciate the honorable conduct of this many long \nyears' debate that we have had together--and, unfortunately, we will \nhave in the future, since Senator Coats and I do not intend to give up \non this issue.\n  More importantly, there was a seminal moment, I think after about 5 \nyears of our debating this issue, when you walked up to Senator Coats \nand me and said, ``I believe you're really sincere in your belief that \nthe line-item veto is both constitutional and appropriate for \nAmerica.'' That was, frankly, one of the greatest compliments that \neither one of us have been paid in our time here in the Senate.\n  May I say that Senator Coats and I continue to intend to fight this \nbattle. I must say, in all sincerity, it will be much more difficult \nfor me. It will be a much more arduous task without the\n\n[[Page S7053]]\n\ncompanionship and friendship of an individual that has the highest \nmoral standards and the highest dedication and commitment to the \nbetterment of this Nation and its families than my dear friend from \nIndiana. He is not gone yet from this body, and we have the rest of the \nyear to fight this battle, but one of my deepest regrets is that my \ndear friend and partner will not be there.\n  Mr. President, I intend to speak briefly on this issue, and I know \nthat Senator Coats does, also. Let me make just a couple of comments.\n  One, it is important to point out that my understanding of the reason \ngiven by the Supreme Court for the 6-3 decision was that the \nConstitution requires every bill to be presented to the President for \nhis approval or disapproval--every bill. In other words, my \nunderstanding of this decision is not that the concept of transferring \nthis power to the President of the United States lacked \nconstitutionality, but the fact that each bill was not sent to the \nPresident for approval or disapproval was where the Supreme Court made \nthis decision.\n  Now, if that is the case, it is an argument that S. 4--which Senator \nCoats and I cosponsored, and was passed by a vote of 69-29, known as \nseparate enrollment--will be constitutional. As we all know, we went \ninto negotiations with the House that passed enhanced recession--the \nbudgeteers and Finance Committee people--and we made certain \nconcessions which resulted in enhanced recession. But the original bill \nthat was passed by a vote of 69-29 through the Senate was separate \nenrollment, which meant that every bill would separately be presented \nto the President of the United States for his approval or disapproval.\n  In all due respect to my friend from Michigan, the allegation that \nsomehow we were handing constitutional power--if I wrote the words down \ncorrectly--``to repeal or modify laws without congressional \ninvolvement,'' clearly it calls for congressional involvement. The \nSenator from Michigan knows that. If he vetoes it, it comes back to the \nCongress of the United States for veto override. That is not \nnoninvolvement. Let's be very clear here as to what the original bill \nthat passed 69-29 said.\n  Finally, we can't justify spending $150,000 to fund the National \nCenter for Peanut Competitiveness, or $84,000 earmarked for Vidalia \nonions. My all-time favorite--one year we spent a couple million \ndollars to study the effect on the ozone layer of flatulence of cows. \nWe can't do that kind of thing.\n  Unfortunately, the President of the United States now, again, does \nnot have the power that 43 Governors in America have, and that is the \nline-item veto power.\n  Today, Senator Coats and I will reintroduce the separate enrollment \nbill that passed 69-29 through the U.S. Senate. We believe that clearly \nhas constitutionality, and we will be getting expert opinions. But our \ninitial understanding of the Supreme Court decision is based on the \nfact that these were not separate bills sent to the President of the \nUnited States for approval or disapproval. The fundamentals of the \nseparate enrollment bill, which passed in the 104th Congress by a vote \nof 69-29, was exactly that and will meet those standards.\n  We will have many more hours of discussion and debate on this issue \nboth in the public forums around America as well as on the floor of the \nSenate. I thank Senator Byrd for his extreme courtesy. I look forward \nto further debate with him and others on this issue. I believe the time \nand the opinion of the American people, as well as the Constitution of \nthe United States, is overwhelmingly in favor of the line-item veto in \nthe form of separate enrollment.\n  Today, The Supreme Court struck down the line-item veto in a 6-3 \ndecision. I am very saddened by this decision. This 6-3 decision \nconcludes that the line-item veto act violates the part of the \nConstitution requiring every bill to be presented to the President for \nhis approval.\n  This is a bad decision. Polls from previous years indicate that 83 \npercent of the American people support giving the President the line-\nitem veto. We need the line-item veto act to restore balance to the \nfederal budget process.\n  The line-item veto act was a vital force in restoring the appropriate \nbalance of power, and eliminating wasteful, unnecessary pork-barrel \nspending. Unfortunately, pork barrel spending is alive and well. Most \nrecently, the FY 1999 Agriculture Appropriations bill had $241,486,300 \nmillion in specifically earmarked pork-barrel spending. The FY 1999 \nEnergy Water Appropriations Bill contained approximately $649,428,000 \nmillion for specially earmarked projects that were not included in the \nbudget request.\n  We can not afford this magnitude of pork barrel spending when we have \naccumulated a multi-trillion dollar national debt. Right now, today, we \nuse a huge portion of our federal budget to make the interest payments \non our multi-trillion national debt. In fact, this interest payment \nalmost equals the entire budget for national defense.\n  Mr. President, we can not justify spending $150,000 to fund the \nNational Center for Peanut Competitiveness, or an $84,000 earmark for \nvidalia onion, when we should be using this money to pay down the \nnational debt, or provide tax cuts for hard-working middle class \nAmericans. Until recently, we amassed huge budget deficits. If we are \nto realize our anticipated future budget surpluses, we must exercise \nfiscal restraint.\n  Our past budget deficits can return to haunt us. These past deficits \ndid not occur by accident. They occurred because we shifted the balance \nof power away from the executive branch to the legislative branch. In \n1974 the Budget Impoundment Act was passed, which deprived the \nPresident of the United States of the authority to impound funds. This \nwas a tremendous shift in power. This shift eroded the executive \nbranch's ability to exercise fiscal responsibility and fiscal \nrestraint.\n  Our objective is to curb wasteful pork-barrel spending. Even though \nthe line-item veto was recently struck down, there are other means to \nreaffirm the appropriate balance of power, and curb pork-barrel \nspending.\n  Shortly, Senator Coats and I will introduce another approach to \ncurbing Congress' appetite for mindless unnecessary and wasteful \nspending of hard-working American's tax dollars.\n  Essentially, the Separate Enrollment Act of 1998 will require that \neach item in any appropriations measure or authorization shall be \nconsidered to be a separate item.\n  Legal scholars contend that the separate enrollment concept is \nconstitutional. Congress has the right to present a bill to the \nPresident of the United States. Separate enrollment merely addresses \nthe question of what constitutes a bill. It does not erode or interfere \nwith the presentment of the bill to the President. Under the rulemaking \nclause, Congress alone can determine the procedures for defining and \nenrolling a bill. Separate Enrollment is constitutional and will \nclearly work.\n  Separate Enrollment is not a new concept. This concept is not \ncontroversial. The Senate adopted S.4, a separate enrollment bill in \nthe 104th Congress, by a vote of 69 to 29. Its mechanics are simple * * \n*. This bill requires each spending item in legislation to be enrolled \nas a separate bill. If the President chose to veto one of these items, \neach of these vetoes would be returned to Congress separately for an \noverride.\n  The Separate Enrollment Act will help to restore some of the \nExecutive Branch's role in the Federal budgeting process. The current \nbudget process is in disarray. We have a huge national debt. We have \nbudget surpluses that can easily be ``spent'' away. Our system of \nchecks and balances is out of sync in the budget process. Congress has \ntoo much power over the federal purse strings, and the President has \ntoo little. While the line-item veto is not an instant fix to this \ndilemma, it is a valuable tool to realign the balance of powers, and \ncheck Congress' appetite for reckless pork barrel spending.\n  This is a nonpartisan issue. The issue is fiscal responsibility. We \nhave 100 Senators, and 435 Representatives. It is hard to place \nresponsibility upon any one member. Thus, no one is accountable for our \nrunaway budget process. The line-item veto act, or a separate \nenrollment bill would make it more difficult for the Congress to blame \nthe President for not vetoing an entire appropriations bill. Our new \nproposal will allow the President to surgically remove wasteful pork-\nbarrel spending from appropriations and authorizations bills.\n\n[[Page S7054]]\n\n  Past Presidents have sought the line-item veto. Congress finally \nagreed in 1995, when we passed the line item veto, to redistribute some \nof the power in the federal budget process. By giving the President a \nstronger role, the line-item veto, or a Separate Enrollment Act would \ninstill additional Presidential accountability and Federal spending, \nand reduce the excesses of the congressional process that focus on \nlocality specific earmarking, and caters to special interest, not the \nnational interest, as it should.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I simply ask my colleagues to be fair and \nreasonable when addressing the issue on fiscal responsibility. The \nline-item veto and the shifting the balance of power in the budget \nprocess is vital to curbing wasteful pork-barrel spending. Again, I \nlook forward to the day when we can go before the American people with \na budget that is both fiscally responsible and ends the practice of \nearmarking funds in the appropriations process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for his \nkind remarks.\n  I also want to congratulate the Senator from West Virginia for a \nsignificant victory. The Senator had indicated during the debate that \nhe believed and had reason to believe that the bill we were sending to \nthe President, which was signed by the President and exercised by the \nPresident, would not stand constitutional muster. The Court affirmed \nthat conclusion.\n  I also congratulate the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, for \nbeing the guardian of this institution. He stands at the gate to retain \nits hallowed practices and rules and traditions. And in this modern age \nof seeking the expedient and convenient over the tried, tested, and \ntrue, the Senator's contributions are extremely important to the future \nof this institution. I commend him for that. He is also a \nconstitutional scholar without peer in this institution.\n  This Senator, as I did yesterday and as I do today, stands up with \nsome trepidation in terms of discussing issues and matters of the \nConstitution, because I know I am doing so with someone who has studied \nit for far longer and has a far better understanding of it than I have.\n  When Senator McCain and I addressed the issue of the line-item veto, \nwe consulted a number of constitutional scholars. It is fair to say \nthat there is disagreement. There are constitutional scholars, \nrecognized scholars, who believed that the process of enhanced \nrescission was not line-item veto, per se, enhanced rescission was a \nconstitutionally acceptable process, that it did retain a balance of \npower, it did retain the prerogative of Congress to override the \nPresidential veto. And it is my understanding, along with Senator \nMcCain's, on a quick reading, I would say--not even a full reading, but \na very brief overview of the decision that is handed down, and I look \nforward to reading the entire case--that what the Court addressed was \nmore procedural than principle, the procedure of the omnibus bill being \npresented to the President and, as the Senator from Michigan said, \nbeing signed, and then in a sense accepted and then reviewed relative \nto certain aspects of that.\n  The Court obviously sided with the argument so ably presented by the \nSenator from New York, who has left the floor--the Senator from \nVirginia, the Senator from New York, the Senator from Michigan, and \nothers.\n  It is the principle that Senator McCain and I are attempting to \naddress, not the procedure. We had spent numerous hours of discussion \nand debate in attempting to establish a procedure whereby the principle \nof a balance against what we considered to be--and many, I think, of \nthe American people considered to be --an irresponsible exercise of the \nspending power of the Congress--not the right to have the power of the \npurse, but an irresponsible use of that, and the voluntary transfer of \nsome of that power, yet retaining a balance in terms of the division of \npower between the branches, as the founders intended. That was our \nintent.\n  As Senator McCain said, the bill that passed the Senate with 69 votes \nas a separate enrollment procedure would have, I believe, addressed the \nconcerns of the Court by presenting to the President separate bills on \neach line item of spending. We didn't include the tax issue. That was \nadded at the request of members of the Finance Committee. Ours went \nspecifically to spending items. That was different from what was passed \nin the House of Representatives and perhaps now, in retrospect, a \nfaulty decision. We ceded the Senate procedure to the House procedure, \nand we paid the price of that ceding--or perhaps not; we don't know for \nsure what the Supreme Court would have done with that.\n\n  The principle of each decision by the Congress standing on its own \nmerits--having the light of day shine on that spending decision, so \nthat the American people know that our yea is a yea and our nay is a \nnay, and not the procedure of hiding what arguably could be decisions \non spending that would not stand the light of day and not receive a \nmajority of support, because it is subsumed by the importance of the \nbroader legislation--is really the principle that we are attempting to \naddress.\n  We want what is decided in the back halls to be debated on the Senate \nfloor. We want to give each Senator and Representative the opportunity \nto say, ``I support that,'' or, ``I don't support that,'' and discuss \nit on the merits, rather than saying, ``I didn't know about that \nbecause it was added in the back room. It was part of a thousand-page \nbill, and we didn't have the time to peruse each line of that \nlegislation. And, yes, had I had an opportunity to vote on that \nseparately, there is no way I would have supported that irresponsible \nuse of the taxpayers' dollars.''\n  So we are seeking a way of attempting to bring into the process a \nmeans by which we could achieve a check against imbalance, against what \nwe considered to be spending that had not been given the opportunity to \nbe addressed and discussed and debated on the merits. We think it is a \ndeceptive practice. We think it is a distasteful practice. We think it \ndoes not enhance the public's opinion of this institution and the \nprocesses by which we make decisions. We think it is an irresponsible \nexercise of the fiscal discipline that the taxpayers of America expect \nus to exercise in the spending of their dollars.\n  That is the genesis behind the legislation that Senator McCain and I \nhave authored and fought for 10 years to pass, and finally did pass.\n  So are we disappointed with the Supreme Court decision? Yes, deeply \ndisappointed. Do we see it as a permanent defeat? No, we don't. We \nthink a preliminary reading, and hopefully a further careful reading \nand study of the Supreme Court's decision, will indicate that the Court \ndecided on the basis of the procedure used, not on the basis of the \nprinciple involved. The principle involved ought to be at the center \nand heart of our debate and discussion. I hope that as we engage in \nfuture battles--I guess that is the proper word, because those were \nheated debates, but principled, heated debates--we can focus on the \nprinciple and not the procedure.\n  Questions have been raised about the cumbersome nature of separate \nenrollment procedurally, with a large piece of legislation having to be \nbroken down into its separate pieces. Up until a few years ago that was \nan argument that carried a lot of persuasion and a lot of weight. But \nwith the advent of modern technology--computer technology--and with \nsome visits by myself and others to study with the enrollment clerk, \nand the witnessing of the utilization of that modern technology in \nterms of how bills are printed, how they are enrolled, and how they are \npresented for enrollment, we have the opportunity to take advantage of \nthose marvelous improvements in the way in which we procedurally enroll \nlegislation that is now technologically feasible. What would have taken \nliterally days and perhaps hundreds of enrollment clerks, scribes, \nworking away diligently in the basement of the Capitol separating out \nthe bill, enrolling separate pieces of legislation, and having those \nsigned and presented to the President of the United States, and having \nthe President attempt to deal with it to the point he would have no \nother time to\n\n[[Page S7055]]\n\ndeal with any of his other duties and certainly achieve writers' cramp, \nthat no longer is a problem. Technology has allowed us to bypass that.\n  So we intend to introduce as early as today a procedure--a process--\nwhich 69 of our Members, on a bipartisan basis, have supported, which \naddresses the principle of the issue and not the procedure of the \nissue. We look forward to the debate that will occur. We look forward \nto the opportunity to give our Members, all 69 of them--Democrats and \nRepublicans--the opportunity to, once again, support a responsible \npractice of spending the taxpayer dollars in the most responsible way \nthat we can.\n  Mr. President, I will close. I wish I were as eloquent and as \narticulate as the Senator from West Virginia. I wish I could reach into \nmy mind and recall the words of the famous scholars, constitutional \nexperts, or a poem that was appropriate to the discussion. I don't have \nthat capacity. I don't have that talent. I admire that greatly in \nSenator Byrd. What discipline it must have taken to commit to flawless \nmemory the words of historians, the thoughts of some of the greatest \nthinkers that this world has ever seen, the magic and beauty of the \npoetry that expresses those thoughts in the recall that the Senator \nhas.\n  I am leaving the Senate this year. I will take with me many lifetime \nmemories, not of process but of people--some of the most extraordinary \npeople, I think, ever to have had the privilege of being born into this \ngreatest of all nations and serve in this greatest of all institutions. \nI take away a vast reservoir of memories of 100 unique individuals with \nsome of the greatest and most extraordinary talents to be found \nanywhere. And none of them, I think, transcends the abilities and the \nextraordinary capabilities of the Senator from West Virginia, who I \nhave enjoyed serving with, even though we have found ourselves on \nopposite sides of a number of issues, and we have found ourselves on \nthe same side on several issues.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I don't want to interrupt this flow, but I \nwant to join very briefly.\n  Mr. President, I stand here merely as a foot soldier in this \ndiscussion. However, I would like to take a moment to offer some \ncomments on the Supreme Court's decision today to strike down the line-\nitem veto as unconstitutional.\n  I am proud to say that I was one of 29 Members who in March of 1995 \ncast a vote against the line-item veto, along with the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, \nand Senator Moynihan and 25 others on that day who expressed their \nopinion that they opposed this legislation--not as I recall, although \nothers may have said, because they disagreed with the approach to deal \nwith the budget issue. In my view, it had little or nothing to do with \nthe budget process, but had everything to do with the issue that \nprovoked the briefs to be filed, amicus curiae briefs, and the \nsubsequent legal actions--that issue is the constitutionality of the \nline-item veto.\n  I just wanted to point out that I was looking over the vote. And of \nthe 29 people who voted against the line-item veto in March of 1995, \nsix Members of that group of 29 have since left the Chamber. This list \nincludes our distinguished colleagues Senators Hatfield, Johnston, \nNunn, Pell, Pryor, and Simon. Two others who voted nay--Senators \nBumpers and Glenn--will be leaving at the end of this Congress.\n  The other day, someone counted some 100 different proposals which are \nbeing drafted or have been introduced that would amend the Constitution \nin one way or another.\n  I am not questioning the intentions or even the desired goals that \nthose constitutional proposals have in mind. But the framers and the \nfounders of the document, which I happen to carry with me as well--a \nlesson I learned one day watching the distinguished colleague from West \nVirginia. I got my copy of the Constitution. I carry it in my pocket \nevery single day, and have ever since, along with a copy of the \nDeclaration of Independence, which is included here.\n  It is our job here to do everything we can to advance the goals and \ndesires of our society, particularly as we enter a new millennium and a \nnew century. But the fundamental principles, values and ideals \nincorporated in the Constitution, the basic organic law of our country, \nare rooted in sound philosophical judgments. And the temptation, \nparticularly in the midst of great difficulties--and certainly the \nbudget crisis was no small difficulty with $300 billion of deficits a \nyear, $4 trillion in debt--the temptation to want to come up with an \nanswer to that was profound and significant.\n  There will be other such crises, maybe not of that nature, but maybe \nof other natures that will come along, and the temptation will be to \nsolve that problem and to do so by circumventing the values and \nprinciples incorporated into the Constitution. I only hope that we \nremind ourselves of what our forbearers had been struck with; and that \nis not to in any way denigrate or detract from the fundamental \nprinciples of the Constitution as we struggle through a very \ndeliberative, painful, oftentimes annoying and frustrating process \ncalled democracy to address the issues of our day.\n  I often point out to my constituents back home that as a country we \nhave been through a great Civil War, two World Wars in this century, \nand a Great Depression when I am sure the temptations were great to \namend or suspend parts of our Constitution, our Bill of Rights \nparticularly. And we never saw fit to do so during all of those great \ncrises. We never saw fit to do so. We thrive and are strong today as a \nnation without having made a single change in the Bill of Rights--not \none change since those words were first crafted and drafted in 1789--\nnot a single word. Not a single syllable has been changed in the Bill \nof Rights.\n  I hope that as we look forward to a new century and a new millennium, \nwith all the unanticipated problems we face as a nation in the world, \nthat we will not be tempted to be drawn ``to the flame''--to use the \nanalogy of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia--to draw to \nthat flame which could defeat it. And I will not put flame to this \ndocument and destroy the very principles and values which I think are \nthe rationale and reason for why we have achieved the level of \ngreatness that we have as a people.\n  As one Member of this body, I suspect, speaking on behalf of the six \nwho are no longer here, and those who are not here on the floor, we \nthank you immensely on behalf of our constituents, both past, present \nand in the future, for the three of you, along with Senator Hatfield \nwho led this effort beyond the Chamber here and brought the matter to \nthe highest court of our land. I also extend my gratitude to those six \nSupreme Court Justices for the decision they handed down today.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. And, \nagain, I have said to him in meetings of our own committee, where we \nsat together and worked together so many times, Dan Coats is going to \nbe missed in the Senate. He has been one terrific Senator, and Indiana \ncan be very proud that they sent someone of his talent, ability, and \ntenacity. I would much rather have him as an ally than an opponent. I \nhave been an ally of his and have been on the opposite side. Believe \nme, it is much more pleasant to have Dan Coats on your side. It is a \nprivilege to say so on this floor, as I have on other occasions.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nDodd, for his incisive observations with respect to the roster of those \nwho voted against the Line-item Veto Act on March 23, 1995, and for his \nvery eloquent statement.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to join in thanking----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Indiana yield to the \nSenator from North Dakota?\n  Mr. COATS. I would be happy to do that if I could just do a unanimous \nconsent request. Then I would be happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be very happy to yield.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator.\n\n[[Page S7056]]\n\n  First of all, Mr. President, in relationship to the issue of \ndiscussion, I believe it important to the legislative history of the \nLine Item Veto Act to have the brief prepared by the Senate counsel in \nsupport of the line item veto submitted to the Record. However, in the \nspirit of fiscal responsibility, to spare the taxpayer expense of \nprinting the entire document, I ask unanimous consent that the front \ncover of the brief be printed in the Record. The cover provides the \nnecessary source information to assist anyone seeking to review the \nfull document in locating a complete copy. I encourage Senators to \nexamine this excellent brief along with the Court decision.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              No. 97-1374\n\n    [In the Supreme Court of the United States, October Term, 1997]\n\n  William J.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss \nbriefly the Supreme Court's decision earlier today to strike down the \nline-item veto law and to a new approach to the line-item veto that \naims to cut some of the vast fat contained in our annual spending \nbills, but will stand up to constitutional scrutiny.\n  Though the Court found that the line-item veto legislation was \nflawed, I supported the experimental line-item veto authority we gave \nthe President in 1996 as a means of controlling Congress' voracious \nappetite for pork.\n  I had great concerns about many aspects of the legislation. My \ngreatest concern was granting a greatly expanded veto authority that \nretained the two-thirds override threshold that the Constitution \nprovides for the Presidential veto of entire bills. Extending that \nauthority for individual sections of a bill worried me. And the Court \nfound that this represented an inappropriate shift in the balance of \npower from the legislative branch to the executive. I do not question \nthe Court's decision.\n  Mr. President, I don't believe, nor have I ever believed that \nenhanced rescission authority, whether it be the line-item veto or some \nother vehicle, is the whole answer to our deficit and spending problem, \nor even most of the answer, but it certainly can be part of the answer.\n  I am working on a bill that would allow expedited rescission. It \npromises to be a useful tool to help reduce the Federal deficit and \nbring the Federal budget truly into balance, and more importantly to \nbring reform to our appropriations process.\n  The introduction of this bill would be extremely timely given this \nbody's consideration of the fiscal year 1999 spending bills. Ideally, \nwe would have an expedited rescissions law in place for this year's \nappropriations bills, but I know that won't happen. What surely will \nhappen is the stealthy insertion of an extensive list of wasteful and \nunnecessary projects and programs that pick clean the wallets of this \ncountry's taxpayers.\n  This bill would allow the Congress and the President to work together \nto exercise the kind of specific budget pruning that many of us feel is \na necessary response to the budget abuses that persist in the \nappropriations process.\n  Mr. President, this bill would enable the President to propose \neliminating specific spending items for veto and would allow Congress \nto support or oppose the President's suggestions on a simple up or down \nvote.\n  This bill would accomplish the objectives of the line-item veto--\neliminating wasteful and unnecessary spending--but without violating \nthe constitutional principles of separation of power and balance of \npower.\n  Mr. President, I believe this bill would be an effective means of \nfighting wasteful spending, certainly something everyone opposes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask before I yield to the Senator how \nmuch time is remaining on the earlier allocated time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. COATS. Is that sufficient? I yield the Senator the remainder of \nour time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Indiana very much for his \ncourtesy.\n  Let me just say I have found the Senator from Indiana to be among the \nmost courteous of our colleagues, and we are very much going to miss \nhim. I think he is an outstanding U.S. Senator, an extraordinarily \ndecent person, and I am personally going to miss him from this body.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator for those remarks. They are generous, \nand also the Senator from Connecticut, I appreciate his remarks. I \ndon't want anybody to misunderstand those remarks or interpret those \nremarks to mean that the Senator is finished for the year. I expect to \nbe back in the Chamber, and I hope that Senators feel the same way \nabout me at the end of the session as they do now.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am sure we will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I take just a minute to thank the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd. I thank him for standing \nup to protect the Constitution of the United States. I don't think \nthere is any higher responsibility for a Member of this body, because \nwe all take a solemn oath when we are sworn in to preserve, protect, \nand defend the Constitution of the United States. That is the organic \nlaw of our country. It is a Constitution that is truly genius in what \nit has done for our country. We are a very young country, but already \nthe rest of the world seeks to emulate us. And one of the reasons is \nthe genius of that organic law, that document that has provided for the \nstructure of this Government.\n  Senator Byrd convinced me when we were debating the question of line-\nitem veto, and I must say the constituency pressure from my State was \nall on behalf of supporting the line-item veto. I did not because I was \nconvinced, after lengthy discussions with Senator Byrd, that it \nviolated the Constitution of the United States and that, in fact, part \nof the genius of that document was the separation of powers and the \npower of the purse being put in the hands of the Congress of the United \nStates to reflect the will of the people of this country. And to have \nthat power diluted not because Members of Congress are seeking power \nbut because the Constitution established the framework to protect the \nrights of the people, that is the extraordinary genius of our \nConstitution. And nobody has been more vigilant in defending that \nConstitution than the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd.\n  I thank him because it was not an easy task. It was not a popular \ntask. But he was right to do it. And the rightness of his position has \nbeen confirmed by this ruling by the Supreme Court. It was not a close \nruling. By a 6 to 3 vote, the Supreme Court of the United States has \nsaid, yes, Senator Byrd and others who made that judgment were correct. \nWe would be doing damage and injury to the Constitution of the United \nStates if we were to approve the line-item veto that had been passed by \nthe Congress of the United States.\n  So I say to Senator Byrd a sincere thank-you, because what he has \ndone is in the finest tradition of the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am out of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nstatement, for standing with the small group, small band, on March 23, \n1995. He perhaps did not at that time follow\n\n[[Page S7057]]\n\nthe will of his people, but his people were served best by his \ndecision, by the stand that he took, and in the long run I am sure they \nwill admire him for it and respect him for it and reward him for it. \nHis full reward comes from his conscience, his conscience that he did \nthe right thing, that he helped to preserve the liberties of the people \nof his State and the people of the United States.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the cover page of the amici \nbrief referred to before that was filed by Senator Byrd, Senator \nMoynihan, and myself be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the brief was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              No. 97-1374\n\n    [In the Supreme Court of the United States, October Term, 1997]\n\n William J.

Something that might be known as \n     ``Public Law 105-33 as modified by the President'' may or may \n     not be desirable, but it is surely not a document that may \n     ``become a law'' pursuant to the procedures designed by the \n     Framers of Article I, [section] 7, of the Constitution.\n       If there is to be a new procedure in which the President \n     will play a different role in determining the final text of \n     what may ``become a law,'' such change must come not by \n     legislation but through the amendment procedures set forth in \n     Article V of the Constitution.\n\n  I close my reading of the excerpts from Mr. Justice Stevens' majority \nopinion. Let me read now, briefly, certain extracts from the concurring \nopinion by Mr. Justice Kennedy. He says this:\n\n       I write to respond to my colleague JUSTICE BREYER, who \n     observes that the statute does not threaten the liberties of \n     individual citizens, a point on which I disagree. . . . The \n     argument is related to his earlier suggestion that our role \n     is lessened here because the two political branches are \n     adjusting their own powers between themselves. . . . The \n     Constitution's structure requires a stability which \n     transcends the convenience of the moment. . . . Liberty is \n     always at stake when one or more of the branches seek to \n     transgress the separation of powers.\n       Separation of powers was designed to implement a \n     fundamental insight; concentration of power in the hands of a \n     single branch is a threat to liberty.\n\n  The Federalist states the maxim in these explicit terms:\n\n       The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive and, \n     judiciary, in the same hands . . . may justly be pronounced \n     the very definition of tyranny.\n\n  Others of my colleagues may wish to quote further.\n  So what is involved here--what the Court's opinion is really saying--\nwhat is involved when we tamper with checks and balances and the \nseparation of powers, that structure in the Constitution? What is \nreally involved are the liberties of the people.\n  Blackstone says it very well in chapter 2 of book 1. Chapter 2 is \ntitled ``Of the Parliament.''\n\n[[Page S7051]]\n\n  Blackstone said the same thing that the Court is saying:\n\n       In all tyrannical governments, the supreme magistracy, or \n     the right both of making and of enforcing the laws, is vested \n     in one and the same man, or one and the same body of men; and \n     wherever these two powers are united together, there can be \n     no public liberty. . . .\n\n  There it is. There can be no public liberty where these two powers \nare united in one and the same man or one and the same body of men.\n  That is what the Line-Item Veto Act sought to do; namely, to unite \nthe power of making law with the power of enforcing the law in the \nhands of one man: the President of the United States.\n  Let me close with this excerpt from my own modest production titled \n``The Senate of the Roman Republic'':\n\n       This is not a truth that some people want to hear.\n\n  See, I was talking about the line-item veto. I spent years in \npreparation for this battle, and those years of preparation went into \nthe writing of this treatise. I quote:\n\n       This is not a truth that some people want to hear. Many \n     would rather believe that quack remedies such as line-item \n     vetoes and enhanced rescissions powers in the hands of \n     presidents will somehow miraculously solve our current fiscal \n     situation and eliminate our monstrous budget deficits. Of \n     course, some people would, perhaps, prefer to abolish the \n     Congress altogether and institute a one-man government from \n     now on. Some people have no patience with constitutions, for \n     that matter.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleagues.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I rise to praise the Constitution, but also \nappropriately perhaps in this setting, the Senate's foremost expositor \nand defender of that document, the Honorable Robert C. Byrd, who has \ntoday helped write a page in the history of liberty. I mean no less, \nand I could say no more.\n  In 1995, led by Senator Byrd, Senator Levin, Senator Hatfield and \nothers, we pleaded with the Senate not to do this, not to enact this \nlegislation. We said it is unconstitutional.\n  That is a large statement. We did not say it was unwise or \nunseasonal. We said it was unconstitutional. We take an oath to support \nand defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, \nforeign and domestic, and domestic enemies can arise from ignorance, \nwell-intentioned ignorance.\n  This surely was the case, because the bill passed 69 to 31.\n  It passed in the face of the clearest injunction from George \nWashington in 1793 who said, I must sign a bill in toto or veto it.\n  Senator Byrd, along with the Senator from New York and Senators Levin \nand Hatfield, chose, with two Members of the House, to sue the \nGovernment of the United States declaring this act to be \nunconstitutional. The Court held we did not have standing, although two \nJustices dissented. Justice Stevens, who wrote today's opinion, said in \nhis dissent in that earlier case that we did have standing, and that \nthe measure is unconstitutional. This was so plain to a scholar and a \njudge.\n  I will take just a moment to add and to emphasize Senator Byrd's \ncitations of the writers at the time the Constitution was composed.\n  In the Federalist Papers, Madison at one point asks, given the \nfugitive existence--that nice phrase--of the Republics of Greece and \nRome, why did anybody suppose this Republic would long endure? Because, \nit was answered, we have a new ``science of politics.'' The ancients \ndepended on virtue to animate the people who govern. We have no such \nillusions. We depend on the clash of equal and opposed opinions and \ninterests--the conflict of opposings interests and the separation of \npowers, those two fundamental ideas. And we wrote them into the \nConstitution: article I, the legislative branch; article II, the \nexecutive branch. And the court decisions in this matter, too, have \nhearkened back to those early times.\n  I was struck by the opinion written by Judge Hogan, who earlier this \nyear was the second judge of the U.S. District Court for the District \nof Columbia to hold this statute unconstitutional. He cited Edward \nGibbon, whose ``Decline and Fall'' was published in 1776.\n  Here is Gibbon's passage as cited by Judge Hogan:\n\n       The principles of a free constitution are irrecoverably \n     lost when the legislative power is nominated by the \n     executive.\n\n  And that is exactly the direction we were moving in.\n  Justice Kennedy, in this morning's opinion, quoted a passage from the \nFederalist Papers in which Montesquieu, in the ``Spirit of the Laws,'' \nis cited:\n\n       When the legislative and executive powers are united in the \n     same person or body, there can be no liberty.\n\n  Liberty is what Senator Byrd was talking about. Liberty is what was \nupheld by the Supreme Court of the United States today, and liberty is \nwhat was put in jeopardy, I am sorry to say, Mr. President, by this \nbody, by the other body, and by the President who signed the \nbill. Liberty was put in jeopardy. Liberty has prevailed.\n\n  Let us learn from this. Let us not just let it go by and think \nnothing happened. Something did happen. A smallish group opposed it, \ntook it to court, were rebuffed, took it to court again. We were there \nas amici and prevailed. But had we not, what would have happened? Had \nRobert C. Byrd not been here, what would have happened to our \nliberties? Not to our budget. These are inconsequential things compared \nto that fundamental.\n  And so, sir, I rise to express the honor I have felt in your company \nand hope that history will long remember and largely note what was done \ntoday in the Court at the behest of the sometime majority leader, the \ndistinguished upholder of our Constitution, Robert C. Byrd. Not as a \nman but as a man speaking for the ideas and principles on which the \nConstitution of the United States is based.\n  Finally, sir, I express thanks to our counsel, Michael Davidson, \nLloyd Cutler, Alan Morrison, Charles Cooper, and Louis Cohen--some of \nthe finest attorneys in our country--who have helped us with this \nmatter, and have generously done so on a pro bono basis. Professor \nLaurence H. Tribe at the Harvard Law School, and Dean Michael J. \nGerhardt of Case Western University School of Law, were also of great \nassistance, as were others.\n  I celebrate the moment and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the victory which we celebrate today is \ntruly a victory for the American people and our Constitution. It has \nbeen a matter of real pride for me to be associated with Senators Byrd \nand Moynihan in the effort that we have made, first when we went to \ncourt to challenge the line-item veto and were parties where it was \nruled we had no standing, and the substantive issue was then delayed to \nthe decision of the Court today. But then when, as Amicus, we banded \ntogether--no longer was Senator Hatfield there, who is no longer a \nSenator, who was with us I know in spirit, and who had been with us in \nour first effort--to file an amicus brief to point out and to argue the \nfundamental premise of this Constitution's Article I.\n  The article that relates to enactment of laws is that the only way a \nlaw can be made, modified, or repealed is if the Congress is involved. \nAnd Congress may want to give the President the power to repeal a law \nor modify a law or even enact a law on its own. We may want, for \nwhatever momentary reason we have, to give a President the power to \nmake, modify, or repeal a law, but, thank God, we have a Constitution \nwhich says we cannot do that. And, thank God, we have a Supreme Court \ntoday which upheld that very fundamental provision of the Constitution.\n  What we tried to do--the Congress tried to do--in this law was to \ngive the President the power to repeal a law which he just signed. What \nthis law tried to do, and thankfully was not allowed to do, was to give \nthe President the power to create a law today with his signature, a \nbill which had passed both Houses and which became law when he affixed \nhis signature. But then this Line-Item Veto Act said that if he, within \na certain number of days, wanted to modify that law, unless Congress \nacted to do something to the contrary, that he could unilaterally, on \nhis own,\n\n[[Page S7052]]\n\nwithout congressional involvement, change the law of the land.\n  Now, when we were all kids we learned about this Constitution and \nwhat those magic words ``law of the land'' meant, and what they mean \ntoday, and what, the Good Lord willing, they will always mean in this \ncountry--``law of the land''--all of us bound by it equally, no matter \nwhat our station or income or power, all bound by those words, ``law of \nthe land.''\n\n  When the President affixes his signature to a bill, that bill then \ntakes on that power, in a free society, of being the law of the land. \nWhat the line-item veto bill, in the form we passed it, tried to do was \nto then say, ``Well, yes, it's the law of the land today, but the \nPresident can undo that law by himself, without congressional approval, \nif he does it in a certain number of days, in a certain type of way.''\n  The Supreme Court said today that that cannot stand. The fundamental \nreasons have been cited by Senator Byrd, the mentor of all of us \nrelative to the Constitution, and in so many other ways, and also cited \nby Senator Moynihan. The fundamental reason is, as the Federalist put \nit, as James Madison put it, that there could be no liberty where the \nlegislative and executive powers are united in the same person.\n  It is so fundamental, we often forget it. We should never forget it. \nThe Supreme Court emblazoned it again on the constitutional \nconsciousness of this country today. There can be no liberty where the \nlegislative and executive powers are united in the same person. What \nthis bill tried to do was to unite that power in the President by \nsaying that he could make a law today as part of the legislative \nprocess, of which he must be a part, but then alone, as the executive, \nundo that law tomorrow--he could repeal a law on his own.\n  That is what this Congress tried to give a President of the United \nStates. What a power. And what a road that would have taken us down. To \nthink that we would even consider giving a President the power to \nrepeal or modify the law of the land on his own without congressional \ninvolvement, changing a law which had been properly enacted and \npresented--to think that we would do that is almost unimaginable. We \ntried, Congress did, and, thank God, we failed.\n  I want to close by again thanking Senator Byrd for his leadership. I \nwill always treasure a copy of the Constitution which he has inscribed \nto me, the same Constitution which he carries with him every day of his \nlife, in his pocket, which he has so often on this floor brought out to \nmake a point. I want to thank him.\n  I want to thank Senator Moynihan and Senator Hatfield. I want to \nthank the counsel who represented us on this amicus brief that we just \nfiled successfully: Mike Davidson, Linda Gustitus, Mark Patterson.\n  I also want to thank, on behalf of all of us, the attorneys who \nrepresented us in our earlier effort, where we did not succeed because \nof a technical reason but where we nonetheless established that \nbeachhead which today led to victory. And those lawyers were Mike \nDavidson, at that time as well; Lloyd Cutler; Lou Cohen; Alan Morrison; \nand Chuck Cooper.\n  I also wish to thank Peter Kiefhaber. Although he is not a lawyer, he \nhas one of the keenest legal minds--if you will excuse me--that I have \never seen. With their help, and the help of many others in this body, \nbut mainly with the leadership of Senator Byrd, the position today was \nsustained that our liberty has been preserved in the most fundamental \nway.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the Senators has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Didn't Senator Coats and I have time allotted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senators both \nfrom Indiana and Arizona will now be recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the Senators allow me to close our \ncomments on this highly important subject? I will be brief.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from West \nVirginia be allowed to speak for as long as he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona. I also \nthank the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, and the Senator from \nIndiana, Mr. Coats, for their steadfast support of that in which they \nbelieved and concerning which we disagreed.\n  I have, from time to time, found myself wrong in life, and I have \nlearned some lessons in being wrong. But Senators Coats and McCain \nnever faltered in their efforts. They were very worthy protagonists of \ntheir cause. I salute them, admire them, and respect them.\n  Mr. President, if I may add just this: we should learn a lesson by \nthis experience. We have a duty as Members of the Senate to support and \ndefend the Constitution. Some of us read it differently, understand it \naccording to our own lights differently, perhaps.\n  We should understand that it is up to us to fight to preserve that \nConstitution, to protect it, to support it, to defend it. We should not \npass off to the Supreme Court of the United States the duty that is \nours as elected representatives of the people in this country--a duty \nwhich is ours, to study the Constitution, to study its history, the \nconstitutional history of America, study the history of American \nconstitutionalism, to study the history of England, to study the \nhistory of the ancient Romans, to study the colonial experience, to \nreflect upon the church covenants, to reflect upon the Bible and its \nteachings of that federation, the twelve tribes of Israel. We should do \nour very best to uphold that Constitution and again not to depend upon \nthe Supreme Court of the United States to do our work. We should not \nhand off our responsibility to the Supreme Court.\n  In this instance, I am proud of the Supreme Court. At no moment in my \nlife have I ever been more proud of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates than I am today. God save that honorable Court!\n  I close, if I may, with the lines written by Henry Wadsworth \nLongfellow in ``The Building of the Ship.'' I think they are most \nappropriate for this occasion:\n\n     Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!\n     Sail on, O Union, strong and great!\n     Humanity with all its fears,\n     With all the hopes of future years,\n     Is hanging breathless on thy fate!\n     We know what Master laid thy keel,\n     What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,\n     Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,\n     What anvils rang, what hammers beat,\n     In what a forge and what a heat\n     Were shaped the anchors of thy hope!\n     For not each sudden sound and shock,\n     'T is of the wave and not the rock;\n     'T is but the flapping of the sail,\n     And not a rent made by the gale!\n     In spite of rock and tempest's roar,\n     In spite of false lights on the shore,\n     Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!\n     Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,\n     Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,\n     Our faith triumphant o'er our fears,\n     Are all with thee,--are all with thee!\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senators from \nArizona and Indiana are recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, there is a line that has entered American \nslang, and that is, ``That is a tough act to follow.'' Mr. President, I \nthink that certainly applies now when I make my remarks following those \nof our most distinguished Senator of the U.S. Senate, Senator Byrd.\n  Senator Byrd, I know that Senator Coats will say this for himself, \nbut both of us appreciate the honorable conduct of this many long \nyears' debate that we have had together--and, unfortunately, we will \nhave in the future, since Senator Coats and I do not intend to give up \non this issue.\n  More importantly, there was a seminal moment, I think after about 5 \nyears of our debating this issue, when you walked up to Senator Coats \nand me and said, ``I believe you're really sincere in your belief that \nthe line-item veto is both constitutional and appropriate for \nAmerica.'' That was, frankly, one of the greatest compliments that \neither one of us have been paid in our time here in the Senate.\n  May I say that Senator Coats and I continue to intend to fight this \nbattle. I must say, in all sincerity, it will be much more difficult \nfor me. It will be a much more arduous task without the\n\n[[Page S7053]]\n\ncompanionship and friendship of an individual that has the highest \nmoral standards and the highest dedication and commitment to the \nbetterment of this Nation and its families than my dear friend from \nIndiana. He is not gone yet from this body, and we have the rest of the \nyear to fight this battle, but one of my deepest regrets is that my \ndear friend and partner will not be there.\n  Mr. President, I intend to speak briefly on this issue, and I know \nthat Senator Coats does, also. Let me make just a couple of comments.\n  One, it is important to point out that my understanding of the reason \ngiven by the Supreme Court for the 6-3 decision was that the \nConstitution requires every bill to be presented to the President for \nhis approval or disapproval--every bill. In other words, my \nunderstanding of this decision is not that the concept of transferring \nthis power to the President of the United States lacked \nconstitutionality, but the fact that each bill was not sent to the \nPresident for approval or disapproval was where the Supreme Court made \nthis decision.\n  Now, if that is the case, it is an argument that S. 4--which Senator \nCoats and I cosponsored, and was passed by a vote of 69-29, known as \nseparate enrollment--will be constitutional. As we all know, we went \ninto negotiations with the House that passed enhanced recession--the \nbudgeteers and Finance Committee people--and we made certain \nconcessions which resulted in enhanced recession. But the original bill \nthat was passed by a vote of 69-29 through the Senate was separate \nenrollment, which meant that every bill would separately be presented \nto the President of the United States for his approval or disapproval.\n  In all due respect to my friend from Michigan, the allegation that \nsomehow we were handing constitutional power--if I wrote the words down \ncorrectly--``to repeal or modify laws without congressional \ninvolvement,'' clearly it calls for congressional involvement. The \nSenator from Michigan knows that. If he vetoes it, it comes back to the \nCongress of the United States for veto override. That is not \nnoninvolvement. Let's be very clear here as to what the original bill \nthat passed 69-29 said.\n  Finally, we can't justify spending $150,000 to fund the National \nCenter for Peanut Competitiveness, or $84,000 earmarked for Vidalia \nonions. My all-time favorite--one year we spent a couple million \ndollars to study the effect on the ozone layer of flatulence of cows. \nWe can't do that kind of thing.\n  Unfortunately, the President of the United States now, again, does \nnot have the power that 43 Governors in America have, and that is the \nline-item veto power.\n  Today, Senator Coats and I will reintroduce the separate enrollment \nbill that passed 69-29 through the U.S. Senate. We believe that clearly \nhas constitutionality, and we will be getting expert opinions. But our \ninitial understanding of the Supreme Court decision is based on the \nfact that these were not separate bills sent to the President of the \nUnited States for approval or disapproval. The fundamentals of the \nseparate enrollment bill, which passed in the 104th Congress by a vote \nof 69-29, was exactly that and will meet those standards.\n  We will have many more hours of discussion and debate on this issue \nboth in the public forums around America as well as on the floor of the \nSenate. I thank Senator Byrd for his extreme courtesy. I look forward \nto further debate with him and others on this issue. I believe the time \nand the opinion of the American people, as well as the Constitution of \nthe United States, is overwhelmingly in favor of the line-item veto in \nthe form of separate enrollment.\n  Today, The Supreme Court struck down the line-item veto in a 6-3 \ndecision. I am very saddened by this decision. This 6-3 decision \nconcludes that the line-item veto act violates the part of the \nConstitution requiring every bill to be presented to the President for \nhis approval.\n  This is a bad decision. Polls from previous years indicate that 83 \npercent of the American people support giving the President the line-\nitem veto. We need the line-item veto act to restore balance to the \nfederal budget process.\n  The line-item veto act was a vital force in restoring the appropriate \nbalance of power, and eliminating wasteful, unnecessary pork-barrel \nspending. Unfortunately, pork barrel spending is alive and well. Most \nrecently, the FY 1999 Agriculture Appropriations bill had $241,486,300 \nmillion in specifically earmarked pork-barrel spending. The FY 1999 \nEnergy Water Appropriations Bill contained approximately $649,428,000 \nmillion for specially earmarked projects that were not included in the \nbudget request.\n  We can not afford this magnitude of pork barrel spending when we have \naccumulated a multi-trillion dollar national debt. Right now, today, we \nuse a huge portion of our federal budget to make the interest payments \non our multi-trillion national debt. In fact, this interest payment \nalmost equals the entire budget for national defense.\n  Mr. President, we can not justify spending $150,000 to fund the \nNational Center for Peanut Competitiveness, or an $84,000 earmark for \nvidalia onion, when we should be using this money to pay down the \nnational debt, or provide tax cuts for hard-working middle class \nAmericans. Until recently, we amassed huge budget deficits. If we are \nto realize our anticipated future budget surpluses, we must exercise \nfiscal restraint.\n  Our past budget deficits can return to haunt us. These past deficits \ndid not occur by accident. They occurred because we shifted the balance \nof power away from the executive branch to the legislative branch. In \n1974 the Budget Impoundment Act was passed, which deprived the \nPresident of the United States of the authority to impound funds. This \nwas a tremendous shift in power. This shift eroded the executive \nbranch's ability to exercise fiscal responsibility and fiscal \nrestraint.\n  Our objective is to curb wasteful pork-barrel spending. Even though \nthe line-item veto was recently struck down, there are other means to \nreaffirm the appropriate balance of power, and curb pork-barrel \nspending.\n  Shortly, Senator Coats and I will introduce another approach to \ncurbing Congress' appetite for mindless unnecessary and wasteful \nspending of hard-working American's tax dollars.\n  Essentially, the Separate Enrollment Act of 1998 will require that \neach item in any appropriations measure or authorization shall be \nconsidered to be a separate item.\n  Legal scholars contend that the separate enrollment concept is \nconstitutional. Congress has the right to present a bill to the \nPresident of the United States. Separate enrollment merely addresses \nthe question of what constitutes a bill. It does not erode or interfere \nwith the presentment of the bill to the President. Under the rulemaking \nclause, Congress alone can determine the procedures for defining and \nenrolling a bill. Separate Enrollment is constitutional and will \nclearly work.\n  Separate Enrollment is not a new concept. This concept is not \ncontroversial. The Senate adopted S.4, a separate enrollment bill in \nthe 104th Congress, by a vote of 69 to 29. Its mechanics are simple * * \n*. This bill requires each spending item in legislation to be enrolled \nas a separate bill. If the President chose to veto one of these items, \neach of these vetoes would be returned to Congress separately for an \noverride.\n  The Separate Enrollment Act will help to restore some of the \nExecutive Branch's role in the Federal budgeting process. The current \nbudget process is in disarray. We have a huge national debt. We have \nbudget surpluses that can easily be ``spent'' away. Our system of \nchecks and balances is out of sync in the budget process. Congress has \ntoo much power over the federal purse strings, and the President has \ntoo little. While the line-item veto is not an instant fix to this \ndilemma, it is a valuable tool to realign the balance of powers, and \ncheck Congress' appetite for reckless pork barrel spending.\n  This is a nonpartisan issue. The issue is fiscal responsibility. We \nhave 100 Senators, and 435 Representatives. It is hard to place \nresponsibility upon any one member. Thus, no one is accountable for our \nrunaway budget process. The line-item veto act, or a separate \nenrollment bill would make it more difficult for the Congress to blame \nthe President for not vetoing an entire appropriations bill. Our new \nproposal will allow the President to surgically remove wasteful pork-\nbarrel spending from appropriations and authorizations bills.\n\n[[Page S7054]]\n\n  Past Presidents have sought the line-item veto. Congress finally \nagreed in 1995, when we passed the line item veto, to redistribute some \nof the power in the federal budget process. By giving the President a \nstronger role, the line-item veto, or a Separate Enrollment Act would \ninstill additional Presidential accountability and Federal spending, \nand reduce the excesses of the congressional process that focus on \nlocality specific earmarking, and caters to special interest, not the \nnational interest, as it should.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I simply ask my colleagues to be fair and \nreasonable when addressing the issue on fiscal responsibility. The \nline-item veto and the shifting the balance of power in the budget \nprocess is vital to curbing wasteful pork-barrel spending. Again, I \nlook forward to the day when we can go before the American people with \na budget that is both fiscally responsible and ends the practice of \nearmarking funds in the appropriations process.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor at this time to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona for his \nkind remarks.\n  I also want to congratulate the Senator from West Virginia for a \nsignificant victory. The Senator had indicated during the debate that \nhe believed and had reason to believe that the bill we were sending to \nthe President, which was signed by the President and exercised by the \nPresident, would not stand constitutional muster. The Court affirmed \nthat conclusion.\n  I also congratulate the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, for \nbeing the guardian of this institution. He stands at the gate to retain \nits hallowed practices and rules and traditions. And in this modern age \nof seeking the expedient and convenient over the tried, tested, and \ntrue, the Senator's contributions are extremely important to the future \nof this institution. I commend him for that. He is also a \nconstitutional scholar without peer in this institution.\n  This Senator, as I did yesterday and as I do today, stands up with \nsome trepidation in terms of discussing issues and matters of the \nConstitution, because I know I am doing so with someone who has studied \nit for far longer and has a far better understanding of it than I have.\n  When Senator McCain and I addressed the issue of the line-item veto, \nwe consulted a number of constitutional scholars. It is fair to say \nthat there is disagreement. There are constitutional scholars, \nrecognized scholars, who believed that the process of enhanced \nrescission was not line-item veto, per se, enhanced rescission was a \nconstitutionally acceptable process, that it did retain a balance of \npower, it did retain the prerogative of Congress to override the \nPresidential veto. And it is my understanding, along with Senator \nMcCain's, on a quick reading, I would say--not even a full reading, but \na very brief overview of the decision that is handed down, and I look \nforward to reading the entire case--that what the Court addressed was \nmore procedural than principle, the procedure of the omnibus bill being \npresented to the President and, as the Senator from Michigan said, \nbeing signed, and then in a sense accepted and then reviewed relative \nto certain aspects of that.\n  The Court obviously sided with the argument so ably presented by the \nSenator from New York, who has left the floor--the Senator from \nVirginia, the Senator from New York, the Senator from Michigan, and \nothers.\n  It is the principle that Senator McCain and I are attempting to \naddress, not the procedure. We had spent numerous hours of discussion \nand debate in attempting to establish a procedure whereby the principle \nof a balance against what we considered to be--and many, I think, of \nthe American people considered to be --an irresponsible exercise of the \nspending power of the Congress--not the right to have the power of the \npurse, but an irresponsible use of that, and the voluntary transfer of \nsome of that power, yet retaining a balance in terms of the division of \npower between the branches, as the founders intended. That was our \nintent.\n  As Senator McCain said, the bill that passed the Senate with 69 votes \nas a separate enrollment procedure would have, I believe, addressed the \nconcerns of the Court by presenting to the President separate bills on \neach line item of spending. We didn't include the tax issue. That was \nadded at the request of members of the Finance Committee. Ours went \nspecifically to spending items. That was different from what was passed \nin the House of Representatives and perhaps now, in retrospect, a \nfaulty decision. We ceded the Senate procedure to the House procedure, \nand we paid the price of that ceding--or perhaps not; we don't know for \nsure what the Supreme Court would have done with that.\n\n  The principle of each decision by the Congress standing on its own \nmerits--having the light of day shine on that spending decision, so \nthat the American people know that our yea is a yea and our nay is a \nnay, and not the procedure of hiding what arguably could be decisions \non spending that would not stand the light of day and not receive a \nmajority of support, because it is subsumed by the importance of the \nbroader legislation--is really the principle that we are attempting to \naddress.\n  We want what is decided in the back halls to be debated on the Senate \nfloor. We want to give each Senator and Representative the opportunity \nto say, ``I support that,'' or, ``I don't support that,'' and discuss \nit on the merits, rather than saying, ``I didn't know about that \nbecause it was added in the back room. It was part of a thousand-page \nbill, and we didn't have the time to peruse each line of that \nlegislation. And, yes, had I had an opportunity to vote on that \nseparately, there is no way I would have supported that irresponsible \nuse of the taxpayers' dollars.''\n  So we are seeking a way of attempting to bring into the process a \nmeans by which we could achieve a check against imbalance, against what \nwe considered to be spending that had not been given the opportunity to \nbe addressed and discussed and debated on the merits. We think it is a \ndeceptive practice. We think it is a distasteful practice. We think it \ndoes not enhance the public's opinion of this institution and the \nprocesses by which we make decisions. We think it is an irresponsible \nexercise of the fiscal discipline that the taxpayers of America expect \nus to exercise in the spending of their dollars.\n  That is the genesis behind the legislation that Senator McCain and I \nhave authored and fought for 10 years to pass, and finally did pass.\n  So are we disappointed with the Supreme Court decision? Yes, deeply \ndisappointed. Do we see it as a permanent defeat? No, we don't. We \nthink a preliminary reading, and hopefully a further careful reading \nand study of the Supreme Court's decision, will indicate that the Court \ndecided on the basis of the procedure used, not on the basis of the \nprinciple involved. The principle involved ought to be at the center \nand heart of our debate and discussion. I hope that as we engage in \nfuture battles--I guess that is the proper word, because those were \nheated debates, but principled, heated debates--we can focus on the \nprinciple and not the procedure.\n  Questions have been raised about the cumbersome nature of separate \nenrollment procedurally, with a large piece of legislation having to be \nbroken down into its separate pieces. Up until a few years ago that was \nan argument that carried a lot of persuasion and a lot of weight. But \nwith the advent of modern technology--computer technology--and with \nsome visits by myself and others to study with the enrollment clerk, \nand the witnessing of the utilization of that modern technology in \nterms of how bills are printed, how they are enrolled, and how they are \npresented for enrollment, we have the opportunity to take advantage of \nthose marvelous improvements in the way in which we procedurally enroll \nlegislation that is now technologically feasible. What would have taken \nliterally days and perhaps hundreds of enrollment clerks, scribes, \nworking away diligently in the basement of the Capitol separating out \nthe bill, enrolling separate pieces of legislation, and having those \nsigned and presented to the President of the United States, and having \nthe President attempt to deal with it to the point he would have no \nother time to\n\n[[Page S7055]]\n\ndeal with any of his other duties and certainly achieve writers' cramp, \nthat no longer is a problem. Technology has allowed us to bypass that.\n  So we intend to introduce as early as today a procedure--a process--\nwhich 69 of our Members, on a bipartisan basis, have supported, which \naddresses the principle of the issue and not the procedure of the \nissue. We look forward to the debate that will occur. We look forward \nto the opportunity to give our Members, all 69 of them--Democrats and \nRepublicans--the opportunity to, once again, support a responsible \npractice of spending the taxpayer dollars in the most responsible way \nthat we can.\n  Mr. President, I will close. I wish I were as eloquent and as \narticulate as the Senator from West Virginia. I wish I could reach into \nmy mind and recall the words of the famous scholars, constitutional \nexperts, or a poem that was appropriate to the discussion. I don't have \nthat capacity. I don't have that talent. I admire that greatly in \nSenator Byrd. What discipline it must have taken to commit to flawless \nmemory the words of historians, the thoughts of some of the greatest \nthinkers that this world has ever seen, the magic and beauty of the \npoetry that expresses those thoughts in the recall that the Senator \nhas.\n  I am leaving the Senate this year. I will take with me many lifetime \nmemories, not of process but of people--some of the most extraordinary \npeople, I think, ever to have had the privilege of being born into this \ngreatest of all nations and serve in this greatest of all institutions. \nI take away a vast reservoir of memories of 100 unique individuals with \nsome of the greatest and most extraordinary talents to be found \nanywhere. And none of them, I think, transcends the abilities and the \nextraordinary capabilities of the Senator from West Virginia, who I \nhave enjoyed serving with, even though we have found ourselves on \nopposite sides of a number of issues, and we have found ourselves on \nthe same side on several issues.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I don't want to interrupt this flow, but I \nwant to join very briefly.\n  Mr. President, I stand here merely as a foot soldier in this \ndiscussion. However, I would like to take a moment to offer some \ncomments on the Supreme Court's decision today to strike down the line-\nitem veto as unconstitutional.\n  I am proud to say that I was one of 29 Members who in March of 1995 \ncast a vote against the line-item veto, along with the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, \nand Senator Moynihan and 25 others on that day who expressed their \nopinion that they opposed this legislation--not as I recall, although \nothers may have said, because they disagreed with the approach to deal \nwith the budget issue. In my view, it had little or nothing to do with \nthe budget process, but had everything to do with the issue that \nprovoked the briefs to be filed, amicus curiae briefs, and the \nsubsequent legal actions--that issue is the constitutionality of the \nline-item veto.\n  I just wanted to point out that I was looking over the vote. And of \nthe 29 people who voted against the line-item veto in March of 1995, \nsix Members of that group of 29 have since left the Chamber. This list \nincludes our distinguished colleagues Senators Hatfield, Johnston, \nNunn, Pell, Pryor, and Simon. Two others who voted nay--Senators \nBumpers and Glenn--will be leaving at the end of this Congress.\n  The other day, someone counted some 100 different proposals which are \nbeing drafted or have been introduced that would amend the Constitution \nin one way or another.\n  I am not questioning the intentions or even the desired goals that \nthose constitutional proposals have in mind. But the framers and the \nfounders of the document, which I happen to carry with me as well--a \nlesson I learned one day watching the distinguished colleague from West \nVirginia. I got my copy of the Constitution. I carry it in my pocket \nevery single day, and have ever since, along with a copy of the \nDeclaration of Independence, which is included here.\n  It is our job here to do everything we can to advance the goals and \ndesires of our society, particularly as we enter a new millennium and a \nnew century. But the fundamental principles, values and ideals \nincorporated in the Constitution, the basic organic law of our country, \nare rooted in sound philosophical judgments. And the temptation, \nparticularly in the midst of great difficulties--and certainly the \nbudget crisis was no small difficulty with $300 billion of deficits a \nyear, $4 trillion in debt--the temptation to want to come up with an \nanswer to that was profound and significant.\n  There will be other such crises, maybe not of that nature, but maybe \nof other natures that will come along, and the temptation will be to \nsolve that problem and to do so by circumventing the values and \nprinciples incorporated into the Constitution. I only hope that we \nremind ourselves of what our forbearers had been struck with; and that \nis not to in any way denigrate or detract from the fundamental \nprinciples of the Constitution as we struggle through a very \ndeliberative, painful, oftentimes annoying and frustrating process \ncalled democracy to address the issues of our day.\n  I often point out to my constituents back home that as a country we \nhave been through a great Civil War, two World Wars in this century, \nand a Great Depression when I am sure the temptations were great to \namend or suspend parts of our Constitution, our Bill of Rights \nparticularly. And we never saw fit to do so during all of those great \ncrises. We never saw fit to do so. We thrive and are strong today as a \nnation without having made a single change in the Bill of Rights--not \none change since those words were first crafted and drafted in 1789--\nnot a single word. Not a single syllable has been changed in the Bill \nof Rights.\n  I hope that as we look forward to a new century and a new millennium, \nwith all the unanticipated problems we face as a nation in the world, \nthat we will not be tempted to be drawn ``to the flame''--to use the \nanalogy of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia--to draw to \nthat flame which could defeat it. And I will not put flame to this \ndocument and destroy the very principles and values which I think are \nthe rationale and reason for why we have achieved the level of \ngreatness that we have as a people.\n  As one Member of this body, I suspect, speaking on behalf of the six \nwho are no longer here, and those who are not here on the floor, we \nthank you immensely on behalf of our constituents, both past, present \nand in the future, for the three of you, along with Senator Hatfield \nwho led this effort beyond the Chamber here and brought the matter to \nthe highest court of our land. I also extend my gratitude to those six \nSupreme Court Justices for the decision they handed down today.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. And, \nagain, I have said to him in meetings of our own committee, where we \nsat together and worked together so many times, Dan Coats is going to \nbe missed in the Senate. He has been one terrific Senator, and Indiana \ncan be very proud that they sent someone of his talent, ability, and \ntenacity. I would much rather have him as an ally than an opponent. I \nhave been an ally of his and have been on the opposite side. Believe \nme, it is much more pleasant to have Dan Coats on your side. It is a \nprivilege to say so on this floor, as I have on other occasions.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nDodd, for his incisive observations with respect to the roster of those \nwho voted against the Line-item Veto Act on March 23, 1995, and for his \nvery eloquent statement.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to join in thanking----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Indiana yield to the \nSenator from North Dakota?\n  Mr. COATS. I would be happy to do that if I could just do a unanimous \nconsent request. Then I would be happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be very happy to yield.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator.\n\n[[Page S7056]]\n\n  First of all, Mr. President, in relationship to the issue of \ndiscussion, I believe it important to the legislative history of the \nLine Item Veto Act to have the brief prepared by the Senate counsel in \nsupport of the line item veto submitted to the Record. However, in the \nspirit of fiscal responsibility, to spare the taxpayer expense of \nprinting the entire document, I ask unanimous consent that the front \ncover of the brief be printed in the Record. The cover provides the \nnecessary source information to assist anyone seeking to review the \nfull document in locating a complete copy. I encourage Senators to \nexamine this excellent brief along with the Court decision.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              No. 97-1374\n\n    [In the Supreme Court of the United States, October Term, 1997]\n\n  William J.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss \nbriefly the Supreme Court's decision earlier today to strike down the \nline-item veto law and to a new approach to the line-item veto that \naims to cut some of the vast fat contained in our annual spending \nbills, but will stand up to constitutional scrutiny.\n  Though the Court found that the line-item veto legislation was \nflawed, I supported the experimental line-item veto authority we gave \nthe President in 1996 as a means of controlling Congress' voracious \nappetite for pork.\n  I had great concerns about many aspects of the legislation. My \ngreatest concern was granting a greatly expanded veto authority that \nretained the two-thirds override threshold that the Constitution \nprovides for the Presidential veto of entire bills. Extending that \nauthority for individual sections of a bill worried me. And the Court \nfound that this represented an inappropriate shift in the balance of \npower from the legislative branch to the executive. I do not question \nthe Court's decision.\n  Mr. President, I don't believe, nor have I ever believed that \nenhanced rescission authority, whether it be the line-item veto or some \nother vehicle, is the whole answer to our deficit and spending problem, \nor even most of the answer, but it certainly can be part of the answer.\n  I am working on a bill that would allow expedited rescission. It \npromises to be a useful tool to help reduce the Federal deficit and \nbring the Federal budget truly into balance, and more importantly to \nbring reform to our appropriations process.\n  The introduction of this bill would be extremely timely given this \nbody's consideration of the fiscal year 1999 spending bills. Ideally, \nwe would have an expedited rescissions law in place for this year's \nappropriations bills, but I know that won't happen. What surely will \nhappen is the stealthy insertion of an extensive list of wasteful and \nunnecessary projects and programs that pick clean the wallets of this \ncountry's taxpayers.\n  This bill would allow the Congress and the President to work together \nto exercise the kind of specific budget pruning that many of us feel is \na necessary response to the budget abuses that persist in the \nappropriations process.\n  Mr. President, this bill would enable the President to propose \neliminating specific spending items for veto and would allow Congress \nto support or oppose the President's suggestions on a simple up or down \nvote.\n  This bill would accomplish the objectives of the line-item veto--\neliminating wasteful and unnecessary spending--but without violating \nthe constitutional principles of separation of power and balance of \npower.\n  Mr. President, I believe this bill would be an effective means of \nfighting wasteful spending, certainly something everyone opposes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask before I yield to the Senator how \nmuch time is remaining on the earlier allocated time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. COATS. Is that sufficient? I yield the Senator the remainder of \nour time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from Indiana very much for his \ncourtesy.\n  Let me just say I have found the Senator from Indiana to be among the \nmost courteous of our colleagues, and we are very much going to miss \nhim. I think he is an outstanding U.S. Senator, an extraordinarily \ndecent person, and I am personally going to miss him from this body.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator for those remarks. They are generous, \nand also the Senator from Connecticut, I appreciate his remarks. I \ndon't want anybody to misunderstand those remarks or interpret those \nremarks to mean that the Senator is finished for the year. I expect to \nbe back in the Chamber, and I hope that Senators feel the same way \nabout me at the end of the session as they do now.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am sure we will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. I take just a minute to thank the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd. I thank him for standing \nup to protect the Constitution of the United States. I don't think \nthere is any higher responsibility for a Member of this body, because \nwe all take a solemn oath when we are sworn in to preserve, protect, \nand defend the Constitution of the United States. That is the organic \nlaw of our country. It is a Constitution that is truly genius in what \nit has done for our country. We are a very young country, but already \nthe rest of the world seeks to emulate us. And one of the reasons is \nthe genius of that organic law, that document that has provided for the \nstructure of this Government.\n  Senator Byrd convinced me when we were debating the question of line-\nitem veto, and I must say the constituency pressure from my State was \nall on behalf of supporting the line-item veto. I did not because I was \nconvinced, after lengthy discussions with Senator Byrd, that it \nviolated the Constitution of the United States and that, in fact, part \nof the genius of that document was the separation of powers and the \npower of the purse being put in the hands of the Congress of the United \nStates to reflect the will of the people of this country. And to have \nthat power diluted not because Members of Congress are seeking power \nbut because the Constitution established the framework to protect the \nrights of the people, that is the extraordinary genius of our \nConstitution. And nobody has been more vigilant in defending that \nConstitution than the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd.\n  I thank him because it was not an easy task. It was not a popular \ntask. But he was right to do it. And the rightness of his position has \nbeen confirmed by this ruling by the Supreme Court. It was not a close \nruling. By a 6 to 3 vote, the Supreme Court of the United States has \nsaid, yes, Senator Byrd and others who made that judgment were correct. \nWe would be doing damage and injury to the Constitution of the United \nStates if we were to approve the line-item veto that had been passed by \nthe Congress of the United States.\n  So I say to Senator Byrd a sincere thank-you, because what he has \ndone is in the finest tradition of the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am out of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD.

The Senate, under a previous order, is \nauthorized to deal with the amendment concerning Reserve retirement, \nfor 10 minutes, equally divided.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3004\n\n(Purpose: To require actions to eliminate the backlog of unpaid retired \n                     pay relating to Army service)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3004.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 634. ELIMINATION OF BACKLOG OF UNPAID RETIRED PAY.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--The Secretary of the Army shall take such \n     actions as are necessary to eliminate, by December 31, 1998, \n     the backlog of unpaid retired pay for members and former \n     members of the Army (including members and former members of \n     the Army Reserve and the Army National Guard).\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Army shall submit \n     to Congress a report on the backlog of unpaid retired pay. \n     The report shall include the following:\n       (1) The actions taken under subsection (a).\n       (2) The extent of the remaining backlog.\n       (3) A discussion of any additional actions that are \n     necessary to ensure that retired pay is paid in a timely \n     manner.\n       (c) Funding.--Of the amount authorized to be appropriated \n     under section 421, $1,700,000 shall be available for carrying \n     out this section.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Let me begin my thanking my colleagues on both the minority \nand majority sides for their support of this amendment. I rise on \nbehalf of military retirees, all of whom are due a pension and medical \nbenefits at age 60, as all of my colleagues are well aware. This \namendment directs the Secretary of the Army to eliminate by the end of \nthis calendar year a serious backlog that has developed in the \nprocessing of pension applications by Army personnel.\n  My awareness of this problem began, as I think my colleagues will \nappreciate, with a letter that I received from a constituent, Mr. \nArthur Greenberg, of Hamden, CT. Mr. Greenberg, a Vietnam veteran, \nretired from the military in 1984. Mr. Greenberg submitted his pension \napplication back in February, 6 months before his 60th birthday. \nRecently, he called to check on the status of his claim and was told \nthat his pension claim would not be processed until 9 months after his \n60th birthday. I assumed that this was just an isolated case and merely \na problem to be corrected through the normal corrections in the \nbureaucracy.\n  The Army informed me, however, that this is not an isolated case, and \nthat its retirement benefits office presently holds a backlog of 2,000 \ncases out of a total of 5,000. So Mr. Greenberg's situation is not the \nexception but fast becoming the majority of cases, in terms of pensions \nto be received. In other words, 2,000 military retirees who have \nreached their 60th birthday and become eligible for pensions and \nmedical benefits are waiting for those benefits to come.\n  The number of military retirees who become pension eligible increases \nevery year. In 1994, there were 6,700 pension packages that were \nsubmitted. In 1996, the number jumped to 8,700. By the end of this \nyear, over 10,000 Army retirees will have asked for their pensions. To \ngive you some sense of where this is headed, 10 years from now that \nnumber will be 29,000 applications for pensions and medical benefits. \nIn the face of this steady increase in the number of pension-eligible \nretirees, the office that processes Army pensions has been reduced from \nas many as 40 personnel a couple of years ago to just 17 people today.\n  I realize the Army must make personnel reductions, but in view of its \nincreasing workload, the Army pension office should not be so \ndrastically cut. Some retired soldiers who spent a career defending \nthis country cannot easily afford to wait for several months to begin \nreceiving their retirement benefits. Those benefits make a difference \nin the majority of these people's lives.\n  From the first day of boot camp, the Army has demanded from those who \ngo through that process that they be punctual and responsible. Now, \nhowever, they must camp out by their mailboxes while they wait on the \nArmy to provide the benefits to which each of them is entitled and due. \nThis amendment, very simply, directs the Secretary of the Army to \nsubmit a report to Congress regarding this backlog and eliminate the \nbacklog no later than December 31, 1998.\n  Furthermore, it requires the Defense Department to provide up to $1.7 \nmillion from existing funds to eliminate the backlog of Army pension \nclaims--$1.1 million to update antiquated computer systems and another \n$600,000 to hire some additional 10 civilian personnel. That would get \nyou up to 27--far short of the 40 we had before.\n  By the way, I should say that the Army supports this amendment. They \ndon't like the idea they cannot provide these benefits. But they \nbelieve these numbers would allow them to update their computer systems \nand hire the necessary personnel to process the claims. Then we can \navoid, to put it mildly, the embarrassment of seeing these pensioners \nwait to get the dollars they are due. But, more important, the people \nwho deserve these benefits will receive them on time.\n  I am very grateful to our colleagues, both the distinguished Senator \nfrom South Carolina, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, as \nwell as my colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, and the other \nmembers of the committee for their support of this amendment. I am \ngrateful to them for allowing it to be considered and adopted, as I am \ntold it will be, by approval of both sides.\n  I yield to my colleague from Michigan, whom I see on the floor, for \nany comments he wishes to make on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nproceed for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me congratulate Senator Dodd for his\n\n[[Page S7058]]\n\namendment. It is inconceivable to me, as it was to him, that a retired \nreservist would have to wait for up to 9 months to receive the first \npension check. The Army must fix this problem, and quickly. We will do \neverything we can to ensure that this issue is addressed and is \nresolved very quickly, and it will be Senator Dodd's tenacity that is \ngoing to drive the appropriate quick response and outcome on this \nissue.\n\n  So the amendment has strong support in the Armed Services Committee, \nand it has been cleared by both sides, I understand. I believe the \namendment could be adopted at this point.\n  Mr. President. I understand the amendment has been cleared by both \nsides.\n  Mr. THURMOND. It has been cleared by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3004) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I had some time allocated for another \namendment here that addresses Lyme disease, which we in Connecticut are \npainfully aware of since the name ``Lyme disease\" comes from Lyme, CT, \nthe town where it first achieved prominence. But I am going to defer on \nthat and allow the Senate to consider the amendment at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWashington is to be recognized. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3005\n\n           (Purpose: Relating to burial honors for veterans)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Mr. \n     Murkowski, and Mr. Sarbanes, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3005.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 268, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1064. BURIAL HONORS FOR VETERANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Throughout the years, men and women have unselfishly \n     answered the call to arms, at tremendous personal sacrifice. \n     Burial honors for deceased veterans are an important means of \n     reminding Americans of the sacrifices endured to keep the \n     Nation free.\n       (2) The men and women who serve honorably in the Armed \n     Forces, whether in war or peace, and whether discharged, \n     separated, or retired, deserve commemoration for their \n     military service at the time of their death by an appropriate \n     military tribute.\n       (3) It is tremendously important to pay an appropriate \n     final tribute on behalf of a grateful Nation to honor \n     individuals who served the Nation in the Armed Forces.\n       (b) Conference on Military Burial Honor Practices.--(1) Not \n     later than October 31, 1998, the Secretary of Defense shall, \n     in consultation with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, \n     convene and preside over a conference for the purpose of \n     determining means of improving and increasing the \n     availability of military burial honors for veterans. The \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall also participate in the \n     conference.\n       (2) The Secretaries shall invite and encourage the \n     participation at the conference of appropriate \n     representatives of veterans service organizations.\n       (3) The participants in the conference shall--\n       (A) review current policies and practices of the military \n     departments and the Department of Veterans Affairs relating \n     to the provision of military honors at the burial of \n     veterans;\n       (B) analyze the costs associated with providing military \n     honors at the burial of veterans, including the costs \n     associated with utilizing personnel and other resources for \n     that purpose;\n       (C) assess trends in the rate of death of veterans; and\n       (D) propose, consider, and determine means of improving and \n     increasing the availability of military honors at the burial \n     of veterans.\n       (4) Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the conference under this subsection. The report \n     shall set forth any modifications to Department of Defense \n     directives on military burial honors adopted as a result of \n     the conference and include any recommendations for \n     legislation that the Secretary considers appropriate as a \n     result of the conference.\n       (c) Veterans Service Organization Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``veterans service organization'' means any \n     organization recognized by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \n     under section 5902 of title 38, United States Code.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss my amendment to the \nDepartment of Defense authorization legislation regarding burial honors \nfor deceased veterans. I ask that my full statement be made part of the \nRecord.\n  Earlier this year, along with Senator Murkowski and Senator Sarbanes, \nI introduced the Veterans Burial Rights Act of 1998. Our bill requires \nthe Department of Defense to provide honor guard services upon request \nat the funerals of our veterans. Importantly, my bill was crafted with \nthe direct participation of numerous veterans service organizations and \nhas been endorsed by the Former Prisoner of War, the Paralyzed Veterans \nof America, AMVETS and the American Legion.\n  I got involved in this issue several years ago for a very simple \nreason. Sadly, all across this country, veterans are being buried \nwithout full military honors--honors earned through service to us all. \nWe asked these soldiers, sailors, and airmen to travel to distant \nshores to risk the ultimate sacrifice. It seems only fair to ask the \nDOD to travel to a nearby community to remember and honor the \nsacrifices of our veterans.\n  I believe we have a moral responsibility to tell each and every \nveteran at his or her funeral that we remember and we honor their \nservice to our country. That message is so important to families who \nhave sacrificed so much for our country.\n  I can speak personally to the importance of the Veterans Burial \nRights. Act. I lost my own father last year, a World War II veteran and \nproud member of the Disabled American Veterans. My family was lucky, we \nwere able to arrange for burial honors at his service. Having the honor \nguard there for my family made a big difference and created a lasting \nimpression for my family. We were all--and particularly my mother--\nfilled with pride at a very difficult moment for our family as Dad's \nservice was recognized one final time.\n  The Veterans Burial Rights Act seeks to ensure we make the same \nburial honors available to veterans and families who specifically \nrequest the honors at a funeral service.\n  Unfortunately, the Department of Defense has opposed the Veterans \nBurial Rights Act. The DOD has bombarded Capitol Hill with doomsday \nproclamations about my bill.\n  The DOD's stance has been particularly offensive to the veterans of \nour country. Not only did the DOD oppose a greater DOD role in \nproviding burial honors for veterans, but they even went so far as to \nsuggest the Department of Veterans Affairs should pay for honors taking \nadditional dollars from health care, rehabilitative services and other \nveterans programs.\n  The DOD recently wrote to the Armed Services Committee claiming that \na four-person burial honors detail ``would have required 12,345 man-\nyears of effort at a cost of $547 million to support the 537,000 \nveterans' funerals held in 1997.'' The last part is a direct quote. \nAccording to the DOD, funeral support in 1997 would have required \n12,345 man-years and $547 million for 537,000 funerals. I must say, \nthat's impressive accounting for an agency that can't figure out the \ngoing rate for hammers and toilet seats.\n  The DOD has chosen to fight my attempts to increase funeral support \nto veterans with funhouse mirrors. The DOD's arguments are based on \nproviding funeral support to every veteran who dies. That's absurd. \nVeterans know this is not possible, logistics and cost will always be a \nfactor. And most veterans' families will not request the services. The \nvast majority of veterans' families do not seek burial honors today. We \nare simply trying to provide burial honors for veterans whose families \nrequest the honors.\n\n[[Page S7059]]\n\n  The House of Representatives included a version of the Veterans \nBurial Rights Act in their version of the DOD authorization. The DOD \nissued an appeal to the House urging the ``exclusion'' of this language \nthreatening that funeral support would have negative impact on \npersonnel and operational readiness. And I should point out again that \nthe DOD is choosing to interpret our legislative proposals and interest \nin this issue in the most negative manner.\n  From the very beginning, we have sought to leave the DOD with the \nflexibility to write the directives on funeral support. No one wants to \nundermine the basic mission of the department. And particularly our \nveterans who continue to hold the various services in high esteem. But \nwe do believe that the Department and individual services can and \nshould do more on burial honors. We believe all of our assets--from the \nveterans service organizations to active and reserve components to ROTC \ncadets all across the country--can be utilized in a comprehensive and \ncooperative effort to provide burial honors for veterans and families \nseeking a final, deserved tribute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I understood I had 10 minutes to speak on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes equally divided.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I do not believe there is anybody speaking in opposition \nto this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that since the \nSenator from Maryland wants to speak for the amendment for a few \nminutes--\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield such time as he needs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Does the Senator from Washington need additional time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I need an additional 5 minutes. It is my understanding I \nhad 10. If I can have 5 minutes and Senator Sarbanes 2 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. The Senator can have any time she needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 5 minutes \nalso. Is it my understanding you have yielded your 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Washington.\n  Mr. THURMOND. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask the Senator from Maryland be yielded 2 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. President, from the very \nbeginning, we have sought to leave the DOD with the flexibility to \nwrite the directives on funeral support. No one wants to undermine the \nbasic mission of this Department, especially our various veterans \nservice organizations. They hold the Department of Defense and their \nservice in high esteem.\n  Already, veterans across the country are seeking to fill the void \nleft by the DOD's inability to provide burial honors for veterans. \nVeterans service organizations want to be involved in the funerals of \ntheir fellow veterans. And we want them to continue to be involved. But \nthe DOD overlooks this important asset. We are simply saying that VSO's \nand particularly older veterans cannot meet the demand alone.\n  The DOD wants to study the issue. We know that more than 30,000 World \nWar II vets are dying each month and the veterans death rate is \nincreasingly rapidly. We need to act in the short term or America's \nheroic World War II veterans will be gone before the DOD decides to \nact. That's why my amendment gives the DOD 180 days to come up with new \ndirectives and legislative recommendations for the Congress. Every day \nwe wait, a bit of our history passes away without recognition and \ngratitude.\n  My amendment is very straightforward. It simply calls the DOD's bluff \non burial honors for veterans. The DOD will be directed to hold a \nconference on burial honors by October 31, 1998 in cooperation with the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and veterans service organizations. \nFollowing the enactment of this legislation, the DOD will have 180 days \nto report back to the Congress detailing new DOD directives on funeral \nsupport and burial honors policy and forward to Congress any \nappropriate legislative recommendations.\n  This is essentially what the DOD has pledged to the Congress in \nopposing more expansive legislation on funeral support. My amendment \nseeks to hold the DOD accountable to its pledges to the Congress and \nour veterans. This is a real opportunity to make progress on this issue \nand I encourage the DOD to make the most of this opportunity. \nOtherwise, I can assure the Department that we will be back with more \ndefinitive language defining what the Congress believes are appropriate \nburial honors.\n  Many of our services have taken a positive role, and I especially \ncommend the Commandant of the Marine Corps who issued a white paper on \nfuneral support. General Krulak, to his credit, says we can and we will \nhonor current and former marines.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his white letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        White Letter of 12-02-97\n\n     From: Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n     To: All General Officers, All Commanding Officers, All \n       Officers in Charge.\n     Subject: Funeral Support.\n\n       1. This past January, I signed ALMAR 003-97 which \n     emphasized the Marine Corps' commitment to funeral support. \n     Properly laying a fallen Marine to rest is one of the final \n     tributes that the Marine Corps can render to our own. This \n     service provides comfort to grieving families and \n     demonstrates our wholehearted and enduring commitment to \n     those who have earned the title ``Marine.'' Unfortunately, I \n     continue to receive letters and E-mails from family members, \n     disappointed that the Marine Corps failed to support them \n     during their hours of need. I am appalled, dismayed, and \n     outraged that I continue to receive these letters. Failing to \n     provide funeral support to a Marine, for whatever reason, is \n     completely contradictory to our ethos and diminishes the \n     value of our fallen comrades' service.\n       2. Specific guidance for funeral support is contained in \n     MCO P3040.4D. The Marine Corps Casualty Procedures Manual, \n     and reemphasized in ALMAR 003-97, Military Funeral Support. \n     While I understand that an individual unit may not be able to \n     support every funeral request, I cannot imagine our precious \n     Corps ever turning down the request to properly bury a fellow \n     Marine. If your unit cannot provide a funeral detail, find \n     one that will.\n       3. I want my intent and guidance to ring loud and clear \n     concerning funeral support to families of Marines and former \n     Marines--it is our duty and we would have it no other way! \n     Anything less is UNACCEPTABLE. I expect this guidance to be \n     disseminated to every Marine Corps command, inspector-\n     instructor staff, recruiting station, and administrative \n     detachment. Ensure that all units are fully aware of my \n     feelings on this matter and they uphold the long tradition of \n     properly honoring a fallen Marine.\n                                                      C.C. Krulak.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, he says:\n\n       Properly laying a fallen Marine to rest is one of the final \n     tributes that the Marine Corps can render to our own. This \n     service provides comfort to grieving families and \n     demonstrates our wholehearted and enduring commitment to \n     those who have earned the title Marine. Unfortunately, I \n     continue to receive letters and E-mails from family members, \n     disappointed that the Marine Corps failed to support them \n     during their hours of need. I am appalled, dismayed and \n     outraged that I continue to receive these letters. Failing to \n     provide funeral support to a Marine, for whatever reason, is \n     completely contradictory to our ethos and diminishes the \n     value of our fallen comrades' service.\n\n  General Krulak goes on to say:\n\n       I want my intent and guidance to ring loud and clear \n     concerning funeral support to families of Marines and former \n     Marines--it is our duty and we would have it not other way! \n     Anything less is unacceptable.\n\n  These are very powerful words and I commend General Krulak and the \nMarine Corps for making this a priority issue. General Krulak has taken \nour objective from the very beginning of this effort and turned it into \nMarine practice each and every day.\n  Is it really too much to ask of our country that we do a better job \nremembering those who answered the call to duty, risked the ultimate \nsacrifice, and paved the way to the peace and prosperity we all enjoy \ntoday?\n  Until very recently, I doubted the DOD's sincerity in this effort. We \ndo have a long way to go on this issue, I do think it is important to \nacknowledge that progress has been made in recent months on this issue. \nOf course, the Marines are taking a leadership role. But it should also \nbe noted that Army and Air Force are taking positive steps on the \nburial honors issue. This progress is the direct result of pressure \nfrom the Congress, from our veterans, and from the families of veterans \nwho fought for burial honors.\n\n[[Page S7060]]\n\n  My amendment is an opportunity to build upon this progress. It's a \nstep forward but I remind my colleagues that we cannot address this \nissue in steps alone. We need to move quickly, and that's what we are \nasking the Department of Defense to do.\n  I ask the Senate to accept this straightforward amendment. By \nadopting this amendment and holding the Department of Defense \naccountable, the Congress will send a powerful message to veterans that \ntheir service to us all will never be forgotten.\n  Mr. President, I know that this amendment has been accepted by both \nsides. I thank all of my colleagues for working with us. We are \ndirecting the Department of Defense to return definitively, quickly to \nus with a response to this before it is too late.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Mikulski as a \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nSenator from Washington in offering this amendment requiring the \nDepartment of Defense and the Veterans' Administration to sit down with \nthe Veterans Service Organizations to find ways to honorable pay our \nlast respects to our nation's veterans. Six months after enactment of \nthis legislation, DoD will submit to Congress a report noting changes \nin DoD's policies for burial honors and recommendations for possible \nlegislation to address this problem.\n  Why is this needed?\n  Let me tell you. Veterans across the country are dying. These are the \nmen and women who have sacrificed so much for our country. How do we as \na nation pay our final respects--many times with one person with a \nfolded flag and a tape of taps. With World War II veterans growing \nolder, the problem will only get worse.\n  Even around Washington, DC, with its many military bases this \nhappens.\n  This is not uncommon. The father of one of my staff members passed \naway a few years ago on the West Coast. She thought that since he was a \nWorld War II veteran, he would receive an honor guard--an appropriate \nthank you for the service he had given our country.\n  What happened? As the family members watched, a member of the \nmilitary--one member came and handed over a flag. There was no honor \nguard, no bugler, no final send off for a job well done.\n  My staff person was shocked at the insensitivity and the impersonal \nnature of the burial service. I am shocked as all of us should be.\n  This is a disgrace.\n  Earlier this year Senator Murray, Senator Sarbanes and myself \nintroduced legislation that required a five person honor guard with a \nbugler. DoD opposed the legislation because of the potential costs and \ndrain on our military personnel.\n  Mr. President, although I understand DoD's arguments, something must \nbe done. This amendment moves the ball forward but it does not solve \nthe problem. I expect in DoD's report realistic suggestions on solving \nthis problem. One person and a tape of Taps is not an alternative.\n  In closing, I would like all of us to think about the honor that our \ncountry bestows on our veterans and the honor they deserve. An honor \nguard is the last instance that we as a nation can thank them for their \nservice.\n  They deserve no less. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I offer my very strong support to my \ncolleague from the State of Washington and commend her for her efforts \non behalf of our Nation's veterans. What we are dealing with is really \nan unacceptable situation. Families across the nation have come to \nexpect and depend on having a proper military burial for their loved \nones who have served in our Armed Forces. This is simply not happening. \nI joined earlier with the Senator from Washington and the Senator from \nAlaska, Senator Murkowski, in introducing legislation to in effect \nmandate a solution to this problem.\n  This amendment--and I think this is a commendable effort on the part \nof my distinguished colleague from Washington--will direct the \nDepartment of Defense, working with the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nto convene a summit and identify the means and manpower to meet this \nneed. Senator Murray has put this process on a very tight timeframe. \nThe Department has a 6-month period in which to come up with a plan to \ntake care of this problem.\n  I have received letters that would move you to tears in terms of the \nimportance that families place on providing a proper burial for their \nloved ones who have served in our armed services. Not every family \nrequests these honors. But for those families who seek a military \nburial and have it incorporated into their burial plans, this is an \nextremely important matter.\n  These military honors, honoring the sacrifice that members of armed \nservices have made for this country during their lifetimes, should \nalways be a high priority, I think, on behalf of the Congress and on \nbehalf of the Department. Unfortunately, this problem has not been \nrecognized as such until now--due to the tremendous outcry that this \nsituation be addressed. And Senator Murray has undertaken to make these \nburial rites a priority in a very positive and constructive and \nforthright way.\n\n  I am very pleased that the managers of the bill have agreed to accept \nthis amendment. I think that through the process it establishes we will \nbe able to work to a solution. That is my expectation and hope, that we \nwill now, in effect, by requiring the executive branch to focus on this \nproblem, come together to give it the kind of high priority study which \nwe think it requires and that they will come up with a solution.\n  We are constantly told the Department is in favor of our goals and \nobjectives in this regard, so we want it now to work out the means to \nachieve these goals and objectives. I think the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington will move us very much down that \npath and help to accomplish that purpose. I very strongly support her \nefforts.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for yielding time.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I congratulate and thank the Senator from \nWashington for her persistence, her constancy, and the way in which she \nhas gone about trying to make sure that the families of veterans, in \ntheir grief, have a bit of a reminder of the dedication and the \ncommitment of those veterans. The honors that we should be providing \nthese veterans and their families are important. They are particularly \nimportant at a time of grief.\n  The Senator from Washington is determined, with the support of many \nof us, including the Senators from Maryland, to have the Defense \nDepartment make this happen and make this work. And I just want to \nthank her. There are a lot of families who will never know her name, \nbut because there will be honors at funerals where they are requested, \nthey will in fact have been served by her efforts here on the floor. I \nwant to thank her for them as well as for many of us.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I commend the able Senator from \nWashington for offering this amendment and being willing to compromise \non this important situation. And I urge adoption of the amendment, if \nit is in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All debate time has expired. The question is \non agreeing to the amendment No. 3005.\n  The amendment (No. 3005) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2794\n\n  (Purpose: To repeal the restriction on use of Department of Defense \n                       facilities for abortions)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2794 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n\n[[Page S7061]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Robb, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Kerrey, \n     Ms. Moseley-Braun and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2794.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VII add the following:\n\n     SEC. 708. RESTORATION OF PREVIOUS POLICY REGARDING \n                   RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \n                   MEDICAL FACILITIES.\n\n       Section 1093 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking out subsection (b); and\n       (2) in subsection (a), by striking out ``(a) Restriction on \n     Use of Funds.--''.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Before I speak on this amendment, let me again thank my \ncolleagues for their help on the Veterans Burial Rights Act. This is an \nimportant personal issue for me, and I know it is for many families \nacross the country who will be waiting for the DOD report. And I will \nbe working with all of you on whether or not we receive that report in \na timely manner.\n  Mr. President, the amendment that I have just called up is again to \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill, and it is an effort to \nprotect the health and safety of our military personnel and dependents \nwho are stationed overseas.\n  Mr. President, I am here on the floor today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Murray-Snowe amendment which ensures that female military \npersonnel and female dependents are not subjected to substandard care \nwhile serving our country.\n  The Murray-Snowe amendment is very simple. It would allow female \nmilitary personnel and female dependents access to abortion-related \nservices at their own expense--at their own expense--at military \nhospitals or medical facilities. Our amendment guarantees that women do \nnot surrender their rights to a safe and legal abortion because they \nare serving our country overseas. Our amendment also ensures that women \nin the military have access to the full range of reproductive health \nservices.\n  The current Department of Defense restrictions that deny women access \nto safe and legal reproductive health services is not only inhumane, it \njeopardizes their lives. This is a women's health issue, plain and \nsimple. That is probably why the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists supports this amendment. The Murray-Snowe amendment has \nalso been endorsed by the American Medical Women's Association, the \nAmerican Association of University Women, the American Public Health \nAssociation, and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\n  Mr. President, I recently received a statement from an active-duty \nmember of the Air Force stationed in Japan which summarized her \nexperience with seeking safe and legal reproductive health services. \nHer supervisors were of little or no help when she notified them that \nshe was pregnant. They offered no assistance, and they made character \njudgments. It was only her doctor, a military doctor, who stepped in \nand tried to help her. Because his hands are tied, due to DOD policy, \nhe could only give her information on locally available abortion \nservices.\n  This is a woman who is serving our country, and she is told she is at \nthe mercy of the host country. For no other procedure or life-\nthreatening illness would we allow the Department of Defense to turn \nmilitary personnel out onto the streets of their host country. But that \nis what we are allowing for women.\n  This is what this particular servicewoman faced. She was given a \nhand-drawn map with the location of three hospitals that perform \nabortions. When she arrived at the hospital, none of the nursing staff \nspoke any English. She had no Japanese friends who could translate, and \nthe Air Force could not provide any assistance. If she had been \narrested for armed robbery, the Air Force could have been of more help \nto her.\n  The doctors in the hospital had limited proficiency in English, and \none could not even tell her what medication he was giving her. \nObviously, there was very little concern about possible reactions to \nthe medication. She was totally at the mercy of these doctors in the \nhost country.\n  Her experience was humiliating and frightening. As she stated in her \nletter--and I quote--\n\n       Although I serve in the military, I was given no \n     translators, no explanations, no transportation, and no help \n     for a legal medical procedure . . . The military expects \n     nothing less than the best from its soldiers and I expect the \n     best medical care in return. If this is how I will continue \n     to be treated as a military service member by my country and \n     its leaders, I want no part of it.\n\n  Opponents of the Murray-Snowe amendment will argue that Federal tax \ndollars should not be used to provide abortion-related services. I am \nsure their arguments do not hold up under scrutiny.\n  Our amendment simply restores previous policy--previous policy--that \nallowed female military personnel to pay for abortion-related services \nat their own expense at our military hospitals. They had to pay for \nthis expense. The hospital or outpatient facility already has to be \nmaintained for the safety of our troops. The cost of operating the \nfacility is already a given. The soldier or dependent would pay for any \npossible added cost of providing this service.\n  Does she pay for the electric or water bill for the facility? No, of \ncourse not. And this is where opponents argue that Federal funds are \nbeing used to provide abortion-related services. That, I would say to \nmy colleagues, is a real stretch.\n  What opponents do not point out is that under existing policy, if a \nwoman feels confident enough to discuss a very private, personal matter \nwith her commanding officer and to request a temporary leave, the \nmilitary will fly her back to the States or any other location so she \ncan receive a legal and safe abortion. They will pay to transport her \nhalfway around the world if she sacrifices her right to privacy and \nsubjects herself to character assaults and judgments.\n  Instead of receiving care at a military hospital on base at her \nexpense, the military will incur thousands of dollars in costs to \ntransport her to safety. This may be why the DOD supports this \namendment. They recognize the costs involved in the current policy as \nwell as the threat to the health and safety of our soldiers.\n  One has to think that maybe opponents of the Murray-Snowe amendment \nare really trying to just humiliate women or jeopardize their health \nand safety. It cannot be that they are concerned about military \npersonnel performing abortions when they object. All branches of the \nmilitary have included in their code of conduct language allowing for a \nconscience clause for military doctors. They cannot be forced to \nperform an abortion if they conscientiously object.\n\n  During debate on this authorization bill, I heard many of my \ncolleagues talk about the quality-of-life needs for our soldiers, the \nneed to ensure that our troops receive the support that they deserve. \nThis should be the same standard afforded women soldiers. This is a \nbasic quality-of-life issue. Access to a full array of clinical \nservices for women goes to the heart of quality of life.\n  I ask my colleagues to join us in support of our service personnel \nwho so proudly serve our country and ask only for our support and \nassistance. This is not about publicly financed abortions; this is \nabout protecting the health and the safety of military personnel and \ntheir families who are stationed overseas.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Maine such \ntime as she desires.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington, \nSenator Murray, for taking the leadership on this issue once again. I \nam sure she\n\n[[Page S7062]]\n\nshares my disappointment that we are even in the position we are in \ntoday that we have to offer this amendment. That this amendment is even \nnecessary is regrettable. We will continue to offer it because we think \nit is important to make sure that women in the military have access to \nhealth care treatment, as well as their spouses and dependents of \nmilitary personnel who are stationed overseas. Therefore, we will \ncontinue to offer this amendment to ensure that there is equal access \nto the high level of health care that the women who serve in our \nmilitary have earned and deserve.\n  We are here today, once again, because U.S. law denies the right to \nchoose to the dependents of more than 227,000 service men and women \nstationed overseas, and it denies the more than 27,000 servicewomen who \nhave volunteered to serve their country access to safe medical care \nsimply because they were assigned to duty outside this country.\n  I do not understand, Mr. President, why we insist on denying these \nwomen and the families of our Armed Forces their rights as Americans. \nWe ask a great deal of our military personnel and their families--low \npay, long separations, hazardous duty. When they signed up to serve \ntheir country, I do not they believe they were told they would have to \nleave freedom of choice at ocean's edge. It is ironic that we are \ndenying the very people we ask to uphold democracy and freedom the \nsimple right to safe medical care.\n  The New York Times summed it up several years ago when they noted:\n\n       They can fight for their country. They can die for their \n     country. But they cannot get access to a full range of \n     medical services when their country stations them overseas.\n\n  The Murray-Snowe amendment would overturn the ban and ensure that \nwomen and military dependents stationed overseas would have access to \nsafe health care. And I want to clarify that overturning this ban will \nnot result in Federal funds being used to perform abortions at military \nhospitals. Federal law has banned the use of Federal funds for this \npurpose since 1979.\n\n  From 1979 to 1988, women could use their own personal funds to pay \nfor medical care they needed at overseas military hospitals. As we \nknow, a new policy was instituted in 1988 that prohibited the \nperformance of any abortions at military hospitals, even if paid for \nwith personal funds.\n  I should reiterate this point because I think it clearly is an \nimportant one. It is not the use of Federal funds or any public moneys; \nin fact, it is the use of one's own personal funds for this procedure.\n  As Senator Murray illustrated, what are the choices for women who are \nstationed overseas and have to make a very difficult decision as to \nwhether or not to have an abortion? She must either find the time and \nmoney to fly back to the United States to receive the health care she \nseeks or else possibly endanger her own health by seeking one in a \nforeign hospital whose quality of care cannot compare with ours. Or she \nmay have to fly to a third country--again, where the medical services \ndo not equate to those available at the base--if she cannot afford to \nreturn home.\n  When people sign up for the service, we assure them that we will do \nour best to provide for them and their families as part of the \narrangement that we make in return for their willingness to serve our \ncountry. Yet we prohibit women from using their own money to obtain the \ncare they need at the local base hospital. They are all alone in a \nforeign country, facing a very difficult, wrenching, personal, \ndifficult decision, and all we can say is, ``Sorry, you are on your \nown.''\n  The amendment that Senator Murray and I are offering here today is \nonly asking for fair and equitable treatment. It says to our service \nmen and women and their families: If you find yourself in this \ndifficult situation, in order to ensure you receive safe and proper \nmedical care, we will provide the service if you pay for it with your \nown money.\n  I happen to believe we owe it to our men and women in uniform, and \ntheir families, the option to receive the care they need in a safe \nenvironment. They do not deserve anything less.\n  I think it is really unfortunate that we are faced with this \nsituation year in and year out in seeking what is equitable treatment \nfor women who are serving in our military. Fourteen percent of the \nmilitary is now represented by women. They vote, they pay taxes, are \nprotected and punished under American law. They are serving in our \nmilitary to protect the ideals and rights that this country represents.\n  Whether we agree with abortion or not, we all understand that safe \nand legal access to abortion is the law of the land. It is a choice and \nit is a right that has been affirmed by the Supreme Court. This ban \ntakes away a fundamental right of personal choice for them. I don't \nbelieve we should create a dual standard because one happens to serve \nin the military and happens to be stationed abroad. You have that \nchoice in America. You have your choice of facilities within your own \nState. You can go where you want to make that decision to have access \nto that legal medical procedure. But when you are stationed abroad, it \nis another matter in terms of receiving the quality care that women \ndeserve. They may well be required to travel to another country, not \nfacing the same medical standards that one is accustomed to here in \nthis country.\n\n  This ban puts women at risk. It puts their health at risk and it puts \ntheir life at risk, because they may well be forced to seek unsafe \nmedical care in other countries where the blood supply may not be safe, \nprocedures are antiquated, equipment may not be sterile. I don't \nbelieve that, in addition to the sacrifices that people in the military \nalready make, they are now required to add unsafe medical care to the \nlist.\n  I happen to believe that the Department of Defense in this country is \nrequired to give the same kinds of options and access to quality \nmedical care. In fact, it is a constitutional right for women to have \nthis choice, whether they are serving in the military or not serving in \nthe military. Back in 1992, the Supreme Court rendered a decision in \nthe case Planned Parenthood v. Casey. It said that Government \nregulation of abortion may not constitute an ``undue burden'' on the \nright to choose abortion. An undue burden is defined as having the \n``purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a \nwoman seeking an abortion.''\n  Well, certainly a combination of military regulations and practical \nhurdles means that a pregnant servicewoman who needs an abortion, who \nmakes that very difficult decision, may face lengthy travel, serious \ndelays, high expenses to fly her home, substandard medical options, and \nrestricted information. Therefore, in my opinion, the ban appears to \nunconstitutionally burden the right to choose of American servicewomen.\n  So for all of these reasons, Mr. President, I hope that this body \nwill do the right thing here today and overturn the ban that currently \nis in the statute so that it allows women to have the option to make a \nsafe choice for herself and her well-being.\n  Again, I should remind this body that it isn't a requirement that we \nnow have to use Federal funds to pay for abortions. In fact, to the \ncontrary, it allows women to use their own personal funds for that \noption--a decision they may have to make if they are stationed overseas \nin the military. At one time in our history, they had that option. But \nnow, in the last few years, they have been denied that choice. I don't \nthink it is right or fair to women who serve in our military.\n  I urge this body to adopt the Murray-Snowe amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be divided equally between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S7063]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to speak in opposition to the \nMurray-Snowe amendment and give a little bit of history. It is not the \nfirst time we have visited this amendment. In fact, we have been \ndebating it each year, I believe, since I have been in the Senate. So \nwe are not plowing any new ground here. We are replowing old ground. \nNevertheless, it is an important issue.\n  On the amendment that has been offered, I think it is important that \nMembers understand the current state of play and understand what it is \nwe are voting on. Some history can perhaps help.\n  Mr. President, let me inquire as to how much time is remaining on \nthis side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-two minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I would like to be notified when 10 minutes \nhave been used. I don't believe I will use more than that.\n  Mr. President, since 1979 the Department of Defense has prohibited \nthe use of Federal funds to perform abortions except in cases of rape, \nincest, or to protect the life of the mother. The bill before us today, \nthe Department of Defense bill, continues that prohibition. When we \ndebated this issue last year, it was abundantly clear that the current \nrestriction was not onerous. It did not put any women at risk. It is a \npolicy which is fair. It was fair and sound last year and was supported \nby the Congress, and it remains fair and sound today.\n  What we are trying to do is maintain a consistency in Federal policy \nrelative to abortion. That policy, described as ``the Hyde amendment,'' \nstates that taxpayer money should not be used against the wishes of \ntaxpayers for elective abortions except in some very limited \ncircumstances--exceptions are allowed in the cases of rape, incest, and \nthe life of the mother. But beyond that, the Congress has consistently \nsupported prohibitions against the use of taxpayer dollars to perform \nabortions. That is something that has been upheld by the Court. It is \nconstitutional. The case of Harris v. McRae upheld the Hyde amendment. \nIt did not find a constitutional right to require the taxpayers to fund \nabortions. So I don't believe the Constitution is an issue here.\n  Time and again we have disallowed the use of Federal funds for \nabortions, except in cases where, as I said, rape, incest or life of \nthe mother is at issue. We are trying to maintain that policy. That was \na policy that was maintained without problem until 1993 when President \nClinton issued an Executive order to reverse the policy. Rather than go \nthrough the Congress and have the people exercise their will through \ntheir elected Representatives, the President just simply issued an \nExecutive order, saying, ``I don't like the current policy that \nCongress has established, and I am going to override it with an \nExecutive order.'' Under that policy, the President's change in policy, \ndefense facilities were used for the first time in 14 years, not to \ndefend life, as our military hospitals are charged to do, but to take \nlife, and to do it with taxpayer funds.\n  In 1995, the House and the Senate voted to override the President's \nExecutive order, reversing that policy and making permanent the ban on \nthe use of Department of Defense medical facilities to perform \nabortions with the exceptions of rape, incest, and endangerment of the \nmother's life.\n  So again we are today debating that issue. The amendment before us \nwould strike that ban and reinstate the policy instituted by the \nPresident through his Executive order that the Senate overturned 3 \nyears ago. Proponents of the amendment argue that abortions under the \nClinton order did not involve use of taxpayer funds since servicewomen \nare required to pay for their own abortions. But, Mr. President, that \nstatement evidences a misunderstanding of the nature of military \nmedical facilities.\n  Military clinics, unlike the private hospitals, receive 100 percent \nof their funds from Federal taxpayers. Physicians are not private \nphysicians who happen to be contracting with the hospital, but they are \nphysicians that are government employees paid entirely with tax \nrevenues. All of the operational and administrative expenses of \nmilitary medicine are paid for by taxpayers. All of the equipment used \nto perform abortions is purchased at taxpayers' expense, and, \ntherefore, it is impossible to separate out that which is Federal funds \nutilized for abortion from that which is private funds.\n\n  The only way to protect the integrity of these taxpayers' funds and \nthe integrity of the policy is to keep the military out of business of \nperforming abortions. Taxpayer money should not be used if it goes \nagainst what I believe and I think the Congress has supported, the \nmoral and religious beliefs of the taxpayer, and in this case the \ntaxpayer, through their Representatives, elected to Congress have \nexpressed time and again that they don't feel their tax dollars are \nappropriately used to perform abortions.\n  The question is raised: If abortions are disallowed, does that not \nput those servicewomen who are seeking to have an abortion at risk? It \ndoes not. As we have repeatedly demonstrated and said, along with \ncertification from the Department of Defense, nothing in this policy \ndictates the decision of the woman, whether or not she wants to have an \nabortion or has an abortion. It simply says you can't use taxpayer \nfunds for an abortion. Because of the commingling of funds and the \nimpossibility of separating funds, we don't want to use military \nhospitals for that abortion. But nothing prevents that woman from going \noutside of the military hospital facility to utilize another hospital \nin countries where there are those hospitals. Because the law of the \ncountry--say Italy--does not allow abortions or support abortions; the \nmilitary has provided transport for that individual who seeks the \nabortion. There has never been a complaint filed about inability to go \nand have that abortion.\n  So I think Members confuse the issue sometimes when they come to the \nfloor without having heard the debate and say, ``This is a vote on a \nwoman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion.''\n  I have strong and deeply held feelings about that. We have debated \nthat issue on this floor time and time again, and we will debate it \nmore--the nature and the meaning of life, the right of the unborn \nversus the right of a woman, and the decision in terms of whether one \nright has a preeminence over another right. But that is not what is at \nissue here today, and it shouldn't be confused in this debate. The \nissue is not over whether a woman has the right to an abortion. That is \na debate for another day.\n  The issue is whether that abortion should be partially paid for by \ntaxpayer funds, or performed at military hospitals. We have a policy in \nplace that allows women who seek to have an abortion while they serve \nin the military, or their dependents, to have that abortion. Nothing \nprohibits them from doing that. But we simply have to have a policy \nthat says that cannot be performed in a place where taxpayer funds are \nbeing used to accomplish that, or at least to accomplish part of that.\n  We have not received any evidence that indicates that this is a \nprohibition on women, on their ability to have an abortion, to make a \nchoice to have an abortion. It simply retains a policy that has been \nconsistently upheld by this Congress and by the Court that says that \nthe taxpayer has a right to put limitations on whether or not their \ntaxpayer funds are used to provide abortions. The Congress has \nconsistently voted to uphold that policy. They make what I think are \nlegitimate and reasonable exceptions in cases of rape, cases of incest, \nand cases of where the life of the mother is in danger.\n  So I hope that Members would see this issue for what it is--not a \nwomen's right to choose; we can discuss that at another time--but \nwhether or not taxpayer funds should be used to perform abortions.\n  Mr. President, I will reserve the remainder of my time. In fact, I \nsee the Senator from Idaho is on the floor. I would be happy to have \nthe chairman yield him whatever time he desires.\n\n[[Page S7064]]\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 8 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, and also Senator Coats for \nthe particular comments he has made.\n  Mr. President, I have been the chairman of the Military Personnel \nSubcommittee for the past two years, and in that time I have learned \nthe subcommittee itself cuts a wide swath on all the issues that we \ndeal with. This subcommittee resolves issues that are at the forefront \nof our national debate. We cope with the issues of values taught to our \nyoung people who volunteer for the armed services. We deal with the \nissues involving gender-based training, sexual harassment in the \nworkplace, drug and alcohol abuse, and now, as a result of this \namendment before the Senate, the very sensitive issue of abortion.\n  Senators should know that this amendment is not a new issue. Last \nyear the Senate extensively debated this issue, and defeated it on a \n48-51 vote. I trust that the Senate will again defeat this amendment.\n  My record on the issue of abortion is clear. Abortion is the most \nemotional, complex and personal issue before us today. Personally, I \nbelieve abortion should be allowed only in cases of rape, incest or \nwhen the life of the mother is in danger. In addition, I have \nconsistently stated my belief that federal funds should not be used for \nabortions. In this regard, I have voted to maintain the Hyde Amendment, \nwhich bans federal funding of abortion except in cases where it is made \nknown to appropriate authorities that the abortion is necessary to save \nthe life of the mother or that the pregnancy is the result of rape or \nincest.\n  I make it very clear at the outset what this issue in this particular \namendment is not about. It is not about whether you are pro-life or \npro-choice. This amendment is about where those abortions may be \nperformed and whether they are paid for at Federal Government expense. \nThis amendment would repeal the prohibition on using Department of \nDefense facilities for abortions and allow prepaid abortions to be \nperform in these taxpayer-funded facilities and by Federal medical \npersonnel at these facilities.\n  The sponsors of this amendment argue that without this amendment, \nwomen in the Armed Forces stationed overseas may find it difficult to \nhave access to a safe abortion. As a result, this interferes with their \nconstitutional right to an abortion, so they contend.\n  I want to acknowledge that women who are in the Armed Forces and are \nstationed overseas in countries where abortion is not legal, are faced \nwith complex emotional and difficult decisions. I note for the record, \nhowever, that a woman with a pregnancy who is in the armed services who \nis overseas and that pregnancy is medically life-threatening or the \nresult of rape or incest, under current policy, can receive an abortion \nat a U.S. military hospital.\n  But there is no getting around the fact that the Department of \nDefense military hospital are paid with 100 percent taxpayer dollars. \nThe medical facility is paid for with taxpayer money. The doctors and \nthe nurses are Federal employees, paid with taxpayer dollars. So is the \nequipment, the overhead, the operating rooms, et cetera.\n  Even though the pending amendment contemplates that women will be \nallowed to use personal funds to pay for an abortion, there is no \ngetting around the fact that taxpayer dollars would still directly or \nindirectly pay for an abortion. So this amendment, if adopted, could \nlead to situations where taxpayers are paying for abortions, which is \ncontrary to our national policy as outlined in the Hyde amendment. That \nis inconsistent with our national policy.\n  To summarize, I would like to make a few important points on why I \noppose this amendment.\n  First, I believe it is accurate to state that our national policy, as \nreflected in legislation adopted by this Congress and signed into law, \nas embodied in the Hyde amendment, in essence states that we will not \nuse Federal taxpayer money for abortion except in the case of rape, \nincest, or the life of the mother.\n  Second, In 1980 the Supreme Court ruled on Harris vs. McRae, in which \nthe Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Hyde amendment.\n  Third, Congress, the President and the Supreme Court have set and \naffirmed the national policy that we not use Federal money to fund \nabortions except in those cases that I cited.\n  Fourth, The Defense Department in their own analysis has said it \nwould be an accounting nightmare to go through and determine the true \ncost of having an abortion performed in a U.S. medical facility when \nthe facility is 100 percent taxpayer funded. All of the personnel, \nequipment and facilities are paid for by the taxpayers.\n  Fifth, Current policy allows for a female member of the military \nservice, in the event she chooses to have an abortion, to have access \nto military transportation so that she can go to a facility of her \nchoice and exercise her constitutional right. Any military personnel \nhas access to military transport on a space-available basis. The DOD \nhas never had an instance where a woman who was seeking access on a \nspace-available basis on military transport has been denied that \nbecause the purpose of her transport was for an abortion.\n  Sixth, If a female member of the military service was in a life-\nthreatening situation, an abortion could be performed at a US military \nhospital overseas.\n  So I believe the current abortion policy at US military hospitals is \nconsistent with over all national policy.\n  Mr. President, I conclude by just stating I have the utmost respect \nfor Senator Murray and Senator Snowe, the two Senators who have offered \nthis amendment. I work with Senator Snowe on the Military Personnel \nSubcommittee. She does an outstanding job. What a great addition she is \nas we deal with these issues dealing with our armed services.\n  I also affirm this significant fact: We could not operate as the \nleader of the free world without women in the military. We must have \nthese outstanding, dedicated individuals as part of our military \ninstallations. I believe that the policy that is on the book does \naffirm certainly their constitutional rights, but it also affirms the \nnational policy which I have stated, and it provides opportunities for \nthem to exercise that. And in the case where it is life threatening, \nthey certainly have the means with which they can deal with it in an \nappropriate fashion consistent with, I think, the caring of all human \nbeings.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized \nfor 3 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I commend Senator Coats for the \nexcellent remarks he made on this subject. I also wish to commend \nSenator Kempthorne for his outstanding remarks.\n  Mr. President, I will have to oppose this amendment. There have been \nsome good points mentioned by those who favor the amendment, but I do \nnot think it is wise. It is one that we have debated several times on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  The current law prohibits abortions from being performed in military \nfacilities except in the case where the life of the mother would be in \ndanger or in the case of rape or incest. The Congress enacted the \ncurrent legislation in 1995 and reaffirmed it again in 1996 and in \n1997.\n  In 1996, this same amendment passed the Senate by a voice vote after \nthe motion to table failed. However, in order to achieve agreement with \nthe House of Representatives in the conference, the conferees were \nrequired to return to the current provisions of law. Last year, this \nsame amendment failed to achieve Senate approval.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest that extended debate on abortion \nwithin the Senate is unlikely to change any Senator's vote. I hope we \ncan agree to limit the discussion and vote.\n  The question comes down to this. This is the question, and I would \nlike\n\n[[Page S7065]]\n\nfor Senators to listen to this: If you want to have abortion on demand \nperformed in military treatment facilities overseas at the expense of \nthe Government, then this amendment is for you. If you want to preserve \nthe life of the baby except in the case of rape, incest, and when the \nlife of the mother is at risk, then you should vote against this \namendment.\n  It is just that simple, Mr. President. I urge my colleagues to defeat \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair. I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. President, I just make several observations in response to some \nof the comments that have been made here this afternoon. First and \nforemost, this doesn't cost a single cent to the Federal Government. \nWhen we hear about the fact, well, it is going to cost some money \nbecause of the use of the hospital, the use of medical personnel, I \nthink we all recognize the rates that are charged by hospitals today. \nThey set a rate, they set a cost, a charge for recovery of all of the \ncosts. The fact is, under Medicare and Medicaid, we reimburse hospitals \nand providers for a specific cost. So are we saying that we are not \nable to create a charge for that particular procedure and in this case \nthe option to have an abortion? I doubt it.\n  Obviously, the charge that is set is the recovery of all of the \ncosts, all of the overhead. Hospitals all across America and throughout \nthe world set that rate. So this doesn't cost a dime of taxpayers' \nmoney--not a dime. I think it is an important point to emphasize, that \nno public funds are used; it is only personal funds.\n\n  Second, it has been mentioned: What is the law of the land? Row v. \nWade is the law of the land, and it includes the constitutional right \nfor a woman to have an abortion, to make that decision, to make that \nvery difficult personal choice. And, in fact, between 1973 and 1988, it \nwas permissible for a woman to have this procedure done at military \nhospitals, and between 1993 and 1995 the same was true. Unfortunately, \nin the years in which it wasn't allowed, we were denying a woman's \nright. Unfortunately, it got embroiled as to whether or not you were \npro-life or pro-choice.\n  That is not the issue here. It should not be the issue. The issue \nshould be whether or not a woman who serves in the military, who has an \noverseas assignment, has access to the same health care as everyone \nelse who serves in the military--in this case, with an abortion \nprocedure, using her own personal funds. That is the issue here. That \nis why this right was allowed between 1973 and 1988 and between 1993 \nand 1995. It was permissible because it is the law of the land for a \nwoman to have the right to choose.\n  The fact is, because she goes across the border of the United States, \nshe all of a sudden loses her right to make this decision and is denied \naccess to quality care. So, that is the issue here today. It is not a \nquestion of using public funds, because that is not what this amendment \nis all about; it never has been. It is a question of whether or not a \nwoman in the military who is assigned overseas is going to be treated \ndifferently, treated as a second-class citizen, being the victim of a \ndouble standard because individuals have differences over whether or \nnot women in America have a right to choose.\n  Because she is in the military, because she is assigned overseas, she \nshould not be treated any differently and she should not be required to \nleave those rights behind.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to support the \namendment offered by Senator Murray. This provision would take the long \noverdue step of repealing the current ban on privately-funded abortions \nat U.S. military facilities abroad, so that women in the armed forces \nserving overseas can exercise their constitutionally-guaranteed right \nand have safe abortion services.\n  This is an issue of fundamental fairness for the women who make \nsignificant sacrifices to serve the nation. They are assigned to \nmilitary bases around the world to protect our freedoms, and they serve \nwith great distinction. It's wrong to deny them the kind of medical \ncare available to all women in the United States. They should be able \nto depend on their base hospitals for all their medical services.\n  It is not fair for Congress to force women who serve overseas to face \nthe choice of accepting medical care that may be of lower quality or \nelse returning to the United States and for the care they need. Without \ngood care, abortion can be a life-threatening or permanently disabling \nprocedure. This danger is an unacceptable burden to impose on the \nnation's servicewomen.\n  Congress has a responsibility to provide safe alternatives in these \nsituations. Opponents of this amendment are exposing service women to \nsubstantial risks of infection, illness, infertility, and even death. \nThe amendment does not ask that these procedures be paid for with \nfederal funds. It simply asks that the appropriate care be made \navailable. It is the only responsible thing to do.\n  In addition to the health risks of the current policy, there is a \nsignificant financial penalty on servicewomen and their families who \nmake the difficult conclusion to have an abortion. The cost of \nreturning to the United States from far-off bases in other parts of the \nworld to obtain adequate care can often involve significant financial \nhardship for young women. This is a cost that servicewomen based in the \nUnited States do not have to bear, since non-military hospital \nfacilities are readily available.\n  If military personnel cannot afford to return to the United States on \ntheir own for an abortion, they will often face significant delays \nwaiting for military transportation. The health risks increase each \nweek, and if the delays in military flights are long, a woman may well \ndecide to rely on questionable medical facilities overseas. As a \npractical matter, women in uniform are being denied their \nconstitutionally-protected right to choose. A woman's decision on \nabortion is a very difficult and extremely personal one. It is unfair \nto impose an even heavier burden on women who serve our country \noverseas.\n  Every woman in America has a constitutionally-guaranteed right to \nchoose to terminate her pregnancy. It is time for Congress to stop \ndenying this right to military women serving abroad. It is time for \nCongress to stop treating service women as second-class citizens. I \nurge the Senate to support the Murray amendment and end this flagrant \ninjustice under current law.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by Senators Murray and Snowe. I am proud to be a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  This amendment states Senate support for providing access to \nreproductive services for military women overseas. It repeals the \ncurrent ban on privately funded abortions at US military facilities \noverseas.\n  I strongly support this amendment for four reasons. First of all, \nsafe and legal access to abortion is the law. Secondly, women serving \noverseas should have a full range of medical services. Thirdly, this \namendment protects the health and well-being of military women. \nFinally, we should not deprive military women from legal medical \nprocedures.\n  It is a matter of simple fairness that our servicewomen, as well as \nthe spouses and dependents of servicemen, be able to exercise their \nright to make health care decisions when they are stationed abroad. \nWomen who are stationed overseas are totally dependent on their base \nhospitals for medical care and should not be denied abortion services \nwhen confronted with an unintended pregnancy. Most of the time the only \naccess to safe, quality medical care is in a military facility. We \nshould not discriminate against female military personnel just because \nthey are stationed overseas. They should be able exercise the same \nfreedoms they enjoy at home. Without this amendment, military women \nwill continue to be treated like second-class citizens.\n  It is ridiculous to think that a woman cannot use her own funds to \npay for access to safe and quality medical care.\n  The current ban on access to reproductive services is yet another hit \non Roe v. Wade. It is an attempt to cut\n\n[[Page S7066]]\n\naway at the constitutionally protected right of women to choose. It \nstrips military women of the very rights they were recruited to \nprotect. Abortion is a fundamental right for the women in this country. \nIt has been upheld repeatedly by the Supreme Court.\n  Let's be very clear on what we are talking about here today. We are \ntalking about the right of women to obtain a safe and legal abortion \npaid for with their own funds. We are not talking about using any \ntaxpayer or federal money. We are not talking about reversing the \nconscience clause. No military personnel will be compelled to perform \nan abortion against their wishes.\n  This is an issue of fairness to the women who sacrifice every day to \nserve our nation. They deserve the same quality care that women in \nAmerica have access to each day. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant amendment to the 1999 Department of Defense Appropriations \nBill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, what is the status of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 5 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Maine has 5 minutes 46 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. THURMOND. How much time is left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time on our \nside to the able Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I believe we will be able to yield back \ntime. I don't know that we have any other speakers here. Let me just \nquickly summarize the reasons, the basis of why we oppose the \namendment.\n  I believe the amendment is a solution in search of a problem. There \nis no identified problem with women in the military or their dependents \nseeking the right to have an abortion of their choosing when there \nsimply is a provision in current law which states on this issue the \nmilitary is not going to decide whether or not that woman should have \nan abortion.\n  We simply are saying that we want to uphold the policy that has been \nin place now for nearly 20 years, with the exception of the President's \noverturning it for a 3-year period, that says the taxpayers' funds \nshould not be used to perform abortions or to pay for any portion of \nabortion except in certain limited cases --the case of rape, the case \nof incest, or where the life of the mother is in jeopardy.\n  Because of the nature of military hospitals, they are 100 percent \nfunded with taxpayer funds, including all their equipment, all their \nfacilities, and all their staff. Military doctors are Government-paid \nemployees. Mr. President, 100 percent of their pay is from the \ntaxpayer. So it is impossible to utilize military hospitals without \nusing taxpayers' funds. Even if the woman pays for the abortion, the \nequipment will be used, facilities will be used, Government employees \nwill be used. So we are simply saying to that woman who seeks an \nabortion, we would like you to go outside the military health care \nsystem to have your abortion. Since you are paying the cost anyway, it \nis not a question of affordability.\n  Then the question arises, What if facilities are not available \noutside of military hospitals? The military has recognized this is a \npossibility. It is not a problem at all at any U.S. base, military \ninstitution, nor in many foreign institutions. But there are certain \ncountries that have bans on abortions being performed in their country \non the basis of that country's policy. The military, in that instance, \nhas said we will make space available on air transport for these women \nto go to a place where the abortion is legal.\n  So, I don't understand what the problem is. And, rather than overturn \na law which has been upheld by both the courts and enacted by this \nCongress again and again and again--the Hyde language--it seems the \nbest way to proceed is to leave the current policy that has been \nendorsed in place and defeat this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the current law, to vote against the \nMurray-Snowe amendment, again, because there is no identifiable problem \nto which this amendment seeks to advocate a solution.\n\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I think we are ready to yield back time. \nThere does not appear to be any other speakers. We can move to the next \namendment or vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield back the remainder of time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. There has been no \nrollcall requested.\n  The Chair asks if anyone wishes to order a rollcall vote on the \npending Murray amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3009\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Murray-Snowe \namendment is now set aside and the Senator from Nevada is recognized to \noffer his amendment.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on my behalf \nof myself and my colleague Senator Bryan, the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. \nInouye, Senator Wyden, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, Senator Durbin, \nSenator Murray, and Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself, Mr. Bryan, \n     Mr. Inouye, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Murray \n     and Mr. Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 3009.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 347 strike line 21 through line 13 on page 366 and \n     insert the following:\n       (f) Repeal of Superseded Authority.--Section 2205 of the \n     Military Construction Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 \n     is repealed. This section shall take place one day after the \n     date of this bill's enactment.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, all Senators in this body who have a \nmilitary installation in their States should be concerned if my \namendment does not pass because, in effect, what this language that I \nam trying to have stricken today does is guarantee the future of \nMountain Home Air Base. That is what this is all about. This \nenlargement is simply to stop there being a further round of closures \nthat affects Mountain Home Air Base.\n  This amendment would prevent the unnecessary expansion of Mountain \nHome Air Base. This is a training range, an Air Force range in Idaho. \nSince 1991--in fact, since the early 1980s, the Air Force has sought to \nexpand the training areas used by pilots operating from Mountain Home \nAir Base in southern Idaho.\n  These training areas are made up of the airspace over the Owyhee \nCanyon lands and range from southern Idaho to eastern Oregon and \nnorthern Nevada.\n  First of all, let me talk a little bit about the Owyhee Indian \nReservation. This is a Shoshone Paiute Tribe consisting of a little \nover 2,000 members. The area that they were placed by the Federal \nGovernment is an area that is beautiful, but very stark and cold. Many \ntimes during the winter, you will find the coldest place in the United \nStates is the Wild Horse Reservoir located some 20 miles below the \nreservation. This is a very cold place. But in spite of it being cold \nabout 9 months out of the year, it is a beautiful place.\n  The Owyhee--O-W-Y-H-E-E--Reservation also has running through it the \nOwyhee River. This is one of the most beautiful areas anyplace in the \nUnited States.\n  How did the name Owyhee originate? If you ask one of the Indians from \nthe reservation, they will tell you it is very simple. Last century, \nsome trappers from Hawaii came to trap on the river in the area. They \nwere never heard from again. No one knows what happened to them. From \nthat time forward, this whole area has been known\n\n[[Page S7067]]\n\nas Owyhee, a derivation of a Hawaiian name--O-W-Y-H-E-E--Canyon. The \nlands range from southern Idaho, eastern Oregon, northern Nevada.\n  The Air Force is saying this will improve their ability to train at \nthis range. They are saying it is inconvenient for them to have to fly \nto Utah, to Oregon and Nevada to train. That is just a way of trying to \nestablish an air base that won't be taken away in the future. There is \nno reason to enlarge this air base; none whatsoever. The longest flight \nthey have to take now to do their training in Nevada, Utah or one of \nthe other bases in the area is about 40 minutes. It doesn't seem like a \nvery long time. If, in fact, we are able to have our amendment adopted \nby this body, they will still have to fly to these areas. So this does \nnot take away the necessity of having to have their pilots fly to other \nareas to train.\n  Why is this language in the defense authorization bill which will \nexpand the training range and associated airspace? It is not about \ntraining and readiness. That is taken care of. This is about base \nrealignment and closure. This is about something we call BRAC. This is \nabout almost $32 million being used to buy BRAC insurance for Mountain \nHome Air Force Base in Idaho.\n  It seems somewhat unusual to me that in this bill we are fighting to \nhave money for projects that are extremely important for the readiness \nof the military. It seems real unusual to me and most everyone else who \nlooks at this as to why we have to spend $32 million of money that we \ndon't have and can't afford to enlarge a base that shouldn't be \nexpanded.\n  It is about trying to make Mountain Home too attractive to close, \nwhile other bases in other parts of this country are closing. It should \ncome as no surprise that this range expansion is not needed and is a \nwaste of taxpayers' money.\n  Mr. President, let me read from an Air Force audit report. This is an \naudit report of the inspector general of the Department of Defense \nverbatim:\n\n       The Air Force has not . . . proved why existing training \n     ranges cannot continue to provide composite force training. \n     Establishing the Idaho Training Range would be an exception \n     to the overall DOD attempt to downsize infrastructure.\n\n  I continue the quote:\n\n       The Assistant Secretary asserted that Saylor Creek can \n     support day-to-day training performed by the composite wing. \n     In summary, the Utah, Nellis and Fallon ranges are suitable \n     for composite force training and the ranges have the required \n     airspace and ground areas. During our audit, the 336th wing \n     officials--\n\n  That's Mountain Home----\n\n     stated that all the training requirements were being met with \n     the Saylor Creek range and the Utah, Nellis and Fallon \n     ranges. Our review showed that the capabilities of the Utah \n     range satisfy the currently described training quality \n     attributes applicable to the 366th. The Air Force chief of \n     staff, plans and operations, has acknowledged that the ITR \n     was not necessary for composite force training. The deputy \n     chief of staff stated that using existing assets, the wing \n     has trained adequately and has become combat ready. It seems \n     very clear and unambiguous.\n\n  Mr. President, further, a draft audit from the inspector general went \non to say:\n\n       The Air Force's proposed Idaho Training Range is an \n     unwarranted duplication of existing DOD tactical training \n     ranges. Also, the Air Force cost-benefit analysis to justify \n     the Idaho Training Range is not valid. We attributed these \n     conditions to the State of Idaho's efforts to influence the \n     fiscal year 1995 base closure selection process and an \n     eagerness by both Air Force and Idaho officials to establish \n     the training range.\n       Therefore, the Air Force and the Idaho Air National Guard \n     will unnecessarily spend $35.4 million.\n\n  Which has been cut down a few million.\n  Further, Mr. President, a Department of the Air Force memorandum from \nassistant inspector general of auditing a couple years ago states:\n\n       The draft report is largely devoted to establishing what \n     the Air Force has long acknowledged--the State's proposed \n     Idaho Training Range is not a necessity for composite wing \n     training in Idaho.\n\n  That is really it. There is no reason to have it. There is no request \nfor it. The reasons haven't changed since the inspector general made \nhis report.\n  In this same audit, the Secretary of Defense asserted that the \nexisting range can support the day-to-day activities that are \nnecessary. Even the Air Force stated that the ``Air Force has long \nacknowledged the State's proposed Idaho Training Range is not a \nnecessity. . ..''\n  What does this unwarranted duplication of existing assets cost? \nAlmost $32 million for an expansion the Air Force admits is not \nnecessary, even as the Secretary of Defense calls for another round of \nbase closures just to make ends meet.\n  We also have another very unique land policy issue, and that is, \nthere is a cowboy whose statements I have read. He doesn't want to \nleave his ranch and is not going to have to leave his ranch. But about \n5 percent of his many thousands of acres are going to be taken by the \nAir Force.\n  In compensation for this, he is going to get anywhere from $250,000 \nto $1 million. I must say, Mr. President, this is the first time that \nthe land managers are aware of ever paying anybody for a privilege. \nThat is, people who have grazing lands have the privilege of grazing \ncattle on those lands. Why should we pay somebody for that privilege? \nIt seems it should be the other way around.\n  In addition to that, this gentleman is being compensated for water \nlines that he has put in, fencing he has put in and also he is going to \nbe guaranteed makeup for the grazing lands that are taken from him. It \nseems like a pretty good deal to me, that he, in effect, loses nothing \nbut makes anywhere from a quarter of a million to a million dollars.\n  The Bureau of Land Management does not recognize these lands as being \navailable for sale or in need of compensation.\n  This is simply wrong.\n  Let's talk about the environment, the wildlife and also about Native \nAmericans. There are many reasons to oppose it. I have outlined a \nnumber of them already. It is an unnecessary expansion of the base \nbecause the Air Force doesn't need it. It is unnecessary compensation \nto a rancher, a cowboy in the area. But, these Owyhee lands are far \nmore than just a target for Air Force bombers or a dumping ground for \nAir Force chaff.\n  The Owyhee Canyon lands provides some of the most pristine, rugged \nand spectacular country in the West. Let me show you some of the areas \nalong the Owyhee. It is a beautiful area. It is called the next Grand \nCanyon or the ``Grand Canyon of the North.'' It is just picturesque any \ntime of the year, and this is going to be impacted significantly as a \nresult of the language that is in this bill.\n  Recently described as the ``other Grand Canyon'' in a prominent \nwestern magazine, the Owyhee Canyon lands are a vast network of river \ncanyons, plateaus; this is the largest undeveloped area in the lower 48 \nStates.\n  This is a mecca for those who seek to escape the daily clutter of \ncivilization. I repeat, these canyonlands are the largest undeveloped \narea in the lower 48 States. And, Mr. President, these canyonlands \noffer an unmolested remnant of nature. This is what it is like. Tens of \nthousands of people go there every year--41,000, to be exact, the last \ncount that we had. And they are going to be devastated as a result of \nthis area being used for low-level bombing by airplanes, low-level \ntraining by airplanes.\n  Mr. President, Owyhee is the traditional homeland for the tribes of \nthe Shoshone-Paiute. They have significant religious and cultural \ninterests which must be protected from encroachment and desecration. \nHere, Mr. President, is some of the petroglyphs that are existing. They \nare all over this area.\n\n       To us, the ashes of our ancestors are sacred, and their \n     resting places are hallowed ground. Our religion is in the \n     traditions of our ancestors, the dreams of our old men given \n     them in solemn hours by night, by the Great Spirit, and the \n     visions of our chiefs. And it is written in the hearts of our \n     people.\n\n  Chief Seattle is the one who said that.\n  Mr. President, shouldn't the Native Americans have been part of this \ndeal? Do they deserve to be ignored? They live in a very remote part of \nthe United States, one of the most remotely settled areas in the entire \nUnited States. And they have been ignored.\n  And as one newspaper reported, it seems rather unusual that there \nwould be so much attention spent--and I quote--``It is one thing when \nit's a\n\n[[Page S7068]]\n\nwhite rancher who is a significant contributor. But if it's the Native \nAmericans who are not involved in a commercial relationship with the \nFederal Government, too bad for you.''\n  That is from a newspaper article today, an intermountain feature \nexchange from the Idaho Statesman.\n  It seems to me that I have no problem with this rancher caring a lot \nabout his land. I think what I have heard about him --he has been on \nthat land, his family has been on that land since 1880. Mr. President, \nthose Indians have been there a lot longer than that. They deserve at \nleast the right of somebody to consult with them. And they have been \nignored. They have written a letter saying they have been ignored, they \nare not part of this concern, and they should have been.\n  The canyonlands, Mr. President, offer a safe haven for the California \nbighorn sheep, the pronghorn antelope, elk, deer, and numerous plants \nthat will require our attention if they are to survive in the future.\n  Here is a picture, Mr. President, of the California bighorn sheep--\none of the most magnificent animals there is. Average life expectancy \nof one of these animals--7 years. In that 7 years, they become a \nmajestic animal and can do all kinds of things. They can do all kinds \nof athletic things that are beyond belief. We should do something to \nprotect them. And we are not.\n  These are lands which are both part of our Western heritage and part \nof our American future. People of the West deserve a voice in how that \nheritage is used and what the future is going to be.\n  Today, the people of Idaho, Oregon, and Nevada have been allowed to \nadd their voice to the chorus of those opposed to further range \nexpansion.\n  Mr. President, I think it says a lot when we understand that groups \nare opposed to this. They talk about an environmental impact statement, \nand they have a comment period. The comments were 6-1 opposed to this--\nopposed to this.\n  Groups opposed to Mountain Home range expansion are: the Shoshone-\nPaiute Tribes, Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Wilderness Society, the \nSierra Club, the Idaho Wildlife Federation, Owyhee Canyonlands \nCoalition, Foundation for North American Wild Sheep, U.S. Public \nInterest Group, the National Wildlife Federation, the Nevada Wildlife \nFederation, the Idaho Conservation League, Friends of the Earth, The \nRural Alliance for Military Accountability, the Oregon Natural \nResources Council, the Idaho Whitewater Association, the Idaho Rivers \nUnited, the Committee for Idaho's High Desert, the Oregon Natural \nDesert Association, and the Friends of the West.\n  The newspapers that are opposed to it, to name a few, are the Idaho \nStatesman, the Idaho Falls Post Register, the Wood River Journal News, \nand the Times-News.\n  So I am somewhat concerned that this is in the bill. We recognize it \nis always much more difficult to take something out of a bill than to \nput something in. But we are going to proceed on that basis.\n  What is being done here is simply wrong. The act bends the process. \nIt fails to address the concerns of the tribe. We have 41,000 annual \ncanyonland visitors a year. The agreement is not a product of public \ncomment. The public has spoken and has clearly said they do not want \nthe range.\n  Only yesterday the Idaho Statesman, the leading paper in Idaho, \nreported that ``Congress has a wide variety of reasons to reject the \nproposed training range for Mountain Home Air Base. It should pick one \nand vote no.''\n\n  There are lots of reasons. We only need one of those reasons. There \nare a multitude of reasons. The fact is, the citizens of Idaho oppose \nthis expansion 6-1, as I have said before.\n  This agreement is the result of an unpleasant compromise forced on \nthe BLM as part of a shotgun wedding with the Air Force. For the BLM, \nit was either the language accepted earlier this afternoon, or the even \nmore odious agreement which was originally in the bill. And all so \nMountain Home can enjoy BRAC insurance. This is not the way to craft an \nagreement for the public interest.\n  As I have said, Mr. President, the environmental impact statement is \nsupposed to protect all parties. It does not. The Shoshone Tribe said \nyesterday:\n\n       The EIS does not even begin to account for tribal concerns \n     and was absolutely insufficient for the purpose of making a \n     decision regarding tribal interests. In fact, the EIS process \n     was detrimental to Tribal archaeological resources because \n     significant vandalism has resulted from the lack of \n     confidentiality provisions in this part of the EIS process.\n\n  That is why the majority of the people in the States of Nevada, \nIdaho, and Oregon oppose this language. The language in the agreement \nwhich addresses the tribe's sacred sites was never shown to them. Their \nopinion, in this end game, was never asked.\n  Consistent with this approach, they are excluded from every decision \nin the process that has been acquired here. This, Mr. President, is \nwrong.\n  I am a strong supporter of the men and women in our military. And as \nmuch as any American, I want to make sure that they have everything \nthey need to be prepared to defend our Nation's interests and return \nhome safely.\n  Mr. President, over half of Nevada's airspace is dedicated to the \nmilitary. Over 50 percent of the airspace over the State of Nevada is \ndedicated to the military. But they want more. They are gluttons, Mr. \nPresident. They cannot get enough. Over half of the airspace of the \nState of Nevada is already dedicated to the military. And I see no \nreason that there must be more given, more taken.\n  The Air Force has not justified its need to spend $32 million. And \nthey do not need more airspace. Remember, if they get more airspace, \nthey are still going to go to Oregon, still going to go to Utah, still \ngoing to go to Nevada.\n  Mr. President, they are going to come on and say, well, we are only \ngoing to fly so high or so low. Who is going to enforce that? Who are \nthe air police? They do not have them. Anyone who has flown an airplane \nin the military knows those rules are not enforced.\n  Look what took place in Italy just a short time ago. That was in \nforce because they hit a cable on a gondola at a ski operation. But to \nsay we are only going to fly this high or this low is ridiculous. \nEverybody knows there is no way to enforce that.\n  The agreement in this bill is stealth legislation. I believe in \nstealth in the military, but not in the legislative process.\n  Mr. President, we have numerous letters. I would ask the Chair, how \nmuch time has the Senator from Nevada used of the 1 hour?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 20 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are numerous newspaper articles from \nall over the country. But let us just focus on a few. Let us talk about \na newspaper article from Idaho Falls where they talked in the Post \nRegister. ``The U.S. Air Force keeps trying to build a new bombing \nrange at its Mountain Home base--but it still hasn't got it right.''\n  They acknowledge that this is ``the most spectacular canyonlands left \nin North America.'' They talk about certain concessions the military \nhas attempted to make.\n\n       But these concessions are irrelevant [though, says the \n     newspaper] when placed next to what the Air Force has in \n     mind. It wants to fly thousands of bombing missions, \n     hammering the countryside. This activity would occur in a \n     countryside where solitude recreation is becoming \n     increasingly popular.\n       And it is the home of rare California bighorn sheep, not to \n     mention a rich spectrum of high desert wildlife. Biologists \n     will tell you that bighorn sheep don't schedule their lambing \n     to suit the air force bombing runs. They haven't addressed \n     [the newspaper article goes on to say] the 500 \n     archaeological sites in the Owyhee Canyon lands. Some of \n     these sites are the most important to the Shoshone-Paiute \n     Tribe.\n  They go on to say, recently as late at 1995, 1996, the Air Force said \nthey didn't need the land.\n  The Idaho Falls Post Register, again, says, ``You would expect \nsomething this important''--talking about this legislation--``would \nwarrant a separate piece of legislation.'' They go on to say, ``No, it \nis sneaked into an appropriations bill.'' There will be no public \nhearings. The voices of thousands of Idahoans who overwhelmingly \nopposed the Air Force bombing range during a series of forums will be \nsilenced. Idahoans won't be able to talk about the loss of solitude in \nan area so popular with fishermen, hikers, and ranchers, and Native \nAmericans won't be able to express their concerns, and no Idahoan will \nbe allowed to tell the Congress\n\n[[Page S7069]]\n\nthat building a bombing range for pilots who already can fly to the \nranges in nearby Utah is wasting taxpayers' dollars.\n  Mr. President, they go on to say ``the politically contrived pack is \nsilent about how the Air Force will respect areas in the Duck Valley \nReservation.'' It gives the Air Force the right to fly twice a month at \n500 feet. The Air Force promises to alert the public in advance--as if \neverybody is standing at attention for this announcement.\n  The Twin Falls newspaper says: Why is this training range necessary? \nIt is not. It is not as if the new lean and mean Air Force doesn't have \nother options to the west for the composite wing station. At Mountain \nHome, the Owyhee Canyon lands is a convenience, not a necessity. They \ngo on to say it is just that in an era where the Federal Government is \nsupposed to be trimmed down and subcompact, the proposed Owyhee \ntraining range seems to be more like a Cadillac hood ornament.\n  The Twin Falls newspaper, the Times News: The real issue is, will the \nmilitary be allowed to lock up this irreplaceable gem of God's creation \nfor the sake of a shorter commute? Eight years into this debate and we \nstill haven't heard a convincing explanation why it should. This is how \nthe people of Idaho, the people of Nevada, how the people of Oregon \nfeel about this. That is why the groups I have listed--Oregon Natural \nResources Counsel, the Rural Alliance for Military Accountability, \nFriends of Earth, and dozens of other groups--think this idea is \nscatter-brained and not very wise.\n  Mr. President, we have numerous articles. I also state that yesterday \nthere was a statement made when there was a perfecting amendment--there \nwas, in fact, a photo shown, but the Owyhee Canyon lands photo is a \nphoto of the Tules and East Fork of the Owyhee River. The area is not \ncovered by altitude restrictions described by the person moving the \namendment. The restrictions extend upriver to Battle Creek. The Tules \narea is east of this.\n  Now public comments. The movement of the perfecting amendment \nyesterday failed to disclose that of the thousands of comments \nsubmitted, the substance of the comments--I repeat, 6-1, 86 percent are \nopposed to this deal; 86 percent are opposed to the Air Force proposal.\n  The tribes weren't at the table; the tribes weren't present at the \nmeetings of any of the Senators who moved the amendments. Tribal \nconcerns have not been met. The tribes remain opposed. One completed \nstudy, funded by the Air Force, shows irreversible harm to tribal \nculture by this proposal.\n  Mr. President, there is no reason to do this. Rancher Brackett will \nnot go out of business as a result of this proposal. The impact of the \nallotment represents 5 percent of his total operation. The intention of \nthe amendment, very graciously, is to compensate the rancher for loss \nof grazing allotments and then find replacement allotments of equal \nvalue. Brackett has an agreement with BLM to commence an environmental \nassessment, confer over 3,000 temporary AUMs--animal unit months--to \nthe Juniper area, which would require compensation. It seems unfair and \nunwise.\n  Mr. President, training will continue. It is not going to change. \nThis is for the benefit of the Air Force, to give them BRAC insurance. \nThere is no other reason for this. It is a range of convenience. It is \ndetrimental to the environment. If we look to the future, this training \nrange is not futuristic, it is something that is looking to the past. \nAnd certainly, with our constrained budget, and attempting to balance \nthe budget, it is unwise. I ask my colleagues to support this \namendment, to delete this language from the bill, save the taxpayers a \nhuge amount of money today and large amounts of money in the future.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Is there a sufficient \nsecond?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I will address the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields the Senator time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. How much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina controls 60 \nminutes in opposition.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield the distinguished Senator such \ntime as he may require.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I will address a number of the issues that have been raised by the \nSenator from Nevada. He talks about this proposal by the Air Force to \nexpand and enhance training at Mountain Home Air Force Base. It is a \ncomposite wing with F-15s, F-16s, B-1 bombers, C-135 tankers. This is \nunusual, to have a composite wing. They are bedded down so that they \ntrain as they will fight.\n  I think we know we have a troubled world out there. There is no \nlonger the other big giant, the Soviet Union. We see the troubling \nheadlines every day. It is a composite wing that would get the order--\nif we have to go into harm's way, there is a high likelihood they would \nbe dispatched from Mountain Home Air Force Base--the finest pilots in \nthe world, sending them into harm's way.\n  I hope and pray that not only do we provide them the best equipment \nbut also the best training opportunities, so that when those men and \nwomen get into that aircraft, they have every chance and opportunity to \ncome back home to their loved ones after accomplishing what the U.S. \nGovernment sends them to do on behalf of the U.S. citizens.\n  The characterization that this is just some guarantee of future \nMountain Home Air Force Base, is that why this is one of the items in a \npriority of the President of the United States? Is that why the \nSecretary of Interior is part of this process? The acting Secretary of \nthe Air Force? The director of the BLM? The director of the Council of \nEnvironmental Quality? The Secretary of Defense? Are they all in this \ntogether? Yes, they are, because we want to provide that sort of \ntraining opportunity for the composite wing.\n  It happens to be located at Mountain Home Air Force Base. I serve on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee. I am proud of that assignment. Why \ndid we put this legislation, this language from the Department of \nInterior and the Air Force, in the defense authorization bill? Because \nthat is where the President puts the funds for the expansion and \nimprovements to the training range.\n  That seems rather logical to me. Governor Phil Batt, a Republican, \nduring his entire term of office, has been working to make this project \na reality from the State perspective. His predecessor, Governor Cecil \nAndrus, a Democrat, worked diligently and dedicated much of his time to \nbring this about to be a reality. We are finally going to make it a \nreality. Is it a Republican issue? Well, if it is, why is a Democrat \nadministration making this such a priority?\n  I ask the opponents of this: Have you called your President? Have you \ncalled your Secretary of Interior? Have you called your Secretary of \nthe Air Force? Your director of the BLM? Your director of the Council \nof Environmental Quality? If you have, as I have, I think you will get \na very clear message that this is a priority and this must and should \ngo forward.\n  On this idea that, by golly, we have shut everybody out, there have \nbeen 2\\1/2\\ years of effort, Mr. President. This is the environmental \nimpact statement. Yes, everybody was ``shut out''--16 public hearings \nin 3 different States, over 400 witnesses, and over 1,000 comments are \nincluded in this. Show me the evidence that they were shut out.\n  We talk about the Native Americans. The Senator from Nevada said, \n``Shouldn't they be part of the deal? Why were they ignored?'' Well, I \nwould like to, then, reference from the environmental impact statement \na few of the meetings that were held between the Air Force and \nrepresentatives of the Shoshone-Paiute Tribe. I happen to have the \nutmost respect for members of the Shoshone-Paiute tribe. I worked with \nthem. A number of them I consider friends. They are wonderful people.\n\n[[Page S7070]]\n\n  A meeting was held on 20 May, 1995; on 20 September, 1995; on 6 \nDecember, 1995; on 21 February, 1996; on 21 May, 1996; on 22 May, 1996; \non 23 May, 1996; on 28 May, 1996; on 20 June, 1996; on 11 July, 1996; \non 7 August, 1996; on 22 August, 1996; on 19 September, 1996; on 20 \nSeptember, 1996; on 24 September, 1996; on 8 November, 1996; on 9 \nDecember, 1996; on 9 January, 1997; on 22 January, 1997; on 14 March, \n1997; on 9 June, 1997; on 29 July, 1997; on 5 December, 1997; on 10 \nDecember, 1997; on 9 January, 1998; on 13 January, 1998.\n  Isn't it a shame that they were ignored. There were 26 meetings.\n  In a letter that the tribe sent to the Honorable Rudy De Leon, Under \nSecretary of the U.S. Air Force--included in this letter, Mr. \nPresident, they referenced the training range. They say, ``In regard to \nthe training range, enclosed as an attachment is a map with a shaded \narea running north and west from a reservation. This represents the \narea in which our sacred sites are located and, therefore, the area in \nwhich we oppose the creation of any training range, whether drop or no \ndrop.''\n  Included in this letter is this map. Now, I would like to point out \nthat here is the Duck Valley Indian Reservation. Here is the Idaho-\nNevada border. This map is the same as right here. They drew the line; \nthe Native Americans drew the line and said, ``Stay out of this area, \nplease, because we have sacred sites, because this is critical to our \nculture.'' So where is Juniper Butte, the 12,000-acre training range? \nIs it in that area? No. It is right there, right there. But nobody was \nlistening. Where is the evidence? Who selected that site--Juniper \nButte? Did this rancher come forward and say: Federal Government, would \nyou please choose this site? No. It was the Bureau of Land Management. \nThat was their proposed alternative. They suggested that. After a 2\\1/\n2\\-year process, the Air Force agreed that that is the best site. That \nis where you can do it. BLM recommended it; Air Force concurred. The \nrancher--or the ``cowboy,'' as the Senator from Nevada refers to him--\ndidn't come forward and say, ``I would like to do this.'' The Air \nForce, from day 1, said they would compensate anybody who was adversely \nimpacted.\n\n  There is the land, 12,000 acres. That is where that family, for \nyears, has been deriving their living. They put in extensive water \npipes and fencing in this area. But now, because the Air Force needs \nit, yes, they are willing to be good citizens and say, all right, we \nwill no longer utilize it as we have. But isn't it fair that they ought \nto be compensated for the pipelines and the fence, so they can be \nallowed to remain whole? There it is.\n  Now, these beautiful pictures of the Owyhee Canyon lands are \nabsolutely spectacular. The Senator from Nevada says that citizens, in \ntrying to escape the daily clutter, go to these Owyhee Canyon lands. \nThat is good. They should come there. They are welcome there. It is \nbeautiful. He said that they would be devastated by this decision--\ndevastated by this decision--because we are going to turn it into a \nbombing range. Over this beautiful, pristine canyonland, do you know \nwhat the current regulations are? Jets can fly at 100 feet above ground \nlevel, 100 feet above the canyon rim. With this agreement, they won't \nbe able to do that. Right now, they can do that 365 days out of the \nyear. With this agreement, during April, May, and June, they can only \ndo it Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. So that the recreationalists \ncan enjoy the beautiful canyonlands and the water, it is just Tuesday, \nWednesday, Thursday, not 7 days a week. Incidentally, it is not at 100 \nfeet above the canyon rim, but 5,000 feet above the canyon rim, if they \nrun parallel to the canyons, a mile on each side, 5,000 feet, or \nperpendicular at 1,000 feet. That is what you pick up with this.\n  But if you don't like that, then go along with the Senator from \nNevada and strike the language, and the pilots can again be at 100 feet \nabove the canyon rim 365 days a year.\n  We talk about sheep that are there; the Air Force provides $435,000 \nfor 4 years so we can monitor the impact of this, the flights on the \nsheep as well as sage grouse. We have mitigation in place for spotted \npepper grouse.\n  Mr. President, I think we have a good program here. I think we have a \ngood project. We talk about the training.\n  Again, as members of the Armed Services Committee, we are very \nconcerned about training and the amount of time that we can budget for \nour pilots actually to be in the air training--not in transit, \ntraining. That is the key--training. We have determined that their \ntotal combat training time more than doubles with this enhanced \ntraining range--more than doubles. Isn't that what we want for our \npilots--to be training, so, again, as much as you hope and pray, they \nare not going to have to go into conflict with something crazy that \nhappens somewhere in the world? But I will tell you, if they do, I \ndon't want to be on the side that denied them the opportunity for \nadequate training.\n  This proposal that predates my tenure in the U.S. Senate--it has been \naround many, many years, but it is time to bring it to a conclusion. \nThat is what the President of the United States believes. That is what \nthe Secretary of the Air Force believes, the Secretary of Defense, the \nSecretary of the Interior, and the Idaho delegation--Senator Craig, \nCongresswoman Chenoweth, Congressman Crapo--Governor Batt. It is time \nto do this and do what is right.\n  Mr. President, I think that concludes my remarks at this point. I \nhope I have helped set the record straight.\n  I urge my colleagues not to support this amendment offered by the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Again, I remind you that this is not a partisan issue. I call upon my \nfriends of the Democratic Party, certainly those on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, to support this Air Force proposal, to support this \nadministration proposal, so that we can do what is right, do what is \nright for the pilots, but do it in a sensitive fashion that is right \nfor the environment and which also enhances the opportunities for \nrecreation.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, Senator Reid's amendment will strike title 29 of the \nNation's Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. Title 29, if \nenacted, would authorize the land withdrawal for enhanced military \ntraining in Idaho. That land withdrawal is necessary to ensure the very \nrealistic military training of the 366th Wing at Mountain Home Air \nForce Base, ID. The administration has expressed support--I repeat, the \nadministration has expressed support--for Senator Kempthorne's \nsubstitute amendment to title 29 which was passed by a voice vote \nyesterday.\n  I strongly support Senator Kempthorne's amendment to title 29 of the \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 and his continued \nefforts to ensure enhanced training in Idaho. As a result, I must \noppose Senator Reid's amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Idaho indicates that he wants \nto make sure that the pilots don't fly in harm's way. The pilots who \nfly out of Mountain Home are treated fairly. They have all they need to \nbe the best that they can be.\n\n  I refer to what the Air Force said themselves. I quote the Air Force \ndeputy chief of staff. He acknowledged that ``the Idaho training range \nwas not strictly necessary for composite force training.'' The deputy \nchief of staff said, ``The division already met training needs using \nthe existing range at Saylor Creek, as well as the ranges in Idaho and \nNevada.''\n  Here is what General Ken Peck had to say, the wing commander: ``We \nare the most combat capable unit anywhere in the world right now.''\n  So I don't think we can stretch this by saying that if this amendment \ndoes not pass, the Air Force pilots are going to be flying in harm's \nway. Quite to the contrary. According to the commander of the 336th \nWing, ``We are the most combat capable unit anywhere in the world right \nnow.'' Why? Because they fly, at the most, 40 minutes to do training. \nThey can train at Mountain Home, but at the most, 40 minutes.\n  Mr. President, let me also say that I have mentioned a number of the \nenvironmental groups. Everyone should understand that they haven't had \nmany\n\n[[Page S7071]]\n\nenvironmental votes this year. This is one of them. The League of \nConservation Voters feels very strongly about this. They have written \nletters. They have done telephone calls. They have sent e-mail. They \nsent faxes. This is something the League of Conservation Voters are \ngoing to look at very closely.\n  Mr. President, has the training of the last 7 years been sufficient \nor inadequate? The Air Force can disagree, as I have already indicated \nfrom the commander of the base. We must focus on the justification for \nthe proliferation of more Air Force space. It is simply unneeded. Is it \nnecessary to spend $32 million? The answer is no. We are trying to save \nmoney, not spend it unnecessarily. As I have said before, this is BRAC \ninsurance for Mountain Home Air Base.\n  What does the new tribal council say about the sites? They say that \nthey have people come to the reservation on many occasions but, of \ncourse, have not consulted with the tribe. They have come through and \ntold the tribe what they are going to do, and that is indicated. It is \nimportant to do that. They have been ignored.\n  The picture that has been shown by my friend from Idaho shows this \ndesert area. Mr. President, what do you fly over to get to that? You \nfly over this to get to that. You fly over this land. That is the \nproblem. We admit they are not going to be strafing and dropping bombs \nin this area. But they are going to be flying over this to get to the \nother area.\n  I repeat: Who is going to be the air police? Are we going to have \nhelicopters up there 500 feet, and, if you go below that, you hit a \nhelicopter? The answer is no. There is no air police. The airspace is \nviolated continually. Anyone who has an airbase in their State knows \nthat. These pilots do their best. Sometimes their best is not good \nenough. They must fly over these wilderness areas, these pristine \nareas, to get to the area in the picture my friend showed.\n  Mr. President, who called them about the agreement on the sacred \nsites in this bill? The answer is no one. Everybody was shut out over \nthe site. The Air Force didn't like what was being said. Remember, we \ntalk about thousands, or more, comments--1,000 or more comments, and 86 \npercent of them were opposed to it. You can go around and get all the \ncomments you want, if you are going to ignore them. That is what was \ndone here.\n  I admit that taking taxpayer money and spending it unnecessarily is a \nbipartisan objective around here. I agree with my friend from Idaho. \nMoney is spent unnecessarily by Democrats and Republicans, and that is \nwhat is being done here.\n  It seems funny, as reported in the Idaho press, that the only person \nbeing compensated is a caucasian farmer. The Indians who have their \ntribal lands violated, their sacred sites violated, their life \ndisturbed, are not getting 5 cents.\n  They will be able to fly over Jack's Creek, an area that BLM didn't \nwant to give up--270 square miles of pristine land.\n  Mr. President, I think the most impressive thing here is how the \nFederal Government has attempted to get insurance. It is not on the \nmarket in most places. In Congress it is. They can come in here and buy \nBRAC insurance so that next time we do base closings--everybody knows \nMountain Home just barely made it last time. This is an effort to \nassure that Mountain Home won't close next time.\n  I want to make sure, because they are never represented in the halls \nof Congress, or rarely so, and certainly the Owyhee Indians are not \nrepresented--I want everyone to understand that they feel they have \nbeen had, that they have not been treated fairly, and they feel their \nlands have been taken from them this time and in the past. In the past, \nwe can't do much about that, but we certainly can do something about \nthis time.\n  This amendment should pass. It is a fair thing to do. It is the right \nthing to do. It is the good thing to do for the military of this \ncountry. And it is the best thing we could possibly do for the \ntaxpayers of this country. Right off the bat, we would save $32 \nmillion.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I say to the chairman of the committee, the manager of the bill, that \nI only have one Senator I know who has indicated he wants to come and \nspeak on this issue, and we are making a call. If he does not want to \ncome, maybe we can yield back our time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, my colleague from Nevada has been \nreading from an inspector general's audit. I believe the date on that \nis 1995. That particular project was the Idaho Training Range. It was a \nprevious proposal that was rejected. This was a proposal which then-\nGovernor Cecil Andrus worked extremely hard to bring about and should \nbe commended for that. But again the specifics on that audit deal with \nITR, the Idaho Training Range, and that is not the proposal before us \ntoday.\n  He references official letters that I think are a couple years old, \nso let me read to you, if I may, a letter from the current Secretary of \nDefense, William Cohen. I will ask unanimous consent that this be made \npart of the record.\n  It says:\n\n       Thank you for your letter of September 8, 1997. I want to \n     assure you nothing has changed regarding my enthusiasm for \n     the Enhanced Training in Idaho (ETI) initiative.\n       The 366th Wing at Mountain Home Air Force Base is an \n     important component of our military capability. As one of the \n     first units to deploy to a problem area, it has the \n     responsibility to neutralize enemy forces. It must maintain \n     peak readiness to respond rapidly and effectively to diverse \n     situations and conflicts.\n       ETI balances realistic local training with careful \n     consideration of environmental, cultural, and economic \n     concerns. The elements of the ETI proposal, though designed \n     to minimize environmental impacts, will simulate real world \n     scenarios and allow the aircrews to plan and practice complex \n     missions. In addition to providing realistic training, ETI's \n     close proximity to Mountain Home Air Force Base also will \n     enable the Air Force to convert time currently spent in \n     transit into actual training time. Thus, the ETI proposal \n     allows Air Force crews to use limited flight training hours \n     more efficiently.\n       I continue to give the ETI process my full support. It will \n     provide our commanders with realistic training opportunities \n     locally, while ensuring potential impacts to natural, \n     cultural, social, and economic resources are identified and, \n     where possible, cooperatively resolved. Your strong support \n     for the ETI initiative is very important to us, and you may \n     rely upon my continued interest and commitment. I trust this \n     information is useful.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bill Cohen,\n                                             Secretary of Defense.\n\n  I also have a letter dated June 19, 1998, from the Acting Secretary \nof the Air Force, Whitten Peters, as well as the Secretary of Interior, \nBruce Babbitt. I quote from that:\n\n       Dear Senator Kempthorne: We are pleased to provide you with \n     the attached legislation for the withdrawal of lands for \n     the Enhanced Training in Idaho (ETI) project. As you know, \n     this legislation represents three years of extensive work \n     by the Bureau of Land Management, the Air Force, you, and \n     other representatives of the people of Idaho, and many \n     others who care about the welfare of Idaho's environment \n     and the effectiveness of the 366th Wing at Mountain Home \n     Air Force Base.\n       ETI will increase the realism, flexibility, and quality of \n     the Air Force's training. It permits the 366th Wing to train \n     more efficiently and effectively for its important missions, \n     thereby improving the aircrews' safety and mission \n     performance. Implementation of ETI will substantially \n     strength the 366th Wing's ability to ensure readiness to \n     perform its assigned missions.\n       Importantly, however, the Air Force and BLM also worked \n     very hard so that ETI would balance training needs with the \n     concerns of the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes, the environment, and \n     other public land uses. The Air Force and BLM actively \n     solicit public and agency involvement through the development \n     of the project. Participants in the process included the \n     State of Idaho, environmental organizations, the Shoshone-\n     Paiute Tribes, ranchers, recreational organizations, and \n     other users of the public lands in Idaho.\n       The Air Force incorporated numerous mitigations in the \n     design of the project to address public concerns and \n     relocated facility sites during preparation of the \n     environmental impact statement to avoid various environmental \n     concerns expressed by the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes and others. \n     Following completion of the EIS and consideration of public \n     comment, the Air Force adopted further mitigation measures, \n     including altitude and seasonal overflight restrictions\n\n[[Page S7072]]\n\n     that further address concerns of recreational users to \n     protect the habitat of bighorn sheep. The NEPA process was a \n     valuable tool in helping to identify these mitigations and \n     resolve concerns.\n       We believe the attached legislation accommodates many \n     issues that you and other representatives of the people of \n     Idaho have raised throughout the process and is an important \n     step forward for national security, for the environment, and \n     for significant tribal interests.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that from the \n     standpoint of the administration's program there is no \n     objection to the presentation of this report to Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bruce Babbitt,\n                                        Secretary of the Interior;\n     F. Whitten Peters,\n                                Acting Secretary of the Air Force.\n\n  Mr. President, as noted here, the language which I submitted is the \nadministration's language. And I was greatly pleased, and I appreciate \nthe statement by the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Levin, when he stated, and I may be paraphrasing, \nthat Senator Kempthorne did exactly what he said he would do in the \nArmed Services Committee, and that is that he would come back before \nthe Senate and he would provide the perfecting language to this issue. \nIt is exactly what I did. And whose perfecting language? It came from \nthe administration.\n  I know that the senior Senator from Idaho wishes to make comments on \nthis, so I will yield the floor and again look forward to comments by \nthe senior Senator from Idaho, who has been a great leader on this \nissue as well.\n  I make this final thought. It is a public process. In the public \narena you sometimes get bruised, but there are just groups out there \nthat for years have not wanted this project to become a reality, and so \nthey will use any handle they can to try to stop it. They have tried a \nvariety of things to stop it. Sometimes they questioned people's \nintegrity in their efforts to try to stop this. That is real \nunfortunate because I think that is what causes a lot of citizens to \nsay ``that's why I don't want to step into the public arena.''\n  I think people's reputation and dignity are worth something, and I \ndon't think they ought to be trashed just for a political agenda to \nsomehow try to stop something.\n  So with that, I look forward to the comments by the senior Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am here on the floor this afternoon to \njoin my colleague from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, to reinforce what \nthis Senate agreed to yesterday, agreed to in a unanimous environment. \nWhat they really agreed to, once the two Senators from Idaho and the \nIdaho congressional delegation had spent over 2\\1/2\\ years ensuring \nthat the public process was fulfilled, they agreed--you agreed, the \nSenate agreed--that the Senators from Idaho, having worked the process, \ndeserved to do what was necessary to do to ensure the long-term \nstability of Mountain Home Air Force Base and its expanded mission.\n  What did we do? What did Idaho do to ensure that the public lands \nwere held in the appropriate esteem, that Native Americans involved in \nthis were appropriately addressed, that the mission was fulfilled by \nthe expansion of range to the necessary amount?\n  We met twice with the BLM and the Air Force and all of the agencies \ninvolved to assure that they did their homework and that they did it \nright, because several years ago they had not done it right and \nIdahoans reacted, in part, by saying, while we need this training \nrange, the process has to be corrected. The process is now complete and \nthe process is correct, by every participant's evaluation.\n  There are some, like Senator Kempthorne has just spoken to, who do \nnot agree with it. But they agree with nothing. They oppose everything. \nEven though they are hard-pressed to admit that there were any failures \nto the process because they were involved, there were, I believe, some \n16 public hearings in the State, a full outreach by the BLM and the Air \nForce, to make sure that this reallocating of land was the right thing \nto do.\n  The Duck Valley Indian Reservation--I believe there were 20-plus \nmeetings. Let me read a letter that was sent on January 29 by the \nentire congressional delegation to the Shoshone-Paiute tribes of Duck \nValley Reservation. James Paiva, the tribal chairman:\n\n       Dear Chairman Paiva:\n       Today we received the Air Force's final Environmental \n     Impact Statement . . . regarding the Enhanced Training in \n     Idaho . . . project. We also had a meeting with senior \n     Department of Defense, Air Force, Department of the Interior \n     and Bureau of Land Management officials regarding the future \n     steps necessary to develop the ETI.\n       Knowing of the tribes' previous concerns regarding the ETI \n     [or the Enhanced Training in Idaho] project, at our meeting \n     today we especially asked about the tribes' position \n     regarding the final EIS. We were assured the Air Force and \n     BLM have made great efforts to accommodate the concerns of \n     the Tribe.\n       We want to thank you for your excellent cooperation on this \n     very important project. We urge you to continue to work with \n     the Air Force to develop cooperative solutions to training \n     issues. We look forward to working with you in the future on \n     the many areas of mutual interests we share.\n\n  Sincerely,\n     Senator Craig.\n     Senator Kempthorne.\n     Congressman Crapo.\n     Congresswoman Chenoweth.\n  The outreach has gone on. The outreach has been complete. I cannot \nstand here today and tell you that all members of the Shoshone-Paiute \ntribe at Duck Valley are satisfied. But we believe that their questions \nand their concerns have been answered and that they agree in general \nthat is the case.\n  Let me address the environment for just a moment. The Owyhee will not \nbe devastated. Neither Senator Craig nor Senator Kempthorne would stand \nor tolerate that, and any suggestion of that is bunk. It is a false \nallegation at the very best. We value our lands and we value their \nbeauty--and they are beautiful. As Senator Kempthorne has said, where \nthere was once a 100-foot level of flight over areas, which may be \ndemonstrated in the pictures standing by the Senator from Nevada, there \nis now 1,000 feet of protection. Where there was an ability to \ncontinually fly over areas where there are California sheep, there is \nnow a limitation during the lambing period. There really isn't anything \nwe have not thought of, because we have been consulting for 2\\1/2\\ \nyears with every stakeholder and every interest in this area.\n  I am at a loss today to try to understand why the Senator from Nevada \nwould want to strike this because we have talked with him. We felt we \nhad talked and worked with his people adequately enough to assure that \nall of the concerns were met. Claims that this range is only here to \nBRAC-proof Mountain Home simply are false because Mountain Home was \nnever on the list. Why? For a lot of the reasons that Nevada bases have \nnot been on lists, because they are away from population centers and \nthey have great air time and they are the kinds of bases that the Air \nForce wants for optimum flying. That is why.\n  But, for new training missions, looking out into the future, knowing \nhow difficult it is to reallocate public lands, Mountain Home and the \nAir Force thought it was time to expand the necessary training ranges. \nIt costs hundreds of thousands of dollars annually to fly longer \ndistances to train simply because of the consumptive necessities of \nthese large aircraft. The closer that range, the easier to train, the \nless need to schedule timing and do all of that type of thing. And that \nis exactly why we worked with the Air Force to do that.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will join with us today in not supporting a \nmotion to strike, because I believe the two Senators from Idaho, \ncertainly, Senator Kempthorne and myself, have spoken to this issue. We \nknew that there would always be concern about the reallocation of \npublic lands and that the process had to be unquestionable. We have \ntracked it. We have detailed it, day to day, week to week, month to \nmonth, for 2\\1/2\\ years. Now the administration is in full support of \nit. The administration put it in their budget. The Department of the \nInterior signed off on it. The Air Force signed off on it. The BLM has \nsigned off on it. It is in full support.\n  So why, today, a motion to strike is beyond me and very frustrating. \nWe had hoped this would not have to occur, but apparently it is \nnecessary that the Senator from Nevada do this. For that, I am \ndisappointed, that it has to happen, because the people of Idaho have \nbeen addressed in this issue and all of the parties concerned have been \nworked with in a complete manner. We believe it is important that we \nproceed.\n\n[[Page S7073]]\n\n  Let me add just one additional thing. The Senator from Nevada \nexpressed concern about the compensation issue for a rancher. I said it \nyesterday. The Senator from Nevada was not on the floor. Let me repeat \nit again today. There is no compensation for this individual rancher. \nThere is an assurance, as we require him to move to a new range, that \nthe moneys are there to build the pipelines and the water systems and \nthe cross-fences to make the new range as productive as the old range \nthat is being taken away from him. This rancher and the Three Creeks \nGrazing Association that I am very familiar with--I have been out on \nthat range numerous times. I know the canyonlands that the Senator from \nNevada talks about. I have been there. I have been in them over the \nlast good number of decades. But the Three Creeks Grazing Association--\nthis rancher and others--have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars \nof their own money and time over the last many, many years to make this \none of the best grazing areas in the State of Idaho. Why? Because they \ncan manage their cattle and because they have adequate water systems to \nmove from pasture to pasture without overgrazing. As a result, these \nlands have become increasingly productive.\n  Something else happens when lands for grazing become increasingly \nproductive because of water and because of rest/rotation management \nthrough effective cross-fencing. The abundance of wildlife increases, \nand there is clear documentation to prove it. Upland game birds, deer, \nand now in Idaho, open range elk have increased in phenomenal numbers--\nnot because of the absence of management but because of the presence of \nmanagement and because of the kinds of investment that many of these \nranchers have worked with BLM to make over the years.\n  That is the intention we are talking about. Not the full \nmisrepresentation in the newspapers that somehow somebody was getting \npaid off. That is simply not the case. I don't think the administration \nwould be involved in that kind of a tactic. It is their budget that we \nare dealing with here and the moneys they put in for the purposes of \nthese kinds of transitions. That is what we are talking about today.\n  We have been fully aboveboard on this with numerous public hearings \naddressing all of the issues. I hope my colleagues will join Senator \nKempthorne and myself in a motion to table this motion to strike.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to S. \n2057 offered by my colleague from Nevada, Senator Reid.\n  The Reid amendment would strike from the bill an amendment adopted by \nthe Armed Services Committee during its markup of S. 2057.\n  That amendment, offered by Senator Kempthorne, would withdraw 12,000 \nacres of land from the public domain for use by the United States Air \nForce for a project known as Enhanced Training in Idaho, or E.T.I.\n  It would ratify the Air Force's recently announced selection of this \nland--known as the Juniper Butte Range--for addition to an existing \n109,000-acre training range.\n  The Air Force plans to invest thirty million dollars to outfit the \narea for training pilots in electronic warfare, tactical maneuvering \nand air support.\n  Over the past several years, the Air Force has failed to gain public \napproval of similar proposals to expand its training area in Idaho to \nprovide more cost-effective training for pilots at Mountain Home Air \nForce Base.\n  These proposals, like the current Juniper Butte proposal, have been \ncontroversial in large part due to their potential impacts on proposed \nwilderness areas, wildlife, and human populations.\n  These impacts--principally from the anticipated increase in air \ntraffic and the noise associated with it--are significant and very \ndifficult to mitigate.\n  Increased air traffic and noise are of particular concern to the \nShoshone-Paiute tribes of the Duck Valley Indian Reservation, which \nstraddles the Idaho-Nevada border.\n  Low level overflights of the reservation and sonic booms associated \nwith the existing Idaho training facilities have long been a source of \nfriction between the tribes and the Air Force.\n  As a result of litigation brought by the tribe against the Air Force \nover these issues, the tribe and the Air Force entered into an \nagreement concerning training flights in the vicinity of the Duck \nValley Reservation.\n  Regrettably, the tribe currently regards the Air Force as being in \nviolation of this agreement.\n  It is therefore not surprising that the Duck Valley tribes view the \nJuniper Butte proposal as an additional threat to their culture, \nreligion and resources.\n  Nevertheless, I would like to commend the Air Force for entering into \na contract to evaluate the impacts of Air Force activities on the \ncultural practices and sacred sites of the tribes.\n  However, my understanding is that these ethnographic studies are \nongoing, and that we at present do not have the benefits of their \nfindings or recommendations.\n  Given the difficult history in the relationship between the Air Force \nand the tribe, I question the wisdom and the need to move precipitously \non the Juniper Butte withdrawal.\n  Typically, when a Federal agency announces a record of decision on a \nproposal such as the Juniper Butte withdrawal, other Federal agencies \nhave an opportunity to review and comment on it.\n  The Department of the Interior, whose Bureau of Land Management \ncurrently manages the Juniper Butte lands, has a wide array of concerns \nabout withdrawing the lands for a bombing range.\n  The department has concerns about potential impacts to some 22 \nproposed wilderness areas, big horn sheep and other wildlife.\n  In addition, as trustee for the Shoshone-Paiute tribes, the \nDepartment is concerned about the potential impacts that adding Juniper \nButte to the bombing range would have on the Duck Valley Reservation \nand its people.\n  While Interior and Air Force representatives have been meeting in an \neffort to address Interior's many concerns, there has been no effort to \naddress the tribal concerns.\n  Given the past and present concerns about this matter, it is \nappropriate to ask, ``What's the rush?''\n  Why is it necessary to short circuit the normal public process of \nreview and comment, of congressional review of a proposal of this \nnature?\n  While it may be desirable for the Air Force to provide an additional \narea for training, there is no lack of existing facilities and no \ncrisis that requires hasty action by the Senate.\n  There have been no congressional hearings on the decision to go ahead \nwith the Juniper Butte land withdrawal since the Air Force announced it \nin March of this year.\n  Accordingly, the Senate has no record of discussion of the relative \ncosts and benefits of the proposal, much less of the need for it.\n  Indeed, a June, 1995, report by the Defense Department's inspector \ngeneral concluded that ``establishing the Idaho training range would be \nan exception to the overall DoD attempt to downsize infrastructure''.\n  Anyone familiar with my record in Congress knows that I believe in a \nstrong national defense.\n  I support the desire of the Air Force to have the best possible \ntraining facilities so that our pilots will remain the very best in the \nworld.\n  And I have no doubt that the Air Force has labored long and hard to \naddress the various criticisms that have been made of its proposals to \nexpand its training facilities in Idaho.\n  However, I also believe that the Senate has a duty and an obligation \nto be sure that the questions of need, of costs and benefits, have been \nanswered fully.\n  We also have an obligation to review the adequacy of the measures \nbeing proposed to mitigate impacts on the environment, wildlife, and \nhuman populations.\n  Until and unless these concerns have been fully addressed, I see no \ncompelling reason to go forward with this project at this time.\n  Accordingly, I support Senator Reid's amendment to strike the Juniper \nButte provisions from S. 2057.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Reid \namendment, which would strike title 29 of the Defense Authorization \nbill, entitled ``Juniper Butte Range Lands Withdrawal.'' Title 29 would \nauthorize development of the proposed Enhanced Training in Idaho (ETI) \nproject of the Air Force. The ETI involves creation of\n\n[[Page S7074]]\n\na new Air Force training range covering parts of Idaho, Oregon, and \nNevada to enhance training for aircrews of the 366th Wing based at \nMountain Home AFB. The ETI would provide composite force training that \nincludes multiple types and numbers of aircraft training together. The \nproposal would allow the Air Force to withdraw 12,000 acres of BLM land \nand associated airspace. Total DoD funding is estimated at $31.5 \nmillion.\n  Mr. President, I would like to share with my colleagues several \nreasons why I feel the Enhanced Training in Idaho proposal lacks merit.\n  1. The Air Force has not justified the need for a new training range.\n  The Inspector General of the Department of Defense reviewed the Air \nForce's Idaho training range proposal and found that ``the Air Force \ncost benefit analysis that supports the proposal was prematurely \nformulated because of the lack of an overall training plan for the \n366th Wing.''\n  The IG audit recommended that the Pentagon ``withhold Air Force and \nAir National Guard funds related to establishing the Idaho training \nrange.''\n  In his comments to the IG, the Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff \nacknowledged that the Idaho training range was not strictly necessary, \nand he stated that existing training resources enabled the 366th Wing \nto meet its training needs and to become combat ready.\n  The IG concluded that ``the Air Force has not established the \ntraining requirement for the 366th Wing composite force or proved why \nexisting training ranges cannot continue to provide composite force \ntraining.''\n  The IG further concludes that ``the Utah, Nellis, and Fallon ranges \nare suitable for composite force training and the ranges have the \nrequired airspace and ground areas.'' During the audit, officials of \nthe 366th Wing stated that all training requirements were being met \nwith the Saylor Creek Range and the Utah, Nellis, and Fallon ranges.\n  2. The ETI proposal is nothing more than a BRAC insurance policy for \nMountain Home AFB.\n  The motivation for this proposal is clear: it lessens the likelihood \nof Mountain Home AFB being included in a future round of base closings.\n  Senator Kempthorn was quoted in the Mountain Home News earlier this \nyear as saying that the ETI range proposal ``will be a great insurance \npolicy for Mountain Home AFB.''\n  3. Congress has not had the opportunity to review the proposal.\n  Neither the Armed Services Committee nor the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee have held any hearings on this proposal.\n  Interested members of Congress and the public should have the \nopportunity to examine this proposal in the context of public hearings.\n  In the 99th Congress, hearings were held in both the House and Senate \non Legislation authorizing the withdrawal of public lands in the State \nof Nevada for training ranges in Fallon and Nellis.\n  4. Environmental impacts associated with the proposal have not been \nadequately mitigated..\n  A substantial portion of the air space expansion proposed by the Air \nForce is in the state of Nevada.\n  The Board of County Commissioners of Elko County, Nevada, has \nexpressed its concern with the proposal regarding the impact of \nincreased training flights over the Owyhee Canyonlands, which extend \ninto Elko County in northern Nevada.\n  Less than one-third of the acreage the BLM originally sought to \nprotect is covered by the 5,000 foot minimum flight level contained in \nthe agreement between BLM and the Air Force.\n  The agreements 5,000 foot standard protects less than one-half of the \nwilderness study areas of that region and its archaeological and sacred \nIndian sites.\n  It protects less than one-third of the candidate wild and scenic \nrivers.\n  Finally, the agreement opens military overflights in the area \nsurrounding Little Jacks Creek, which is the only remaining wild area \nin the Owyhees where people and wildlife, including bighorn sheep, can \nenjoy relative peace\n\n  5. Impacts on the Shoshone-Paiute tribes have not been adequately \naddressed.\n  The proposal omits any meaningful mitigation measures for the tribal \nmembers residing on the Duck Valley Reservation\n  The language of the proposal pays only lip service to the importance \nof preserving access to and use of Indian sacred sites\n  6. The compensation provisions for ranching operations is a taxpayer \nboondoggle.\n  The proposal contains a lucrative compensation package for one \nrancher that currently has a federal grazing permit on the 12,000 acres \ntargeted for the range\n  It has been reported that the grazing permit involves 1,059 AUM's--an \nAUM is currently valued at $1.35--which would mean that the permittee \nis currently paying approximately $1,429 per year for his privilege to \ngraze cattle on public land\n  It has also been reported that the agreement between the Air Force \nand the permittee involves a buy out of all or a substantial portion of \nthis grazing use at the rate of $250 per AUM, which equates to a total \npayment of $264,750; in addition, the Air Force has agreed to \ncompensate the permittee for the replacement costs associated with \nconstructing new range improvements on other grazing land\n  The vast discrepancy between what this rancher has paid for his \nprivilege to graze on public land and what he is being paid to relocate \nhis grazing operation sets a dangerous precedent that should alarm the \nAmerican taxpayer\n  Mr. President, for the reasons stated above, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Reid amendment.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Oregon was coming to \nthe floor to speak, but there is an illness in his family, and he will \nbe unable to come.\n  What we have to understand is why, if the previous information that \nthey had given to the Senate regarding the audit was not accurate, why \nwasn't another audit done?\n  The electronic range that is being talked about here is essentially \nthe same, although it has shifted a little to the east. Both proposals \nfeature supersonic operations, low-level flight, flare and chaff and \ncomposite force exercises over vast areas of public lands.\n  The generic components of the electronic battlefield and bombing \nrange have been juggled around geographically in the airspace, but have \nremained essentially the same and are designed to support the same kind \nof training which has been judged to be redundant by the Department of \nDefense inspector general in the audit report.\n  There has been some talk that the tribe has been consulted many \ntimes. This is what the tribe says:\n\n       The EIS does not even begin to account for tribal concerns \n     and was absolutely insufficient for the purpose of making a \n     decision regarding tribal interests. In fact, the EIS process \n     was detrimental to Tribal archeological resources because \n     significant vandalism has resulted from the lack of \n     confidentiality provisions in this part of the EIS process.\n\n  The tribe doesn't like this deal. They don't like it in one respect, \ntwo respects; they don't like it in any respects.\n  My friend, the senior Senator from Idaho, says this has nothing to do \nwith BRAC insurance. I only refer to the junior Senator from Idaho in a \nspeech where he said, it was reported in the Mountain Home News earlier \nthis year:\n\n       The range will be a great insurance policy for Mountain \n     Home Air Force Base.\n\n  That is a quote. ``The range will be a great insurance policy for \nMountain Home Air Force Base,'' Mountain Home News, February 25, 1998.\n  The Owyhee Canyon Lands Coalition, speaking for all the environmental \ngroups, said:\n\n       We have always considered the electronic warfare range to \n     be at least as objectionable as the Juniper Butte target \n     site.\n\n  We have heard talk on the floor that there is no compensation \ninvolved. All you have to do is read from the language of the bill that \nwe are trying to have stricken:\n\n       The Secretary of the Air Force is authorized and directed \n     upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary considers \n     just to conclude and implement agreements with the \n     permittees--\n\n  Of course, there is only one--\n\n     to provide appropriate consideration.\n\n\n[[Page S7075]]\n\n\n  I have not practiced law in a number of years. I am a lawyer, and I \nknow consideration means compensation. That is what the bill says.\n  I talked about the Air Force really having quite an appetite. They \nhave about 50 percent of the land in the State of Nevada. Here is what \nthey have in the State of Utah, which is 175 miles from Mountain Home. \nHow long does it take those jets to go 175 miles? You can figure it \nout. Not very long. Ten minutes? Fifteen minutes? Half hour? The north \nrange is about 175 miles from Mountain Home and consists of 350,000 \nacres of land for exclusive DOD use. They are begging for business. \nThey want Mountain Home to come and fly there. It has all kinds of \ngreat craters and a helicopter air-to-ground complex. It has everything \nthey need for this composite wing in Utah.\n\n  They have Nellis, a large base. I say to my friend from Idaho, the \nsenior Senator, the Nellis Air Force Base range is one of the best in \nthe world, if not the best, but Nellis Air Force Base is right in the \nmiddle of town. It is not rural Nevada. It is right in the middle of \nLas Vegas. You can fly from there over the great range. They can go \nover to Fallon, a great training facility which they use all the time.\n  The extension of this base is unnecessary. Based upon the statements \nmade by Commanding General Ken Peck who is, remember, the commander of \nthe 336th: ``We are the most capable combat unit anywhere in the world \nright now.'' It doesn't mean after they get these additional acres. It \nmeans they are the most efficient, the most capable combat unit \nanywhere in the world right now.\n  I say to my colleagues, this legislation is important. This amendment \nis important. This is what the taxpayers put us here to do: to save \nmoney. By voting yes on this amendment--no on the motion to table--you \nwill be saving this Government $32 million to begin with, and allowing \nin the future the necessary consideration to go forward as to whether \nor not this base should be closed. This is fair to the Native Americans \nwho have been ignored in this process. It is fair to the taxpayers, and \ncertainly fair to the environment and the people who support the \nenvironment. This is a vote that will be scored by a number of \nenvironmental organizations, as well it should be. This is an important \nenvironmental vote. It is an environmental vote, I think, for setting \nthe tone for this Congress.\n  I say to the manager of the bill, I don't know if my two friends from \nIdaho have more to say. Otherwise, I will be happy to yield back time.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I believe we have made our case. We have had a good \ndebate. We are ready to yield back our time. At the appropriate time, I \nwill move to table.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back the time of the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I yield back my time, and I move to table the Reid \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will be postponed.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes \nordered with respect to the pending amendments be stacked to occur at \n4:30 p.m. I further ask that the first vote occur on, or in relation \nto, the Murray-Snowe amendment, followed by a vote on, or in relation \nto, the Reid amendment, which is a motion to table, with 4 minutes for \ndebate equally divided prior to each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I make this inquiry of the Senator \nfrom Nevada. In looking at his legislation and reading it, he states in \nsection ``(f) Repeal of Superseded Authority.--Section 2205 of the \nMilitary Construction Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 is \nrepealed.''\n  My question is with regard to ``fiscal year 1997,'' since that is the \nprevious year, if, in fact, this should read ``fiscal year 1999.'' If \nthere is a need to make a correction here, I have no objection, because \nI don't want to have any parliamentary excuse used. I would like to \nhave a fair vote here. So, again, I make this inquiry as to whether or \nnot this should be 1997, or in fact should be 1999, or in fact the year \n2000.\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Idaho, this is right out of the \nbill. The bill says, ``1997,'' so maybe we should take a look. There \nmight be something wrong with the bill, because the bill says, \n``1997.''\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Again, Mr. President, I appreciate that. We noted \nthat. We wanted to make sure there was nothing to stand in the way of \nus having a vote on this issue before us.\n  Mr. REID. So, Mr. President, I say to my friend from Idaho, if there \nis something wrong, it is because the original text is wrong. We will \ntake a look at that before the vote. If it needs to be corrected, we \nwill stipulate that.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleagues, the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina and the Senator from Michigan. And I realize they are waiting \nfor a couple of amendments to come over and be dealt with on this bill. \nSo as soon as I see someone walk in with an amendment, I will truncate \nthese remarks so as not to interrupt. I know they have the important \nbusiness of the Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dodd pertaining to the introduction of S.2224 are \nlocated in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and \nJoint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2794\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of amendment No. \n2794, the amendment we will be voting on. I understand I have 2 minutes \nand the opposing side will have 2 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthe Murray-Snowe amendment. This is a very simple amendment that \nrestores the right of our women and family members who serve overseas \nin the military to have access to health care services to which they \nought to have access.\n  Current law in the DOD bill says that a woman who would like to have \nhealth care services relating to an abortion would have to ask for \npermission from her commanding officer to have the military pay for her \ntransport home to the United States in order to get health care \nservices. This amendment simply allows that woman to pay for--out of \nher own pocket, not at our expense--that service in a military hospital \nwhere she is serving overseas.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is a safety issue for our women and \nfamilies of personnel who serve overseas. During the course of the \ndebate, I talked about a letter written to me by a woman who was \nserving in Japan who had to go to a hospital in Japan where they did \nnot speak English. She did not know what kind of medication she was \nreceiving. Her health care was at risk. She wrote to us seriously \nquestioning whether she would remain in the military after being \ntreated like this.\n  This is a service that is legal here in the United States. Women who \nserve in\n\n[[Page S7076]]\n\nthe military and families of military personnel should have equal \naccess. We are not asking for any taxpayer expense. We are simply \nallowing women who serve in the military, or families of those who \nserve in the military, to pay for abortion-related services out of \ntheir own pocket, in a safe military hospital overseas.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I thank Senator \nSnowe for her continued help on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes in opposition to the \namendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield back our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2794.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Roth) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Hutchinson) is \nabsent due to death in the family.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nArkansas (Mr. Hutchinson) would vote no.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from Montana (Mr. Baucus), the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn), \nand the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 44, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 176 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--44\n\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Robb\n     Sarbanes\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--7\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Glenn\n     Hutchinson\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Specter\n  The amendment (No. 2794) was rejected.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3009\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Under the \nprevious order, there is 4 minutes of debate equally divided on the \nReid amendment, No. 3009. However, that 4 minutes will not commence \nuntil the Senate is in order.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is an amendment sponsored by Senators \nReid, Bryan, Inouye, Wyden, Kerrey of Nebraska, Durbin, Murray and \nFeingold.\n  What this is all about is inserted in this bill is something called \nBRAC insurance to prevent the Mountain Home Air Base from in the future \nbeing closed. That is all this is.\n  It will cost the Government $32 million unnecessarily. You compensate \na rancher for the first time in the history of this country for having \na privilege. The Government is paying somebody for using our land, in \neffect. Environmentally, every group in America is opposed to what is \nin this bill that we are attempting to take out.\n  The Indians' rights have been stomped upon. There are environmental \nimpact statements out there--86 percent of the respondents were opposed \nto this. Every newspaper in the State of Idaho is opposed to what they \nare trying to accomplish; Oregon, Nevada is against it. This is \nsomething that is unnecessary. It is a range of convenience.\n  I read from the Idaho Statesman newspaper:\n\n       So the question is: Should taxpayers spend $30 million to \n     build another range and risk losing more high desert \n     wilderness so the Air Force can save a few million in fuel, \n     maintenance and operations costs for training out of the \n     state?\n       The answer is no. It's not an acceptable trade-off. The \n     area is far more valuable for its natural resources--\n     especially since the Air Force has shown its range \n     proposal to be only convenient, rather than undeniably \n     essential for national security or pilot safety.\n\n  To show how unnecessary this is, I refer to General Ken Peck, the \ncommander of the 366th Wing, which is this Mountain Home Air Base \ncommander. ``We are the most combat-capable unit anywhere in the world \nright now.''\n  This is not needed. I ask my colleagues to oppose this motion to \ntable for the taxpayers of this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Idaho is recognized. The Presiding Officer is aware that \nthere are important conversations and negotiations underway relative to \nthe disposition of this bill. The Chair asks that those conversations \nbe taken from the well so everybody can hear the Senator from Idaho.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this project is a project of the U.S. \nAir Force. It is supported by the President of the United States, \nSecretary of the Interior, the Director of BLM, Katie McGinty, Counsel \nfor Environmental Quality to the President. Here is the 2\\1/2\\-year \nprocess, the environmental impact statement.\n  I hope Senators had an opportunity to listen to the debate we had \nearlier. We were able to refute everything said by the Senator from \nNevada.\n  I urge everyone to vote to table this motion.\n  I yield the remaining time to the chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, Senator Chafee.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I support Senator Kempthorne and will vote \nto table the Reid amendment. Senator Kempthorne's provision will \nprotect the environment while providing the Air Wing at Mountain Home \nAir Force Base with more realistic training facilities.\n  Please note this: The administration supports the compromise in the \nbill. In fact, the administration wrote the language offered by Senator \nKempthorne. Secretary Babbitt and Secretary Cohen have both sent \nletters of support, as has the Acting Secretary of the Air Force.\n  The compromise language ensures that our environmental laws will \nfully apply to Air Force activities at the Juniper Butte Range. This \nincludes the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  The concessions made by the Air Force with respect to airspace flight \nrestrictions near the range will reduce the noise in the canyon. \nInstead of flights at 100 feet at any time, the flights are now \nrestricted to 3 days per week and this raises the minimum altitudes \nfrom 100 feet to 1000 feet or 5,000 feet depending on the flight angle \nto the canyon.\n  The Kempthorne amendment provision protects the environment and \nnational security. I urge my colleagues to support Senator Kempthorne.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the motion to table \nAmendment No. 3009, offered by the Senator from Nevada. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Roth) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Hutchinson) is \nabsent due to a death in the family.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  Mr. FORD.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                         Contingency Operations\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia, I offered an amendment incorporated into this \nbill requiring the President to explain to Congress the goals and \npotential endpoint of any military contingency operation involving more \nthan 500 troops. Our provision furthermore mandates this report \nwhenever the administration submits a budget request for the operation.\n  During its June 9th Executive Session, the Armed Services Committee \nunanimously approved this amendment, and I am grateful for the eloquent \nexpressions of support made by Senators Thurmond and Levin.\n  The Snowe-Cleland amendment, Mr. President, received the Committee's \nbroad endorsement regardless of our differences over the scope and \npurpose of U.S. contingency operations because Senators from both \nparties agree that the administration must express its mission \nobjectives in tandem with a funding request.\n  The President, however, has ignored this obligation in seeking funds \nto sustain our units in Bosnia. By the end of Fiscal Year 1999, the \nadministration will have budgeted an estimated $9.4 billion for our \nparticipation in the Bosnia Stabilization Force since the completion of \nthe Dayton peace accords. But it has never offered us a comprehensive \nreadiness and mission assessment of U.S. Contingency Operations \n(CONOPS) policy to justify the expenditure of these funds.\n  Our amendment, therefore, mandates a dual report on the ``clear and \ndistinct objectives'' that ``guide the activities of United States \nforces'' as well as the proposal of an approximate date, or set of \nconditions, ``that defines the endpoint'' of a contingency operation.\n  Congress, Mr. President, needs more constructive guidance in advance \nfrom the administration as the era of peacekeeping claims billions of \ndollars in funding that might otherwise go to core readiness and \nmodernization programs.\n  Approximately 47,880 American soldiers have undertaken 14 \ninternational contingency operations between 1991 and 1998. As a \nresult, we need to match the administration's policy arguments with its \nbudget demands to determine if the Pentagon has a clear peacekeeping \nstrategy that reflects the major security interests of the United \nStates and its allies.\n  We did not have the benefit of this policy blueprint the first time \nthat Congress approved Bosnia mission funding to monitor the Dayton \npeace accords with the FY96 budget. One year later, when the \nincremental cost of the Bosnia operation totaled $2.28 billion, we \nstill had no mission guidance.\n  For FY98, the House and Senate appropriated two packages of $1.5 \nbillion and $490 million a few months after a Presidential press \nconference that made our commitment in the Balkans open-ended.\n  And in FY99, Mr. President, the White House would not even label its \nBosnia funding request. It chose instead to place $1.86 billion in an \nambiguous ``emergency operations'' category and forced the Senate Armed \nServices Committee to move this sum into the defense budget.\n  When the Committee took this action last month, we did not know, \nafter almost a three-year deployment, the conditions that would set the \nstage for an orderly force withdrawal.\n  We did not know whether adequate stability had been achieved so that \ndiplomats and community leaders could build self-sustaining civic \ninstitutions.\n  We did not know why the administration extended the time frame of our \ndeployment three times since November 1995.\n  And we did not know, Mr. President, for how long and to what end the \nWhite House planned to keep rotating thousands of Service people in and \nout of the Bosnian vortex.\n  Were our troops creating a Bosnian security environment for political \nreconciliation, or digging deeper into a country with a peace agreement \nthat everyone signed but no one accepted?\n  The administration cannot expect either Congress or the taxpayers to \nplow billions of dollars every year into protracted peacekeeping \nexercises. Our Bosnian experience teaches us that we will achieve \nclarity of goals and accountability in financing if the President \ndevelops a strategy before he submits a funding request, not as he asks \nfor more to do what remains unclear.\n  Ironically, this amendment stipulates what the administration once \ndeclared as its own strategy. Presidential Decision Directive 25 of May \n1994 outlined the scope and purpose of the administration's contingency \noperations policy. It promised the application of strict standards to \ndetermine whether the U.S. should participate in any overseas peace \noperation. The reporting categories specified by my amendment \nintentionally overlap with the President's directive. PDD-25 \nspecifically declared that potential CONOPS commitments would depend on \n``clear objectives'' and an identifiable ``endpoint.''\n  As the new century unfolds, the need for a rational peacekeeping \npolicy, as promised by PDD-25, will only grow. The May 1997 Quadrennial \nDefense Review concluded that ``the demand for smaller-scale \ncontingency operations is expected to remain high over the next 15 to \n20 years'' while also acknowledging that peacekeeping commitments could \ncause a ``chronic erosion'' of procurement funding.\n  At the same time, the National Defense Panel, created by Congress to \nreview the guidelines of the QDR, analyzed the Pentagon's peacekeeping \npolicy as one that forces troops ``too often and too quickly'' into \ndisputes of a purely political or diplomatic character.\n  This year, the Armed Services Committee received Navy and Air Force \nPosture Statements that contained warnings of negative readiness \nimpacts from long contingency deployments. Navy Secretary Dalton \nspecifically cited the ``requirements of the Unified Commands''--those \nthat participate heavily in peacekeeping missions--as effecting the \nreadiness of non-deployed fleet units.\n  The number of Air Force personnel dedicated to contingency operations \ngrew fourfold since 1989 to 14,600 by FR97. ``Caution indicators,'' as \nthe report summarized it, have emerged in the areas of retention, \nreenlistment, and depleted inventories of spare parts.\n  In addition, by October 1999, the Army, the most peacekeeping \nintensive of the Services, could lack the heavy armored divisions \ndesigned for rapid deployment to crisis areas. Two of the divisions \nthat train full time for this mission may have one-third of their \ntroops on duty in Bosnia or Kuwait.\n  In FY94, the Army had 541,000 active duty soldiers and no commitments \nin Bosnia, and the Armed Services Committee considered this level the \nminimum necessary for effective crisis response. Yet today, the Army \nfaces the\n\n[[Page S7078]]\n\nchallenge of preparing for two Major Theater Wars, at a reduced force \nstrength of 491,000, and with a deployment in Bosnia.\n  We must act upon these warning signals from military leaders, Mr. \nPresident, by aligning the law with the new requirements placed on our \nwar fighters. It only makes common sense to mandate a contingency \noperations policy rationale with a contingency operations budget \nrequest. I therefore commend the Senate for adopting the Snowe-Cleland \namendment.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7057-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, JUNE 26, 1998\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the \nprovisions of the Department of Defense authorization bill relating to \nthe United States military mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The amendment \noffered by the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Thurmond) expresses the \nsense of the Congress that United States ground troops should not \nremain in Bosnia indefinitely. The amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire (Mr. Smith) would have required that none of the \nfunding authorized or appropriated for the Bosnia mission under this \nbill be expended after March 31, 1999, unless both Houses of Congress \nhad voted on the continued deployment of U.S. ground troops in Bosnia.\n  I supported both of these amendments because I firmly believe that it \nis of paramount importance for the Senate to go on record at every \nopportunity with respect to the U.S. mission in Bosnia. It is \nespecially important that the Senate go on record as a part of the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill, which is perhaps the most \nimportant piece of defense-related legislation that this body debates \neach year because it is the framework under which our military will be \nfunded over the next fiscal year.\n  I have opposed the Bosnia mission since its inception because I did \nnot believe then--and I do not believe now--that the Administration has \npresented a list of clear, achievable objectives and a definite exit \nstrategy to the American people. To date, taxpayers have paid more than \n$9 billion for this ill-defined mission.\n  I am pleased that the second-degree amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Arizona (Mr. McCain) to the Thurmond amendment calls upon the \nPresident to submit a report on the status of the Bosnia mission with \neach future request for additional funding for this mission. To date, \nthe Administration has repeatedly come to the Congress seeking more and \nmore money for this mission and offering little justification in \nreturn. The McCain language asks the Administration, with each \nadditional funding request, to provide specific information on the \nBosnia mission, including objectives for reaching a self-sustainable \npeace and a schedule for achieving them, and future cost and risk \nassessments involved with this mission.\n  Of course, I support our men and women in uniform and the commendable \njob they have done to help to implement the Dayton Accords and to \nachieve a lasting peace in Bosnia. What I cannot accept is the mission \ncreep and uncertainty that these men and women are forced to live with, \nand the hefty price tag the American people have been forced to pay.\n  While I supported the Thurmond amendment, I would have liked to see \nstronger language, including calling on the President to devise an exit \nstrategy that included a date certain for the transfer of chief \nresponsibility for this mission from United States forces to European \nforces. It is my firm belief that the longer U.S. troops remain in the \nregion, the harder it will be for them to leave. We must call upon our \nNATO allies to assume responsibility for this mission.\n  In the past, I have supported both a date certain for troop \nwithdrawal, and efforts to cut funding for this mission. I also have \ncome to the floor to express my concerns about the expanding nature of \nthis mission. I would also like to express again my continuing \nfrustration with the emergency designation for the funding for this \nmission, which is clearly no longer an emergency.\n  I regret that the Administration chose to deploy troops to Bosnia in \n1995 without seeking prior congressional approval. I also regret that \nthis mission has continued far past its original one-year time frame, \nand that our troops have been asked once again to continue down an \nuncertain path toward an ill-defined goal. In December 1997, the \nPresident abandoned the purported June 1998 exit date and replaced it \nwith a series of so-called ``benchmarks'' for U.S. withdrawal. Today, \non the 25th day of June 1998, the end of this mission is nowhere in \nsight. I hope that the Administration will hear clearly the sentiments \nexpressed by the Senate through the Thurmond amendment, which has been \nadopted overwhelmingly by this body.\n\n\n              prohibition on expansion of sale of alcohol\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate adopted the \namendment I submitted to S. 2057 that puts the Senate on record in \nopposition to the attempt being made to increase the number of military \nstores that sell wine and beer. Although alcohol is available for sale \non military bases, it is not for sale in the commissary stores along \nwith the groceries. Specifically, my amendment would prohibit the \nSecretary of Defense from conducting a survey of commissary patrons to \ndetermine whether or not they would support the sale of beer and wine \nin commissaries. In addition, the amendment would prohibit a \ndemonstration project to evaluate the merit of selling wine and beer in \ncommissary stores at exchange store prices. Mr. President, that is the \nwrong direction in which to take our military. We should be trying to \ndeglamorize alcohol, not taking steps that tend to promote its use. An \nexpansion of accessibility will likely lead to an increase in the \nmilitary of all the problems that go hand and hand with alcohol use in \ncivilian life; the negative health consequences, the loss of \nproductivity, the cost to society, the increase in violence and crime, \nand the increase in sexually transmitted diseases. Why in the world \nwould we want\n\n[[Page S7082]]\n\nto embrace such a policy as expansion of access to alcohol as official \ngovernment policy! Life in the military already has its share of \nstress--long hours, a rigid hierarchy of command, constant training, \ntravel, and long deployments overseas. Let us not expand the \nopportunities to pour more fuel on any smoldering embers of alcohol \nabuse in our population and add to these stresses and strains. Let us \nkeep our soldiers fit and sober, clear-headed and ready to defend our \nnational security interests, and hope that such a policy sets an \nexample which other entities in our society will embrace.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the 1999 Defense Authorization bill \nbefore us contains a demonstration project that would allow some DoD-\neligible retirees to join FEHBP plans, under a separate risk pool. It \nis my understanding that this ensures that DoD retirees who enroll in \nthis demonstration project are able to choose from competing, private \nsector FEHBP plans. It is also my understanding that retirees, like \nother FEHBP-eligibles, will be able to choose among plans that offer \nfully integrated health care benefits that use market-based competition \nto control cost and improve quality of care.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Yes, we fully expect that OPM and DoD will conduct a \ndemonstration project that provides military retirees with the same \nhealth care services provided through the same private sector delivery \nsystems that serve today's FEHBP beneficiaries.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chairman. I appreciate this clarification \nand I look forward to evaluating the success of the FEHBP demonstration \nalong with the two other demonstration projects included in this bill.\n\n\n                   Y-12 plant in oak ridge, tennessee\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I know the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee \nagrees with me that nuclear deterrence is the cornerstone of our \nnational defense policy, and we should do everything we can to maintain \na strong, viable nuclear deterrent in this country. This requires a \nrobust nuclear weapons program, the ability to ensure that our weapons \nare both safe and reliable, and the ability to remanufacture any \ncomponent of any weapon in the stockpile at any given time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. The Senator from Tennessee is correct. We must preserve \nour capability to manufacture weapons and weapons components, and we \nmust maintain ongoing weapons surveillance and assessment activities. \nThe four weapons production plants--including the Y-12 plant in the \nSenator's home state of Tennessee--are key to achieving these goals.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. As the Chairman knows, production activities at Y-12 \nwere placed in a stand down mode on September 22, 1994, due to \nprocedural and criticality safety concerns identified by the Defense \nNuclear Safety Board. Since then, Y-12 has made significant progress \nimproving its operations throughout the plant. Since the stand down, Y-\n12 personnel have worked tirelessly to restart operations in the \nfollowing mission areas: Receipt and Shipment, Disassembly and Storage \nOperations, Depleted Uranium Operations, and Stockpile Surveillance, \nwhile continuing to meet all defense mission requirements.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I agree with the Senator that the staff of Y-12 have \nworked hard to bring operations back up to full speed. I was very \npleased to see that, earlier this month, Y-12 resumed the last of its \nproduction missions: Enriched Uranium Operations.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. The Chairman is correct. On June 8, 1998, Y-12 cast its \nfirst enriched uranium part since September, 1994. This achievement is \na credit to the dedication and commitment of everyone at Y-12, and is a \ntestament to the leadership and management expertise of Lockheed Martin \nand their teammates at the Department of Energy. It is also critically \nimportant to our national security, because Y-12 operations are crucial \nto the success of our Stockpile Life Extension Program. In fact, Y-12 \nis currently involved in the life extension program for the Peacekeeper \nMissile warhead, called the W87. Initial delivery of key components of \nthis weapon are due at the end of this year, and manufacturing will \ncontinue for several years.\n  I am very pleased that operations at Y-12 are up and running again, \nso that these critical national security missions can continue on \nschedule and uninterrupted. In that vein, I want to express my concern \nabout any action on the Department of Energy's part that would disrupt \nthe progress that has been made at Y-12 and jeopardize the timely \ncompletion of this very important Stockpile Life Extension project.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I share the Senator's concern, and I urge the \nDepartment to make every effort not to disrupt the tremendous progress \nthat has been made at Y-12. The production activities taking place at \nthe plant are a critical component of our national security policy.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                          dod teacher quality\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. When the Armed Services Committee met to mark up the FY \n1999 Defense Authorization bill, I introduced a measure designed to \nencourage the Department of Defense schools to assure the high quality \nof its faculty in DoD schools. Senator Coats and I have discussed ways \nto improve the proposal and have agreed on words that we believe would \nbe appropriate to include in the Conference report on the Defense \nAuthorization bill.\n  Mr. COATS. That's correct, Senator Bingaman. I believe the words we \nhave agreed to here will encourage the Department to emphasize hiring \nhigh quality instructors for the Department's schools. In my view, the \nmost appropriate vehicle at this point to incorporate this initiative \nin the defense bill is to seek a provision in the Conference report. \nSenator Thurmond, would you assist our efforts to do so during the \nupcoming conference?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I appreciate your efforts to assure continued high \nquality education in Department of Defense schools and I'll work to see \nthat the provision you seek is adopted in conference.\n\n\n                        counternarcotics mission\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in 1989, President George Bush called \ndrugs ``the gravest domestic threat facing our nation today.'' Almost \nnine years later, that threat still exists.\n  That same year, President Bush tasked the Defense Department to play \nan important role in the drug war. Specifically, the Defense Department \nwas tasked to engage in the detection and monitoring of drugs in \ntransit towards the United States. At that time, counter narcotics, and \ndrug interdiction were key components of our nation's drug control \nstrategy. As a member of the House of Representatives at that time, I \ncan recall very well the investments we dedicated toward the \ninternational and interdiction components of the war on drugs. These \ninvestments made a difference. We made a dent in the drug industry. The \nprice of cocaine increased. Drug use declined significantly.\n  That was 1989. In 1992, the focus and the level of commitment toward \na comprehensive drug control strategy has diminished. The drug threat \nis as strong as ever, but the same cannot be said for our drug \ninterdiction efforts. It's not just a case of fewer resources, it's a \ncase of diminished priorities. In fact, in its list of priorities, the \nDefense Department currently ranks counter-narcotics dead last in its \nmission statement.\n  This is an unfortunate mistake.\n  Mr. President, it's time we re-ordered our priorities. That is why \nlast week, my friend and colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, myself \nand Senator Grassley and Senator Helms, introduced an amendment to the \nDefense Authorization bill. This amendment, which was adopted by the \nSenate last week, simply states that a higher priority should be given \nwithin the Defense Department to drug interdiction and counterdrug \nactivities. Specifically, our drug control mission should be ranked at \nthe same level as our peacekeeping operations. I thank my colleagues \nfor accepting my amendment by unanimous consent. It is my hope that the \nfinal bill will contain similar language.\n  The facts bring us to no other conclusion--it's time to make drug \ninterdiction a priority again. In 1988, close to 2 million adolescent \nAmericans were drug users, and by 1992, that number was down by 25%. At \nthat time, we had a balanced drug control strategy--with sufficient \ninvestments in the key components: interdiction, treatment, education \nand law enforcement. During\n\n[[Page S7083]]\n\nthat same period, marijuana use dropped by over 16 percent and cocaine \nuse was down 35 percent. Our efforts were concentrated and effective--\nwith inspiring results.\n  Mr. President, that progress ceased in 1992, and since that time, \nteenage drug use has more than doubled--and the ramifications have been \nfar-reaching. For example, drug-abuse related arrests for those under \nthe age of 18 in 1996 were twice those of 1992. Health costs continue \nto rise as this plague spreads uncontrollably.\n  Youth drug use is on the rise because drugs have increasingly become \nboth more available and more affordable. The Office of National Drug \nControl Policy has reported that small ``pieces'' or ``rocks'' of \ncrack, once sold for ten to twenty dollars, are now available for three \nto five dollars. The street price of drugs is decreasing and our \nefforts to limit their supply are failing.\n  Mr. President, this increase in illicit drug use can be traced in \npart to the decline in counter-narcotics as a priority for national \ndefense policy. In 1992, Department of Defense funding for counter-\nnarcotics activities in transit areas was over $500 million. A steady \ntrend in decreased funding brought it down to an all-time low of $214 \nmillion in 1995. Mr. President, that is more than a 50% decrease in \nfunds. Thankfully, due to efforts by my Senate and House colleagues, \nlast year's allocation was increased to $300 million. However, we are \nnowhere near the 1992 levels.\n  In recent years, the Department of Defense has been called upon to \nsupport counter narcotics activities in transit areas in the Caribbean. \nHowever, assets critical to the drug interdiction effort have been \nconsistently diverted to matters considered a ``higher priority.''\n  Mr. President, this decrease in funding has had an unfortunate impact \non our drug interdiction efforts in the Caribbean. For example, the \nnumber of days per year that our ships spend patrolling the Caribbean \nhas shrunk by two-thirds. Some of our key interdiction agencies have \nreported that the ships and manpower needed for effective interdiction \nare unavailable. Also, there radar system is less extensive--and even \nif drug traffickers can be identified, we lack the manpower necessary \nto intercept and seize the illegal drug imports. In 1996, only half of \nthe known maritime drug events detected resulted in apprehension or \nseizure. Our defenses are down and the drug lords are taking advantage \nof this weakness. Added to this decline in resources is the increase in \nmore sophisticated resources utilized by the drug cartels.\n  According to the State Department, about 760 metric tons of cocaine \nwere produced in South America in 1996. Of that, 608 tons were destined \nfor the United States through the transit zone. U.S. government \nagencies that deal with cocaine seizures indicated that with additional \nequipment, annual cocaine seizures can be significantly increased. The \nDepartment of Defense, however, has indicated that it will not be able \nto provide these additional assets because of other priorities.\n  Mr. President, this attitude was not acceptable in the late 1980's \nand it should not be acceptable now. It is necessary that we once again \nimplement an effective transit zone operation as an integral measure to \nlimit the availability of illicit drugs to our youth.\n  It is time to renew drug interdiction efforts, provide the necessary \nequipment to our drug-enforcement agencies, and make the issue a \ndefense priority again. I thank my colleagues for supporting this \namendment and helping turn the tide of the drug crisis in our country.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss language in the \nDoD authorization report contained in the ``Additional Matters of \nInterest'' section. The language in the DoD Authorization targets an \namendment Senator Wyden and I were able to get accepted during the \nSuperfund markup.\n  Earlier this year the EPW Committee marked up S. 8, which if passed \nand signed into law would significantly improve the Superfund program. \nAt markup Senator Wyden and I proposed an amendment clarifying the \nwaiver of sovereign immunity currently contained in Section 120 of \nSuperfund. A waiver of sovereign immunity basically allows private \nparties and state and local governments to bring suit against the \nfederal government for noncompliance.\n  This original waiver was added in 1986 when Superfund was last \nreformed and was accepted with broad bipartisan support. The intent of \nSection 120 is clear and unambiguous to those who research the \nlegislative history and read it faithfully. The words are plain and \nthey read: ``Each department, agency, and instrumentality of the United \nStates (including the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of \ngovernment) shall be subject to, and comply with, this chapter in the \nsame manner and to the same extent, both procedurally and \nsubstantively, as any nongovernmental entity, including liability under \nsection 9607 of this title.''\n  My reading of this is that the federal government needs to comply \nwith the law just like any private party or state or local entity.\n  As Senator Stafford said during passage of the 1986 Superfund \namendments, ``. . . the legislation recognizes the reality that, only \nin unusual cases, th[at] national security may require issuance of \ncircumscribed Executive orders exempting a Federal facility from the \nrequirements of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of \n1986. In all such cases, Executive orders should adopt the method of \nprotecting legitimate national security interests that maximize \ncompliance with the environmental and health requirements imposed by \nthe legislation. For example, it may be appropriate to require EPA \nemployees reviewing cleanup plans [to] obtain a national security \nclearance, but it would not be appropriate to exempt such plans from \nnational cleanup standards simply because EPA employees are assigned to \nascertain what standards should apply to the cleanup.'' However, the \nlanguage in the '86 Amendments was not exact enough and wiggle room was \nleft for the Federal government to avoid their environmental \nresponsibilities. Unfortunately, even though our amendment is merely \nclarifying, some in the Senate would like to maintain dual cleanup \nstandards, one for those who live near a private National Priority List \n(NPL) site and another for those who live near an NPL site the federal \ngovernment has responsibility over. Simply put, that should not be \nhappening.\n  The Armed Services Committee has expressed concern with our Amendment \nand has even gone so far as to include report language in their bill \ncommenting on legal language in another bill. Further they have asked \nfor a study on the cost of our amendment.\n  I provide the above background as context for my reply to the \nCommittee's characterization of our amendment to S. 8. In their report \nthe Armed Services Committee made several claims with which I disagree. \nThey also make claims which can be disputed which are outlined below:\n  (1) the report states that, ``[t]he amendment would require federal \nfacilities to comply with state and local substantive and procedural \nrequirements, rather than the uniform, national process described in \nthe National Contingency Plan.'' The implication is that federal \nfacilities would no longer be subject to the National Contingency Plan \n(NCP) and that all cleanups would be done pursuant to state and local \nlaw. That is not the case. What our amendment in Committee simply did \nwas allow state, local, and to some extent EPA the authority to enforce \ncompliance with current Superfund and similar State and local laws. \nEnforce the current Superfund law including its implementing \nregulations, the NCP, and similar state and local laws against federal \nfacilities just as they would against private parties. I have attempted \nto make this point clear in the past and I will attempt to do so once \nagain, this amendment would ensure that Federal entities are held to \nthe same standard of compliance as local, state, and private parties. \nNothing more, nothing less.\n\n  (2) The report also states that, ``[u]nder current law, Federal \nfacilities are already subject to state laws concerning removal and \nremedial action, including laws regarding enforcement (42 U.S.C. \n9620(a)(4)), but state challenges must be brought after remedial action \nis complete. (42 U.S.C. 9613 (g))[sic]'' The Federal government has not \nfollowed this section of law faithfully, in reality they have argued \nthat it merely requires them to comply with\n\n[[Page S7084]]\n\nsubstantive sections of the law, for example, Applicable or Relevant \nand Appropriate Requirements (ARAR's). As evidence of this is a letter \nfrom the Chief Counsel for the National Guard Bureau on September 13, \n1996 to Assistant Attorney General Steve Shackman, regarding Duluth Air \nForce Base State Superfund Site. In this letter Mr. Hise asserts that, \n``[c]ompliance with a state CERCLA law's substantive requirements, via \nthe ARAR's process [which includes provisions to waive ARAR's], \nfulfills CERCLA's legal requirements.''\n  To state it once again, my concern is that, even though the report \nasserts that States can take action under 113(h) after remedial action \nis complete the federal polluters do not acknowledge this section means \nwhat it says. Instead, they maintain it only requires them to comply \nwith state standards as ARARs. In fact, the only case in this area, \nU.S. versus Colorado, held that the federal government could not escape \nregulation under an authorized state RCRA program merely by listing on \nthe NPL. Clearly, clarification is necessary that Congress intended all \nfederal agencies to comply with this law in substance and procedure.\n  Beyond the merely incorrect statements in the report there is a \nfundamental difference in philosophy. In my view the Federal government \nneeds to be held to the same standard as any other entity. If we are \ngoing to have a Federal Superfund law then it should apply to everyone. \nIn other words everyone needs to be in the same bath tub with the same \nscrub brush. I believe this was true when we made all laws applicable \nto Congress and believe we need to make at the least this law \napplicable to all Federal agencies.\n  When I proposed this amendment in Committee it was claimed that it \nwould cost the government too much money. In fact, if we examine what \nhas occurred under RCRA, which has had the same language in effect \nsince 1992, the conclusion is the opposite. A study done by the EPA \nentitled, The Federal Facility Compliance Act: Enforcement Analysis of \nRCRA Administrative Orders at Federal Facilities indicates that State \ngovernments have been easier on the Federal government than the EPA. \nThe study found the following: while Federal orders averaged 369 days \nbefore settlement, state orders averaged 196. Also, during the study \nperiod the EPA fined Federal facilities over $9 million while states \nfined Federal facilities only slightly over $4 million. In other words \nthose who claim the states will gold plate remedies have no basis for \nthat belief.\n  Finally, I note that the Armed Services Committee has asked for a \nstudy which is due at the end of September outlining the additional \npotential liability a Superfund waiver would incur. I'm not opposed to \nsuch a study but I am sending a letter to the President's Council on \nEnvironmental Quality bringing it to their attention and asking them to \noversee the collection of the data. I am certain that the authors of \nthe amendment wouldn't object to such oversight which would avoid the \nperception of the fox guarding the chicken house.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the National Defense \nAuthorization Bill for Fiscal Year 1999. The need for a strong and \ncapable military was clearly demonstrated during the Iraqi crisis over \nthe UN-mandated inspections. Our forward-deployed forces were quickly \nstrengthened by additional personnel as the crisis deepened. The \ndiplomacy of United Nations Secretary General Khofi Annan, backed up by \nthe credible, on-scene forces of the United States Armed Forces, \nsuccessfully kept the peace.\n  This bill provides the proper support for our military forces while \nmaintaining a realistic balance between readiness to take care of \nimmediate needs, and the needed investment to develop and procure new \nsystems for the future.\n  The bill provides for those who serve in uniform today, and those who \ngave this country so much during their careers in military service. A \nfully funded and well-deserved 3.1% pay raise for military personnel is \nincluded in the bill.\n  Additionally, the bill includes a provision for the Department of \nDefense to initiate a comprehensive test plan to evaluate the best way \nfor us to provide health care to retired military personnel and their \nfamilies who have reached the age of 65. The plan will build on the \nMedicare test program included in last year's Bipartisan Budget \nAgreement. The new expanded plan will include test sites for \nparticipation in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, the \nDepartment of Defense's Tricare health care program, and a mail order \npharmacy program to reduce out-of-pocket costs.\n  The daily operations of our military forces have obvious risks and \ndangers. All branches of the Armed Forces have made progress in \nimproving safety in the military, but more remains to be done. I \ncommend the Department of Defense for its accelerated installation of \nneeded additional safety systems on military aircraft that carry \npassengers.\n  This bill also includes a worthwhile provision to evaluate the way \nthe Pentagon investigates aviation accidents. We must ensure that no \nstone is left unturned in finding the cause of every accident and \ntaking the necessary corrective action to reduce the risk of future \naccidents.\n  The growing frequency and sophistication of attacks on the Pentagon's \ncomputer networks highlight the need for improved protection of \ncritical network infrastructures. This bill includes research and \ndevelopment funding for the exploration and development of defenses \nagainst cyber attacks. This step will greatly improve the Pentagon's \nfocus on this growing threat.\n  In the past eight years, the Navy-Marine Corps team has responded to \nover 90 contingencies--almost one per month. As the Ranking Democrat on \nthe Seapower Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, I am pleased \nthat the bill provides the support necessary for our naval forces as \nthey modernize to meet the challenges of tomorrow.\n  The bill includes the necessary advance procurement funding for \nFiscal Year 1999 for the Navy's next aircraft carrier, CVN-77. The \nNavy's procurement schedule for the next carrier, revised from its \nbudget submission of last year, will be under the cost cap mandated in \nlast year's defense bill. Also, much of the new technology being \ndeveloped for the next generation aircraft carrier, the CVX, will be \nincluded in CVN-77.\n  The budget request for the Navy's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the \nMarine Corps' MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft is fully funded. The \nSuper Hornet combines the outstanding characteristics of earlier F/A-18 \nmodels with cutting edge technology in an affordable aircraft with \nsignificantly improved performance and endurance. The MV-22 Osprey is a \nvertical take-off and landing aircraft designed to replace the Marine \nCorps' aging fleet of CH-46 and CH-53 helicopters.\n  In contrast to these aspects of this bill, I do have concerns about \nreductions in the Administration's budget request for the Cooperative \nThreat Reduction Program, demilitarization of chemical weapons, and the \nnuclear weapon stockpile stewardship program. I hope that these \nreductions will be corrected in the final bill.\n  The Cooperative Threat Reduction program is the most cost-effective \nprogram for reducing the dangers of nuclear weapons. Thousands of \nnuclear warheads remain in the nations of the former Soviet Union. The \nCooperative Threat Reduction program plays a key role in the control \nand dismantling of these weapons. We must continue this all-important \nprogram and ensure that every single nuclear warhead is secure, and \neventually destroyed.\n  Funding reductions in the chemical weapons de-militarization program \nwill endanger our ability to comply with the provisions of the Chemical \nWeapons Conventions Treaty approved last year. As a world leader and \nthe only superpower, we have an obligation to lead the worldwide effort \nto eliminate chemical weapons. I urge the restoration of these funds.\n  All of us have grave concerns over the recent nuclear testing in \nIndia. Russia and the United States continue to work hard to reduce the \nworld's stockpile of nuclear weapons. India and other nations must also \nbe involved in the reduction and eventual elimination of all nuclear \nweapons.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a major milestone on the road to \na nuclear free world. A cornerstone of the implementation of this \ntreaty is the Department of Energy's Stockpile Stewardship Program. We \nmust be able\n\n[[Page S7085]]\n\nto certify that our remaining stockpile of nuclear weapons is reliable, \nwhile reducing the number of nuclear weapons through START II and, \nhopefully, a START III treaty.\n  The Stockpile Stewardship Program is the key component in \nverification of the reliability of our nuclear weapons. The program has \nexperienced a fundamental shift in policy since the United States \nceased live testing of nuclear weapons. The Department of Energy is \ndeveloping new capabilities to complete this certification without live \ntesting of nuclear weapons. The funding cuts in the budget request will \nhinder these efforts. I urge the restoration of these funds to the \nStockpile Stewardship Program.\n  In closing, I welcome the opportunity to commend the distinguished \nservices of the members of the Committee, particularly the \nextraordinary services of the three members who will be leaving the \nSenate at the end of this Congress. Their efforts have added \nsignificantly to this year's Defense Authorization bill. The Airland \nSubcommittee has benefited from the efforts and insights of Senator \nGlenn and Senator Coats. Senator Kempthorne's able leadership of the \nPersonnel Subcommittee has ensured that the needs of our service men \nand women are paramount in this legislation. It has been a privilege to \nwork with these able members of the Committee over the years, and we \nwill miss their leadership in the years ahead.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the \nadmirable work of the Senate Armed Services Committee. For the past two \nyears, we have had budget agreements that have forced the Committee to \nmake tough choices with shrinking resources. Under the able leadership \nof Chairman Thurmond and the Ranking Member, Senator Levin, the \nCommittee has once again enhanced the quality of life for our brave men \nand women in uniform and have invested in programs vital to our future \nfighting forces. As the Ranking Member on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, I am constantly reminded of how vital a strong military is \nto protecting American interests and security around the world. I have \nsaid it before and I'll say it again, for diplomacy to be effective, \nnot only must it be adequately funded, it must also be backed by a \nstrong military and superior intelligence activities.\n  But, Mr. President, before I say any more about this bill, I want to \nsay a word or two about Chairman Thurmond. His service to this nation \nhas been truly remarkable. From the beaches of Normandy to the halls of \nthe U.S. Senate, he has shown an outstanding dedication and commitment \nto doing the work of this nation. He and I worked together on the \nJudiciary Committee for 12 years--he was Chairman for the first 6 years \nand I was Chairman for the last 6. Then, as now, he has been a leader \nby example. He is one of the most remarkable individuals I have ever \nhad the privilege of working with. We are not merely colleagues, we are \nfriends.\n  He has served on the Armed Services Committee for 40 years, the last \n4 of which he has been its Chairman. This is his last year as Chairman, \nso I want to say now what deep respect I have for the Senior Senator \nfrom South Carolina's military expertise and for the able manner in \nwhich he has worked with Senator Levin to keep our military strong. The \nCommittee, the Senate, and the American people have gained from Senator \nThurmond's leadership and his willingness to work with Senators from \nboth parties to put America's national security interests ahead of \npartisan interests.\n  This bill is an example of that. It includes a 3.1 percent pay raise \nfor military personnel. It also includes an important increase in \nhazardous duty incentive pay for mid- and senior level air crew \npersonnel. I thank my colleagues for joining me in addressing that \nconcern and showing these experienced personnel that we value their \nunique and vital contribution to America's national interest.\n  In addition, there is an important $12 million increase in C-5 \nairlift squadrons research and development. This money is critically \nneeded by the Air Force to examine the needs of these crucial aircraft \nas new technology becomes available to improve their performance. As \nmany already know, the C-5 is capable of carrying more cargo than any \nother aircraft in our military. It has supported military operations \nfrom Vietnam to Desert Storm to the current operations in Bosnia and \nthe Persian Gulf. I applaud the Committee's foresight in providing the \nmoney necessary to maintain these planes at peak performance levels.\n  Mr. President, I also want to take a minute to talk about the health \ncare demonstration programs in this bill. With the growth in the number \nof retired military personnel, the rising costs of health care in \ngeneral, and the closing of military bases, great strains have been \nplaced on military medical facilities. This, in turn, has placed in \nsome jeopardy the idea of guaranteeing high quality health care to our \nmilitary retirees.\n  Last year, Congress recognized this growing problem, and we took a \nstep in fixing it. Last year's Defense Authorization bill included a \ndemonstration project on Medicare subvention--where Medicare reimburses \nmilitary medical facilities for the treatment of retirees who are also \neligible for Medicare. I am pleased that the Dover Air Force Base in \nDelaware has been selected as one of the six sites for this national \ndemonstration project.\n  Again, this was a first step. But, there are other ways that might \nhelp us to fulfil our commitment to military retirees. And, so I \nstrongly support the three additional health care demonstration \nprojects in this bill--one to allow military retirees to participate in \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Program once they reach age 65; \none to allow retirees to continue their eligibility for TRICARE and not \nhave to switch to Medicare when they turn 65; and one to allow military \nretirees who are also eligible for Medicare to continue to participate \nin the Department of Defense's mail order pharmacy program.\n  Providing health care is an obligation we owe to our military \nretirees. It is a promise we made--but a promise that is now in \njeopardy. The health care demonstration projects in this bill will not \nsolve the problem we face. They are, after all, only demonstrations. \nBut, hopefully, they--along with last year's Medicare subvention \ndemonstration project--will help point the way to a solution so we can \nensure that the federal government upholds its commitment to the men \nand women who so bravely served our country.\n  Mr. President, this bill includes an amendment that I joined with \nfour colleagues in voting against yesterday. It was a compromise Sense \nof Congress resolution offered by Senator Levin, Senator Coats, and \nSenator Thurmond, regarding budgeting for continued participation of \nUnited States forces in NATO operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  The three cosponsors deserve credit for their hard work in having \ncrafted what was, in the main, a very well thought out amendment. It \ncontained several positive elements. And their compromise amendment was \nfar preferable, in my opinion, to another amendment on U.S. forces in \nBosnia, which Senator Hutchison and Senator Byrd were considering \nintroducing.\n  Nonetheless, I voted against the compromise amendment, and I would \nlike briefly to explain the reasoning behind my vote.\n  First, I agree with the amendment's intent to keep the pressure on \nour European allies to constitute the bulk of ground forces in the \nStabilization Force, known popularly as SFOR. I want to clarify, \nhowever, that non-American forces already make up approximately three-\nquarters of the SFOR total.\n  Second, I am in complete agreement with the amendment's not giving a \ndate-certain for the withdrawal of United States ground combat forces \nfrom Bosnia and Herzegovina. Such a date-certain would constitute the \nworst kind of micro-management of military affairs by the Congress, and \nwould quite likely endanger the lives of American troops on the ground.\n  My principal reason for voting against the compromise amendment is \nthat I do not agree that our goal should be a withdrawal of all United \nStates ground combat forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina as long as a \nNATO-led stabilization force remains in that country.\n  To be perfectly candid, Mr. President, I believe that such a move \nwould serve to undermine American leadership in NATO. Even Combined \nJoint\n\n[[Page S7086]]\n\nTask Forces, commonly known by their CJTF acronym, should, unless there \nare exceptional circumstances, have a U.S. ground combat force \ncomponent. While American air, naval, command and control, logistical, \nand intelligence support, and even a ready reserve over-the-horizon \nforce in the region would be vital to any future mission, the \nparticipation of some American combat ground forces will remain a vital \nbona fide of U.S. commitment to Alliance operations.\n  In other words, for the United States to retain control of NATO-led \noperations, we must be present in all components of missions, including \non the ground. This would apply to any follow-on force in Bosnia, \nwhether it is NATO-led or is a CJTF with the Western European Union.\n  Let me pose a question to my colleagues. If the Bosnia ground \noperation becomes a purely European affair, do they not think that \npretty soon some of our European allies will begin to question whether \nan American should continue to serve as Supreme Allied Commander Europe \n(SACEUR)?\n  I for one think the answer is yes. The compromise amendment, against \nwhich I voted, may, I fear, begin to set in motion a process that will \nseverely erode American leadership in NATO.\n  Lest anyone thinks that my fears are far-fetched, I would remind my \ncolleagues that France has already called for a European to take over \ncommand of Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH) in Naples and that \ninitially the French were supported by several other European allies.\n  Keeping a contingent of U.S. ground combat troops in all NATO and \nNATO-led missions is a powerful symbol of American leadership and is \nrecognized as such by allies and potential foes alike. We should think \nlong and hard before advocating a change in that policy.\n  Mr. President, I will conclude where I began. I compliment the \nmanagers of this bill and the Armed Services Committee for providing a \nbill that continues to strengthen our nation's national security. It \nenhances the quality of life of our loyal and dedicated men and women \nin uniform. It addresses important weapons systems needs and takes \nsteps toward finding the best way to meet our health care obligations. \nWhile I disagree with the Bosnia provision added for the reasons I've \nalready mentioned, I think this bill gives America the strong military \nit needs to support our diplomatic work and to promote our national \nsecurity interests.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, every year I come down to the floor of the \nSenate and ruminate over the propensity of Members of Congress to add \nprograms to spending bills solely, or at least primarily, for parochial \nreasons. The majority of us in Congress who supported the line-item \nveto were ostensibly doing so as an overdue reaction to the profligate \nspending practices that, over time, resulted in a $5.5 trillion federal \ndeficit. The fact that we have a balanced budget for the first time \nsince 1969 should not detract from the fact that we continue, as a \nresult of past spending practices, to pay as much per year in interest \non the federal debt as we do for national defense.\n  The practice of adding programs to spending bills for parochial \nreasons has not abated, as a review of the ISTEA legislation reminds \nus. For many of us in the Senate, however, there has been a growing \nconsensus that inadequate resources are being allocated for national \ndefense, and that the financial burden associated with foreign \noperations like those in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, the funding for \nwhich is repeatedly ignored in Administration preparation of annual \nbudget submissions, is seriously exacerbating readiness and \nmodernization problems stemming from the combination of shrinking force \nstructure and expanding commitments. When the stress from these \nconflicting trends is combined with the fact that no funding was added \nby Congress to the national defense portion of the federal budget for \nthe first time since President Clinton took office, the seeds of a \nfurther, serious degradation in the state of our Armed Forces are \nfirmly planted.\n  Because Congress did not add to the Administration's request for \nnational defense, it would have seemed to be incumbent upon Members to \nact with a modicum of responsibility and not perpetuate funding \nproblems with a business as usual approach. Unfortunately, we have once \nagain failed to live up to that relatively minor expectation. The bill \nbefore us is one more example of why the President's failure to \nadequately exercise his line-item veto authority last year has provided \nMembers every incentive to manipulate the budget process for the good \nof individual districts or states and, often, at the expense of what is \nbest for the Armed Forces.\n  In my remarks last year, I was highly critical of the politicization \nof the services' unfunded priorities lists. That concern remains to \nsome degree. My comments today include items that were added to the \nAdministration's request and are on the unfunded priorities list both \nbecause of my concerns about the integrity of the process through which \nthose lists are produced and because the lists were always submitted in \nthe past within the context of congressionally-implemented additions to \nthe defense budget. As additions to the budget request this year had to \nbe offset within the 050 account, I have included projects added by \nMembers even if they are on the lists because, in some instances, they \nare displacing funding from higher priority programs.\n  I commend the chairman of the Acquisition and Technology Subcommittee \nfor his valiant effort at minimizing the usual considerable damage to \nscience and technology programs that are the seed corn of our future. \nSenator Santorum deserves credit for the manner in which he has \nbalanced the need to preserve high priority science and technology \nspending with the usual onslaught of frivolous pet projects inserted \ninto the budget to mollify this university or that laboratory. It is \nunfortunate that he could not be spared the onerous and wasteful task \nof nevertheless finding funding for a number of highly questionable \nprojects. Spending $1.5 million to study the effects on missile \ncomponents of high frequency vibrations sounds reasonable. The only \nproblem is, we have been studying that issue with regard to every \nmissile and rocket designed since the dawn of the missile age. It is \ninclusive in the development of every such weapon system. This is not a \nbetter mousetrap; it s a classic waste of scarce resources.\n  Similarly, the $3 million added to the budget for research into \nstainless steel double hull technologies ignores the fact that \nprivately-owned shipyards seeking to profit from the oil pollution act, \nwhich mandated that all future oil tankers be double hulled, have \nalready conducted ample research into that area with financial \nincentives courtesy of the Title XI loan guarantee program. \nAdditionally, what can the Navy learn from this project that it doesn't \nalready know from its years of experience with high strength, light \nweight steels such as are used in the construction of submarines? Mr. \nChairman, this is precisely the type of spending the majority party was \nsupposed to oppose--the kind that helped create a huge federal deficit \nwhile diverting funding from higher priority programs.\n  No better example of Congress operating at its fiscal worst exists \nthan the inclusion in the budget of more C-130J aircraft. The Air Force \nhas repeatedly emphasized its huge surplus of C-130s, yet is forced to \nbuy more completely irrespective of requirements and funding \npriorities. The annual addition to the defense budget of C-130Js--and \nwe are buying enough of them to house the homeless in brand-new \nfuselages--is fiscally irresponsible in the extreme. To see four new \naircraft added to the bill when the accompanying report is highly \ncritical of the C-130J due to cost overruns and developmental problems \nsets a new standard for absurdity. What if we said, ``we don't need the \nSergeant York air defense gun, it was a developmental nightmare, we \ncan't afford it, it was canceled by the Reagan Administration, so let's \nadd the purchase of some to this budget?'' It would be the only thing \nmore incomprehensible than the continued acquisition of unrequested C-\n130s.\n  Lest anyone think that I exaggerate the budgetary impact of \npurchasing four unrequested, unneeded C-130J airframes, consider this: \nThe cost of those aircraft is over $200 million. That is a lot of money \nat a time when we are struggling to pay for important quality of life \nprograms and maintain readiness. Yet, this is not even the most\n\n[[Page S7087]]\n\negregious example of unnecessary, unrequested spending in the budget. \nThis bill also includes a $50 million down payment on a $1.5 billion \namphibious assault ship that was not requested by the Navy.\n  The defense authorization and appropriations bills cannot continue to \nbe the vehicle for pumping tax dollars into favored districts and \nstates. There are $2.5 billion in Member-adds in this bill, a bill, to \nreiterate, that did not enjoy an increase in its top line. That means \nthat the funding for these programs had to be found within the Defense \nDepartment s request. It means that the priorities of the military were \nignored in favor of channeling dollars toward projects of low or \nnonexistent priority. How much more should we provide to the flat panel \ndisplay industry, which should be funding its own research? With all \ndue respect to Norway, a NATO ally, how long are we going to allow it \nto leverage its weapons purchases from the United States against our \npurchase of Penguin missiles, which the Navy has not requested?\n  Mr. President, there are a number of programs inserted into the \nbudget by Members of Congress that bear little or no relation to the \nmission of providing for the common defense. There are programs that \narguably will, over time, contribute to our national security. I \nfurther recognize that Congress does not exist to perfunctorily bless \nwhatever recommendations emerge from the federal agencies we are tasked \nto oversee. The Constitution of the United States vests Congress with \nthe authority to raise and support Armies. That is a responsibility \nsome of us take very seriously. The practice of adding and earmarking \nfunding for programs and activities that marginally contribute to the \nnational defense in order to protect jobs, however, represents an abuse \nof that authority we should not countenance. We should take no pride in \nthe fact that the Army was forced to accept the National Automotive \nCenter as the focal point for the development of automotive technology. \nWhy should the public not think the worst of us when they see their tax \ndollars handled so cavalierly?\n  These statements, which I make on every spending bill, get tiresome \nafter a while. My colleagues don't like to hear them, and I certainly \ndon't win any popularity contests on account of them. I would like to \nwax poetic about charging windmills, but I am under no illusions that \nmy Dulcinea waits outside the chamber or that a final reward awaits me \nin the great beyond. All I ask is for it to stop. Adding ships, planes, \nhelicopters and the usual myriad of arcane research and development \nprojects to a defense bill at a time when the state of the Armed Forces \ncontinues to suffer from high operational rates and contracting force \nstructure, when we struggle to provide military retirees the medical \ncare they were promised when they enlisted, when the services are \nrepeatedly telling us that they don't need what we insist they buy, \ndoes not speak well of Congress as an institution. I urge my colleagues \nto heed the warning not of me, but of the combatant commanders and the \nmen and women in the field who are tired and leaving the military \nbecause we cannot get our priorities in order.\n  Mr. President, I will keep coming to the floor to rail against \nwasteful federal spending because I believe it is warranted, and not \njust a little cathartic. I thank you for indulging me once again and I \nask unanimous consent that this list of programs added to the budget, \nmost for the kind of questionable reasons to which I referred, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n        Program                                             In millions\nArmy

Mr. President, I rise in support of the bill before us.\n  In this bill the Armed Services Committee has--under unprecedented \nfiscal austerity--ably worked to balance the many important yet \ncompeting needs for scarce funding, maintaining a first-class military \nand providing important benefits for personnel, their dependents, and \nretirees.\n  Allow me to highlight several particularly good provisions in this \nbill, for which Chairman Thurmond and Senator Levin should be \ncongratulated.\n  First, this measure wisely has full funding for National Missile \nDefense for FY99. Treaty-friendly, affordable, effective NMD has always \nhad my strong support.\n  I am also pleased that funds have been added to begin to make up the \nreadiness funding deficit of the Army National Guard. The Guard Bureau \ninforms me these accounts were more than half a billion dollars short \nin the FY99 budget request. I hope the funding added by the Committee \ncan be supplemented during conference.\n  Third, an additional $46 million has been included for Minuteman III \nICBM upgrades. The Minuteman III force will be service for decades to \ncome, and modernization must go forward. The Committee acted wisely \nregarding the Guidance Replacement Program.\n  The Committee has also moved to accelerate key military construction \nprojects for North Dakota. These include $8.5 million for repair of the \ntaxiway at Minot AFB, and $3.65 million for renovation of a supply shop \nfor the North Dakota Air National Guard. George Lauffer and Mike McCord \non the Committee staff deserve thanks for their work on these items.\n  Additionally, the Authorization bill calls for demonstration programs \nregarding allowing Medicare-eligible military retirees to enroll in the \nFederal Employee Health Benefits Program.\n  Finally, but very importantly, I am pleased that the Senate has \napproved an amendment bringing the pay raise in this bill up to the \nlevel in the House bill, 3.6 percent.\n  However, there are a number of matters in this bill of great concern.\n  First, the Committee's bill would call for a cut of nearly $100M to \nthe Air Force's budget request for the Airborne Laser, a revolutionary \ntheater missile defense program, and top priority for the USAF.\n  Second, this bill provides inadequate funding for the B-52H bomber \nforce. Although I will not discuss this matter in detail at this time, \nlet me say this: today's thoroughly upgraded B-52H can deliver a \ngreater quantity and diversity of conventional and nuclear munitions a \ngreater distance at a lower cost than any other airborne combat \nplatform in the world today. Cutting the B-52 force doesn't make good \nnational security or fiscal sense, and I applaud Senator Stevens and \nSenator Inouye--the distinguished leadership of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee--for acting to fund all 94 B-52s in the \nFY99 Defense Appropriations Bill.\n  I hope that ABL and B-52 funding can be addressed in conference. Even \nso, I am pleased to support this bill, especially in light of the \nCommittee's acceptance of my amendment regarding Russian tactical \nnuclear weapons.\n  Mr. President, at this point I would like to speak briefly about the \namendment.\n  The recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan serve as an unsettling \nreminder that nuclear weapons continue\n\n[[Page S7089]]\n\nto be sought for their terrible destructive power and prestige. An \nequally serious, if not greater, nuclear threat still lies to the north \nof the Indian subcontinent, however--in Russia's enormous, ill-secured, \nand potentially destabilizing non-strategic, or ``tactical,'' nuclear \narsenal.\n  As my colleagues may be aware, Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile \ncould be larger than ours by a factor of eight-to-one, and is not \ncovered by any arms control accord.\n  I believe it is time for the Congress to do three things.\n  First, go on record as concerned about the significant ``loose nuke'' \ndangers associated with Russia's tactical stockpile, and the growing \nstrategic relevance of Moscow's tactical arsenal.\n  Additionally, we must call for the Russians to make good on the 1991 \nand 1992 Gorbachev and Yeltsin promises to deeply reduce tactical \nweapons, just as the US has followed through in good faith on President \nBush's similar promises in September 1991.\n  And finally, the Congress needs a detailed report, and the benefit of \nthe analysis of the Defense Department, the Intelligence Community, and \nthe US Strategic Command.\n  Today, I wish to thank the Armed Services Committee for accepting my \namendment earlier this week that does just these things.\n  I also wish to thank the following distinguished Members of the Armed \nServices Committee, who have cosponsored my amendment: Senators \nKempthorne, Kennedy, Bingaman, and Levin. Glen Tait, Menda Fife, Bill \nMonahan, and Madelyn Creedon, in addition to Monica Chavez with the \ncommittee--deserve thanks for their good work.\n  Before asking unanimous consent that the full text of my amendment be \nincluded after my statement, I would call the Senate's attention to the \ntestimony of the Commander in Chief of the United States Strategic \nCommand, Gen. Eugene Habiger. Gen. Habiger, testifying before the Armed \nServices Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, responded to a question \nregarding Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile by Senator Kempthorne--a \ncosponsor of my amendment--by stating that ``it is time for us to get \nvery serious about tactical nuclear weapons.''\n  My amendment responds to the General's sage advice, advancing the \ncause of getting deep reductions to Russia's non-strategic nuclear \narsenal. At the very least, we should ask them to come down to our \nlevel--and prove it to us.\n  Before closing, Mr. President, I would like to emphasize that my \namendment should be properly viewed in context with the funding for the \nvital Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat program in the FY99 Defense \nAuthorization bill. Senate passage of my amendment ensures that we send \nto Russia a message of concern and cooperation.\n  Let me be clear: continuing the Nunn-Lugar program is absolutely \ncritical. I can think of no better investment of national security \ndollars than simply expending money for the destruction of horrible \nweapons capable of killing millions of Americans.\n  Continuing and fully funding the CTR program is especially important \nin light of the Russian tactical nuclear dangers I have discussed. \nAlthough there are arms control agreements requiring Russian strategic \nforce reductions, there are no arms control agreements requiring \nreductions to Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile.\n  In addition to the diplomatic pressure called for in my amendment, \ncontinuing and possibly expanding work under Nunn-Lugar on tactical \nnuclear weapons is the best bet we've got to put this aspect of the \nRussian nuclear genie back in the bottle. Funding for Nunn-Lugar is \nvital, and I congratulate the committee for fully supporting this \nprogram in their bill.\n  Again, Mr. President, I would thank my colleagues for approving my \namendment, and the amendment's cosponsors for their support. This is a \ngood bill--but a better bill because we have taken this initial step \ntoward eliminating the tactical nuclear dangers from the former Soviet \nUnion.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Senate is now in the process of \ncreating arguably the most important legislation we produce all year, \nthe Defense Authorization Bill. We are authorizing the activities of \ngovernment which keep Americans free and safe, and we are authorizing \nactivities which are carried out by young Americans in a spirit of \ncourage and selfless service. So there is no more serious legislation \nthan this. My purpose today is to ask my colleagues as they deliberate \non this bill to consider the threats to our country as they are and as \nthey likely will be in the decade ahead, so we authorize armed forces \nwhich will be able to deter or defeat those threats.\n  The arms forces we authorize in this bill keep America safe mainly by \ntheir credible potential for overwhelming, focused, sustained violence. \nWe allocate the funds by categories such as training, operations and \nmaintenance, quality of life, readiness, but in actuality these funds \nare to support the credibility of that potential for violence. It is a \npotential to counter and, if necessary, defeat the threats which put at \nrisk our national life, the lives of Americans, and in some cases the \nlivelihoods and interests of Americans. It is a potential which is an \nessential element of our national power.\n  Our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee have taken on the \ndaunting task of measuring the forces the President has requested \nagainst the threats we face. I say this is a daunting task because \nwhile the threats are dynamic, there is a normal human trait to see the \nthreats as static, particularly when we are already heavily invested in \na technology or a family of weapons that have proven successful against \na particular threat in the past. It is our duty, Mr. President, to \nresist that trait, to see the world as it is and to try our best to see \nit as it will be. In our analysis our most useful tool is the \ninformation produced by our Intelligence Community.\n  Let's look out across the world of the present and near future. We \nsee Russian nuclear forces, still deployed, still on alert, still \ncapable of killing scores of millions of Americans. We see growing \nindiscipline in the way Russian nuclear weapons are stored and \nmaintained, combined with a hunger for plutonium and weapons-grade \nuranium among the world's weapons proliferators. In China we see a much \nsmaller but still deadly Chinese nuclear force, reportedly with its \nweapons targeted on the U.S. We depend heavily on the intelligence \ncommunity to monitor Russia's and China's nuclear status, for the \nreason we always did: because our national survival could be at stake.\n  In Russia we see conventional forces in steep decline and in China \nconventional forces which appear to be outmoded and immobile, compared \nwith U.S. forces. Looking more broadly, we see a small and diminishing \nnumber of countries with capable conventional land or naval forces, but \nan increasing number of countries and movements trying to develop \nweapons of mass destruction. In the case of India and Pakistan, we see \nvividly how successful proliferation efforts add to global danger. We \nalso see non-national and multi-national threats such as terrorist \nmovements and drug cartels posing greater threats to the safety of \nAmericans than the threats posed by the conventional military forces of \nthe few isolated, weak rogue states who claim to be our adversary. \nLooking more broadly, past the ability of our potential adversaries to \ndo violence, we see a new world in which people increasingly do not \nlook to their national governments as the sole means of accomplishing \ntheir goals in international matters. The age of imperialism, in which \nnational governments invaded each other's territory to extend their \npower, seems a distant memory. Saddam Hussein's attack on Kuwait eight \nyears ago and the current nuclear tension between India and Pakistan \nare two indicators that we must keep a sharp eye on relations between \nstates, and if our policymakers choose to intervene in such conflicts, \nwe must have armed forces capable of doing so. But we are in a world in \nwhich nonnational actors--individuals as well as corporations and \nmovements have taken international relations into their own hands.\n  The global nature of the Internet and the global, not national, \noutlook of the world's dominant corporations, are well known to all. \nDaimler-Benz' recent purchase of a company which less than twenty years \nago we were bailing out as a patriotic duty, and the lack of concern in \nthis country about that purchase, underscores the point. At the\n\n[[Page S7090]]\n\nother, individual end of the scale, we see individual Irish citizens, \nboth north and south, looking beyond their governments and the borders \ncreated by governments and seeing the advantage of direct personal and \ncommercial relationships, the advantage not just of peace but of lower \nbarriers. The relentless integration of Europe, most recently marked by \nthe introduction of a common currency, is a sharp contrast to the \nconflicts and ancient rivalries which marked and divided Europe for \ncenturies. European conflict called forth the greatest armies America \never raised, twice in this century. Today we are concerned with \nresidual ethnic disputes in isolated corners of Europe and in the case \nof Bosnia even deploy military force in an effort to stabilize and \ncontain the conflict. But large-scale conventional conflict in Europe, \nfor the first time since the invention of gunpowder, is unthinkable.\n  Outside Europe, we see economic integration throughout Asia and in \nour own hemisphere, and we see economic integration leading cultural \nintegration. The national boundaries are blurring. In this metropolitan \narea, for example, there are cable TV stations broadcasting in Spanish, \nArabic, Japanese, and other languages. Even in Pakistan and India, the \nelites who rattle nuclear weapons at each other are part of the same \nglobal culture; their children are studying in American universities.\n  There are exceptions to the trend of global integration. There are \npockets of recalcitrance: dictatorships who retain power by force, \nimmature democracies in which crime rivals legitimate business and \ncreates internal civil wars, unscrupulous leaders in places like the \nMiddle East, South Asia, and the former Yugoslavia who manipulate \nethnic rivalries as a tool to retain power. These are the places likely \nto generate conflicts which threaten our safety or our interests. These \nare the places which, especially if economic disparity is added to \nethnic or religious differences, from which violence will emanate. \nThese are the places in which U.S. intelligence ought to provide \npolicymakers and warfighters the edge. Given that such places exist, \nand given the enduring strategic threat we also face from Russia, what \nshould our armed forces be able to do?\n\n  First, our forces should be able to deter the threat of Russian and \nChinese nuclear weapons, along with the growing threat posed by \nregional nuclear programs. The Wall may have fallen, but until \nverifiable arms control agreements bring this nuclear episode of \nmilitary history to an end, we need modern, robust nuclear forces and \nwe need the intelligence to closely watch not just Russia and China, \nbut also the nuclear activities of proliferating countries. Good \nintelligence is inextricably linked to a sound strategic defense, and \nit is not cheap. Strong nuclear forces in the absence of nuclear \ntesting means a dependable Stockpile Stewardship Program. We and the \nworld must have absolute confidence in our nuclear capabilities. I will \ntherefore support the efforts of the Senator from New Mexico to restore \nfull funding to the Stockpile Stewardship Program.\n  Defending America from nuclear threats also means preventing fissile \nmaterials from falling into the hands of those aspiring to develop \nnuclear weapons, be they aspiring countries or terrorists. The Indian-\nPakistani attainment of nuclear weapons does not cease our efforts; it \nmeans we should redouble them. In this sense, the security of Russia's \nvast nuclear arsenal is very much in our interest. The Armed Services \nCommittee has long recognized this fact through the Nunn-Lugar program, \nand I will support restoration of full funding for Nunn-Lugar in this \nbill. Beyond the nuclear threat, the increasingly interconnected world \nI described presents little likelihood of a clash of large conventional \nforces. In addition to globalization, we see a reduction in \nconventional forces of most countries. With the vitally important \nexception of the United States, I also see a decline in recent years in \nthe fighting spirit in the remaining large conventional forces in the \nworld. All these trends suggest we will not see our military engaged in \na major conventional conflict in the foreseeable future. Certainly the \nexample of the Gulf War should dissuade other countries from putting a \nlarge armored force into the field against the United States. Large-\nscale conventional modernization can therefore safely be a lower \npriority for us. However, smaller, highly mobile, highly ready \nconventional forces will be a necessity.\n  Ethnic conflict will continue to erupt on the peripheries of global \nintegration. Because of America's unique power and because, as the \nperformance of our NATO allies in Bosnia prior to our arrival there \nshowed, other countries' militaries will not take forceful action \nwithout an American example, we will be called upon for future \ndeployments much like the Bosnian mission. Certainly we cannot answer \nevery call. But if a conflict threatens a wider war which would require \nan even greater American involvement, we must deploy to nip some \nconflicts in the bud. It is an obligation of leadership. If we do it \nright, others will imitate us and we will have to deploy less often.\n  In designing our forces we should bear in mind the characteristics of \nthe ideal deployable forces: highly capable (packing a strong punch), \nhighly mobile, highly trained, well maintained, closely connected to \nnational and theater intelligence, integrated with the command and \ncontrol systems of the allies with whom we will operate, rapidly \ntransportable to the theater of deployment, and supported by tailored \nlogistics. These forces should operate in an environment in which we \ncontrol the coasts and sea lanes in the vicinity and the airspace over \nthe vicinity, for purposes of support, surveillance, and air strikes if \nnecessary.\n\n  Beyond regional deployments, we face non-national threats such as \nweapons proliferation, terrorism, and the casualties we continually \nsuffer from drug trafficking. As with the Russian nuclear threat, the \nfirst line of defense against these threats is the best possible \nintelligence. We require military forces that can respond to the \nintelligence when policy makers so direct: agile, superbly trained and \nequipped special operations forces. Increasingly the military future \nbelongs to the sophistication and stealth of the special operator, \nrather than the armored masses of the past. Maintaining such forces in \nall the services should be among our highest priority.\n  Mr. President, a new threat has materialized in recent years, the \nthreat of electronic attack against the communications systems and \ncomputer networks which are increasingly the fundamental infrastructure \nof our country. Recent Defense Department exercises have helped size \nthe potential problem and the Administration has a number of agencies \ndeveloping a response. As with every threat, intelligence plays a key \nrole in warning against and countering this threat. In developing our \ndefenses, we need units with great knowledge, the best equipment, \ntechnically sophisticated people, and speed in both decision and \nexecution. Fortunately, these are American traits. In fact, those who \ncontemplate attacking us in the realm of information operations are \nreally attacking into one of our greatest national strengths. But we \nshould not be over confident. We need to defend in cyberspace, and the \nforces authorized in this bill should do so.\n  The Armed Services Committee was faced with a tight budget and \ndifficult choices. I propose reviewing those choices with this \ncriterion: how does this or that program help create or sustain the \nkind of military forces I have described, forces responsive to the \nthreats and global realities we face? We simply cannot afford to \nallocate these scarce resources on the basis of other criteria. It is \nnot enough to state a particular class of equipment is wearing out or \nshould be replaced, we have always had that class of equipment, so we \nshould get a new modern version. We must ask: how does that class of \nequipment respond to the threats we face and will face? It is not \nenough to state, the defense plant in my state will lack work if we do \nnot buy a particular item. It is not enough to state, the military base \nin my state must continue to operate at or above its current level of \nmanning, regardless of the national need. It is unfair to our service \nmembers and their families, it is unfair to taxpayers, but above all it \nis unfair to the nation we are pledged to defend, to force precious \ndefense funds to be spent on a basing system which is reportedly over \ntwenty percent larger than the nation requires.\n\n[[Page S7091]]\n\n  Mr. President, I will be looking closely at this legislation in terms \nof its contribution to the forces we require. It is far more agreeable \nto stay the course and stick with the traditional weapons and \norganizations and bases which helped win the Cold War. With an \ninstitution as large and complex as the Defense Department, change is \nalso a lengthy process. But we must lead change and make the defense \nchoices to align our forces with the world as it is and will be. Our \nfighting men and women deserve it and our country should expect it of \nus.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Fiscal Year 1999 \nDefense Authorization Act. This legislation focuses on the military of \ntomorrow by establishing priorities that will allow American forces to \nprepare for the conflicts of the 21st Century.\n  We consider this measure under the leadership of a remarkable Senator \nwhose personal sacrifice and professional insight have contributed to \nthe molding of the military in our time. The public life of Strom \nThurmond has reflected the evolution of conflict and war fighting \ncapabilities in the last half-century. Emerging as a Colonel from World \nWar II, he persevered through the traumas of Korea and Vietnam; the \nturbulent ``hollow force'' years of the 1970s; the recovery of our \nmight under President Reagan; the collapse of imperial communism; and \nthe computer-age attacks during the Persian Gulf War.\n  Today, he manages a bill that capitalizes on the lessons of the \nmilitary history to which he contributed. The FY99 Defense \nAuthorization Act increases the speed, precision, and analytical \ncapacity of soldiers who will face post-Soviet adversaries as \ndetermined or dictatorial, but more numerous, than those whom we have \nconfronted in the past.\n  While he steps down at the end of the year as Committee Chairman, his \nleadership will resonate in our deliberations and hearings for years to \ncome. He brings an authorization before the Senate this week having \ngroomed three generations of successors in the byzantine ways of \ndefense legislation.\n  Mr. President, this bill includes several programs that enhance the \nreadiness and modernization of the military. Our Committee has worked \ndiligently during the 1990s to control the bleeding of funds from next-\ngeneration procurement systems and the stress on our forces from \nescalating peacekeeping commitments. President Clinton's out-year \nbudget projections bring defense outlays as a percentage of GDP to 2.7 \npercent, the lowest level in almost 50 years. The President targets the \nmilitary as the only federal function that sustains deep outlay \ndecreases between 1993 and 2003. While mandatory domestic expenditures \nwill increase over time by 23.6 percent, those for national defense \nfall by exactly the same level.\n  In modernization accounts--those for weapons procurement--funding has \nfallen by 67% since 1985. This trend, in constant dollars, means that \nat the height of the Reagan build-up thirteen years ago, the Pentagon \nobligated $138.7 billion for procurement. This spending fell to its \nlowest point--$44.2 billion--in FY97. The FY99 budget finally increases \nthe account to $48.7 billion, and I commend Secretary Cohen for \nsubmitting the first budget by this administration that brings \nprocurement back to the annual average threshold of $60.1 billion, as \nrecommended by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, starting in 2001.\n  Exploding expenditures for peacekeeping operations since the end of \nthe Persian Gulf War directly threaten spending for procurement and \nmodernization. To confirm this point, we only need to read the \nQuadrennial Defense Review (QDR). Among all Pentagon programs, the QDR \nsingled out ``incremental costs of unplanned deployments and smaller-\nscale contingencies'' as the ``least predictable operating expenses'' \nwhich ``displace funding previously planned for procurement.''\n  America's 29 contingency operations since the end of the Persian Gulf \nWar have cost us a total of $18 billion. Our Bosnia commitment alone \nhas consumed $7.2 billion. Even excluding Bosnia, the American \ntaxpayers gave another three billion dollars just to support U.N. \npeacekeeping programs throughout the 1990's. The administration, \nhowever, has never offered us a comprehensive readiness and mission \nassessment of U.S. Contingency Operations (CONOPS) policy to justify or \nrationalize the expenditure of this $21 billion, or eight percent of \nthe whole defense budget.\n  The Committee, therefore, supported an amendment that I offered along \nwith Senator Cleland during the mark-up session making the Pentagon \nstatutorily responsible for providing all congressional defense \ncommittees with a Contingency Operations budgetary, mission, and \nreadiness assessment by January 31, 1999. We did not establish the \ndeadline by coincidence. I strongly believe that the Committee should \nconsider any CONOPS authorization or supplemental appropriations \nrequests next year only with the benefit of the president's strategic \nanalysis of how and why the Armed Services will obligate their \npeacekeeping budgets.\n  This amendment subsequently directs the department to address five \nissues: the effects of ongoing CONOPS on Service retention and \nreenlistment rates; whether they cause sustained or significant \nshortages of military personnel and equipment in other regions of the \nworld; the specific programmatic accounts on which the department has \nrelied to underwrite CONOPS deployments; what clear objectives guide \neach of these undertakings; and the conditions, based on such \nobjectives, that would define the end of each operation.\n  Presidential Decision Direction 25 of May 1994, Mr. President, \noutlined the scope and purpose of the administration's CONOPS policy. \nIt promised the application of strict standards to determine whether \nthe U.S. should participate in any overseas peace operation.\n  The reporting categories specified by my amendment intentionally \noverlap with this directive. PDD-25 specifically declared that \npotential CONOPS commitments would depend on whether our participation \nadvanced U.S. interests, the ``unique and general risks'' to American \npersonnel, if ``clear objectives'' could determine the role of our \nforces, and the identification of an ``endpoint.''\n  We would not impose an unfair burden on the Defense Department by \nmandating a pre-posture hearing or pre-budget request report on the \nsteps that the administration has taken to implement its own plan.\n  This year, the Committee received Posture Statements from the Navy \nand the Air Force that contained warnings of potential negative \nreadiness impacts as a result of long CONOPS deployments. Secretary \nDalton cited the ``requirements of the Unified Commands''--those that \nparticipate heavily in peacekeeping missions--as effecting the \nreadiness of non-deployed fleet units.\n  The number of Air Force personnel dedicated to contingency operations \ngrew fourfold since 1989 from 3,400 to 14,600 by FY97. ``Caution \nindicators,'' as the report characterized it, have emerged in the areas \nof retention, reenlistment, and depleted inventories of spare parts.\n  In addition, by October 1999, the Army, the Service most involved in \npeacekeeping, could lack the heavy armored divisions designed for rapid \ndeployment to crisis areas. Two of the divisions that train full time \nfor this mission may have one-third of their troops on duty in Bosnia \nor Kuwait.\n  Four years ago, the Army had 541,000 active duty soldiers and no \ncommitments in Bosnia. The Armed Services Committee, according to \nformer Chairman Nunn, considered this level the minimum necessary for \nresponding to two regional crises. Yet today, the Army faces the \nchallenge of preparing for two Major Theater Wars at a reduced force \nstrength of 491,000, coupled with a deployment in Bosnia.\n  Consider the exorbitant contingency operations costs that the Army \nabsorbed in just one fiscal year. The amount, $1.5 billion, represented \nmore than one-fifth of the entire research and development budget for \nthe Service. It exceeded the total Army aircraft procurement line by \nalmost two hundred million dollars. If we take these examples of the \nstrains imposed by peacekeeping commitments on Army research and \nhardware programs, how can the administration state that it has \nadequately weighed the ``unique and general risks'' of these missions, \nas required under PDD-25, to our people in uniform?\n\n[[Page S7092]]\n\n  Despite the alarming budgetary trends, the QDR predicts that \ncontingency efforts will dominate the Pentagon's planning agenda over \nthe next two decades. The law, Mr. President, must also move in this \ndirection by requiring a CONOPS policy rationale with a CONOPS budget \nrequest. My amendment supports this transition by mandating the first \npre-budget report to Congress on the national security and OPTEMPO \nimplications of our increased contingency commitments.\n  Whether for contingency operations or more traditional missions, \nnaval modernization programs will remain vital to the overseas \nprojection of American forces. As a result, I salute the Chair of the \nSeapower Subcommittee--Senator Warner--for this support of the $2.680 \nbillion continuation of the DDG-51 multi-year destroyer procurement, \nthe $2.003 billion going to produce the second ship of the New Attack \nSubmarine class, and the $639 million going for the next LPD-17 \nAmphibious Transport Ship. In addition, I am pleased that the \nSubcommittee fully authorized the Navy's $85 million DD-21 land-attack \ndestroyer Research and Development request to keep this new effort on \nschedule and within budget.\n  These four programs meet the Navy's requirements for the type of \nwarfare that will dominate our military strategy of the future: \nlittoral operations near coastal plains. Littoral engagements require \nthe Navy to maneuver ``close enough to influence events on shore if \nnecessary.'' This post-Soviet mission continues to match our force \nstructure with our security interests since 80 percent of the world's \npopulation lives near the coastal areas and waterways that open into \nthe littorals.\n  Littoral concepts of war stem directly from the changing worldwide \npolitical environment in which the United States operates. Soviet power \nno longer threatens the open plains of Central Europe. Soviet ships and \nsubmarines no longer prepare for platform-to-platform battles on the \nopen seas. For the first time since the end of World War II, a Pentagon \nplanning document, the QDR, steered the military in the direction of \ndeterring conflict and instability wherever it might occur rather than \ncontaining a single enemy force.\n  The surface ship and submarine programs authorized in this bill will \nprovide the Navy more firepower and endurance at a lower cost. Smooth \nand modular construction materials will deceive the enemy radars that \ncan detect the hard angles of older vessels. Electronic integrators \nwill give ships and submarines split-second systems for communications \nand munitions targeting. A new series of rapid transporters will bring \nunprecedented levels of forces and weapons to the shorelines of \ninstability or humanitarian rescue. From safe distances at sea, smaller \ncrews will program missiles for strategic inland targets.\n  A littoral Navy, Mr. President, also corresponds with lower life-\ncycle costs. Carriers and surface combatants will carry more firepower \nand fewer people. This development, in addition to a greater reliance \non commercial ``off-the-shelf'' technologies, holds the promise of \ndecreasing maintenance expenditures by between 50 and 70 percent.\n  We also cannot forget that political limitations as well as political \nchanges shape the new Navy. The visible and invisible forward presence \nprovided by the Fleet assumes greater importance in an age when we no \nlonger enjoy permanent bases throughout Europe or Southern Asia. As a \nresult, the administration will increasingly rely on the Navy as a key \nagent of force behind our diplomacy.\n  For this reason, I was honored to participate in a Subcommittee \nmarkup that also expanded naval air programs. To stabilize the \ntransition from the Nimitz-class of nuclear aircraft carriers to the \nnew-generation CVX system, the Subcommittee allocated $124.5 million \nfor acceleration of advance procurement and component construction of \nthe CVN-77 system. We furthermore instructed the Navy to invest carrier \nresearch and development budgets in a way that will directly enhance \nthe planned capabilities of the CVX. Our mark-up also placed the P-3 \nOrion Anti-Surface Warfare Improvement Program on an efficient 12-month \nmodification track.\n  The changing mix of threats to our national security represented by \nthese maritime and other high-technology defense programs finally \ninfluenced the Committee vote against authorizing another base closure \n(BRAC) round.\n  This amendment tried to address two of the many problems with the \nBRAC process: the fact that no law guarantees the proper investment of \nany quantifiable returns from base closures, and the president's \ntemptation to manipulate commission rulings in his own political \ninterest.\n  But the Committee rejected the BRAC amendment because it did not, nor \ncould it, solve the fatal flaws in the process. No base closure round, \nMr. President, has yielded the taxpayers any clear or proven savings. \nWe do not need to rely on the claims of congressional BRAC opponents to \ndemonstrate this point. We only need to consider the conclusion of the \nleading advocate of BRAC: The Department of Defense. DoD's April 1998 \nbase closure report to Congress states explicitly that ``no audit \ntrail, single document, or budget account exists for tracking the end \nuse of each dollar saved through BRAC.''\n  We can also turn to the findings of independent evaluators. Last \nsummer, the GAO flatly told us that ``DoD accounting systems are not \ndesigned to track savings.'' The Congressional Budget Office concluded \nin December 1996 that the Pentagon ``is unable to report actual \nspending and savings for BRAC actions.'' Accounting uncertainties, Mr. \nPresident, have made apparent base closure savings a frustrating \nmystery rather than a confirmed fact.\n  The Defense Department cannot continue to decide which installations \nto downsize or close by making arbitrary comparisons to personnel \nreductions. The standard should not focus, as DoD contends, on closing \n36% of our bases if 36% of all people in uniform have left the military \nsince the peak of the Cold War. The standard must remain the adaptation \nof infrastructure to new or developing security threats. But as it did \nlast year, the administration rests the argument for more base closures \non the premise that facility cuts have lagged behind those in personnel \nby 15 percent.\n  A simple percentage, Mr. President, cannot answer the questions that \nshould determine the future of domestic military bases. What depots, \nfor example, do we require to provide competition with the private \nsector and to insure the precision and endurance of fighter aircraft?\n  What shipyards can provide the Navy with a diversified industrial \nbase to sustain the next-generation modular vessels that will maneuver \nin littoral waters?\n  What air bases must stay active to support our long-range power \nprojection capabilities now that we have a diminished forward presence \nin Europe and Southern Asia?\n  These questions do not exhaust the list. But I raise them as examples \nof the factors absent in most of the base closure assessments that have \ncome to Congress from the Pentagon.\n  Page one of the April base report estimates that the military could \nsave 21 billion dollars between 2008 and 2015 if we approve two more \nBRAC rounds. Even if the Committee had accepted this projection, the \nQDR acknowledges that it could re-capture $18 billion of this amount in \nthree ways: by following through with DoD management reforms and \ntechnology upgrades, providing consistent guidance to the Services on \nbudget priorities, and controlling the costs of contingency operations.\n  The QDR indicated that this $18 billion dollar loss as from three \nspecific causes, came exclusively from procurement accounts. It \ntherefore has three specific plans, all of which relate to policy \nchanges and internal reforms, and none of which relate to base \nclosures, for restoring funds to modernization. The April base closure \nreport even admits that if the Pentagon could quantify BRAC savings, \nthere would be no guarantee that procurement programs might gain from \nthe extra dollars because the four separate Services make their own \ninvestment decisions.\n  To assert that the department cannot save $18 billion dollars through \nrigorous budget management, Mr. President, is to assert that it cannot \nfollow the mandates of the QDR, which called for ``reducing unneeded \nstandards and specifications,'' and the ``leveraging of commercial \ntechnology.''\n  And how unreasonable or impractical is it to control the level of \nunplanned expenditures on Bosnia through clear\n\n[[Page S7093]]\n\npolicy objectives? According to the administration, while it predicts \nextensive U.S. involvement in contingency operations beyond 2015, our \nengagement ``must be selective, depending largely on the interests at \nstake and the risk of major aggression elsewhere.''\n  The Clinton Administration advertises a commitment to multi-billion \ndollar defense management reforms while asking for base closures to \ngenerate savings that it can neither find nor re-invest. At the same \ntime, it has submitted very real Bosnia bills that now exceed seven \nbillion dollars and freeze our forces in a political vacuum.\n  By rejecting the BRAC amendment, the Committee invited the \nadministration to provide us with a more compelling plan that links \nfacility to mission needs. In the meantime, DoD can also realize \nbillions of dollars of savings through firm policy decisions about our \noverseas strategic interests, internal reforms, and Service \nprogrammatic goals. The Defense Department must continue to work \ndirectly with Congress on the issues that will improve the military of \nthe next decade instead of shifting them to yet another panel for which \nwe can claim no responsibility.\n  Mr. President, the FY99 Authorization Bill accelerates the \nmodernization of the Armed Services while recognizing the strong \nevidence of the degrading impact of open-ended contingency Operations \non Personnel Tempos and unit readiness. It ultimately holds the \nPentagon accountable for documented savings through policy and \nmanagement reforms rather than accepting the unproven promises of BRAC \nsavings that would come 15 years away. I therefore urge all of my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of this responsible legislation.\n\n\nu.s. non-proliferation policy and condemnation of testing in south asia\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, my support for this amendment must be \nqualified. I too am concerned about proliferation. However, I do not \nwelcome the potentially negative consequences relying strictly on U.S. \nunilateral sanctions in this case. I strongly urge we combine sanctions \nwith engagement. This engagement must be based on comprehensive, \ncalculated non-proliferation policies.\n  I believe that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction poses \nan imminent threat to U.S. and international security. The geopolitical \nstrings that contained states' individual aspirations of mass \ndestruction capabilities have been severed. The emerging multipolar \nworld--in which the U.S. is, without question, the dominant economic, \nmilitary and cultural power--creates new threats and offers new \nopportunities.\n  Capitalizing on opportunities requires U.S. leadership. No other \nnation has the wherewithal to facilitate the creation and \nimplementation of thoughtful and deliberate strategies to counter \nthreats to U.S. and international security. No other nation parallels \nthe power the U.S. can bring to bear in creating a stable international \norder. There is no doubt that we live in an increasingly interdependent \nworld. Most major problems--economic, environmental, military--cannot \nbe handled by the U.S. alone, despite our dominant position.\n  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is one such problem. \nThis threat cannot be stemmed by unilateral U.S. actions. The dangers \nof weapons of mass destruction proliferation--whether by rogue nations \nor terrorist organizations--poses a threat to the U.S. military and \nU.S. civilians, as well as the future of humanity. In light of the \nchanged global circumstances and the U.S. position as the global power, \nwe urgently need to rethink antiquated doctrines of defense and provide \na coherent approach to non-proliferation policies.\n  Our nuclear reality has radically changed in the past weeks. Recent \nrumblings from the detonation of nuclear devices in Southeast Asia \nshould awaken us to a few simple realities: our non-proliferation \npolicies have failed; any country desirous of nuclear capability can \nattain it; and sanctions alone are an inadequate deterrent and \npotentially dangerous approach.\n  Sanctions alone will not suffice in deterring would-be proliferators. \nWhen leaders of a country are willing to state that the people ``will \neat grass'' in order to obtain weapons of mass destruction capability, \nthis should be a sign of the relative impotence of U.S. unilateral \nattempts to alter their behavior.\n  The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty--the lynchpin of nuclear \ncontrol--is under assault. North Korea, Iraq, India and Pakistan sent \nclear signals--nuclear proliferation is a threat now. How obvious do \nthe warning signs have to be to evoke an effective response?\n  The U.S. should be taking the lead in formulating national and \nmultilateral efforts to contain proliferation. If not contained, the \nrecent events in India and Pakistan will become a common occurrence in \nthe world of the near future.\n  As stated by Secretary of Defense William Cohen in recent defense \nAppropriation hearings, India's actions could set off a chain \nreaction--not solely of a fissile nature but nonetheless having similar \ncataclysmic ramifications. Without swift and multilateral intervention \nthis chain reaction could easily lead to a nuclear arms race between \nIndia and Pakistan that would spillover into other countries' strategic \ncalculations.\n  More ominous is that Indian and Pakistani defiance will set the tone \nfor other less developed states. It is clearly in the U.S. interest to \nprevent uncontrolled proliferation. A U.S. response proportionate to \nthe threat would involve bringing all the policy tools we can bring to \nbear in reducing that threat. In sum, this requires a reasonable, \nconsistent and aggressive non-proliferation strategy.\n  I would like to take a minute to look at India as an example of the \nfailures in U.S. non-proliferation policies. India's tests resulted \nfrom international and domestic concerns. The international issues \npoint to problems in the form of lack of consistency in U.S. non-\nproliferation policies.\n  First, India's strategic concerns are most succinctly formulated as \nfollows: China, Pakistan, and the former's assistance to the latter. \nIndia has fought three wars in the last 50 years with Pakistan. These \ntwo states' relations with one another at their best are more perilous \nthan U.S. relations with the Soviet Union were leading up to the Cuban \nMissile Crisis.\n  Moreover, India enjoys front row seats to observe how the existing \nnon-proliferation regimes fail to check China's transfer of controlled \ntechnologies to Pakistan as well as another potential enemy, Iran. If \nChina enjoys unimpeded export of missile technologies to Pakistan, and \nPakistan proceeds to demonstrate its missile capabilities, why should \nIndia refrain from flexing its nuclear muscle?\n  Second, India has repeatedly indicated its frustration with lack of \nprogress toward global nuclear disarmament. As my colleague, Senator \nMoynihan, former U.S. Ambassador to India, recently suggested, India \nrejects the discriminatory nature of the existing non-proliferation \nregimes. Perhaps due to their frustration with the lack of progress on \ndisarmament, India believes that these tests would lend urgency to the \nprocess.\n  The domestic dimension boils down to the nationalist and isolationist \ninclinations of the political leaders in India at present. The election \nmanifesto of India's BJP states that it ``rejects the notion of nuclear \napartheid and will actively oppose attempts to impose a hegemonistic \nnuclear regime.'' India will not have its matters of security or its \nexercise of the nuclear option dictated to it. Nor would any other \nsovereign state.\n  While the world was generally appalled by India's actions, the \nreaction among Indians bordered on euphoria. Even though only four \nmembers of the BJP made the decision to test, that choice obviously \nenjoys widespread support. We witnessed similar domestic jubilation for \nPakistan's response.\n  I agree with my colleague, Senator Moynihan, who suggested that the \nU.S. should attempt to engage India and provide it with incentives to \njoin international non-proliferation regimes. The current government in \nIndia only welcomes our sanctions. To approach the situation with India \nby invoking sanctions only plays into the aims of the strong \nnationalist and isolationist currents in that country.\n  Invoking sanctions on Pakistan raises even more serious concerns. \nPakistan is a poor and unstable country. Should our sanctions push it \nover\n\n[[Page S7094]]\n\nthe brink and induce a collapse--we would have nuclear weapons in the \npossession of a desperate regime. As Henry Kissinger astutely observed, \nnon-democratic regimes often use external conflict to coalesce support \nin the face of domestic unrest. Our sanctions may only force Pakistan's \nhand.\n  The U.S. should temper its sanctions with constructive engagement. \nAnd we should make the lifting of those sanctions contingent on India \nand Pakistan's willingness to negotiate their entry into non-\nproliferation regimes as is suggested in this amendment.\n  A comprehensive and effective non-proliferation policy would include \nseveral elements.\n  The recent call made by the five nuclear powers for these states to \nfreeze their weapons development is a step in the right direction. The \nU.S. must ensure that these multilateral efforts get the sustained and \nclear commitment requisite to turn the tide of proliferation.\n  Our objectives should be clear:\n  First, we need to induce relations between India and Pakistan with \nthe objective of preventing an arms race on the Subcontinent. We must \nconvince them that their security is NOT enhanced by the weaponization \nor deployment of these devices.\n  Second, we should capitalize on recent overtures made by these \ncountries to negotiate their entry into numerous non-proliferation \nregimes. We should focus particular attention on a fissile materials \ncutoff agreement as well as India and Pakistan's commitment to cease \ntesting.\n  Third, the negotiations among the nuclear powers must take bold \nactions to address the discriminatory nature of the existing Nuclear \nNon-Proliferation Treaty. This reality was a longstanding and central \nreason for India remaining outside of the regime. We must assume that \nother nations recognize the discrimination codified in this regime, and \nwe must begin to address it.\n  The implementation of these policies will be anything but easy, but \nthey are critical to international stability and security. To be \nsuccessful, U.S. non-proliferation policy must utilize the full array \nof policy tools available; it must be consistent and aggressive; and it \nmust take into account other nations' perspectives and cost-benefit \ncalculations. Imposing sanctions and muddling through simply will not \nsuffice.\n  Meeting U.S. security needs in the 21st Century will require renewed \ncommitment and more complex strategies than those that sufficed for the \nlast several decades. Make no mistake about it though, these issues \nmust be addressed now, and our commitment must be unwavering.\n  I concur with Senator Moynihan in one other important respect. In the \ncase of India, we should not be focusing on the intelligence failure, \nbut rather the major failure in our statecraft, or lack thereof.\n  Statecraft in the form of addressing these problems as a leader, as \nthe dominant global power. If the U.S. does not step up to the plate, \nthe new millenium will be characterized by nations--both hostile and \nfriendly--being armed with weapons of mass destruction and the means to \ndeliver those weapons to our doorstep.\n  The 21st century will either witness widespread proliferation of mass \ndestruction capabilities or the building of international norms and \nconsensus to scale back incentives to acquiring costly and dangerous \nweaponry. The U.S. is the only country in a position to take a \nleaderhip role in defining the course and shape of the future \ninternational order.\n  If we don't act now, the 21st Century will, indeed, be the era of \nweapons of mass destruction. Mr. President, I support the amendment \ncurrently before the Senate. However, this support is qualified. I do \nnot assume that our condemnation and unilateral economic sanctions will \nbe adequate to turn the tide. I support the provisions centered on \nreduing tensions between India and Pakistan, urging multilateral \nefforts to address proliferation threats and expressing the need for \nU.S. leadership. We must act now. We must be consistent and vigilant. \nAnd we must utilize all policy tools available to achieve our aims.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3010\n\n  (Purpose: To permit recipients of Naval Reserve Officers' Training \nCorps scholarships to attend the participating college or university of \n                             their choice)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3010.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . ATTENDANCE OF RECIPIENTS OF NAVAL RESERVE OFFICERS' \n                   TRAINING CORPS SCHOLARSHIPS AT PARTICIPATING \n                   COLLEGES OR UNIVERSITIES.\n\n       Section 2107 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(i)(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any \n     policy or regulation of the Department of Defense or of the \n     Department of the Navy, recipients of Naval Reserve Officers' \n     Training Corps scholarships who live in the state which has \n     more scholarships awardees than slots available under the \n     Navy quotas in their state colleges or universities may \n     attend any college or university of their choice in their \n     state to which they have been accepted, so long as the \n     college or university is a participant in the Naval Reserve \n     Officers' Training Corps program.\n       ``(2) The Department of Defense and the Department of the \n     Navy are prohibited from setting maximum limits on the number \n     of Naval Reserve Officers' Training Corps scholarship \n     students who can be enrolled at any college or university \n     participating in the Naval Reserve Officers' Training Corps \n     program in such state.''\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this amendment is a very important \namendment, at least to this Senator. I would like to very briefly \noutline the problem I am trying to deal with. I have narrowed the \nsolution to this problem so we might get a place holder in the bill. \nThen, our conferees can fix the Nation's problem in conference.\n  We cannot get an agreement on a final solution now. I think my \ncolleagues, when they hear my argument, will agree to my amendment. I \nsimply want a place holder, so this problem can be fixed in every \nschool in every State in the Union.\n  Mr. President, what is happening is that the Navy is engaged in \nsetting quotas in allowing students to attend colleges and universities \nunder Naval ROTC scholarship programs. It is interesting, because the \nquotas are very similar to the problem we have with having more \nfacilities than we have military personnel and functions. This is \nreally very similar to the whole base closing crisis that we have \nfaced.\n  The basic problem is we have 69 colleges and universities that \nparticipate in the Navy ROTC scholarship program. Many of these schools \nare schools that do not have large numbers of students who would like \nto attend them. Historically, the selection process, which has not \nchanged, is a process whereby young men and women, the best and the \nbrightest in America, apply for a Navy ROTC scholarship.\n  Here is how the system works, here is the change that has been made, \nhere is the problem, and here is my proposed beginning of a solution. I \nhope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will take this amendment.\n  Under our current program, a young man or woman who graduated from \nhigh school in America, who has excellent SAT scores, extremely high \ngrades, and who has taken a strong scientific curriculum in high \nschool, can apply for a scholarship through the Navy ROTC scholarship \nprogram. The selection is made by the Navy on a national basis. For \nexample, for this coming year, 206 young men and women from my State \nhave been selected by the Navy to receive a Navy ROTC scholarship--206.\n  Now, the way the Navy ROTC scholarship program worked prior to the \nimplementation of quotas was that a young man or woman received a Navy \nROTC scholarship and then chose to attend one of the 69 colleges that \nparticipated in the program. As the Navy has reduced the number of \npeople participating in the ROTC scholarship program, rather than \nevaluating university programs and shutting down those\n\n[[Page S7095]]\n\nprograms that enroll literally two or three students per year, what the \nNavy is doing is setting a scholarship cap on each university's Navy \nROTC program. The Navy ROTC scholarship programs that has been \nhistorically popular have been the program at MIT, the program at Notre \nDame, the program at Purdue, the program at Texas A The Navy has \nsaid, if we let students choose, 250 students would go to MIT and 250 \nstudents would go to Texas A\n  Now, I fail to see the problem. Here is the point--by setting a cap \nof 25 students who can attend any one of the participating colleges, \nwhat happens in my State is two things. No. 1, we have 206 young men \nand women who have just won a Navy ROTC scholarship, one of the biggest \nthings ever to happen to them in their lives.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator dispenses pretty quick, we will accept the \namendment and move on.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Apparently, Senator Byrd wants to be heard. Will you \nwithhold?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Then I will continue.\n  Basically, the problem I am trying to deal with is the following \nproblem.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Senator Byrd does not wish to talk on your amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have completed my remarks.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, is there an amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has an amendment \npending.\n  Mr. BYRD. That amendment is open to an amendment in the second \ndegree?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The amendment is open \nfor a second degree.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will have an amendment in the second \ndegree. First, I will talk about my amendment.\n  Mr. President, earlier this month, Secretary of Defense William Cohen \nannounced a plan that he believes will improve initial entry training \nprograms and policies of the U.S. military services. Secretary Cohen's \nplan will implement about 95 percent of the recommendations put forth \nby the Kassebaum-Baker panel. The 95 percent I refer to is not an exact \nmathematical term here. It is just a figure of speech to indicate that \nthe great majority of the recommendations that were recommended by the \nKassebaum panel will be put into effect.\n\n  This was a panel directed to assess the current training programs and \npolicies, with an eye to correcting the structural problems that had \nallowed truly scandalous situations to occur involving the harassment \nof female recruits. The membership of former Senator Kassebaum's panel \nwas selected directly by Secretary Cohen himself.\n\n  While many of the policies under the Secretary's plan are to be \ncommended, debate has been brewing over those core recommendations that \nremain and that were not put into effect by Secretary Cohen. That \ndeviation pertains to Secretary Cohen's support, in the face of the \nreport of the Kassebaum Commission to the contrary, for continuing the \npractice of men and women undergoing basic training together, and \nallowing coed barracks. Not only does this stance counter specific \nrecommendations made by the Kassebaum/Baker panel, but it counters \nlegislative provisions approved by the House of Representatives. In my \nview, it also counters plain common sense.\n\n  Similar to recommendations in the Kassebaum report, the House of \nRepresentatives' Fiscal Year 1999 Department of Defense (DOD) \nAuthorization Bill includes provisions that would require separate \nliving facilities for men and women during basic training; prohibit \nafter-hours access to barracks by the opposite sex, including drill \nsergeants; and separate training of men and women at the basic level. \nSenator Brownback yesterday offered an amendment to the Senate Defense \nAuthorization Bill that would require separate barracks for men and \nwomen, and limit access to these barracks by members of the opposite \nsex.\n  Secretary Cohen has announced that he is strongly opposed to the \nHouse provisions. But regardless of the Secretary's position in the \ndebate, one looming fact remains: Sex scandals are plaguing our \nmilitary training facilities. The papers are filled with headlines \ninvolving sexual misconduct in the services--misconduct involving \nextensive investigations and trials, and high-profile ends to military \ncareers. This is a serious situation, a situation that, in all \nprobability, must have negative ramifications for our overall national \nsecurity. That is what we should be concerned about, not political \ncorrectness, not social engineering, not social theory, not social \nplanning--not political correctness, but the military security of our \ncountry. That is why we have a military.\n  While some may claim that most of the sexual misconduct is not \noccurring during basic training but during follow-on training programs, \nthat claim misses the point. It is my opinion that day 1 of training is \na good place to start--day 1. I strongly support a policy that directly \nstates the rules and values of our military services to new recruits on \nday 1. This policy should clearly dictate to new recruits that the U.S. \nmilitary is about service, honor, and integrity.\n  The sad sagas in the press about sexual misconduct in the military \nand the sorry disrespect on the part of some members for the dignity of \nand the courtesies owed to other members of the military, including \nwomen recruits, can only serve to undermine the appeal of the U.S. \nmilitary to our young men and women.\n  If we want the brightest and the best recruits, we must be committed \nto ensuring that the U.S. military service delivers on its recruiting \npromises of outstanding career opportunities. The best and the \nbrightest will demand no less.\n  But that is only part of the issue, as far as I am concerned. While \nwe must implement policies that attract cream-of-the-crop recruits and \nthat carry through on the promise of providing them with world-class \ntraining, we must also remember that the objective of military service \nis the defense of the Nation. That is the objective of the military \nservice. That is what it is all about. That defense, that security, \nmust be the paramount aim of the Military Establishment. All other \ngoals must be secondary to the goal of establishing the best fighting \nforce that our Nation can field.\n  I have grave concerns--particularly in light of the Kassebaum \nreport--that our current policy is failing to keep its eye on that \nparamount concern.\n  The Kassebaum panel stated:\n\n       There is no more valuable military resource than its \n     personnel, making training indisputably a top priority.\n\n  The panel further noted:\n\n       The principal objective of the military's training programs \n     is to produce an effective, efficient, and ready force. In \n     order to achieve this objective, the training programs must, \n     first and foremost, emphasize and instill discipline.\n\n  I heartily agree with those conclusions. And the Kassebaum report's \nrecommendations supporting separate barracks for men and women during \nbasic training, as well as calling for some same-gender platoons, seem \nto me to be in the best interest of the troops, as well as providing \nthe right atmosphere for sound and serious training. I believe we need \nto do what is best for our national security and what is best for the \nmen and women who join our military forces and whose very lives depend \nupon the quality of the training they receive.\n  Mr. President, last year, I worked with Senator Kempthorne on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. I joined with him on an amendment to \nthe fiscal year 1998 defense authorization bill that created an \nindependent blue-ribbon body to thoroughly examine, review, and \nevaluate the reasons for the ongoing number of sex scandals in training \ncommands. This blue-ribbon panel is also chartered to examine \nfraternization and adultery issues. This panel has been created with \nunquestioned credentials. I believe that the report generated from this \ngroup will be a significant contribution to the body of work on gender \npolicy. I regret that that report will not be completed until next \nyear. And if its recommendations mirror, or reflect, those of \nKassebaum-Baker, it is likely also to be ignored by the powers that be.\n\n[[Page S7096]]\n\n  I also favor the language included in the House of Representatives \nfiscal year 1999 Department of Defense authorization bill that provides \nfor the separation of men and women in training at the basic level. \nEchoing my priority in this regard, the Kassebaum report concludes:\n\n       . . . separating the recruits at the operational training \n     unit level should provide a better environment for teaching \n     military values, including professional relations.\n\n  Again, the bottom line must be about ensuring that military service \nis a profession of service, honor, and integrity. Let us also remember \nthis--let me say it again--the purpose of our Military Establishment, \nwhich costs us scores of billions of dollars, is to protect the \nnational security of these United States, the security interests of the \nUnited States of America.\n  Our military is not an equal employment opportunity commission. It \ndoes not exist to ensure perfect political correctness by responding \naffirmatively to the demands of this group or that interest group or \nsome other interest group. It is the ultimate protector of the \nsovereignty of this mighty Nation and the ultimate protector of the \nfreedoms of her people. That is quite a heavy responsibility and one \nthat needs the most conscientious and vigilant attention to be \nadequately addressed.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in taking a \nconstructive first step towards cleaning up the mess in the military \nand putting some common sense back into the service training regime. I \nlike the way the Marines do it. And I think we ought to take a page out \nof their book.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say possibly on this amendment. As \nof now, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in the debate on the Brownback amendment \nyesterday some Armed Services Committee members observed that the \nBrownback amendment would adopt recommendations of the Kassebaum/Baker \ncommission report by passing the Senate's own commission created last \nyear. It was said that doing so makes a ``mockery'' of the Senate's own \naction, and wastes the time of the 10 members of the commission.\n  Well, Mr. President, Secretary Cohen has flouted the recommendations \nof the Kassebaum/Baker report that he himself commissioned. He has \npromised to implement the easiest recommendations in that report while \npublicly repudiating its core recommendations. He has not waited for \nthe Senate commission's report either. He got out in front of it.\n  Senator Brownback's amendment, and the amendment that I have \nprepared, would say if you are in for a penny, you are in for a pound. \nIf the report has merit--and Secretary Cohen has acknowledged that at \nleast parts of it do have merit in his estimation--then we ought not to \nreject those parts of the report that do not seem politically correct. \nIn fact, the Kassebaum/Baker report notes that ``the committee has made \nrecommendations regarding gender integration in training where \nappropriate, but has also made recommendations regarding the large \nnumber of other issues that we concluded have an impact on the \neffectiveness of the overall training program. It is the committee's \nintention that its recommendations be viewed as a complete package \nsince training is a building-block process beginning with the quality \nof the recruit.''\n  Other Members have reported the objections of senior military \nofficials to the recommendations in the Kassebaum/Baker report. And \nthey have stated their strong support for keeping mixed-gender training \njust the way it currently is.\n  I would remind those officials and my colleagues that not so long ago \nthe military trained women completely separately from men. It was only \nsince the early to mid-1980's that the military began mixing the sexes \nduring the early training phases. I believe, if I recall it correctly, \nthat Army women were trained together at Fort McClellan, which is now \nclosing as a part of the base realignment and closure process.\n  The great social experiment of putting men and women together from \nday 1 in the training process is not, therefore, some hallowed military \ntradition. It is a policy, and if that policy gets in the way of a \nprocess that is designed to remold these undisciplined young \nindividuals into focused disciplined soldiers, then we should not \nhesitate to change it.\n  Our focus must be on national security--not political correctness; \nnot social policy. And the basic safety and security of our recruits \nshould not be compromised.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment may be \ntemporarily laid aside so that others may call up other amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

TERMINATION OF THE EXTREMELY LOW FREQUENCY \n                   COMMUNICATION SYSTEM PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Termination of Program.--The Secretary of the Navy \n     shall terminate the Extremely Low Frequency Communication \n     System program.\n       (b) Payment of Termination Costs.--Funds that are available \n     on or after the date of the enactment of this Act for the \n     Department of Defense for obligation for the Extremely Low \n     Frequency Communication System program of the Navy may be \n     obligated for that program only for payment of the costs \n     associated with the termination of the program.\n       (c) Use of Savings for National Guard.--Funds referred to \n     in subsection (b) that are not necessary for terminating the \n     program under this section shall be transferred (in \n     accordance with such allocation between the Army National \n     Guard and the Air National Guard as the Secretary of Defense \n     shall direct) to funds available for the Army National Guard \n     and the Air National Guard for operation and maintenance for \n     the same fiscal year as the funds transferred, shall be \n     merged with the funds to which transferred, and shall be \n     available for the same period and purposes as the funds to \n     which transferred.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, my amendment terminates the Navy's \nExtremely Low Frequency Communications System and uses the savings from \nit to offset funding increases for our National Guard. I am very \npleased to be joined in introducing this amendment by our senior \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl.\n  Mr. President, the amendment would limit funds appropriated in this \nbill for the Navy's Extremely Low Frequency Communications System or, \nas is it called, Project ELF, and it involves the termination of this \nprogram. It is time to mothball the project and use the savings to \ncorrect a significant shortfall that we have in this authorization bill \nin the funding for the National Guard's operations and maintenance \naccount. Project ELF is in Wisconsin, but it is an ineffective, \nunnecessary, outdated, cold-war relic that is not wanted by most \nresidents of our State.\n  The members of the Wisconsin delegation have consistently fought for \nyears to close down this Project ELF. I have introduced legislation \nduring each Congress that I have been here to terminate it. And I have \nalso attempted and have, in fact, recommended it for closure to the \nDefense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.\n  This project has been opposed by residents of Wisconsin since its \ninception, but for years we were told that the national security \nconsiderations of the cold war outweighed our concerns about having \nthis installation in our State. As we continue our efforts to reduce \nthe Federal budget deficit and as the Department of Defense continues \nto struggle to meet a tighter budget, it is just absolutely clear that \nProject ELF should be closed down. If enacted, this amendment would \nsave approximately $12 million a year.\n  Project ELF is simply a one-way, primitive messenger system designed \nto signal to but not actually communicate with deeply submerged Trident \nsubmarines, so it is really just a bellringer. It is like a pricy \nbeeper system used to tell the submarine when it should rise to the \nsurface to get the actual detailed message through real communications \nsystems. This was designed a long time ago. It was designed when the \nthreat and consequences of detection to our submarines was real. But \nELF was never developed to an effective capability, and the demise of \nthe Soviet threat has certainly rendered at least this program \nunnecessary.\n  With the end of the cold war, Project ELF has become harder and \nharder to justify. Trident submarines no longer need to take this extra \nprecaution against Soviet nuclear forces. They now can surface on a \nregular basis with less danger of detection or attack. They also \nreceive more complicated messages through very low frequency, or VLF, \nradio waves or lengthier messages through satellite systems if it can \nbe done more cheaply.\n  During the 103d Congress, Mr. President, I worked with our former \ncolleague, Senator Nunn from Georgia, and included an amendment in the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 that required a \nreport by the Secretary of Defense on the benefits and the costs of \ncontinued operation of this Project ELF. The report issued by DOD was \nparticularly disappointing because it basically argued that because \nProject ELF may have had a purpose during the cold war, it should \nsomehow continue to operate after the cold war as part of the complete \ncomplement of command and control links that were configured with the \ncold war in mind.\n  So if the question is, Did Project ELF play a role in helping to \nminimize the Soviet threat? Perhaps. Did it do so at risk to the \ncommunity? Perhaps. But does it continue to play a vital security role \nto this Nation? No, it doesn't. It does not have that role.\n\n  In the 1995 rescissions bill, the Senate, as a whole, recommended the \ntermination for Project ELF. Somehow again, though, the program \nsurvived when some conference committee members claimed to have ``newly \nreleased, highly classified justifications'' for the program's \ncontinuation. When I looked into these claims and was assured by the \nNavy and Strategic Command that no new classified justifications \nexisted, I continued my effort to try to get rid of this program. \nAgain, the Senate cut funding for the program in 1996 in the DOD \nauthorization bill but somehow it was again resurrected in conference.\n  I would like you to know that both congressional representatives who \nhave ELF installations in their areas, Representatives Obey and Stupak, \nsupport getting rid of this project. Also, former commander in chief of \nthe Strategic Command, General George Lee Butler, called for an end to \nthe cold-war nuclear weapons practices, of which Project ELF is a \nharrowing reminder.\n  Additionally, the Center for Defense Information called for ending \nthe program, noting that ``U.S. submarines operating under present and \nforeseeable worldwide military conditions can receive all necessary \norders and instructions in timely fashion without need for Project \nELF.''\n  As I mentioned, Mr. President, the savings from terminating this \nProject ELF would offset increases for National Guard operations and \nmaintenance, O As we all know, the National Guard expects this year \na $594 million budget shortfall for the coming year, almost a $600 \nmillion shortfall for our National Guard, and this follows fast on the \nheels of a $743 million shortfall for the National Guard during the \ncurrent fiscal year.\n  According to the National Guard, these shortfalls are, in fact, \ncompromising the Guard's readiness levels, capabilities, force \nstructure, and end strength. The National Guard's O account shortfall \ndirectly affects surface operations tempo, real property maintenance, \ndepot maintenance, information and telecommunications management, and \nmedical support.\n  The President's 1999 budget request leaves the National Guard's O \naccount a significant $450 million below what it really must be in \norder to meet the needs of the Guard and, therefore, the needs of our \nmilitary and our country. The shortfalls have increasingly greater \neffect given the National Guard's increased operations burdens. This is \na result of new missions and increased deployments and training \nrequirements, including the National Guard's critical role in places \nlike Bosnia, the Iraq situation, Haiti and Somalia.\n  Just to give my colleagues some background, as of now the Army \nNational Guard represents 34 percent of all--total Army forces, \nincluding 55 percent of combat divisions and brigades, 46 percent of \nthe combat support, and 25 percent of combat service support. And, yet, \ndespite these very high figures of the critical and central role of the \nNational Guard, the National Guard just gets 9.5 percent of the Army's \nfunding.\n  In total numbers, the National Guard receives just 71 percent of its \nrequested funding as opposed to the Active Army getting 80 percent and \nthe Army Reserves getting 81 percent.\n  It is time we moved toward giving the National Guard adequate and \nequal funding. While this amendment would certainly not achieve funding \nequity for the National Guard, it is a step in the right direction. It \ndoes increase funding for the nation's only constitutionally mandated \ndefense force, the National Guard.\n  Finally, I would like to briefly mention the public health and \nenvironmental concerns that have sometimes been associated with Project \nELF. For almost two decades, we have received\n\n[[Page S7099]]\n\ninconclusive data on this project's effects on Wisconsin and Michigan \nresidents. In 1984, a U.S. district court ordered the project be shut \ndown because the Navy paid inadequate attention to the system's \npossible health effects and violated the national environmental policy. \nInterestingly, that decision was overturned because U.S. national \nsecurity at the time, Mr. President--at the time--prevailed over public \nhealth and environmental concerns. Obviously, at that time the cold war \nwas still occurring.\n  More than 40 medical studies point to a link between electromagnetic \npollution and cancer and abnormalities in both animal and plant \nspecies. Metal fences near the two transmitters must be grounded to \navoid serious shock from the presence of high voltages.\n  Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues this article from this morning's Washington Post. An \ninternational committee, convened by the National Institutes of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences undertook the study of electric and \nmagnetic fields as a possible cause of cancer. Project ELF produces the \nsame kind of electric and magnetic fields cited by this distinguished \ncommittee, and the committee's announcement seems to confirm some of \nthe fears of many Wisconsinites.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed, \nalso to follow my remarks in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Earlier this year, a coalition of fiscal conservatives \nand environmentalists targeted, among other programs, Project ELF, \nbecause it harms both the Federal budget deficit and the environment. \nThe coalition which includes groups like the Concord Coalition, \nTaxpayers for Common Sense, the National Wildlife Federation and \nFriends of the Earth, took aim at about 70 wasteful and dangerous \nprograms, and this was one of them. I hope we heed their suggestion and \nend this program.\n  This amendment achieves two vital goals of many of my colleagues \nhere. It terminates a wasteful and unnecessary cold-war era program, \nwhile providing funding increases for the National Guard. It is truly a \nwin/win situation and I hope my colleagues will support this amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nHealth Panel Urges Power Line Studies--Electric, Magnetic Fields Termed \n                     ``Possible Human Carcinogen''\n\n                            (By Curt Suplee)\n\n       The kind of electric and magnetic fields (EMFs) that \n     typically surround electric power lines should be regarded as \n     a ``possible human carcinogen,'' a federally sponsored \n     advisory panel concluded yesterday.\n       The 29-member international committee, convened by the \n     National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and \n     meeting outside Minneapolis, voted 19 to 9 to consider power-\n     line EMFs as a possible cause of cancer. Eight members found \n     that the fields could not be classified as causing cancer, \n     and one decided that EMFs are probably not carcinogenic in \n     humans.\n       In a statement, NIEHS said that the majority was most \n     influenced by epidemiological studies that ``showed a slight \n     increase in childhood leukemia risk from power-line/\n     residential exposures, and an increase in chronic leukemia \n     risk in adults in electricity-intensive industries.''\n       The possible link between EMFs and cancer is highly \n     controversial. Some other advisory groups, including panels \n     of the National Cancer Institute and National Academy of \n     Sciences, have noted the same association but found it \n     inconclusive.\n       The panel's recommendation will be included in a report \n     that NIEHS, which is part of the National Institutes of \n     Health, is scheduled to present to Congress and regulatory \n     agencies in coming months.\n       ``This report does not suggest that the risk is high,'' \n     said committee chairman Michael Gallo of the University of \n     Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Medical \n     School. ``It is probably quite small, compared to many other \n     public health risks. However, I strongly believe that \n     additional . . . research should be pursued to reduce \n     uncertainties in this arena.''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of this \namendment to eliminate the Extremely Low Frequency or ELF System, and \ntransfer these funds, some $12 million, to the National Guard. I \ncommend my colleague from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, for his \npersistent efforts to kill this cold war relic.\n  It is amazing to me that no matter how many times the Senate votes in \nfavor of eliminating this little known and obsolete system, it \ncontinues to reemerge in conference. In an era of tight budgets, with \npressures to fund operations abroad and maintain modernization efforts \nat home, we need to take a closer took at the ELF System and recognize \nthat we have far more compelling needs even within the defense budget.\n  Project ELF was conceived solely to launch and win a nuclear war. It \nwas designed to protect submerged submarines from Soviet detection. \nUnfortunately, ELF's capabilities are minimal and, given the end of the \ncold war, its rationale is dubious. ELF is a communications system for \nsending one-way pre-formatted messages from shore commands to \nsubmarines operating at high speeds and depth without exposing antennae \non the ocean surface. ELF's message capability is very limited and very \nslow--three letters take 15 minutes to transmit--so a submarine must \nstill surface to retrieve communications. This poses serious questions \nabout the protection ELF can provide to our submarine fleet.\n  ELF's transmitting facilities are located in Clam Lake, WI and \nRepublic, MI. The two antennae work together to strengthen the signal. \nThe Clam Lake antenna is 28 miles long with two sets of wires strung on \ntelephone poles. The wires form an X running several miles out in four \ndirections from the center.\n  The existence of this large antenna in Wisconsin has raised health \nand environmental questions over the years. At best the data on the \nrisks posed by this facility are inconclusive. At worst, more than 40 \nmedical studies point to a link between electromagnetic pollution and \ncancer. The people of Wisconsin would rather not have this question \nmark hanging over their heads.\n  Directing ELF's funding to the National Guard would be a much better \nuse of these funds. The National Guard has been under funded in the \nFY99 budget request and the trend continues in that direction: Unfunded \nrequirements for the Army National Guard could exceed $1.2 billion by \n2002 if current trends continue. Our amendment will help address this \nshortfall.\n  Let me just conclude by noting that people of Wisconsin do not want \nthis system in their borders. For years now, we have been working with \nthe members of Congress in whose districts this system is based to shut \nit down. We almost succeeded in 1995 when the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee rescinded funding for ELF in the Defense supplemental. At \nthat time, I was told that the Navy wasn't interested in funding ELF \nanymore. Furthermore, when the Strategic Command was asked about the \nELF program, it was lukewarm in its support, indicating that they would \nlike to see ELF funded but they couldn't possibly fund it out of their \nown budget. Yet, at the last minute in conference, the House announced \nthat there was new and classified information that supposedly revealed \nthat ELF is essential to national security. The Defense Department has \nsince weighed in with a letter saying it would like to keep ELF.\n  Our inability to kill ELF is a perfect example of how we can't seem \nto shed the Cold War infrastructure that has shaped our defense budgets \nfor so many years. We pay much lip service to ``defense reform'' and \nmaking defense spending relevant to threats of the future, but when we \nhave a small opportunity to demonstrate our resolve in this area, we \ncower at the thought of dismantling even one small system.\n  Mr. President, let's not hesitate this time. Let's eliminate this \nanachronism once and for all. I thank my colleague from Wisconsin for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Feingold amendment \nto terminate the Navy's Extremely Low Frequency communications system.\n  The so-called Project ELF is a vital communications system that \nallows\n\n[[Page S7100]]\n\nthe United States to send messages to submarines that are traveling in \nvery deep water. These messages tell submarines to come closer to the \nsurface to receive more detailed communications. ELF is the only way to \nget a message to attack and ballistic missile submarines when they are \nat their normal operating depths.\n  Contrary to the argument made by the Senator from Wisconsin, Project \nELF is not a cold war relic. The system remains as vital as ever. The \nneed for the United States to have a survivable submarine force remains \nessential. ELF is not only needed to send messages to U.S. ballistic \nmissile submarines but also to attack submarines.\n  In the post-Cold Ware era, the United States will place even greater \nemphasis on the submarine force for strategic deterrence. A survivable \nTrident submarine force is essential. This was reaffirmed in the \nAdministration's Nuclear Posture Review, which recommended the \nretention of 14 Trident submarines for the foreseeable future. In a \nletter to the Armed Services Committee the Commander-in-Chief of the \nU.S. Strategic Command, wrote the following: ``Both ELF communications \nsites, operating simultaneously, are needed to meet our worldwide \nrequirements. Dismantling this critical system would unacceptably \nimpact the survivability and flexibility of our submarine force.'' Just \nthis week the nominee to be the next Commander-in-Chief of Strategic \nCommand, Admiral Richard Mies, reaffirmed STRATCOM's strong support for \nthe ELF system.\n  The need for a survivable U.S. submarine force did not end with the \nCold War. Russia retains an aggressive anti-submarine warfare program \ndesigned to develop advanced capabilities to track and destroy all \ntypes of U.S. submarines. The United States continues to invest \nbillions of dollars to maintain and modernize our submarine force. \nOther countries, such as Iran, are also acquiring an attack submarine \nforce.\n  Congress continues to strongly support development of a New Attack \nSubmarine. This important submarine modernization program is justified, \nin part, by Russia's aggressive ASW program. If the Senate is willing \nto sustain such programs, we should sustain Project ELF. If we \nterminate this communications program we will save approximately $10 \nmillion per year, but put at risk a multi-billion dollar investment in \nour submarine force.\n  The assertion has also been made that the ELF system may pose a \npublic health threat. There is no evidence to substantiate this \nassertion. This question has been extensively studied. Each assessment \nhas concluded that there is no risk to public safety.\n  The Department of Defense opposes the Feingold legislation to \nterminate project ELF. In a letter dated May 7, 1997, the DOD General \nCounsel wrote that: ``The Department of Defense, Joint Staff, the \nDepartment of the Navy, and U.S. Strategic Command all agree on the \nnecessity of maintaining the ELF system.'' The letter also stated that: \n``ELF is the only communications system available that ensures the \nmaintenance of these critical communication links. Costly new research \nand development would have to be done to provide another communications \npath to our submarines to ensure our ability to communicate at speed \nand depth.''\n  Mr. President, in summary, this amendment would jeopardize the \nsecurity of the entire U.S. submarine force. There is no benefit to \ncanceling this program and the risk of doing so is extremely high. I \nurge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will use a bit more of the time I am \nallotted. I would like to briefly respond to the distinguished \nchairman. He indicated, first of all, the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan, who is a member of the Armed Services Committee, has been a \ncritic of the Project ELF program long prior to the time I was serving \nin the Senate. Surely the Senator from Michigan would not support such \na termination if it truly was a threat to our entire submarine system \nand our national security.\n  In particular, Mr. President, there were apparently, at least \narguably, benefits to this program at one point. But these \njustifications that have just been identified no longer can be \ndefended. I tried very hard for 5 years to find exactly what it is that \nis so critical that this system does, and I can't find it. Let me \nreview briefly what the problem is with this ELF program.\n  It is an unsophisticated technology which is designed to only signal \nto, not actually substantively communicate with, a deeply submerged \nTrident submarine. It is entirely ineffective in communicating anything \nof substance. While Project ELF may provide an additional form of \ncommunication, it is really just redundant over the communications \nsystems we now have at this time.\n  Any benefit from this is just marginal. It cannot communicate \nmessages. It can just give phonetic-letter-spelled-out messages at the \nrate of 1 pulse per 5 minutes. And wartime messages, except messages to \nstrike, presumably would require more sophisticated methods.\n  We are dismantling our first-strike capability. In order to act in \ncombat, submarines have to come to the surface anyway, Mr. President, \nin order to receive messages and to launch missiles. So they are at \nrisk of detection anyway at precisely the moment that we are talking \nabout. Even in its optimum construction, Project ELF has no nuclear \nsurvivability; it has no nuclear dependability and, thus, it really \ndoesn't have any wartime efficacy.\n  The justifications that have been given again here are the old ones. \nThey do not fit the reality of the post-Soviet submarine era, and that \nis the reason why there is a justification for this amendment. It saves \nmoney, and it provides funding for our National Guard that desperately \nneeds the help.\n  This is what is sometimes so frustrating about trying to ask the \nDefense Department just to give up something that they don't need. I \nunderstand criticisms of proposals for across-the-board cuts that \nmindlessly say, ``Let's just cut out a percentage of the defense \nbudget.'' That can't possibly be a reflection of the needs of our \nnational security. But when a careful effort has been made over many \nyears by Members of both bodies of our Congress to identify a specific \nprogram as outdated and is a cold-war relic, it seems to me it is our \njob in this body to say, ``Wait a minute; this $12 million a year is \nwasted.''\n  I am not even asking in this amendment that it be put into some other \narea of Government. I am asking that it be put into our National Guard, \nwhich I can tell you, having visited several armories in Wisconsin \nrecently, the National Guard in Wisconsin has inventory problems. They \ncan't get the training they need, and they don't have the personnel \nthey need. They are, unlike Project ELF, critical to our national \nsecurity.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 45 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to those who have \nalready spoken in support of the defense authorization bill. Providing \nfor the common defense is the single most important responsibility of a \nnational government. If we fail in this regard, all the other aspects \nof our public policy become irrelevant. I am particularly pleased with \nthe significant role that my own State of Maine plays in our national \ndefense.\n  The legislation brought to us by the Armed Services Committee--and I \ncommend the leaders of the committee for their tremendous efforts--\nrecognizes Maine's contributions in a number of ways. Perhaps none is \nmore significant than the contribution of the State of Maine in the \nfield of naval shipbuilding. This is where the skill and the dedication \nof Maine workers at Bath Iron Works provide the U.S. Navy with state-\nof-the-art Arleigh Burke class destroyers, the backbone of our \ndestroyer fleet. Fortunately, this bill ensures this will be true for \nyears to come, because the legislation continues the Navy's multiyear \nprocurement program for the Arleigh Burke class.\n  The bill also provides funding for the new LPD-17 amphibious ship \nwhich will be built in Bath and will help the Marine Corps maintain its \nlocal reach for years to come.\n  Moreover, this bill provides continued funding for the Navy's next \ngeneration of destroyers, the DD-21. With the\n\n[[Page S7101]]\n\nDD-21, Mainers will continue to play a pivotal role on the cutting edge \nof American sea power through Bath's participation in the \n``shipbuilding alliance'' that will construct this powerful and \ninnovative new ship for our 21st-century Navy.\n  Other provisions of importance to my State increase funding to \nmodernize and reconfigure the Navy's P-3 maritime patrol aircraft. This \nshould permit these tried-and-true workhorses of naval aviation, \noperating out of bases such as the Brunswick Naval Air Station in \nMaine, to continue protecting our security for years to come. This bill \nalso recognizes and supports the contributions of a number of very \nimportant defense contractors in Maine, including Saco Defense, Pratt & \nWhitney and Fiber Materials International of Biddeford.\n  Furthermore, having learned a great deal about the extraordinary \nhigh-tech chemical and biological sensor laboratory at the University \nof Maine, I am also proud of the groundbreaking role Maine is playing \nin this crucial field. Recent events in Iraq and elsewhere illustrate \nthe grave threats posed by the proliferation of chemical and biological \nweapons, the so-called poor man's atomic bomb. If we are to protect \nAmericans against such threats, our troops in the field and our \ncitizens at home need access to small, portable, state-of-the-art \nsensors capable of detecting such threats quickly and efficiently. I am \nproud that the University of Maine and Maine companies, such as Sensor \nResearch & Development, are playing such an important role in preparing \nto meet this need and that this legislation supports funding for this \nimportant research program and other very significant defense projects \nat the University of Maine.\n  Maine will also contribute to our national defense in the development \nof advanced composite materials--a field in which Fiber Materials \nInternational, of Biddeford, Maine, is a world leader. From structural \nskin elements of advanced NASA spacecraft to the nose tips and other \ncomponents for a whole generation of high-tech missile systems, FMI \nprovides this country with the very best in fiber composite materials. \nAnother world leader from Maine is the Pratt & Whitney plant in South \nBerwick, Maine, which produces engine components for the F-15 Eagle.\n  I should also note that this bill also aims to help ensure that the \nDefense Finance and Accounting Service meets its cost-cutting goals in \na responsible manner--by requiring a careful study of how best to \nbalance DFAS infrastructure reductions before the Department of Defense \nundertakes any such cuts. This ought to help Maine, and other states, \navoid any unfair burden from cuts in facilities such as the award-\nwinning DFAS center in Limestone, Maine. I commend my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Maine, for her amendment requiring this study.\n  As a state with one of the highest per-capita populations of veterans \nin the country, Maine will also gain from this bill's provision for \nthree demonstration projects designed to help the Department of Defense \ndetermine the best way to provide health care to Medicare-eligible \nveterans over the age of 65. Among the demonstration projects this \nlanguage would authorize is an effort to extend FEHBP benefits to \nMedicare-eligible veterans. This provision is itself modeled upon a \nbill introduced by Senator Bond which I have cosponsored. Through such \ndemonstration projects, we hope to be able to fill a significant gap in \nthe health care our country provides to military retirees.\n  As a final observation, I would like to point out that this defense \nauthorization bill also includes language I introduced that will \nrelease federal interests in the Kennebec Arsenal in Augusta, Maine. \nThe national government actually transferred this property to Maine \nnearly a century ago, but this conveyance had a number of strings \nattached--among them the requirement that the land only be used for a \nmental hospital. Today, these conditions are wholly obsolete, and this \nhistoric site is in great need of repair and historical preservation. \nThe language I introduced which has been incorporated into the defense \nauthorization bill will finally release the Kennebec Arsenal, without \nconditions, to the people of Maine. Augusta, ME, has very exciting \nplans for renovating this historic structure.\n  All in all, this defense authorization bill represents far-sighted \nthinking about the challenges of U.S. defense policy in the years \nahead. For this alone, it deserves our support. I am however, \nparticularly pleased that this bill recognizes Maine's role in our \ndefense preparedness and our state's pivotal position on the forefront \nof defense research and development, and that it builds upon them in \norder to ensure our security in the 21st Century. Mr. President, I urge \nmy colleagues to support this legislation, and I, again, salute the \nleaders of the Armed Services Committee for their impressive efforts.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3011\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Byrd \namendment and speak in favor of that amendment. I will not take very \nlong, but I do want to draw some points of attention to my colleagues.\n  This amendment is about separate barracks and separate training. We \nhad a thorough debate on this yesterday, so I don't need to speak for a \nlong period of time. This amendment, in my estimation, is a very \nsensible step in restoring privacy and dignity to the military basic \ntraining experience.\n  The amendment codifies--I want to make this point very clear to my \ncolleagues--this amendment, actually more than the one I put forward \nyesterday, this amendment codifies the Kassebaum-Baker recommendation, \na unanimous commission, a bipartisan recommendation of separate-gender \nbarracks facilities, and this goes on to say also during basic training \nseparate-gender training.\n  This is also what has passed the House. So if my colleagues ask the \nquestion, Is this moving too far forward? I want to point a couple \nthings out to them. This is the unanimous recommendation of the \nKassebaum-Baker commission. This is the recommendation. This is what \nhas passed the House of Representatives. This is what the Marines \ncurrently do, and it is what most of the branches, up until this \ndecade, did as well.\n  But the sole point I actually want to make to my colleagues is this. \nWe have had a good airing of this. When you come down to vote on this \nbill, will you please think of your daughters and your sons and sending \nthem to basic training? I just ask and beg of you, please just think \nabout your 18-year-old children.\n  And when you send them off to basic training--would you ask yourself, \nas you vote: Do I want to send my young daughter--in my case, Abby and \nLiz--do I want to send my 18-year-old daughter to basic training--I \nwant them to serve their country; I really do want them to serve their \ncountry--but do I want to send them to basic training, 18 years old, \nand be able to have a male drill sergeant come in and out at any time \nof the day or night, such as in the cases that have taken place and \ntake place?\n  Do I want to have them in the same barracks facility as other 18-\nyear-old men, who, at the end of the day, may be looking for other \nthings to do? Is that where I want to put Abby and Elizabeth? Is that \nwhere you want to put your daughters, your children?\n  This is not a wild idea or notion that Senator Byrd has put forward. \nIt is common sense. It is the thing we ought to do. And so when the \nSenators cast their votes tonight, I hope when they write down that \nvote, they will think about their daughters, their granddaughters, \ntheir sons, their grandsons, and America, and ask, What is really best \nhere?\n  Let us not hide behind another commission. A lot of people just want \nto do that--``Let's have another commission''--and we will do a \ncommission until it reports out the way some people want. Let us just \ndo what we know is right, what we have been doing with the Kassebaum-\nBaker commission reports, what has already passed, and let us pass the \nByrd amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S7102]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2808\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Could I inquire of the Chair as to what the pending \nbusiness is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the amendment of the \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. President. I would like to speak briefly. \nI am not sure if we had an official time agreement on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no official time agreement.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I have some brief remarks I have to add to those by the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee. I may have additional \ncomments later, but I think this will be all that I have to add.\n  Mr. President, I rise today with the Department of Defense, the U.S. \nStrategic Command, the United States Navy, the Commander of the \nAtlantic Fleet Submarine Force, the Wisconsin State Conference of the \nInternational Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the Wisconsin and \nMichigan District of the International Brotherhood of Electrical \nWorkers, and the Upper Peninsula Building and Construction Trades \nCouncil, in opposing the amendment offered by my friend from Wisconsin, \nMr. Feingold.\n  Because our time is limited, I will get right to the point. The \nprogram which is defined in this amendment as the ELF program is of \ncritical importance to the United States military. It has been for many \nyears, and continues to be today, even in this post-cold-war \nenvironment. No other system can replace it, and if we eliminate it, \nour submarines will be forced to operate at lower speeds, shallower \ndepths, less maneuverability, and will therefore be more vulnerable to \ndetection and attack from hostile forces.\n  Last year, the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, General \nHabiger, told the Senate Armed Services Committee:\n\n       As the only system capable of communicating with submarines \n     operating deep beneath the ocean surface, ELF is key to \n     enhancing the security and flexibility of that submarine \n     force. Without ELF, submarines must communicate at shallow \n     depth and slow speed with increased vulnerability to \n     detection and decreased operation flexibility. The capability \n     to operate at depth and speed is even more important in \n     today's post Cold War environment. . . . From a security \n     standpoint, ELF is critical to maintaining our hedge against \n     current and future ASW [anti-submarine warfare] threats.\n\n  In fact, Mr. President, the Department of Defense recently wrote the \nSenate Armed Services Committee and stated that maintaining our \ndeterrence and commitments under current arms control agreements and \nunilateral U.S. initiatives require the continued operation of ELF. The \nUnited States Navy is planning additional upgrades to this system \nbecause new command and control procedures will place an even greater \nreliance on ELF. Similar statements of support have been made by the \nprevious and prospective Commanders of the U.S. Strategic Command, \nAdmiral Chiles and Admiral Mies. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. \nPresident, that the letters from the Department of Defense, and both \nAdmirals be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Defense,\n\n\n                                              General Counsel,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is in response to your request for \n     the views of the Department of Defense on S. 59, 105th \n     Congress, a bill ``To Terminate the Extremely Low Frequency \n     Communication System of the Navy.''\n       The Department of Defense opposes enactment of S. 59.\n       The Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) Communication System is a \n     unique and highly effective means of one-way communication \n     from U.S. based operational commanders to ballistic missile \n     submarines (SSBNs) and selected fast attack submarines (SSNs) \n     at operational depths and speeds. In fact, it is the only \n     system capable of communicating with submarines operating \n     deep beneath the ocean surface. This is critical if both \n     SSBNs and SSNs are to utilize their full range of tactical \n     capabilities. While other communication systems require \n     submarines to deploy an antenna at or near the surface, the \n     ELF system allows communication further from the surface \n     thereby increasing operational flexibility and maximizing the \n     stealth inherent in our nuclear submarines. Two ELF \n     transmission sites are required to maintain worldwide \n     communications coverage.\n       As a consequence of arms control agreements and unilateral \n     U.S. initiatives, we have reduced the number of alert \n     strategic weapons and forces. Accordingly, our strategic \n     deterrent posture relies increasingly on flexible, \n     responsive, highly survivable submarine forces. The ELF \n     provides an important operational capability for SSBNs and \n     SSNs. This legislation seeks to terminate this important \n     program. Without ELF, submarines must communicate at shallow \n     depths with increased vulnerability to detection and \n     decreased operational flexibility. ELF enables a broader \n     range of nuclear weapon de-posturing possibilities that can \n     be implemented if required. Termination of ELF would \n     seriously degrade submarine operations, by reducing \n     responsiveness, and potentially survivability, of submarines \n     because they would need to resort to less survivable \n     communication postures.\n       The Department of Defense, Joint Staff, the Department of \n     the Navy, and U.S. Strategic Command all agree on the \n     necessity of maintaining the ELF system. In fact, the \n     Department's recently completed comprehensive review of the \n     Nuclear Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence \n     System, conducted in support of the Department's Nuclear \n     Posture Review, strongly supported the continued operation of \n     the ELF system.\n       Fiscal constraints have mandated a reduction in the fixed \n     submarine broadcast system. As the world coverage and \n     redundancy of our communication networks are reduced, the ELF \n     system ensures SSBNs can operate in all patrol areas and meet \n     stringent connectivity requirements. The ELF system supports \n     the rapid repositioning of SSBNs for contingency target \n     coverage while maintaining continuous communications from the \n     National Command Authority. Likewise, the ELF system provides \n     immediate, dependable communications with SSNs operating in a \n     multitude of theaters, communication which is essential to \n     successful accomplishment of their assigned missions. ELF is \n     the only communications system available that ensures the \n     maintenance of these critical communication links. Costly new \n     research and development would have to be done to provide \n     another communication path to our submarines to ensure our \n     ability to communicate at speed and depth.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that, from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program, there is no \n     objection to the presentation of this report for the \n     consideration of the committee.\n           Sincerely,\n     Judith A. Miller.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Department of Defense,\n\n\n                                       U.S. Strategic Command,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 5, 1995.\n     Hon. C.W. Bill Young,\n     Chairman, House Appropriations Subcommittee on National \n         Security, Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Among the potential FY96 House \n     Appropriation Bill Floor Amendments is one which prohibits \n     Navy Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) Communications funding. \n     Project ELF is essential for the effective use of the most \n     critical leg of the strategic TRIAD. Therefore, I will \n     reiterate some of the important facts surrounding ELF.\n       Post-Cold War reposturing and arms control agreements have \n     resulted in placing more emphasis on submarines as the major \n     leg of our nuclear deterrence. The ELF Communications System \n     is the only system capable of communicating with submarines \n     operating deep beneath the ocean's surface. This allows \n     ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) and attack submarines \n     (SSNs), as well, to utilize their full range of tactical \n     capabilities and maximize inherent stealth, thereby providing \n     the operational flexibility needed to support command and \n     control requirements stemming from force structure and \n     mission changes.\n       ELF is also the only communications system that supports \n     rapid reposturing of SSBNs for contingency target coverage by \n     allowing continuous connectivity with the submarine while it \n     transits at design depth and speed. ELF provides the SSBN the \n     ability to train and exercise within the full envelop of its \n     capabilities and maintain the ability to rapidly respond to \n     National Command Authorities' orders. Both ELF communications \n     sites, operating simultaneously, are needed to meet our \n     worldwide requirements. Dismantling this critical system \n     would unacceptably impact the survivability and flexibility \n     of our submarine forces.\n       Your continued support is greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 H.G. Chiles, Jr.,\n     Admiral, U.S. Navy, Commander in Chief.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Commander Submarine Force,\n\n\n                                          U.S. Atlantic Fleet,\n\n                                       Norfolk, VA, June 15, 1998.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for the opportunity to respond \n     to the questions from the Senate Armed Services Committee. It \n     is an honor to have been nominated by the President to be \n     Commander in Chief, U.S. Strategic Command. I respectfully \n     submit the enclosed responses to your questions on\n\n[[Page S7103]]\n\n     the important defense policy and management issues and look \n     forward to working with you and the Committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Richard W. Mies,\n                                                Vice Admiral, USN.\n       Enclosure.\n\n                 Extremely Low Frequency Communications\n\n       Question 54: Do you support continued operation of the \n     Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) communications system?\n       Answer. Yes, I support continued operation of the ELF \n     communications system. A strong command and control \n     capability remains of utmost importance to the success of our \n     Nation's strategic deterrence. Post-Cold War strategic force \n     reductions have resulted in more emphasis on submarines in \n     our strategic triad. ELF is a unique and highly effective \n     system capable of one-way communications with strategic \n     submarines at secure operating depths and speeds. While other \n     communications systems require a submarine to deploy an \n     antenna at or near the ocean surface, the ELF system allows \n     communication further from the surface thereby increasing \n     operational flexibility and maximizing the stealth inherent \n     in our strategic submarines. Both ELF transmissions sites, \n     operating simultaneously, are required to meet our worldwide \n     requirements.\n       Question 55: Do you believe that this system is cost \n     effective and necessary, especially in light of other U.S. \n     decisions to downgrade U.S. strategic command and control?\n       Answer. The ELF system is very cost effective. A nuclear \n     command and control review conducted in support of the \n     Nuclear Posture Review strongly supported the continued \n     operation of the ELF system. Loss of this critical system \n     would adversely impact the survivability and flexibility of \n     our strategic submarine force.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. The second argument made by the opponents of ELF are \nthat significant cost savings can be achieved by closing ELF. However, \nif the operational requirement is still valid, as we have shown that it \nis, and if that requirement can only be met with this facility, then an \ninvestment of about $15 million per year is, in my opinion, a very \nworthwhile expenditure to provide the greatest operational capability \nfor U.S. submarine forces. Furthermore, because of the requirement \ndelineated by the Department of Defense to keep this capability for our \narms control deterrence requirements, the Department states they will \nhave to spend additional money on research for a replacement system \nwhich has not yet been developed, additional money which would swallow \nup any of the costs savings claimed by the opponents of ELF.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the opponents of ELF claim the facility is an \nenvironmental hazard. As for the environmental impact, the Navy has \ninitiated and funded an ongoing environmental monitoring program \nmanaged by an independent organization, I.I.T. Research Institute of \nChicago, Illinois and R.D.L. Corporation. The combined results of these \nstudies have found no adverse effect on animals, plants, or micro-\norganisms.\n  And, Mr. President, this study was exhaustive. It studied such \ndiverse ecological issues as the degradation of bogs in Wisconsin, tree \nphysiology and growth, earthworm, soil amoebas and slime molds, bees, \nbirds, chipmunks--everything. It found no adverse effect on the \nenvironment because of the ELF transmissions. This study was further \nreviewed by the National Research Council in 1997, and they agreed with \nthe Navy's findings of no adverse ecological effects.\n  Furthermore, in 1996, the National Academy of Science, in an \nexhaustive study of the effects of electromagnetic radiation on humans, \ndetermined that\n\n       After examining more than 500 studies spanning 17 years of \n     research, the committee said there is no conclusive evidence \n     that electromagnetic fields play a role in the development of \n     cancer, reproductive and developmental abnormalities, or \n     learning and behavioral problems.\n\n  That, Mr. President, is pretty conclusive evidence, I think, of ELF's \nsafety.\n  So, Mr. President, we have a choice. We can choose to squarely \nanalyze the scientific research at hand, listen to the operational \nrequirements of military Commanders, and provide our submarines, and \nthe men and women that sail them, the best possible chance of achieving \ntheir mission, let alone survival. Or we can choose to force our \nsailors to operate without the equipment they need, placing them in \ngreater danger. For just under $150,000 per submarine, the equivalent \nof the personnel costs of seven junior sailors, we can provide every \nsubmarine the capability of running deep, fast, silent and deadly \ninstead of shallow, slow, noisy and vulnerable.\n  Mr. President, please let me close with a quote from Joe Stranger, \nPresident of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, \nWisconsin State Conference.\n\n       The United States still has enemies that relish our demise \n     and this [ELF] system is a decided advantage to any submarine \n     operation in protection of our way of life. This system does \n     not only protect this Country, but also protects those \n     valuable lives of American servicemen and women who operate \n     those submarines in the line of duty. I do not believe the \n     minimal savings is worth the risk.\n\n  Mr. President, I could not say this any better. I therefore urge my \ncolleagues to reject this amendment and protect our sailors.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It is a great joy working with the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan, and I regret having to be on the opposite side \nof this amendment, especially since it is our two States that are most \naffected by this project--ELF.\n  But this truly is a project in search of a justification. It had a \npurpose in the cold war. But when the Senator from Michigan lays out \nthe purpose of the program, what isn't clearly identified is all this \nProject ELF does. He talks about the slower speeds and the fact that \nthe submarines have to come up. But that is premised, somehow, on the \nnotion that the submarines are being told something of any detail while \nthey are submerged. They are not. Project ELF can only tell the \nsubmarine: ``Come up.'' It is sort of like: ``ET, phone home.'' That is \nall you get. ``Come up and get your messages. Check your answering \nmachine.''\n  While the submarine is submerged, it cannot learn what the threat is, \nit cannot get instructions, it cannot get anything. All it gets is a \nmessage that it has to come up anyway, that it has to slow down anyway.\n  For 5 years I have been searching for a justification for something \nthat is nothing more than really a very primitive beeper system that \nyou can't communicate back with and you can't get any real information \nfrom. The only justification for it was the fact that we had a threat \nfrom Soviet nuclear submarines. That threat is no longer there, and \nthere is no two-way communication that comes from this.\n  Again, this is one of the sad moments where a program comes into \nexistence and somehow, because it once was supposed to have a \njustification under another set of facts, under another series of \nthreats, it just keeps going because a couple of people in the military \nsay it still might be handy.\n  The problem with that is, this is real money. It is $12 million a \nyear that could be spent on a number of things. Under my amendment, we \nwould spend it on our true national security. This is about priorities \nwithin our national security. I believe an archaic ELF system is less \nimportant than putting $12 million a year into the National Guard, \nwhich is underfunded under this bill. The needs of the National Guard \narmories, the inventory, the training, are underfunded under the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill.\n  All I am trying to do here is to balance this, to say let's get rid \nof something that really isn't necessary, that really is primitive, \nthat doesn't provide the sophisticated kind of communication that is \nclaimed, and instead provide help to our hard-working men and women who \nare part of our National Guard and who now comprise a very significant \npart of what our Army does in this country.\n  This is an unusual situation. Both Senators from our State and the \nState where this exists are saying, ``Please get rid of this program.'' \nHow often do Senators from a State go to the base closure system and \nsay please take something out of our State? I assure Members, neither \nSenator Kohl nor I would propose such a thing if we were not convinced \nafter years of efforts that this program did not have a national \nsecurity implication, that it was outdated, it was a waste of money, \nand the money was better used helping our National Guard.\n  I ask our colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of our time.\n\n[[Page S7104]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Feingold \namendment be set aside pending the disposition of the unanimous consent \nagreement which is going to be propounded shortly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. While we are lining up the next speaker, I urge my \ncolleagues to help in bringing this to a conclusion. It is a quarter to \n7. We haven't locked in an agreement to get a sequence of votes on \namendments and final passage. If we don't get that done right away, we \nwill be here past 10 o'clock. So it is time we cut our speeches short \nand get the vote scheduled and bring this to a conclusion. Otherwise, \nwe will be here into the wee hours of the morning.\n  I want to thank Senators Warner, McCain, Thurmond, and Levin for \ntrying to put together an agreement. We need to get it done and quit \ntalking and get to the final votes on this defense bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does that mean that the leader does not wish to speak on \nthe Byrd amendment?\n  Mr. LOTT. I do not wish to speak on the Byrd amendment. I support it, \nand I urge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is a great example by our leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Byrd \namendment No. 3011.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask that the pending business be laid \naside pending the propounding of the unanimous consent, which will be \nshortly. In the meantime, I ask that the Senator from Maine be \nrecognized for her remarks. I believe by the time that the Senator from \nMaine has completed her remarks, we will be ready with the unanimous \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I will speak to the Byrd amendment. The \nfact is, I am rather surprised that the Senator from West Virginia \noffered this amendment as a second-degree amendment, considering the \nfact that last night the Senate, in its wisdom, upheld the second-\ndegree amendment that I offered to the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Kansas.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for the propounding of a unanimous \nconsent agreement?\n  Ms. SNOWE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent request\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nByrd amendment and the underlying Gramm amendment be laid aside, and \nthe following Senators be recognized in the following order, under the \nfollowing time, with no second-degree amendments in order, except those \nlisted prior to votes in relation to amendments.\n  The Feingold amendment, 2 minutes of debate by the distinguished \nchairman, Senator Thurmond, on the Feingold amendment, which would then \ncomplete all debate on the Feingold amendment; the Bumpers amendment, \nrelative to the F-22, limited to 30 minutes under the control of \nSenator Bumpers, 10 minutes under the control of the chairman, and 5 \nminutes under the control of Senator Cleland; the Byrd amendment, with \n20 minutes reserved prior to a vote on the Byrd amendment, which would \nbe 5 minutes for Senator Byrd, 5 minutes for Senator Levin, 5 minutes \nfor Senator Snowe, and 5 minutes for Senator Kennedy. Following that, \nSenator Thompson will be recognized for a colloquy regarding State \ntaxation. Senator Ford will be recognized on the same subject for up to \n10 minutes. Following that will be a Thurmond-Levin amendment relative \nto pay, on which there will be 2 minutes, equally divided; a Burns \namendment relative to milcon, with 5 minutes equally divided; a McCain \nsecond-degree amendment to the Burns amendment, limited to 5 minutes \nunder the control of Senator McCain and 10 minutes under the control of \nSenator Stevens. Then the 2 managers will be recognized to do a series \nof cleared amendments. Following that will be a Warner-Levin-Lott \namendment regarding the naming of the bill.\n\n  I further ask that following the disposition or conclusion of debate \non the above list of amendments, votes begin at no earlier than 8 p.m. \nand no later than 8:30 p.m. in a stacked sequence, and that the Byrd \namendment relative to gender recur after disposition of the Bumpers \namendment, with 10 minutes equally divided for closing remarks, and a \nvote to occur on the Byrd amendment.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of the Byrd amendment, \nand prior to disposition of the Gramm amendment, 4 minutes be equally \ndivided on the Gramm amendment; that the Gramm amendment be deemed \nagreed to, and the Senate proceed to the remaining sequenced votes, \nwith 2 minutes for debate between each vote for explanation.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of the above listed \namendments, the bill be advanced to the third reading.\n  Mr. President, in keeping with that, I have every expectation that \nnot all time that is allowed will be used under this time agreement, in \nthe interest of comity to other Senators who are having to leave the \ncountry tonight on official business. I hope we can shrink these times \nthat have been agreed to.\n  Mr. President, I modify my agreement and ask that the 2 managers be \nrecognized after the vote on final passage to do a series of cleared \namendments.\n  Mr. COATS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. The Senator \nfrom Indiana had requested time to speak on the Byrd amendment. I \nthought it was going to be incorporated into the unanimous consent \nrequest. I think it was inadvertently omitted. The Senator from Indiana \nwould like to have 5 minutes along with the others.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I modify the unanimous consent request and \nask that following the remarks of the Senator from Maine, the Senator \nfrom Indiana be recognized for 5 minutes to speak on the Byrd amendment \nas well.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I hope \nnot to. I have just been informed that we have to clear up one \nadditional issue on this side. I surely hope not to object. We worked \nvery hard on this unanimous consent agreement. We are going to have to \nreserve that right for another couple of moments while one issue, and \npossibly two, are cleared up, which I have just been informed about.\n  I suggest, if the Senator from Arizona is willing, laying aside the \nunanimous consent request, and if the Senator from Maine would be \nwilling to be interrupted again, assuming we can quickly get clearance, \nperhaps we could do that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will try not to have to repeat the unanimous-consent \nagreement.\n  Mr. COATS. I just ask the Senator, if he would, instead of having the \nSenator from Indiana speak on the Byrd amendment following the Senator \nfrom Maine, if I could be incorporated into that order that was listed \nthere to speak immediately prior to Senator Byrd's closing on the Byrd \namendment.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I further modify my unanimous-consent \nrequest and ask that prior to the disposition of the vote on the Byrd \namendment, that there be 25 minutes equally divided, with 5 minutes for \nSenator Byrd, 5 minutes for Senator Levin, 5 minutes for Senator Snowe, \n5 minutes for Senator Kennedy, and 5 minutes for Senator Coats.\n  Mr. President, I will await approval from the other side of this \nunanimous-consent request. I appreciate the patience and forbearance of \nthe Senator from Maine.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is temporarily withdrawn, and the \nSenator from Maine is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3011\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment that \nhas been offered by the Senator from West Virginia. As I said earlier, \nI was very much surprised that he would offer such an amendment \nbecause, first of all, last night, the Senate affirmed the\n\n[[Page S7105]]\n\nposition of supporting the initiative that was taken by this Senate \nlast year in creating a commission to examine all of these far-reaching \nissues with respect to gender-integrated training. That vote was 56-37. \nIt was a very strong vote in reinforcing the position of this body and, \nyes, this Congress, that we needed to have an independent analysis of \nmany of the issues surrounding gender-integrated training.\n  In fact, I was very much surprised because the author of this \namendment, the Senator from West Virginia, was a primary cosponsor of \nthe initiative that was introduced in the Senate last year to create \nthis commission. I was a cosponsor of the amendment, and the prime \nsponsor was Senator Kempthorne as Chair of the Subcommittee on \nPersonnel. We discussed that initiative in the committee. At first, I \ndidn't think it was necessary. After all, we had the Kassebaum-Baker \ncommission, and I didn't think we needed to duplicate those efforts. \nBut as I thought about it, I realized how important it was to create a \nconsensus on this issue because there were many Members within Congress \nand outside that were still concerned about various aspects of gender-\nintegrated training at the basic training level.\n  I visited many installations. I understand the importance of creating \ncohesiveness within a unit from day one. But I was also prepared to \naccept the compromise, and the compromise was the creation of this \ncommission that was sponsored by Senator Kempthorne, cosponsored by the \nSenator from West Virginia and myself in the committee.\n  I would like to read to you some words by the Senator from West \nVirginia in the committee last year, with reference to this commission. \nHe said:\n\n       May I thank and congratulate Senator Kempthorne in offering \n     this amendment and conducting the hearings in relation to the \n     subject matter of the amendment. I congratulate, also, the \n     distinguished Senator from Georgia, Mr. Cleland, who was \n     present at the hearings while Senator Snowe and all who \n     participated took an active part. Let me say that I am a \n     cosponsor of the Kempthorne amendment, and I thank Senator \n     Kempthorne for including me as a cosponsor. It will give us \n     an integrated set of conclusions and recommendations on the \n     various parts of the military gender issue, including \n     training, fraternization and adultery practices and \n     regulations. It will allow us an independent review by a body \n     selected by the Senate of the assessment and recommendations \n     to be made by all 3 bodies, established by Secretary Cohen to \n     look at the various elements of the issue. I congratulate \n     Secretary Cohen as well, in absentia, for proceeding to take \n     action as he has. The American people need to know we are \n     thoroughly investigating and settling the great uncertainties \n     that have arisen about the management of our Armed Forces. A \n     national debate is underway on this issue, and if we do not \n     resolve the issue satisfactorily, recruitment and retention \n     may be seriously affected. The deadline of April 15, 1998--\n\n  Which we ultimately postponed and deferred.\n\n     gives us ample time in the next session to act on whatever \n     recommendations we may choose to act upon.\n\n  The final legislation created a deadline of March of 1999, in which \nthis commission will come back to this Congress and make \nrecommendations with respect to all the issues that now have been \nincluded in the Byrd second-degree amendment.\n  The second-degree amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia \nincludes all kinds of issues on basic training, separate platoons, \nseparate housing--all of the issues that ultimately will be evaluated \nby this commission that is represented with a breadth of experience and \nqualifications by 10 different individuals--individuals that are \nappointed by the Chairman of the Armed Forces Committee here in the \nSenate, ranking members and the leadership here in the Senate, as well \nas the Chairman and the ranking member of the House National Security \nCommittee and their leadership. But the commission will appoint \nindividuals of knowledge and expertise in one or more of the following \nareas:\n\n  Training of military personnel, social and cultural matters affecting \nmilitary service, military training, military readiness, knowledge and \nexpertise to be found through research, policymaking, practical \nexperience as demonstrated by retired military personnel and members of \nthe Reserve components of the Armed Forces, representatives from \neducational organizations, civilian, as well as other government \nagencies. They will look at functions related to gender-integrated \ntraining and segregated basic training--looking at all of the \ndimensions of these issues and the various components.\n  So that is why I hope the Members of the Senate will reject the \namendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia. I hope the Senate \nwill elect to uphold the authority of this commission in place of \nlegislative segregation of males and females living together during \nbasic training and training together. We have separate housing for men \nand women in basic training. And gender-integrated training has been \nendorsed by every military leader who has come before the Senate Armed \nForces Committee. It has been endorsed by the Secretary of Defense; the \nmilitary chiefs of the Army, Air Force, and Navy; military training \ncommanders; senior noncommissioned officers of the Army, Navy, and Air \nForce; and the U.S. Army. Every uniformed person who has testified \nbefore the committee has endorsed gender-integrated training.\n  We should not be legislating our assumptions, as this amendment would \ndo which has been offered by the Senator from West Virginia. Rather, we \nshould, as we agreed to last year, allow a qualified panel of experts \nand former military leaders to consider the myriad questions that \nimpact the effectiveness of gender-integrated training.\n  We have instructed the panel to assess the historic and current \nrationale behind the implementation of gender-integrated training at \nall skill levels. It requires an opinion of the policy within basic \ntraining programs and teaching troops as they would operate. And, \ntowards this end, there are five standards to which the commission must \nfilter the training as operating concepts. It has to review adequate \nphysical conditioning, technical skills, proficiency, knowledge, \nmilitary socialization, to include the delegation of social values and \nattitudes, as well as basic combat proficiencies.\n  Does anyone think in this Chamber that we can legislate answers and \ninsights on these complex questions with the incentive of adjourning in \ntime for a recess? Do we really think that we will be able to come up \nwith the rationale necessary to govern basic training for our Armed \nForces?\n  Mr. President, and Members of this body, I hope we will reject the \namendment that has been offered by the Senator from West Virginia. It \ncertainly will contravene the intent of this Congress last year in \ncreating a commission to examine all of these issues. But it also will \ncontravene the judgment of all of our top military officials who have \nendorsed gender-integrated training.\n  Then we have had the support of gender-integrated training by diverse \ngroups such as the Rand Corporation, the Defense Equal Opportunity \nManagement Institute, the Army Research Institute, and the Defense \nAdvisory Commission on Women in the Services, or DACOWITZ. I would like \nto have you listen to a few of their recommendations.\n  A December 1997 DACOWITZ report states: ``Trainers and trainees in \nall services perceived that gender-integrated training during the \ninitial entry training phase of a service member's career was necessary \nto effectively prepare trainees for duty in the field and the fleet.''\n  A February 1997 study by the U.S. Army Research Institute found that, \n``Females trained in a gender-integrated environment improved their \nperformance on all measures of physical fitness, and males in gender-\nintegrated training improved in two of three events.'' This, by the \nway, occurred with no change in the fitness standards.\n  Finally, we have been told over and over again that integration \ntraining increases unit cohesion. That is why every military leader who \nhas come before the committee has endorsed it. Every single military \nmember who has testified before this Congress supports gender-\nintegrated training. Generals and privates, recruits and trainers, male \nand female, uniformed and civilian--all agree that a military which \ntrains as it fights is the best prepared to meet the challenges of \ntomorrow.\n  Let's review other comments of leaders.\n\n[[Page S7106]]\n\n  The former Secretary of the Army, Togo West, and the Chief of Staff \nof the Army, General Reimer, wrote that, ``Any proposal that calls for \ngender segregation of both trainees and cadre violates the very \nfoundation of the Army: An integrated, effective and lethal force that \nis ready to perform the mission anywhere and at any time.''\n  The senior noncommissioned officers from the services state clearly \nthat, ``Many successes in our gender-integrated all-volunteer force are \na direct result of the training Services currently provide.''\n  Admiral Pilling, the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, supports gender-\nintegrated training as critical to helping recruits ``develop \ninterpersonal relationships that contribute to a healthy, effective, \ngender-integrated force.''\n  So those are the many comments offered by our leaders, our military \nleaders. They have had every opportunity to decide differently on the \nissue of gender-integrated training. The Kassebaum-Baker commission \nreport came forward in December and in fact endorsed gender-integrated \ntraining beyond basic training.\n  The Secretary of Defense gave an opportunity to all of the service \nchiefs to come back and report to the Secretary within 90 days as to \nhow they would implement those recommendations--the ones which they \nagreed with and those which they disagreed with. All of the services \ncame back and endorsed gender-integrated training as the best way to \ncreate a cohesive, unified force to train to fight and to fight as they \nwould train.\n  Mr. President, I hope that on the basis of those who have endorsed \ngender-integrated training and on the basis of those who have doubts--\nthat is the reason why the commission was created by this Congress, to \nevaluate those areas in which people had doubts and concerns about \ngender-integrated training. Even I endorsed the commission, as I said \nearlier, because I think it is important to put to rest once and for \nall of those concerns. That is why I endorsed this commission, as a way \nin which we could allay the fears and concerns of many, to have experts \nfrom a variety of professions and fields within the military, and even \noutside the military, to evaluate for more than a year the dimensions \nof this question.\n  So I hope, Mr. President, that the Members of this body will reject \nthe amendment that has been offered by the Senator from West Virginia \nso that we can allow the commission to do the job that we asked them to \ndo.\n  I hope that Members would support the amendment that was adopted last \nnight by 56 to 37 and protect the integrity of the congressional panel \non gender-integrated military training instead of trying to legislate \nspecific results without the benefit of deliberation. I hope that we \nwill confirm that judgment of last year and, indeed, last night by \nrejecting the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  I remind this body that that commission was one that was endorsed \nand, indeed, created as a result of the cosponsorship of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am strongly opposed to the Byrd \namendment which would require that all military services separate men \nand women during basic training. I am opposed to this amendment for two \nreasons.\n  First, yesterday during the deliberations of the Snowe amendment it \nwas stated that it was premature to make a determination on this issue, \nthat we should let the commission complete its work, that we should \nwait for the final findings of the commission before taking any action. \nNothing has changed.\n  We have charged the commission with a task that we seem to have no \nintention of letting them complete. Only upon careful study of the \ncommission's final report is it prudent to make a judgment that could \nfundamentally alter the way in which the services conduct basic \ntraining.\n  Second, the decision on how to train recruits should be made at the \nindividual service level, not by the Congress for every service, as if \nthey all had the same training requirements. To do otherwise is to do a \ndisservice to the men and women in our armed services. Men and women \nnumerous other overseas postings were trained in a gender integrated \nenvironment. As a result, they are performing superbly in all aspects \nof military life, in a gender integrated force.\n  The Marines and Army direct ground combat units conduct gender-\nsegregated basic training. For all other non-direct ground combat \nroles, the services conduct gender integrated training. This is how \nthey will fight. And these decisions were made at the individual \nservice level, as one component of a larger force structure. And the \nCongress should not now attempt to reverse these decisions.\n  Some ask, why should basic training be any different? But basic \ntraining is where new recruits learn basic military values. Integrated \ninitial training makes sense. They will train and fight as an \nintegrated force for their entire military careers. There is no reason \nwhy they should not begin to do so as early as possible. Doing so \nincreases the readiness of all our military forces.\n  The critics of gender integrated training will list recent incidents \nof sexual harassment as an argument for gender segregation. However, \nthese incidents were largely committed by senior personnel against \njunior personnel.\n  This kind of sexual harassment indicates poor leadership and not a \ngender integration problem in training. All of the Services acknowledge \nthe importance of improving the quality of recruit training. Commanders \nand drill instructors will exercise closer supervision over all \nrecruits. That is the best way to eliminate these abuses and ensure the \nhigh level of readiness required for our national defense.\n  The Senior Noncommissioned Officers in each service say that one \ntraining policy, which applies across all services, will have a \nnegative impact on readiness. Then why are we attempting to sacrifice \nmilitary readiness to gender-segregation? Numerous other military \nofficers and veteran's groups have weighed in on this issue each \nsupporting gender-integration. The senior officer in each service \nsupports gender-integration and moreover, believes that the decision \nshould be properly made at the service level--not in Congress.\n  We have come a long way toward full acceptance of women in the \nmilitary. But more needs to be done to ensure that the progress goes \nforward in the coming years. Women will not continue to serve in a \nmilitary which discriminates against them. I look forward to a day when \nmore policies and programs affecting service members are implemented \nwithout regard to gender. Women in the military deserve no less.\n  I urge you to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3012\n\n(Purpose: To limit the obligation of advance procurement funds for the \n                             F-22 fighter)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] for himself and Mr. \n     Feingold proposes an amendment numbered 3012.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike from line 1, page 25 through page 27, line 10, and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SEC. 133. LIMITATION ON ADVANCE PROCUREMENT OF F-22 AIRCRAFT.\n\n       Amounts available for the Department of Defense for any \n     fiscal year for the F-22 aircraft program may not be \n     obligated for advance procurement for the six Lot II F-22 \n     aircraft before the date that is 30 days after the date on \n     which the Secretary of Defense submits a certification to the \n     congressional defense committees that the Air Force has \n     completed 601 hours of flight testing of F-22 flight test \n     vehicles according to the test and evaluation master plan for \n     the F-22 aircraft program, as in effect of October 1, 1997.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, the Air Force is in the process of buying \nby far the most expensive fighter plane the United States has ever \nbought by a magnitude of 300 percent, to be precise. And that is if we \ncan build it at today's estimated cost. I have not made any bones about \nthe fact that I don't think we need the F-22, but we are going to get \nit. I lost the battle to terminate the program, I admit. But if we are \ngoing to spend $62 to $100 billion for 339\n\n[[Page S7107]]\n\nairplanes, we at least ought to fly that sucker before we buy it. And \ntherein lies the problem.\n  My staff found--the distinguished Presiding Officer will find this \ninteresting--a copy of an article from the January 9, 1989, Atlanta \nConstitution. The Presiding Officer is familiar with that newspaper. \nAnd the headline is ``The B-2: Fly Before You Buy.'' How many times \nhave my colleagues heard that term, ``fly before you buy''? No less \nthan a thousand.\n  My colleague, Senator Pryor, used to screech to the roof of this \nChamber about buying weapons before they have been tested.\n  Let me begin with a little history of the F-22. It is the Pentagon's \nintention--and they usually get their way--to buy advanced F-18s, the \nso-called E/F model. We are going to buy 30 of those next year. Then \nthe Pentagon also plans to buy the F-22, which is supposed to be the \ngreatest, most sophisticated piece of weaponry in the history of the \nworld. And we are going to buy 339 of those. And then in the year 2005 \nwe will start buying 3,000 Joint Strike Fighters. It is going to be \nstealthy, and it is going to be everything that anybody could ever \nconjure up. It will be used by the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air \nForce, the Brits, and perhaps some other members of NATO.\n  Mr. President, we are buying all these fighters in spite of the fact \nthat the intelligence community and everybody who knows anything about \nan airplane knows that there isn't a plane in the world--in France, in \nRussia, in China--that is even remotely comparable to our F-15 and our \nF-18 and there won't be, the CIA says, for 15 to 20 years. So what is \nthe rush to judgment?\n  A little more about the F-22 and its checkered history. We started \nout to buy over 600 F-22s, and the Air Force said, we will buy them at \na certain such cost. It became apparent that they could not even begin \nto buy that many airplanes for those dollars, so they cut the number to \n438. It turns out they could not buy 438 for that price, and Secretary \nCohen, to his eternal credit, said this is the amount of money we are \ngoing to spend and no more. And so that took the number down to 339. \nSixty-two billion dollars, and we put a cost cap for that amount in \nlast year's Defense bill. Listen to this, that comes to $182 million \nfor each F-22 we buy. That is roughly three times more than we have \never paid for a fighter plane.\n  So what is next? Lockheed Martin and the Air Force say in November of \n1994 that the F-22 will require 1,400 hours of testing before we start \nproduction. That sounded reasonable. Then in May of 1997 they say, no, \nwe don t need to do 1,400 hours; 601 hours of testing will be adequate. \nAnd now guess what we are down to in this very bill we are debating. \nYou see the figure on this chart: 183 hours.\n  Mr. President, that comes out to only four percent of the four \npercent of the F-22's whole 4,300 hour flight test program. Four \npercent.\n  Now, the Defense Science Board and every flight evaluator and testing \nexpert will tell you that most of the complaints, most of the flaws in \nan airplane, will, indeed, show up when you test it between 10 and 20 \npercent of the number of hours that it should be tested. But here we \nare in February of 1988. In 1998, they said 183 hours. This bill that \nwe are debating was crafted in May of this year. Bear that in mind. A \nlot of things have happened since then.\n  Mr. President, the Air Force the other day--as a matter of fact, it \nwasn't the other day; it was yesterday--the Air Force sent a message to \nevery Senator's office saying, ``Here is why you ought to oppose the \nBumper's amendment.'' But they closed it out exactly the way I knew \nthey would close it out: 25,000 jobs--mostly in Georgia and some other \nStates.\n  Mr. President, here is how much we tested other fighters before we \nmade an initial purchase. The F-15 was tested for 975 hours before we \nbought the first one; the F-16 was tested 1,115 hours before we bought \nthe first one; the F-18, 1,418 hours before we bought the first one; \nand the F-18E/F, the follow-on model, which really didn't need all that \nmuch testing, we tested for 779 hours. But do you know what else \nhappened. During flight testing of the F-18E/F, they discovered that it \nhad a problem. It was called ``wing drop.''\n  Now, if you listen to this illustration, you will know what you get \ninto when you do this business of buying before you fly. They had to \ntest-fly the F-18-E/F, they had to test-fly it almost 2,500 hours to \ncure one flaw in a time-tested airplane.\n  We are spending $200 million a year on the B-1 bomber, and do you \nknow why? Because we didn't test it. We were so hot to buy that bomber \nback during the cold war that we started buying the initial airplanes \nbefore we even tested them.\n  We are spending over $200 million this year, and we will spend $198 \nmillion next year on it.\n  And so what came next? The next thing that came was the B-2 bomber, \nand it is not fixed. And we are spending God knows how much money on it \nevery year because we didn't test it before we bought it.\n  What this bill does--I hope my colleagues will pay close attention to \nthis--this bill does not keep the Air Force from buying what they call \nlot 1 of low rate initial production, two airplanes. We don't stop that \nwith my amendment. We don't change the bill. They can go ahead and buy \nthose two airplanes.\n  But then there is $190 million in this bill that is fenced, it is to \nbuy long-lead items for the next six airplanes. It says you cannot buy \nthem until you have tested it at least 183 hours and the Secretary \ncertifies a couple of things, then you can go ahead and start toward \n$1.5 billion worth of airplanes, after 183 hours of testing.\n  I have a something here the Pogo Alert, put out by the Project on \nGovernment Oversight. It says:\n\n       The contractors building the aircraft [referring to the F-\n     22] may be satisfied with a promise of future testing in \n     order to get the program funded now and will welcome getting \n     more money in the future to fix problems discovered too late. \n     But the Government should not walk into such a situation \n     knowingly. To avoid more problems with the F-22, the \n     Government merely needs to follow its own rhetoric of \n     adopting commercial best practices, and that means, in this \n     case, testing before producing, not after.\n\n  Once the waiver is issued by the Secretary of Defense, all bets are \noff. We are headed for a $1.5 billion purchase of six airplanes. And \nwhen we start running into trouble we will already be committed just as \nwe were on the B-1 and the B-2.\n  The Air Force says, ``We will test this airplane. We will get in the \n183 hours before December.'' Would you like to know how many hours they \nhave tested it so far? As of June 16, they have tested it 6 hours. And \nthey say yes, but we are going to step that up to 15 hours a month. If \nthey do, in December they will have about 95--95 hours of testing.\n  My amendment says they ought to test this plane for 601 hours before \nthe initial purchase of these six production airplanes is made. That is \nthe amount the Air Force said they would do just last year. Why is it \nthat we are in such a sweat to get this unbelievably expensive airplane \nbuilt with not an enemy in sight, not anybody in the world with \nairplanes to even come close to the F-15s and the F-18s and the F-16s? \nYet they want to go all out to start buying this airplane. And we know, \nwe know to a certainty that we are going to regret it. The testing so \nfar, incidentally, the 6 hours it has been tested, is on what they call \na clean airplane: No armaments, no sidewinders, no SRAMs, no nothing--\njust a clean airplane, 6 hours of testing. And when you start putting \nthe armaments on it and in it, it takes on an entirely different \naerodynamic.\n  I get frustrated and too loud sometimes, because I cannot believe \nwhat we do. Do you know what the Air Force told the GAO in 1992? Listen \nto this. In 1992 they said: We don't have to rush anymore. The cold war \nis over. We can take our time in testing weapons in the future. We do \nnot have to urge what we call concurrency. Concurrency is buying \nairplanes while you are testing them. You are buying airplanes on the \ncome, betting on the come. You are betting that somehow or other, \nwhatever problems crop up, they can be solved. That is called \nconcurrency, and that is what the Air Force told the GAO, in 1992, that \nit was not going to do. It said, we are not going to use concurrency as \nan excuse to buy weapons in the future because we are not in that big \nof a hurry.\n\n[[Page S7108]]\n\n  Mr. President, I wish I could say that I thought Senators who were \nlistening, and those on the floor would take a very sensible view \ntoward testing an airplane before we buy it, particularly the most \nexpensive fighter plane we have ever bought. But I am not hopeful. I \nhave seen it happen too many times, planes being built in a lot of \nStates with a lot of jobs. Nobody wants to be accused of being soft on \ndefense. And they know to a certainty that the American public, by and \nlarge, will never know what happened--just as they don't know what \nhappened in the case of the B-1 and the B-2. And their money will have \nbeen spent.\n  Mr. President, it is the ``same old, same old.'' It is Lucy holding \nthe ball for Charlie Brown and swearing she won't pull it out from \nunder him this time. So it is a freebie. You can go ahead and vote \nagainst this amendment and be ironclad sure you will never pay at the \npolls. Nobody is going to say why did you spend that $62 billion to \n$100 billion on that F-22 without even testing it? They don't know \nabout it, so you get a free ride.\n\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am happy to respond to the Senator as a \nmember of the committee that has addressed this problem. I am just \nlooking back at the Senator from Arizona to see if he is prepared to \npropound a unanimous consent request. I think this Senator and perhaps \nthe Senator from Arkansas are willing to proceed with the amendment and \nwill try to conform our remarks to the conditions of a unanimous \nconsent request, if the Senator from Arizona is prepared to propound \nthat yet. I am not sure that he is.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I renew my request with three \nmodifications: One is that cleared amendments be considered as prior to \nthe third reading; second is following the vote, following the debate \non the Bumpers amendment, Senator Faircloth be recognized for up to 10 \nminutes to propose a MilCon amendment; then, after the disposition of \nthe Byrd amendment, the only other amendment be a Harkin first-degree \namendment with a relevant Biden second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Relative to Kashmir.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Relative to Kashmir. Following that would be a vote on \nthe Faircloth amendment which had been debated earlier.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object--a \nlot of hard work has gone into this. I would only ask a very slight \nmodification there, which is that Senator Daschle be added as a \ncosponsor of the Warner-Levin-Lott amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I also ask unanimous consent Senator Daschle be made a \ncosponsor of the Warner-Levin-Lott amendment regarding the name of the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is ordered Senator \nDaschle will be made a cosponsor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I also ask unanimous consent that the debate that has \nalready taken place be accounted against the 30 minutes for Senator \nBumpers and 10 minutes for Senator Coats and 5 minutes for Senator \nCleland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3012\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I have 13 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the Bumpers amendment? The \nSenator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I think I have 10 minutes under the \nprevious order. I yield myself those 10 minutes. I may reserve some of \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, the Armed Services Committee has discussed \nin great detail the very situation that the Senator from Arkansas \nraises. We held numerous hearings. I had numerous private meetings with \nmembers of the Department of the Air Force, the Department of Defense, \ncontractors and others on this question.\n  Last year, in the authorization bill, I offered an amendment to \nimpose cost caps and a number of accountability features on the F-22, \nnot as an opponent of the F-22, but as a proponent of the F-22, a \nmarvelous new advance in technology that I believe is needed, but one \nin which this Congress has an absolute responsibility to ensure that \nthe engineering, manufacturing, development, flight testing and \nproduction schedules are done in such a way that provides \naccountability to the taxpayer, gives us the product that we are \nlooking for, and gives it to us in a manner that we can afford.\n  The last thing we want is for the F-22 to go the way of the B-2 where \nwe get part way into a program, and because the costs become so \nexcessive, we have to cancel the program or stop the program where it \nis, or the B-1, which was rushed into production without adequate \ntesting, and we have encountered numerous problems with that platform \never since.\n  In recognition of the very issue that the Senator from Arkansas \nraises; that is, rushing to production before we have completed \nadequate preproduction flight test hours, this committee, after \nconsiderable negotiation with proponents, opponents and all those in \nbetween of the F-22, has arrived at a committee consensus that we will \nrequire a specified number of flight test hours and that any money that \nis designated for production will be fenced and not released until that \nthreshold is met.\n  We arrived at that number on the basis of intense discussions with \nthe Department of the Air Force, the Department of Defense, the \ncontractor and others, recognizing that given new flight testing \ntechniques and production techniques, what will be required for the F-\n22 may not necessarily be what was required for tactical airplanes \ndeveloped in the past. Nevertheless, we want to be assured that we have \nat least reached a minimum threshold before any funds can be released.\n  We built a little window in here for the Secretary of Defense to \ncertify that under these new testing techniques, manufacturing \ntechniques, and engineering techniques that a lesser number of hours is \nrequired. He can waive a certain portion of those flight test hours, \nbut not below a certain level.\n  We have requested that no waiver can be granted at a level below 183 \nflight test hours, a level which the Department of the Air Force, the \nSecretary of Defense, the contractor and everybody involved in this \nfeels is adequate.\n  We require more than that. We require that 10 percent of plan \nschedule for flight testing be completed before those fenced funds are \nobligated for production. However, we do allow for a waiver.\n  The bottom line here is that the Committee agrees with the Senator \nfrom Arkansas that not enough flight testing has taken place and that \nwe shouldn't go forward. In fact, the Under Secretary of Defense for \nAcquisition and Technology, Mr. Gansler, has already delayed the \nproduction decision for 1 year on the basis of the fact that there have \nbeen delays in the planned schedule for flight testing and that we need \nmore flight testing.\n  By the same token, we are trying to balance the risk of going forward \nwith fewer hours than what we normally would require with the risk of \nincurring very substantial additional costs as we slip production time \nschedules, as we delay moving from the engineering, manufacturing and \ndevelopment phase to preproduction phase or, in this case, production \nphase. And we are trying to balance all that. We have arrived at a \npretty delicate compromise.\n  I will say that we do agree with the Senator that we need more flight \ntesting hours before we rush into production, but we do also have to \nrecognize that we have put demands on the contractor and the Air Force \nin terms of a fixed-price contract which requires a great commitment on \ntheir part at substantial risk, and we have to find an acceptable \nbalance.\n\n[[Page S7109]]\n\n  We think we have found that balance. As I say, those proponents of \nthe F-22 on the committee, and the opponents of the F-22, and those in \nthe middle have agreed this is an acceptable balance. The only thing I \nwill say about the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas is that it \ngoes a little further than the provision agreed to in the committee, \nand I believe we should hold to the committee position on this, because \nit does achieve that very delicate balance between the extra costs that \nwill incur if we demand more testing, and the risk of not having enough \nflight testing.\n  We have built a 6-percent--between a 4- and 10-percent window in \nthere, but we require the Secretary of Defense to put his signature on \nthe line and his Department's credibility on the line before we waive \nbelow the 10 percent level.\n  For that reason, I urge Members to support the committee position. We \nwill be going to conference with that and hope that they will \nunderstand that the underlying bill addresses the problem raised by the \nSenator from Arkansas, and we think it addresses it in a way that \nallows us to gain confidence that before we go to production, we have \ncompleted adequate flight testing. And yet our position also takes into \nconsideration the fact that under a fixed-price contract and under the \nrequirements that are imposed on the contractor and the Air Force, we \nare not incurring these substantial additional costs through the delay.\n  For that reason, I hope Members will support the committee position. \nAny remaining time I have I reserve, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to speak for 5 minutes in \nopposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas for \ndoing his homework. He is very courageous in touching on one of the \nserious issues regarding the F-22.\n  All of the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, including \nmyself, were rightly concerned about the issue of whether enough flight \ntesting on the F-22 would be accomplished prior to making an informed \ndecision on whether to proceed with low-rate initiation production. The \ndilemma we faced was simple:\n  Do we move forward with the program at the risk that unknown problems \nwould arise causing significant cost overruns and delays or do we shut \ndown the production line in response to our concerns about testing \nwhich would certainly lead to cost overruns and a delay in the program?\n  The Catch-22 we found ourselves in was not an easy one to solve. The \nArmed Services Committee took this head on, and I believe we arrived at \nan approach that addresses the testing issue, while also addressing the \nissue of keeping the program on track. Let me briefly explain what the \nArmed Services Committee did:\n  First, we fenced Lot II funding, and made it absolutely \ncontingent upon completion of 183 test hours. Let me repeat: It is \nabsolutely contingent upon completion of 183 hours. If that level of \ntesting cannot be done in FY-99, Lot II funding will not be released. \nSecond, the committee placed an additional restriction on release of \nfunding for Lot II. The Air Force must complete 433 flight-test hours \nor the Secretary of Defense must certify that less than 433 hours is \nacceptable, explaining why less than 433 is acceptable, showing how \nless than 433 hours is consistent with prior Defense Acquisition board \nrecommendations, and showing why it is more cost-advantageous to \nproceed with Lot II than to delay the production line.\n\n  These requirements are real. They are tough. they are realistic.\n  Let me offer some perspective on the first requirement. Prior to an \ninitial production decision for 2 aircraft, the F-22 will have 183 \nflight test hours. In comparison, the F-16 had only 21 flight test \nhours prior to initial production decision for 16 aircraft--162 less \nthan the F-22. The F-18 A/B had no flight test hours prior to an \ninitial production decision for nine aircraft.\n  The second threshold, the completion of 433 hours or a certification \nfor less than that provides us with this. The F-22 program has changed \nin many ways. And so many things have changed the way aircraft are \ndesigned and built today. With the advances in technology and concerns \nfor keeping control of costs, in the future more and more testing will \nbe done without actual flight test hours.\n  It is undisputed that flight test requirements cannot be replaced \nentirely, but there are certain amounts of simulations and ground \ntesting that can take the place of actual in-flight tests.\n  Here is what the F-22 has gone through, to date: 153 prototype flight \ntest hours--on high angle-of-attack, supercruise, and thrust vectoring \ntechnology; over 365,000 equivalent flight test hours on aircraft \ncomponents and subcomponents; over 23,000 hours of software/hardware \nintegration testing; over 6,000 hours of engine testing; 600 hours of \nhigh-fidelity radar cross section model testing; 450,000 hours of \navionic ground tests; 123,000 hours of component structural tests; \n2,000 hours of engine ground tests; 43,000 hours of wind tunnel \ntesting. More importantly, there has been 25,000 hours of scaled wind \ntunnel testing without experiencing the ``wing drop'' phenomenon \ndiscovered in the F-18E/F wind tunnel testing.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee provisions would require the \nSecretary of Defense to certify all of this and make the case that less \nthan 433 flight test hours on this gives us the level of confidence to \nproceed.\n  I would like to say, Mr. President, that I speak in opposition to the \nBumpers amendment. The Air Force informs us that a delay in the F-22 \nprogram associated with not being able to meet overly stringent \nrequirements could increase the program some $4 billion.\n  So, Mr. President, I speak in opposition to the amendment and yield \nthe remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to voice my \nsupport for the amendment offered by my friend from Arkansas.\n  I am proud to have worked with the distinguished Senator on a number \nof issues during the past five years and I will miss his leadership and \nfriendship. One of the many issues on which I have had the pleasure to \nwork with him is the Defense Department's tactical aircraft programs.\n  I am a proud co-sponsor of this most sensible amendment. I find it \nhard to believe that anyone could oppose an amendment that makes sure \nthe Air Force flight tests its multi-billion dollar F-22 aircraft less \nthan half the number of hours the Air Force itself planned to fly \nbefore moving to begin production.\n  Just this past Monday, the DoD's Director of Operational Test and \nEvaluation told Congress that the F-22 will have approximately 100 \nhours of flight tests by December, not the 183 the Air Force expects. \nAnd that is less than one third the number of hours that the Air Force \nitself said was desirable just last year. In essence, Mr. President, \nthe Air Force wants to begin producing F-22s at a cost of about one \nhundred billion tax dollars after completing about 7 percent of its \noriginally planned flight tests. Does this seem like a good idea?\n  By comparison, the F-15 flew for 975 hours before a production \ncontract award; the F-16 for 1,115 hours; and even the much-flawed \nSuper Hornet had 779 flight test hours before a production contract was \nawarded.\n  There is a direct correlation between flying hours and expansion of \nan aircraft's flight envelope. It takes flying hours to explore an \naircraft's performance at all airspeeds and altitudes and in various \nconfigurations.\n  Remember, Mr. President, prototype tests, ground tests, wind tunnel \ntests and computer simulations did not predict the Super Hornet's \nprogram-threatening wing drop problem, which took 2,500 hours of flight \ntests to solve.\n  Mr. President, this amendment just makes common sense. We need to \nmake sure the taxpayers are getting all they're paying for. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \namendment offered by Senator Bumpers that would fence in funding for \nadvanced procurement for the six Lot II F-22 aircraft until 601 hours \nof flight testing of F-22 flight test vehicles has been completed and \nreported. By requiring the completion of an absolute number of\n\n[[Page S7110]]\n\ntest flight hours before releasing funds, this amendment places on the \nF-22 program constraint which would slow down the program, increase \ncosts and jeopardize full procurement of the Air Force's requirement \nfor this weapon.\n  First, I would like to note that the Armed Services Committee has \nalready placed conditions on funding for the six Lot II F-22's. The \nCommittee, in this very bill, included language mandating that \nprocurement funds for these aircraft will not be released until the F-\n22 has completed 433 hours of flight testing, or the Secretary of \nDefense determines that a number of hours of flight testing less than \n433 provides a sufficient basis for deciding to proceed to production. \nFrom what we know of this plane it has performed well. The F-22 meets \nor exceeds all expectations, and I expect this course to continue.\n  It is estimated that this amendment would delay the F-22 program up \nto one year. By breaking production lines and undermining firm fixed \nprice contracts, production would have to wait while testing is \ncompleted, even if the F-22 has fully demonstrated its capabilities and \nthe Defense Department has full confidence that the plane is ready for \nproduction. This delay would, in turn, increase costs of the program by \nup to $4 billion. This substantial cost increase would break the \nCongressionally mandated cost caps, at full expense to the tax payer, \nand risk full procurement of the Air Force's requirement.\n  Mr. President, the approach to the issue of flight test hours is most \nappropriately addressed by the Armed Services Committee in the Defense \nAuthorization bill. This approach makes flight test requirements an \nessential component of full funding while providing the flexibility to \nproceed with the program should the F-22 prove, as it has already, that \nit is a plane ahead of its time. Our country cannot afford to let this \nprogram get off track. The F-22 is a vital component of our future \nnational security. We must fund it, we must build it and we must fly \nit.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thought the Senator from Arkansas might want to \nconclude, so I would use the remainder of the 3 minutes of the Senator \nfrom Indiana.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Pardon?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will use the balance of the time of the Senator from \nIndiana, and then the Senator from Arkansas can finish.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, the Senator from Arkansas has again \nidentified a significant problem in terms of our defense procurement. \nWe were very much concerned with this problem in the Armed Services \nCommittee in the manner which the Senator from Indiana described.\n  The difficulty that we face is that there is going to be some risks \neither way. If there is a delay here, as the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Arkansas would require, there would be a 14-month gap, \napproximately, before the advanced procurement funds could be \nobligated. And that gap in this production line will be costly to the \nextent perhaps of $2.75 billion.\n  Now, on the other hand, in the testing which we need to displace some \nsignificant problems with the F-22, we are going to also have some \nsignificant costs. So either way, we have to face some risks--either \nway--whether we do it the committee way or whether we do it the way of \nthe Senator from Arkansas.\n  We felt on the committee it was better to do it our way, to let the \nSecretary of Defense, if he must waive some of those testing hours \nbefore the obligation of the advanced procurement money require that he \ncertify that the financial risks that are there either way would be \ngreater from his not certifying than from his certifying.\n  So we are trying to reduce the risks through this process, the \nfinancial risks that are going to exist either way. But in supporting \nthe committee position, and in opposing the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, I again commend him for taking the time to get inside \none of these issues. He is one of the few Senators who is willing to \nget inside one of these complicated defense procurement issues and \npoint out the complexities, and in this case what he considers to be \nthe error of a particular procurement process in which we are engaged. \nAnd so while I disagree with him, again, I commend him and thank him \nfor the time he has taken on this issue.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan for his \nvery fine comments.\n  I have a couple of questions. No. 1, if 601 hours was the right \nnumber of preproduction tests last year, why is 183 hours the right \nnumber this year?\n  If you want to use apples and apples, you compare flight hours prior \nto award of a production contract. This chart shows the preproduction \nflight hours here. Those planes were tested this amount: 975 hours for \nthe F-15; 1,115 hours for the F-16; and 1,418 hours for the F-18--\npreproduction hours.\n  And what are we going to do for the F-22? 183.\n  And let me repeat, when you talk about how much more this is going to \ncost, $3 or $4 billion more, if we do not do this--you tell me, what if \nthe Secretary does not wait? They still have to test 433 hours, and \npresumably you are going to get into the same cost figures of a $3 to \n$4 billion cost overrun.\n  And while I am at it, let me ask the Air Force and Lockheed Martin \nthis question: If you did not know, if they did not know that this \ncommittee, the Armed Services Committee--if they did not know that the \nrequired test hours were going to be cut from 600 to 183, why did they \nmake those commitments that would generate a $3 to $4 billion cost \noverrun? Why are we responsible for the cost overrun that they have \nincurred--not us--they?\n  Oh, Mr. President, it is so frustrating.\n  I want to say this on the floor. Everyone knows I am leaving at the \nend of this year. I am not running for reelection. And, you know, it is \nno fun saying ``I told you so\" when you are in a little country town \ndown in Arkansas instead of on the Senate floor. I told this body years \nago that when push came to shove the space station costs were going to \nstart escalating.\n  You listen to this. I told you years ago that the space station was \ngoing to cost well over $100 billion. And now it is almost up to $100 \nbillion and rising. Since October 1, the cost overrun, just to build \nit--not deploy it--just to build it is 44 percent in 8 months.\n  And this F-22 fighter, this airplane is going to cost this body and \nthis country more headaches than you will ever dream of. And tonight is \nan opportunity to avoid it. Why do we insist on going headlong into the \nproduction of an airplane this expensive, this sophisticated, which \nrequires even more testing because of the new sophisticated equipment \nit has on it? And it is stealthy, all of those things.\n  So I will tell you tonight--and I will not be here to say ``I told \nyou so''--you are making a fatal mistake. You will regret it. The cost \nof this airplane is going to be a lot more than $62 billion.\n  When the Air Force said, ``We'll build it for $62 billion,'' \nSecretary Cohen said, ``OK, that's what we're going to build it for.'' \nThey said, ``How many can you build?'' They said, ``Three hundred \nthirty-nine.'' So last year, courtesy of my good friend from Michigan, \nSenator Levin, and Senator Coats, and Senator McCain, we took the Air \nForce's word, and we put the total cost at $62 billion--$182 million \neach.\n\n  And we hadn't anymore got it ink printed, the ink wasn't dry, before \nthe Air Force says, ``I'm sorry, we can't do it. We have to lift that \ncap.'' You know something else? It will be lifted. It will be lifted. \nNothing is ever permanent around here. How we deceive ourselves and get \nby with it.\n  The only satisfaction I will get out of this evening is knowing that \nsometime in the not-too-distant future I will be proven correct. Would \nyou buy an automobile that had been tested for 6 hours, or even 183 \nhours? You wouldn't buy a Jeep that had only been tested for 183 hours, \nbut we are going to spend $100 billion on 339 airplanes.\n  I yield the floor, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Tennessee was to be \nrecognized for a colloquy, but the Senator is not here.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n[[Page S7111]]\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncolloquy of the Senator from Tennessee be entered in the Record and I \nmay be permitted to introduce my amendment at this time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, the unanimous consent \nrequest was that the colloquy of the Senator from Tennessee be entered \ninto the Record at this time.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. That was my request.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to see if there is an objection to that because----\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I thought the \nSenator from Tennessee would be here to do his own business and I \ndidn't realize the Senator from North Carolina was going to make the \nmotion. I prefer that he not make it so I can have an opportunity--I \nunderstood the Senator from North Carolina will have an amendment he \nwill propose.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. That is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. Why don't I object to the colloquy of the Senator from \nTennessee being entered into the Record, set that aside, so when the \ncolloquy goes in, I will have an opportunity then to present my side of \nthe question; would that be agreeable?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. That would be satisfactory with me.\n  Mr. FORD. So they are withdrawing the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Now, has the debate terminated on the Bumpers \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has.\n  If there is no objection, the Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from North Carolina would now be recognized \naccording to the time agreement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry just to clarify the \nsituation. As I understand the situation, the Senator from North \nCarolina is going to then proceed with his amendment now, ahead of the \ncolloquy of the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Kentucky. \nIs that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That time has been reserved to the Senators from Tennessee \nand Kentucky?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3014\n\n(Purpose: To authorize, with an offset, $8,300,000 for the construction \n  of the National Guard Military Educational Facility at Fort Bragg, \n                            North Carolina)\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Faircloth] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3014.\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 321, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2603. NATIONAL GUARD MILITARY EDUCATIONAL FACILITY, FORT \n                   BRAGG, NORTH CAROLINA.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--The amount authorized \n     to be appropriated by section 2601(1)(A) is hereby increased \n     by $8,300,000.\n       (b) Availability of Funds.--Funds available as a result of \n     the increase in the authorization of appropriations made by \n     subsection (a) shall be available for purposes of \n     construction of the National Guard Military Educational \n     Facility at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.\n       (c) Offset.--The amount authorized to be appropriated by \n     section 2404(a)(9) is hereby reduced by $8,300,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes, 10 \nminutes equally divided on this issue.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, it was 10 minutes for me. It was not \nequally divided. Now, if it is equally divided, it can go to 20 \nminutes. I asked for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Carolina is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, this amendment authorizes \nappropriations for construction of a National Guard training facility \nat Fort Bragg. If anyone has seen the facility that the Guard from four \nStates is using at Fort Bragg, he would agree it is a disgrace. It is a \ndisgrace to the Guard. It is a disgrace to the Government. It is a \ndisgrace to the Army. In fact, the buildings are so old and so run down \nthat they were mistaken by the XVIII Airborne Corps deputy commander as \nabandoned and so ordered them demolished--they were such an eyesore--\nuntil he was informed that they were the National Guard facility.\n  This new training facility will be used by the National Guard and \nreservists and active-duty personnel from four southeastern States--\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida.\n  It is simply wrong to continue to train and berth our guardsmen in \nWorld War II buildings that, when they were built, it was announced \nthat they were temporary and going to last 10 years. Now we are 50-plus \nyears putting our National Guard into these buildings. They were \ntemporarily constructed in 1941, to last for 10 years and then to be \ntaken down. They are still there. We are still housing the National \nGuard in them. The water supply is unsafe, and they have to haul in \nwater in buckets for the National Guard to drink. And we talk about \nquality of life.\n  We expect much from the National Guard. We count on these troops to \nhandle any assignment that is given to them--in war, peacekeeping, or \nnational disasters. Yet we have put them in facilities that are a \ndisgrace to the military. They deserve the same level of accommodations \nthat we are building at other bases around the country.\n  I was not elected to the Senate by the people of North Carolina to \nstand by and listen to Defense Department bureaucrats and autocratic \nofficers. I grew up believing that this was a country in which a \ncivilian authority controlled the military. I have gotten here and I \nhave seen this thing we call the FYDP, or whatever it is, but it now \ngives the military officers the total authority to set the goals of \nwhat we do. And we simply stand by, vote for it, and raise the money. \nThis is not a civilian-controlled military. We are a civilian nation \ncontrolled by an autocratic military.\n  This is a worthy and worthwhile project. It should be funded. The \nNational Guard does, as we expect it to, make a worthwhile and very \nnecessary contribution to the country. They deserve to be treated \nbetter. But, instead they start talking about saving money by the \nmilitary.\n  If ever there was a waster of money, where spending is out of \ncontrol--and we just heard from Senator Bumpers--it's the military. We \nhave heard it over and over and over.\n  This is $8.5 million to replace 50-year-old temporary buildings, and \nthey say, ``No, we can't do it; we need the money for something else.'' \nNow, we are wasting billions of dollars in Bosnia, billions were wasted \nin Somalia and Haiti. If ever it was wasted, that was wasting it. They \nsay we can't afford $8.5 million for four States' National Guards to \nhave a decent place for encampment.\n  No; the President is on his way or in China with 1,000 people with \nhim--1,000. I question that he needs them, every one, when we say we \ncan't afford $8.5 million for a National Guard barracks at Fort Bragg.\n\n  No. We are not a civilian population controlling a military. We \nchanged that rule, and we decided that we would be controlled by a \nmilitary--a military of arrogant officers, entrenched bureaucrats that \nsimply write out what they want and we, like little toadies, follow.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, we will now be \nrecognizing the Senator from Tennessee and then the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for the moment, we yield back any time on \nthe Faircloth amendment.\n  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Under the unanimous-consent \nagreement, would the Chair please advise the Senate as to the next \nmatter. I don't have the agreement before me.\n\n[[Page S7112]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If Senator Thompson is not here, then Senator \nFord would be next.\n  Mr. WARNER. For the moment, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \nThompson matter and now proceed to the Thurmond-Levin amendment \nrelative to pay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3015\n\n (Purpose: To increase the percent by which the rates of basic pay are \n                            to be increased)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond], for \n     himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Levin, Mr. Warner, Mr. McCain, Mr. \n     Coats, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. \n     Inhofe, Mr. Santorum, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Roberts, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3015.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 110, line 13, strike out ``3.1 percent.'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following:\n     ``3.6 percent.\n       ``(c) Offsetting Reductions in Authorizations of \n     Appropriations.--(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     title I, the total amount authorized to be appropriated under \n     title II is hereby reduced by $150,000,000.\n       ``(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of title II, the \n     total amount authorized to be appropriated under title II is \n     hereby reduced by $275,000,000.''\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this amendment would authorize a 3.6 \npercent pay raise for military personnel.\n  Mr. President, increasing military pay is something the Committee \nwanted to do when we marked-up our bill. However, when we completed our \nmark-up six weeks ago, it was just not possible. Many Senators will \nrecall that we were facing an almost insurmountable outlay problem in \nthe defense budget. The Budget Committee, the Armed Services Committee \nand the Appropriations Committee were engaged in intense discussions to \nfind a solution that would not adversely impact our national security.\n  Now that we have been able to review and analyze the defense \nauthorization and appropriations mark-ups of both bodies, we have \nidentified programs which are hollow. We will use this hollow budget \nauthority and outlays to pay for increasing military pay from the 3.1 \npercent requested by the President to the 3.6 percent level indicated \nby the Employment Cost Index. We will, of course, make the necessary \nadjustments to eliminate the hollow programs during our conference with \nthe House.\n  Mr. President, I have discussed this amendment with the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. Both Senator \nStevens and Senator Inouye have joined the Members of the Armed \nServices Committee as co-sponsors of the amendment.\n  Several weeks ago, the Joint Chiefs were briefed on recruiting and \nretention problems in the services and directed their staffs to review \nactions they could take to increase military pay. I am pleased that we \nare able to find a way to give our military personnel the pay raise \nthey deserve. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I am pleased to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would like to be added as a cosponsor. I am sure the \nchairman would agree with me that Senator McCain was very active in \nbringing to our attention the matters of the pay raise.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nWarner be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Senator Burns' amendment relating to \nMilCon would be the next item. We are anxious to move on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan has one minute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we support the amendment. A number of \nDemocratic members of the Armed Services Committee are already \ncosponsors, I believe, on the amendment. If not, I will ask unanimous \nconsent that we be added as cosponsors. I believe the names of those \ncosponsors are already on the amendment. We support this amendment as \nan offset. It corrects a deficiency building up in military pay for \nsome time. We think it is a good amendment and I hope it is adopted by \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3015) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time that \nwe can recognize the Senator from Oklahoma. He has worked out a \nresolution of the amendment by the Senator from North Carolina.\n  I understand they will need a few more minutes.\n\n\n                        unfair state income tax\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I was planning to offer an amendment to \nthis bill that would provide relief to the 2,200 civilian Tennesseans \nworking at Ft. Campbell who are being unfairly taxed by the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky. My amendment would also provide relief to \nSouth Dakotans working on the Gavins Point Hydroelectric Dam who are \nbeing unfairly taxed by Nebraska, and the Washingtonians working on the \nColumbia River Hydroelectric Dams who are being unfairly treated by \nOregon. I am joined in my efforts by Senators Frist, Gorton, Daschle, \nMurray, and Johnson.\n  Mr. President, the folks working at these facilities may live in \nTennessee or South Dakota, but they are being forced to pay state \nincome tax to Kentucky and Nebraska, even though they receive \nabsolutely no services or benefits from these states. These employees \nare being unfairly taxed by their non-resident state simply because \ntheir work takes them across the border into the neighboring state.\n  The employees enter the neighboring state only on federal property. \nThey do not travel on the neighboring states' roads during the course \nof their work. There is no reciprocal tax agreement between the two \nstates to ensure that individuals pay tax only to one state (as is \nusually the case between neighboring states). So, these employees are \nfully supporting the governments of both their resident state and the \nneighboring state.\n  At Fort Campbell, Tennessee civilians enter Fort Campbell on the \nTennessee side of the post and cross into Kentucky on a Fort Campbell \nroad that is maintained by the federal government. The Tennesseans do \nnot travel on a Kentucky road to reach the Kentucky side of the post. \nAnd all emergency fire, police and medical services at Fort Campbell \nare provided by the federal government.\n  We have a situation where Tennesseans are forced to pay the same \nKentucky state income tax as a Kentucky resident, but they are not \neligible to receive any benefits from the Commonwealth of Kentucky, \nsuch as unemployment compensation, in-state tuition, in-state hunting \nlicenses or in-state fishing licenses.\n  The federal employees working at the Gavins Point Dam and the \nColumbia River Dams face comparable situations.\n  My amendment is very narrowly drawn so as not to establish a broad \nprecedent. It would only affect the three listed facilities. In the \npast, Congress has acted to provide tax relief in similar extraordinary \nsituations. Congress has exempted active duty military personnel, \nMembers of Congress and their staffs, and Amtrak and other multi-state \ntransportation employees from taxation except by their resident states.\n  The legislation on which my amendment is based, H.R. 1953, has passed \nthe other body twice this Congress and was reported by the Senate \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs by a vote of 15 to 0. It is currently \npending in the Senate\n\n[[Page S7113]]\n\nFinance Committee. The Chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, has \nexpressed his support for this measure.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from Kentucky has \nclearly indicated his intention to prevent the Senate from voting on my \namendment. It is not my intent to hold up action on the DOD \nAuthorization bill. I want to ask my distinguished colleague from South \nCarolina, the Chairman of the Committee, then for an assurance that he \nwill work with me and the other cosponsors of this amendment in the \nconference to retain the provision identical to my amendment that was \nincluded in the other body's version of the DOD Authorization bill. \nThis is a very serious matter for my state of Tennessee, for South \nDakota and for Washington state, which must be addressed.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I appreciate how important this matter is to the \nSenators from Tennessee, South Dakota and Washington. I say to the \nSenator that, while I cannot make preconference agreements on outcome, \nI will work with him to try to retain the House provision in final \nconference agreement.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chairman for his cooperation and \nassistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I believe I have 10 minutes under the \nunanimous-consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Thompson, \njust entered a colloquy as it related to the tax situation between \nKentucky and Tennessee. I wanted to be sure that my remarks on the \nunconstitutionality of that amendment were brought to the attention of \nmy colleague.\n  Mr. President, there is a provision in the House version of this bill \nthat really astounds me. I am referring to an amendment to title X of \nthe House bill which was offered by Congressman Bryant. I wish to bring \nit to the attention of the managers. It is a tax issue involving the \nStates of Kentucky and Tennessee. Let me restate that. It is a tax \nissue--not even a federal tax issue, but a state tax issue--and it is \nmentioned in the House version of this bill.\n\n  The House bill contains language which preempts state tax laws and \nlays out how federal and private sector employees who may do work at \nthe Fort Campbell Army installation should be taxed by states. I think \nall Senators should be concerned by the precedent set by this language. \nLet me make a few points relevant to this language.\n  The language in the House bill raises fundamental TAX issues. It is \nwithin the jurisdiction of the Finance and Ways and Means Committees. \nIt has no place on this bill.\n  The House tax language involves issues that should be decided among \nStates. Congress should not be dictating state tax policies in a \nDefense Authorization bill. Congress should not be preempting state tax \nlaws in a Defense bill.\n  At my urging, our Governor's office has contacted the Tennessee \nGovernor's office. Revenue officials from both States have had \npreliminary discussions in the last few weeks. We should allow this \nprocess of negotiation to continue. That is the usual way in which \nStates deal with tax issues like this one. Not on the floor of the \nHouse or Senate.\n  The House tax language will cost my State $4 million in lost revenue. \nThe Governor of Kentucky strongly opposes a Congressional attempt to \npreempt State tax laws in this manner. I ask unanimous consent that a \nletter of opposition to this language from the Governor of Kentucky be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Commonwealth of Kentucky,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                     Frankfurt, KY, June 25, 1998.\n     Hon. Wendell Ford,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ford: I am writing to express Kentucky's \n     opposition to the Thompson amendment currently under \n     consideration by the United States Senate. The issue \n     addressed by this legislation is the tax imposed by the \n     Commonwealth on income earned within Kentucky by non-resident \n     federal workers.\n       The protest by federal workers employed at the Fort \n     Campbell military base against the imposition of the Kentucky \n     income tax has centered on their contention that the tax is \n     unfair to them. All income in question is taxed the same \n     whether earned by a resident or non-resident of Kentucky. \n     Only the income earned within the Commonwealth of Kentucky is \n     taxed. It would be unfair to tax the income of residents but \n     not the income of non-residents doing the same job in the \n     same place. Indeed, if this were the case, it would make \n     sense for Kentucky residents working on the Fort Campbell \n     base to move to Tennessee to avoid the Kentucky income tax.\n       On June 23, 1998, Kentucky's Attorney General sent to me a \n     memorandum which offers a compelling and reasonable argument \n     against the constitutionality of the Thompson amendment under \n     the Commerce Clause. A consequence of this amendment would be \n     its detrimental impact on the Kentucky communities which \n     surround Fort Campbell. The legislation would exceed \n     Congressional authority and would likely be proven as \n     unconstitutional. Congress granted the states the power to \n     tax income, and on several occasions, courts have held that \n     states can assess an income tax to nonresidents who earn \n     their income in that state. Congress can reduce the states' \n     power of taxation, but only through an amendment within the \n     confines of the Commerce Clause.\n       We are attempting to resolve this issue through a joint \n     effort with Tennessee Governor Sundquist's office. This \n     matter is one to be settled at the state level, and not an \n     issue for Congress to resolve. The impacts of the Thompson \n     amendment would far surpass Fort Campbell. These impacts \n     would extend to the employees of every federal institution \n     within close proximity with state borders.\n       In closing, I would like to reiterate that Kentucky's \n     taxation of non-residents working in Kentucky is fair in \n     concept and in practice. To exempt all non-residents or a \n     special group of non-residents who work in Kentucky would be \n     unfair. If I may provide you with any other information on \n     this issue, please feel free to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Paul E. Patton,\n                                                         Governor.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this House tax language is strongly opposed \nby the Federation of Tax Administrators. These are the revenue \nofficials from all 50 States and the District of Columbia. They believe \nthis amendment creates a horrible precedent of preempting State tax \nlaws. I ask unanimous consent that a letter in opposition to this \nlanguage from the Federation of Tax Administrators be printed in the \nRecord at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Federation of Tax Administrators,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1998.\n     Hon. Wendell H. Ford,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Ford: I am writing concerning amendments to \n     the defense appropriations bills (S. 2057) which would \n     preempt Oregon, Kentucky and Nebraska from applying their \n     income taxes to certain federal employees (and in some cases \n     contractors) who work in those states, but reside in \n     bordering states with no income taxes (Washington, Tennessee \n     and South Dakota).\n       These amendments have been separately considered earlier in \n     the 105th Congress as H.R. 1953. The Federation of Tax \n     Administrators is an association of the principal tax \n     administration agencies in the 50 states, the District of \n     Columbia and New York City. The Federation has adopted a \n     policy which urges that the Senate reject H.R. 1953 and any \n     similar language which may be offered as an amendment to \n     other bills.\n       We ask the Senate to recognize that, throughout the history \n     of income taxation, both federal and state, workers are taxed \n     by the jurisdiction where the work is performed. This system \n     represents the keystone of taxation. State lawmakers make \n     exceptions to this system to address individual circumstances \n     where strict adherence to the principle leads to undesirable \n     results. In particular, in those instances where sound fiscal \n     and government policy permit, a state may enter into a \n     reciprocal agreement with a bordering state to permit \n     taxpayers to file a single return in the state of residency. \n     Kentucky is at the forefront of such policy refinements--it \n     has a reciprocal agreement with every border state that has a \n     broad-based individual income tax. (The agreements do not \n     function with non-income-tax states such as Tennessee, and \n     thus they are not applicable in this case.)\n       The U.S. Constitution imposes substantive constraints on \n     the manner in which states may structure their tax systems. \n     These constraint ensure that the tax imposed meets \n     fundamental tests of fairness in dealing with all citizens. \n     The Constitution further ensures that state taxes do not \n     impose undue burdens on interstate commerce or the federal \n     government. The taxes imposed by these states meet these \n     requirements and should not be preempted. There is no \n     question that states have the legal authority to tax the \n     income of nonresidents working in Oregon, Kentucky or \n     Nebraska.\n       What this amendment would do is carve out a special tax \n     benefit for workers who choose to live (or move) out of state \n     that would not be available to any other employees working at \n     the same location. Further,\n\n[[Page S7114]]\n\n     the language exempts from taxation wages paid to federal \n     workers in Oregon and Nebraska--but it exempts from tax \n     income paid to all individuals who work in Fort Campbell in \n     Kentucky. This encompasses not only contract employees who \n     work directly for the military (for instance, school \n     teachers), but also includes the employees of private \n     companies who run businesses or perform services on the base, \n     including such businesses as restaurants and road maintenance \n     firms. These are clearly private businesspeople, not federal \n     workers. If Kentucky is to be preempted from taxing \n     individuals who work for the federal government, we \n     particularly urge the Senate to adopt language that more \n     precisely defines the matter. (More precise definitions have \n     been offered by the Pentagon.)\n       Finally, and most importantly, if change is necessary, it \n     is within the power of the states involved to do so. This is \n     an issue for state lawmakers, not federal lawmakers. \n     Lawmakers in Kentucky and Tennessee are seeking an equitable \n     solution that would not impose an unfair burden on either \n     state. Oregon has already passed a law that exempts from \n     taxation those federal employees who work on the dam in \n     Oregon. (We would emphasize that to continue to include \n     Oregon in this bill is unnecessary and an insult to the \n     elected officials of that state.)\n       The ability to define their tax systems within the bounds \n     of the Constitution is one of the core elements of \n     sovereignty preserved to the states under the Constitution. A \n     central feature of this sovereignty is the ability to tax \n     economic activity and income earned within the borders of the \n     state, and it is vital to the continued strong role of the \n     states in the federal system. State taxing authority should \n     be preempted by the federal government only where there is a \n     compelling policy rationale. There is no such rationale \n     present here.\n       The Senate is faced with an opportunity to demonstrate good \n     faith to the principles contained in The Unfunded Mandates \n     Act of 1995. If Congress feels that the impact of federal \n     workers on installations crossing the borders of two states--\n     one of which imposes an income tax and the other of which \n     does not--should be offset, it should provide the funding \n     necessary to offset the costs imposed on the states affected.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Harley T. Duncan,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me quote from a couple of lines from \nthis.\n\n       We ask the Senate to recognize that throughout the history \n     of income taxation, both Federal and State, workers are taxed \n     by the jurisdiction where the work is performed.\n\n  Another part of the letter says:\n\n       The U.S. Constitution imposes substantive constraints on \n     the manner in which States may structure their tax systems. \n     These restraints ensure that the tax imposed meets \n     fundamental tests of fairness in dealing with all citizens.\n\n  The letter says:\n\n       Finally, and most importantly, if change is necessary, it \n     is within the power of the States involved to do so.\n\n  And:\n\n       The ability to define their tax systems within the bounds \n     of the Constitution is one of the core elements of \n     sovereignty preserved to the States under the Constitution.\n\n  There is no rationale of precedent here under this situation.\n  Mr. President, Oregon has just worked out the problem between \nWashington and the State of Oregon, as it should be done. Yet, my \nfriend from Tennessee included Oregon and Washington in his statement.\n  If this language is agreed to, then Tupelo, MS, had better look out \nbecause the same thing that is happening in Kentucky will happen to \nMississippi, because the same situation occurs near Tupelo from \nTennessee, and then there is a park system at the border there. So they \nwould have to, in good conscience, go after two additional States.\n  It was my understanding that the Senator from Tennessee, Senator \nThompson, was considered offering a similar amendment to this bill. \nSenators from at least 24 States should be concerned about the \nprecedent this language would set. Any State which borders another \nState with no state income tax structure should be concerned about the \nprecedent set by this language. I ask unanimous consent that a list of \nthe 24 States that could be adversely affected by the proposed language \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   The Disturbing Precedent Set by the Thompson Amendment--Potential \n  Future Impact on States Bordering Other States With No Broad Based \n                               Income Tax\n\n       Senators from these 24 States should be concerned about the \n     precedent set:\n     Alabama\n     Arkansas\n     Arizona\n     California\n     Colorado\n     Georgia\n     Idaho\n     Iowa\n     Kentucky\n     Louisana\n     Maine\n     Massachusetts\n     Minnesota\n     Mississippi\n     Missouri\n     Montana\n     Nebraska\n     New Mexico\n     North Dakota\n     Oklahoma\n     Oregon\n     Utah\n     Vermont\n     Virginia\n\n  Mr. FORD.

Think about this now. \nBack in 1995 we passed a law on unfunded mandates. This amendment, if \nit was offered here--but it is in the House and will be in conference-- \nviolates, if not the law, the spirit of the law on unfunded mandates.\n  The House language and the Thompson amendment that was not offered \nalso raise significant constitutional concerns.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an opinion from the Office of the \nAttorney General from the Commonwealth of Kentucky suggesting the \nThompson amendment may be unconstitutional be printed in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Commonwealth of Kentucky,\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                     Frankfort, KY, June 23, 1998.\n     To: Scott White.\n     From: Jason Moseley.\n     Re: Income tax on out-of-state residents.\n       This is in response to your request for research and a \n     constitutional argument in opposition to HR 1953--Limitation \n     on State authority to tax compensation paid to individuals \n     performing services at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. (See \n     attached) Below is the proposed constitutional to this \n     legislation.\n       In short, Congress receded jurisdiction to the state to \n     assess a state income tax and, through this proposed \n     legislation, intends to limit that state power. The most \n     plausible power that would be used for Congressional \n     authority to make such an amendment is the Commerce Clause. \n     The constitutional challenge to such authority is that this \n     amendment exceeds Congressional power under the Commerce \n     Clause.\n\n\n                                argument\n\n       At issue is the constitutionality of proposed legislation \n     that would allow Congress to determine where individuals pay \n     their state income tax. Of the enumerated powers given to \n     Congress, the Commerce Clause appears to be the only possible \n     source of authority for such legislation. As a consequence, \n     an argument can be made that this legislation would have no \n     effect on interstate commerce and would have a detrimental \n     effect on the Kentucky communities in and around Fort \n     Campbell. Therefore, the legislation would exceed \n     Congressional power under the Commerce Clause, making the \n     legislation unconstitutional.\n       On several occasions, courts have held that states can \n     assess an income tax to nonresidents who earn their income in \n     that state, (Shaffer v. Carter, 252 U.S. 37 (1919); Travis v. \n     Yale & Towne MFG. Co., 252 U.S. 60 (1919); City of Cincinnati \n     v. Faig, 145 N.E.2d 563 (1957); Ratliff v. Lexington-Fayette \n     Urban County Government, 540 S.W.2d 8 (Ky. 1976), but this \n     power to tax was given to the states by Congress under the \n     Buck Act, 4 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 104-110. Section 106 of this act \n     states:\n       ``No person shall be relieved from his liability for any \n     incomes tax levied by any state, or by any duly \n     constitutional taxing authority therein, having jurisdiction \n     to levy such a tax, by reason of his residing within a \n     Federal area or receiving income from transactions occurring \n     or services performed in such area; and such State or taxing \n     authority shall have full jurisdiction and power to levy and \n     collect such tax in any Federal area within such State to the \n     same extent and with the same effect as though such area was \n     not a Federal area.''\n\n     4 U.S.C. Sec. 106(a). Congress gave the stats this power to \n     tax income and Congress, through an amendment, can reduce \n     that power within the confines of the Commerce Clause.\n       There is no case law pertaining to Congress' power to \n     restrict a state's ability to assess an income tax on \n     nonresidents but there are recent Supreme Court decisions \n     where the Court has established limitations\n\n[[Page S7116]]\n\n     on the Commerce Clause.

United \n     States, 505 U.S. 144, 112 S.Ct. 2408, 120 L.Ed.2d 120 (1992). \n     In Lopez, the Supreme Court held that the Gun-Free School \n     Act, which made it a federal offense to knowingly possess a \n     firearm at a place the person knows or has reason to believe \n     is a school zone, exceeded Congressional power under the \n     Commerce Clause. Lopez, 115 S.Ct. at 1625. It was in Lopez, \n     that the court states the most current test for limitations \n     on the Commerce Clause. Congressional power is limited to \n     three areas. Id. at 1629. ``First, Congress may regulate the \n     use of the channels of interstate commerce.'' Id. This was \n     interpreted as meaning that Congress has the authority ``to \n     keep the channels of interstate commerce free from immoral \n     and injurious uses.'' Id. ``Second, Congress is empowered to \n     regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate \n     commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even \n     though the threat may come only from intrastate activities.'' \n     Id. This area has been found to apply to vehicles and \n     aircraft used in interstate commerce and the theft of \n     interstate shipments. Id. ``Finally, Congress' commerce \n     authority includes power to regulate those activities having \n     a substantial relation to interstate commerce.'' Id. at 1629-\n     1630.\n       The first two areas of power are not applicable to the \n     proposed legislation. The proposed legislation is not an \n     attempt to regulate the use of the channels of interstate \n     commerce. The legislation is also not an attempt to protect \n     an instrumentality of interstate commerce. This is an attempt \n     to alter a state's taxing powers in assessing an income \n     tax to employees that may reside in other states. The only \n     area of power that may justify such legislation is the \n     third area which gives Congress authority to regulate \n     those activities that have a substantial relation to \n     interstate commerce.\n       From the language of the Buck Act, it is evident that \n     Congress recognized that the power to assess an income tax is \n     a function of the state and, more specifically, the state \n     where the income is earned. Assessing an income tax \n     predominately affects the community where the person is \n     employed. There is little to no effect on interstate \n     commerce. Whatever effect there might be is not substantial. \n     The effect of an income tax on the community level is great \n     and reaches many levels. When a person works in a community, \n     there are certain benefits conferred to that employee by the \n     community. These benefits are ``substantial and realistic.'' \n     Ratliff v. Lexington-Fayett Urban County Government, 540 S.W. \n     2d 8,9 (Ky. 1976). ``The employees in going to and from work \n     receive police protection and use roadways built or \n     maintained by the . . . county government. The . . . county \n     government furnishes employees . . . with public facilities. \n     Beautiful landscapes and other esthetic benefits are \n     provided.'' Id. Residents of the community in which they are \n     employed have their income taxed so that the benefits \n     mentioned above can be provided. If a nonresident were to be \n     exempted from contributing back to the community which \n     conferred these benefits, the community would be forced to \n     reduce the amount of money used to fund such programs, \n     resulting in a smaller and less effective police force, less \n     funding for road construction and maintenance, and fewer \n     public facilities with less maintenance. The only other \n     option would be to increase the income tax on those who work \n     and reside in the community so that the level of service \n     could be continued. The community would either have to lessen \n     their own standard of living or increase the tax on their own \n     residents so that nonresidents employed in the community \n     could receive those benefits for free.\n       A state income tax has a substantial relation to activities \n     within the state. There is little if any effect on interstate \n     commerce. When Tennessee a resident comes to work at Fort \n     Campbell, they work, receive a pay check, are assessed an \n     income tax, and return to Tennessee. One might argue that for \n     states such as Tennessee, which has no income tax but imposes \n     a higher sales tax, assessing an income tax on Tennessee \n     residents that work in Kentucky has a substantial effect on \n     the state of Tennessee. This is not the case. If it were, the \n     converse would be true as well. Kentucky residents who \n     purchased items in Tennessee should be exempted from \n     Tennessee sales tax because they pay an income tax in \n     Kentucky.\n       The nature of an income tax is payment given for a benefit \n     conferred. It effects both the community that provides the \n     individual with a job and the individual worker who pays back \n     into the community that has provided the job. The effect of \n     an income tax does not cross state lines just as the effect \n     of a sales tax does not cross state lines. It does not have a \n     substantial relation to interstate commerce. To decide \n     otherwise, and approve this amendment, would effectively make \n     all income and sales tax the province of the Federal \n     government. This would not amend 4 U.S.C. Sec. 106 but would \n     nullify it.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Anticipating what Congressional power will be used as \n     authority for this legislation consequently makes this \n     research limited in its scope. The commerce clause appears to \n     be the only enumerated power that would provide authority for \n     such legislation. The argument has been made by Rep. Linda \n     Smith of Washington state that an income tax on non-resident \n     workers is taxation without representation. The situation \n     addressed by Rep. Smith involved workers on a dam straddling \n     the Washington/Oregon state line. Workers would cross the \n     state line several times a day, making it difficult to keep \n     record of how long an employee was working in each state. \n     This situation is distinguishable from that of Fort Campbell \n     workers. In examining the circumstances at Fort Campbell, it \n     is a case of individuals working in solely Kentucky, \n     benefitting from the services provided by Kentucky \n     communities. Because of this distinction, the `taxation with \n     representation' argument falls to the sales tax analogy \n     mentioned above. If assessing an income tax to residents \n     where they earn their income is taxation without \n     representation, assessing a sales tax to consumers where they \n     purchase their goods would also be taxation without \n     representation.\n       What has been proposed is not an amendment to the Buck Act \n     but an attempt, through piece-meal legislation, to do away \n     with it. Such an amendment is beyond the Commerce Clause \n     powers of Congress and would be unconstitutional.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, why are we singling out this Federal \nfacility? We really do not know the full scope of this issue and this \nprecedent we are creating by preempting State law.\n  The employees of Fort Campbell wherever they reside--benefit from \nservices provided by the States of Kentucky and Tennessee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nKentucky Revenue Cabinet detailing the services provided to all Fort \nCampbell employees, including those who reside in Tennessee, be printed \nin the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Revenue Cabinet,\n\n\n                                    Office of General Counsel,\n\n                                     Frankfort, KY, July 11, 1997.\n     Re H.R. 1953--Fort Campbell.\n\n     Mr. Harley Duncan,\n     Federation of Tax Administrators, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Harley: The Revenue Cabinet has gathered some \n     information on the Fort Campbell issue of whether employees \n     who live in Tennessee and work on the Kentucky side of the \n     Fort Campbell installation receive any benefits from the \n     state of Kentucky.\n       The question of what services Kentucky provides is quite \n     broad. I will attempt to itemize below what we have \n     investigated and the results.\n       Roads--Fort Campbell is accessible from both the Kentucky \n     side and the Tennessee side. Most workers enter the base at \n     the gate nearest their work station. This means, for example, \n     that most hospital workers enter on the Tennessee side (the \n     hospital is in Tennessee), and most school workers enter on \n     the Kentucky side using Kentucky maintained roads (the school \n     is in Kentucky).\n       Water and Sewer Service--Self contained on the base.\n       Electric Service--Most is supplied directly to the base by \n     the Tennessee Valley Authority. One housing area, however, is \n     supplied by the Pennyrile Electric Cooperative, a Kentucky \n     based electric company.\n       Cooperative Fire Protection--Local communities in both \n     Kentucky and Tennessee have agreements with Fort Campbell to \n     assist in the event of a major fire or other emergency.\n       Schools--The school system on the Fort Campbell base is \n     fully self-contained and federally funded. It is limited to \n     the children of active duty military personnel stationed at \n     the military base.\n       Police Protection--All police protection is self-contained. \n     Responsibility for Fort Campbell and all federal military \n     bases rests with the federal/military police.\n       Unemployment Benefits--Federal civilian workers who become \n     unemployed can apply for benefits from the state where they \n     work or the state where they live. If a Tennessee resident \n     working in Kentucky becomes unemployed and applies in \n     Tennessee, a transfer is made from the Kentucky fund to the \n     Tennessee fund to pay that worker's unemployment claim. The \n     result is that wherever the claim is filed, Kentucky funds \n     pay the claim.\n       I hope this information is helpful to you in your efforts \n     concerning HR 1953. It is our belief that the civilian \n     employees who work on the Kentucky side of Fort Campbell \n     definitely receive some benefits from the state of Kentucky.\n       The Kentucky Revenue Cabinet greatly appreciates the work \n     FTA is doing on HR 1953. Harley, we can't thank you and your \n     staff enough. If I can be of further assistance, please let \n     me know.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Alex W. Rose,\n\n                                  Commissioner, Department of Law,\n                                         Kentucky Revenue Cabinet.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, tax legislation, and especially tax \nlegislation that preempts State law, should not be snuck into a defense \nbill in this manner. I intended to offer an amendment which dealt with \nthis issue and would help educate Senators on the potential broad scope \nof the precedent being set by the House language. However, in the \ninterest of finishing this bill, I will withhold offering an amendment \nat this time.\n\n[[Page S7117]]\n\n  However, I wish to alert the managers to my strong objection to such \nlanguage being included in this bill, or any other unrelated bill. I \nstrongly object to inclusion of such language in the conference report.\n  I urge the managers to protect my interests.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Kentucky has \nmade a strong case. I agree with him. Complex tax proposals of this \ntype which preempt State tax laws do not belong in a defense bill. I \nwill make sure that his concerns are considered by the conference \ncommittee when we address the differences between the House and the \nSenate versions of this bill.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan and hope \nthat the majority manager of the bill will give the same attention that \nI have asked for here.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I believe we are ready to conclude a \nmatter with the Senator from North Carolina and--I guess we still need \nto do one more check. Senator Burns is next in line.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2728\n\n   (Purpose: To improve the quality of life for members of the Armed \n  Forces by authorizing additional military construction and military \n                        family housing projects)\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2728, for myself, \nthe ranking member of the Military Construction Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Murray, along with Senators Stevens, Byrd, \nInouye, and Lott to be added as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana (Mr. Burns), for himself, Mr. \n     Lott, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Byrd, and Mr. Inouye, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2728.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 324, below line 14, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2705.

Mr. President, this calls for an additional 27 quality-of-\nlife military construction projects throughout the Department of \nDefense. These projects are located in 22 States, and some overseas. \nAnd it is focused entirely on quality of life.\n  If we have learned anything from our visitations to military \ninstallations, it is that we have not focused on such as health care \ncenters, child care centers, recreation, and also housing for our \nenlisted, and barracks for our enlisted. It encompasses projects such \nas child care, dining facilities, modernization, replacement of \nbarracks, and family housing.\n  We did not focus on any particular State, geographic region or \ncommittee membership, but rather we tried to find worthy and \nmeritorious projects that the services wanted and requested but we \ncould not afford in the near term. The majority of these projects were \nnot asked for by Members of the Senate. Rather, they are projects \nrequested by the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the Marine Corps. \nEvery single one of these projects is contained in the Department of \nDefense Future Year Defense Plan or FYDP. Further, over half are in the \nearly years of that plan.\n  Mr. President, we offer this amendment, and I yield the floor to my \ncolleague from Washington, Senator Murray.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise to join with Senator Burns in fully endorsing this amendment \nto the Armed Services bill. Chairman Stevens, Senator Byrd, Senator \nInouye, Senator Burns and myself have cosponsored this amendment with \nthe sole intention of providing essential quality of life programs and \ninitiatives for our men and women in uniform.\n  Increasingly over the last few years, military construction has been \ngiven the shorter end of the stick in terms of adequate funding. \nCongress has always stood by our services, and managed to increase \nfunding where we thought an increase was necessary.\n  Again, this year we face a similar situation, with the budget request \nat $1.4 billion less than what we appropriated last year. The Armed \nServices Committee significantly bridged this gap by authorizing an \nadditional $500 million in much-needed military construction projects. \nBut we would like to take it a step further and add $200 million for \nmilitary construction quality of life projects. This would make the \nmilitary construction budget $8.48 billion, still $700 million less \nthan what was authorized and appropriated last year, but at least $700 \nmillion above the less than adequate budget request.\n  The projects we have included in this $200 million request are all \nbonafide quality of life initiatives. We are hearing more and more \noften how our services are struggling with lower than average retention \nrates. While this shortfall is being addressed through other means, it \nis also important to address it through military construction. Some of \nthe biggest complaints from our service men and women are regarding \nthings like child care centers. Inadequate housing conditions, old \ndining facilities, and lack of physical fitness centers. We tried to \nmeet these very real needs in our amendment, providing funds for 27 \nprojects in 22 States. All of these projects are in DOD's future year \ndefense plan, and all of these fall under the criteria of quality of \nlife. Furthermore, the selection of the projects was made in a very \nbipartisan way. We did not focus on a certain political party or a \ncertain geographical region. Instead, we went to the services and asked \nthem what they needed but couldn't afford.\n\n  Probably at the front of many of my colleagues' minds is the fiasco \nwe had last year with the line-item veto of 37 of our military \nconstruction projects and an unfounded concern that these projects may \nbe mere pork. Let me assure you that all of these projects were \ncarefully selected with the threat of the line-item veto in mind. Every \nsingle one of these projects has been included in DOD's future year \ndefense plan, and all of these are quality of life projects, meeting \nthe very criteria that the President submitted last year in regards to \nthe line-item veto. Fortunately, the Supreme Court has just determined \nthat we won't have to fight that fight again, but it should be \nreassuring to all here of the thoughtfulness and seriousness in which \nwe chose all of the projects on this list.\n\n  Mr. President, I have to say that it concerns me when I hear \ncriticism of the military construction bill as being ``Christmas in \nJuly,'' delivering ``pork'' projects to Members. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth, especially for the kinds of projects we're \ntalking about today. First of all, as I just mentioned, these projects \nare based on the needs of the services, not the requests of Members. \nSecondly, and most importantly, at the very least, we owe our men and \nwomen in uniform a quality of life that is comparable to their civilian \ncounterparts. They should not be compelled to live in inadequate \nfacilities, to travel off-base for child care, to pay for membership in \na physical fitness center because their installation doesn't have one. \nThese are small dollar items that will mean so much to so many people. \nA gesture like this can only but help in quality of life, help in \noverall satisfaction with the services, help in retention, and \ntherefore help our services meet their force needs and requirements for \nthe 21st century.\n  This is a fair, bipartisan, and legitimate means of providing our \nservice men and women with necessary quality of life programs. We have \nbeen fortunate to work with our colleagues on the Armed Services \nCommittee in ensuring this is an acceptable amendment and an acceptable \nallocation of resources. I hope and expect this amendment can be fully \nembraced by the Armed Services Committee, and I encourage my colleagues \nto support its inclusion.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I stand before this body to address the \nconsiderable number of low-priority, unrequested military construction \nprojects that have been added to the FY 1999 Military Construction \nAppropriations Bill.\n  Since the end of the ``Cold War,'' the budget that provides for the \ndefense of this nation has been cut in half as a percentage of the \ngross domestic product and by over $120 billion in real terms. As a \nresult of these drastic cuts, our military force structure has shrunk \nby more than 30 percent; Operations and Maintenance accounts have been \nreduced by 40 percent; procurement has declined by more than 50 \npercent, and paychecks for our service members now lag an embarrassing \n13 percent behind their civilian counterparts.\n  In stark contrast, our military has seen a 400 percent increase in \noperational commitments over the same period. The tempo of operations \nhas never been so high in a time of peace. And yet, America's military \npersonnel have performed admirably, bridging the gap between decreased \nfunding and increased commitments with sheer dedication to duty and \nprofessionalism. Unfortunately, the damage caused by the \nAdministration's continual practice of asking the military to ``do more \nwith less,'' is becoming very evident.\n  Retention rates throughout the military are down. Mid-grade officers \nand senior non-commissioned officers--groups traditionally thought of \nas career oriented personnel--are exiting the service in increasing \nnumbers. All of the services are facing pilot shortages, no doubt \nprecipitated by reductions in flight hours, declining aircraft \navailability, and increased time away from home.\n  Recruitment goals are not being met. Except for the Marine Corps, all \nof the services are falling short of their recruiting to 7,000 recruits \nshort by the end of the year. This follows the Navy's 12,000 recruit \nshortfall of last year. When recruiters offer potential recruits the \nopportunity to be over-worked, underpaid, spartanly supported and often \naway from home, many of America's best and brightest are saying ``no \nthank you.''\n\n[[Page S7119]]\n\n  Readiness is in decline. Secretary Cohen, the service chiefs, \nregional commanders in chief, and various other military leaders have \nacknowledged that there are significant indicators of readiness \nproblems. There are also significant shortages of critical spare parts. \nThese shortages are forcing maintenance personnel to routinely use \ncannibalized parts--parts taken off of other supposedly operational \nsystems--to keep equipment operating.\n\n  All of these problems--declining readiness, retention and recruitment \nshortfalls, inoperative equipment--are the result of chronic under-\nfunding of our nation's security interests.\n  The Congress, most certainly, has not turned a blind eye to the needs \nof the services. In the previous three years, Congress has added more \nthan $20 billion to the defense budget requests submitted by the \nClinton Administration. So why do we still have these serious and \ngrowing deficiencies in readiness, pay, and modernization? Because the \npractice of Congress has tragically been to mis-use billions of these \nscarce defense dollars to add unrequested programs and building \nprojects to the defense budget.\n  This year's Military Construction Appropriations Bill was crafted \nunder the spending caps of the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997. The \nagreement established firm limits to the National Defense budget. With \nthese budget constraints in place, on would think that members would \nfind it difficult to even consider adding projects of questionable \nmerit, since the offsets required to pay for such requests would siphon \nprecious dollars from areas of greater need within the defense budget. \nThe temptation for members to pander to their parochial interests, I am \nsad to report, has proven too great to resist.\n  One only needs to look at the 114 unrequested military construction \nprojects, at a cost of nearly $800 million in the FY 1999 Military \nConstruction Appropriations bill, to realize the pork habit has become \nan addiction. If this bill is accepted as written, we will have added \n$9 billion in unrequested military construction projects since 1990. \nNine billion dollars!\n  The question is not whether these unrequested military construction \nprojects can be defended as meeting the Senate's review criteria or as \nactions within the prerogatives of Congress. The question is whether we \nare directing scarce defense resources where they will do the greatest \ngood for our country and for the men and women of our All Volunteer \nForce. I believe we are not.\n  This bill funds ten unrequested National Guard armories and Reserve \ncenters at a cost of $65 million. Twelve million dollars is \nappropriated to replace existing dining facilities at two joint \ncivilian/military airports--one, at Dannelly Field, Alabama and the \nother, at Ft. Wayne, Indiana. Hickman Air Force Base will get a new \n$5.1 million dollar civil engineering facility to replace the existing \none.\n  The folks at Fort Wainwright, Alaska will doubtless see readiness \nlevels soar as they christen their new $3 million vehicle wash \nfacility. Fort Bragg, South Carolina gets $8.3 million to erect mission \ncritical fencing.\n  At a time when many installations are closing libraries because of \nlack of use, this bill appropriates $8.5 million dollars to build a \nvery impressive, yet unnecessary library at Shaw Air Force Base.\n  Training at the National Training Center has suffered due to \npersonnel and funding cuts, and the number of ``Red Flag'' air combat \nexercises has also been reduced due to funding cuts. Yet this bill \nappropriates nearly $14 million for a ``Regional Training Institute'' \nat Camp Dawson, West Virginia--a small National Guard weekend drill \nfacility.\n  Many of the additions to this bill were made in the name of service \nmember quality of life. It is interesting to note that not a single one \nof the Chief of Naval Operations' unfunded priority, quality of life \nprojects is in this bill. The Commandant of the Marine Corps has \npriority quality of life project on the list of adds. None of the Air \nForce's top six unfunded quality of life projects made this bill. Only \none of the top 15 did.\n  In contrast, 95 percent of the construction projects in the amendment \nare to be built in the States or districts of appropriations committee \nmembers.\n  In closing, let me say that I am sure there are many good projects on \nthis list. Many of these projects will serve to improve the quality of \nlife of our military personnel, and they will provide facilities and \nimprovements that will enhance mission readiness. But the real reason \nthese projects are funded in this bill is that they provide economic \nbenefit to certain states.\n  With today's budget realities, it is absolutely critical that every \ndefense dollar be spent where it will do the most good. We, the \nCongress, must stop the practice carving out our little portion of the \nDefense Budget to keep the folks at home happy. We must, instead, do \nwhat is best for the services as a whole. We owe nothing less to our \nmen and women in uniform.\n  I ask unanimous consent a list of military construction \nappropriations additions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                             FY 1999 MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS BILL ADDS                             \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              State                             Base                         Facility          Cost in thousands\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama.........................

Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment \noffered tonight by Senator Burns providing additional funds for \nmilitary construction projects. One of the most important aspects of \nmilitary readiness is the quality of life that the soldiers who defend \nour Nation encounter on a daily basis. This amendment focusses only on \nquality of life projects and funds projects of only the highest \npriority--those on the Armed Services' Future Years Defense Plan.\n  Mr. President, two projects found in this amendment are located in \nGeorgia, one at Robins Air Force Base and one at Moody Air Force Base. \nI know from my visits to these military installations that these \nprojects will contribute substantially to the quality of life for the \nsoldiers stationed at the respective bases. I applaud the efforts of my \ncolleague, Senator Burns, to increase funding in an area that needs \nthis assistance and his efforts to help our Nation's soldiers.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana. The Senator has 1 \nminute remaining.\n  Mr. BURNS. We have to understand that in this fiscal year we are \nabout $700 million under what we allocated and appropriated for \nmilitary construction a year ago. Compared to 2 years ago, this \nexpenditure is down $2 billion. And I think this committee has done a \ngood job in trying to seek out those projects that are necessary. We \nhave done it, and we have cut some of the fat out of this \nappropriations and put the money where we really think it is needed and \ndid it in a way that stays within our budget and our allocation.\n  So we are $2 billion less in expenditures than we were 2 years ago. \nSo I think this committee has done a commendable job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nArizona is to be recognized to offer a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, would the Chair kindly repeat that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, the Senator from \nArizona is to be recognized at this point to offer a second-degree \namendment.\n\n[[Page S7121]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have been in consultation with the staff \nof the Senator from Arizona, and I am just going to ask that we move on \nto the next item on the UC at this time, preserving the rights of the \nSenator from Arizona under the unanimous-consent agreement.\n  So I ask unanimous consent to preserve the rights accorded to the \nSenator from Arizona and we move forward from that and proceed to the \nnext item.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  I wish to advise Senators we are moving along a little bit ahead of \nschedule, which is good. I think there could well be a disposition that \nthe Senator from Arizona has in mind.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3016\n\n     (Purpose: To name the bill in honor of Senator Strom Thurmond)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will now move to the next item under \nthe unanimous-consent agreement which, as I understand it, is an \namendment by the Senator from Virginia, myself, on behalf of the \ndistinguished ranking member, Mr. Levin; on behalf of the distinguished \nmajority leader, Mr. Lott; and on behalf of the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, Mr. Daschle. I will send the amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. WARNER], for himself, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Lott, Mr. Daschle, Mr. McCain, Mr. Coats, Mr. \n     Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n     Santorum, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bingaman, \n     Mr. Glenn, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Robb, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Cleland \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3016.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike out section 1 and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina first became a \n     member of the Committee on Armed Services of the United \n     States Senate on January 19, 1959. His continuous service on \n     that committee covers more than 75 percent of the period of \n     the existence of the committee, which was established \n     immediately after World War II, and more than 20 percent of \n     the period of the existence of military and naval affairs \n     committees of Congress, the original bodies of which were \n     formed in 1816.\n       (2) Senator Thurmond came to Congress and the committee as \n     a distinguished veteran of service, including combat service, \n     in the Armed Forces of the United States.\n       (3) Senator Thurmond was commissioned as a reserve second \n     lieutenant of infantry in 1924. He served with great \n     distinction with the First Army in the European Theater of \n     Operations during World War II, landing in Normandy in a \n     glider with the 82nd Airborne Division on D-Day. He was \n     transferred to the Pacific Theater of Operations at the end \n     of the war in Europe and was serving in the Philippines when \n     Japan surrendered.\n       (4) Having reverted to Reserve status at the end of World \n     War II, Senator Thurmond was promoted to brigadier general in \n     the United States Army Reserve in 1954. He served as \n     President of the Reserve Officers Association beginning that \n     same year and ending in 1955. Senator Thurmond was promoted \n     to major general in the United States Army Reserve in 1959. \n     He transferred to the Retired Reserve on January 1, 1965, \n     after 36 years of commissioned service.\n       (5) The distinguished character of Senator Thurmond's \n     military service has been recognized by awards of numerous \n     decorations that include the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star \n     medal with ``V'' device, the Belgian Cross of the Order of \n     the Crown, and the French Croix de Guerre.\n       (6) Senator Thurmond has served as Chairman of the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate since 1995 and as \n     the ranking minority member of the committee from 1993 to \n     1995. Senator Thurmond concludes his service as Chairman at \n     the end of the 105th Congress, but is to continue to serve \n     the committee as a member in successive Congresses.\n       (7) This Act is the fortieth annual authorization bill for \n     the Department of Defense for which Senator Thurmond has \n     taken a major responsibility as a member of the Committee on \n     Armed Services of the Senate.\n       (8) Senator Thurmond, as officer and legislator, has made \n     matchless contributions to the national security of the \n     United States that, in duration and in quality, are unique.\n       (9) It is altogether fitting and proper that this Act, the \n     last annual authorization Act for the national defense that \n     Senator Thurmond manages in and for the United States Senate \n     as Chairman of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, \n     be named in his honor.\n       (b) Short Title.--This Act shall be cited as the ``Strom \n     Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     1999''.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the course of the history of the \nSenate, there comes a moment whereby we recognize the extraordinary \ncontributions of one of our Members. Tonight I rise on behalf of myself \nand others to recognize the services of the distinguished chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Strom Thurmond. I am pleased to introduce \nthis amendment which would name the Department of Defense authorization \nbill presently under consideration after our chairman, Strom Thurmond \nof South Carolina.\n  Very few, if any, persons in American history have made the \ncontributions, in length and quality, to the national defense that \nSenator Thurmond has made. First commissioned a Reserve officer in \n1924, he volunteered for active duty in 1941. He went into Normandy on \nD-Day, June 6, 1944, in a glider with the 82d Airborne Division, and \nfought throughout the campaigns in northern Europe. Transferred then as \na volunteer to go to the Pacific theater following the surrender of \nGermany, he served then in the Philippines when Japan surrendered.\n  Promoted to brigadier general in the Army Reserve in 1954 and to \nmajor general in 1959, Senator Thurmond remained on active status until \n1965. He served as national president of the Reserve Officers \nAssociation, 1954 to 1955.\n  Senator Thurmond first became a member of the Committee on Armed \nServices in January of 1959. He served as the committee's ranking \nminority member from 1993 to 1995 and as chairman from 1995 to the \npresent. He has announced that he will step down as chairman during the \ncourse of the next Congress--or the completion of this Congress--and he \nwill, of course, remain then the ranking member of our committee.\n  Senator Thurmond's nearly 40 years of service on the Committee on \nArmed Services covers 75 percent of the time of the existence of that \ncommittee, which was formed by the merger of the old Committees on \nMilitary Affairs and Naval Affairs in 1947. Perhaps more remarkably, he \ncovers over 20 percent of the time since the original committees were \nset up, since 1816.\n  In view of his matchless contributions to the national defense, both \non the battlefield and in the Senate Chamber, it is altogether \nappropriate that tonight the present bill, the last he will manage as \nchairman of the Committee on Armed Services, be named in his honor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is only because the hour is late and we are trying to \nwrap up this bill that I only will spend a moment saying how important \nit is that we adopt this amendment in paying respects to our chairman, \nwho has done such an extraordinary job in moving our committee along in \nthese last few years as chairman, and as a member for so many years \nbefore that.\n  As ranking member, I had the privilege of working with Senator Strom \nThurmond, for Senator Thurmond is a chairman who approached these \nissues on a bipartisan basis, as the defense budget should be \napproached. He has always set forth a determination that we protect our \nNation's security first and foremost, and that the men and women in our \nArmed Forces be the focus of our resolve, and the protection and \nsecurity of this Nation through them be what is first and foremost in \nour minds.\n  So this is a small gesture that the Senator from Virginia is leading \ntonight. I want to commend him for thinking of this and for taking the \nleadership on this. I want to tell him it is my pleasure to join with \nhim and do what we do so often, act on a bipartisan basis in the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  I congratulate Senator Thurmond. This will be the last defense \nauthorization bill that he will manage, but there will be many, many, \nmany, many more years of energetic efforts that will be forthcoming \nfrom the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I salute one of the greatest Senators this \nbody has ever seen. Strom Thurmond is one\n\n[[Page S7122]]\n\nof the greatest men I have ever known. A fine attorney, judge, local \nand State leader, war veteran, patriot, hero and long-term Senator. \nStrom is a great father and family man. He is a fine human being who \nalways stands up for the right with all his might. He has been a fine \nexample to all of us who serve with him and to the public at large.\n  I've had the privilege of serving on the Judiciary Committee with him \nover the past 22 years. He has always worked hard, fought for his \nbeliefs, and has set an example for all of us.\n  I truly love Strom Thurmond and will do my best to live up to his \ngreat example.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to rise \ntoday in honor of my close friend, the distinguished senior senator \nfrom South Carolina and Chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, Strom Thurmond, on the completion of the FY 99 Defense \nAuthorization bill. This marks the last time that Senator Thurmond will \nmanage a Defense Authorization Bill in his capacity as Chairman of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee.\n  Senator Thurmond is an exceptional man, a truly remarkable individual \nwho has unselfishly dedicated his entire life to the service of others. \nMr. President, earlier in the 105th Congress, on May 25, 1997, Senator \nThurmond made history in this institution when he became he longest-\nserving United States Senator in our nation's history. He is a model in \nperseverance and is a testament to the greatness of this body and to \nthis nation as a whole.\n  Senator Thurmond was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1954 as a \nwrite-in candidate. He was the first person in U.S. history to ever be \nelected to a major U.S. office in this manner. He has since served the \npeople of South Carolina continuously in this body for over 41 years \nand 10 months, a record which is likely to stand the test of time and \nto never be broken.\n  Throughout his career, Strom Thurmond has served South Carolina and \nthe United States in a number of important ways: he has served South \nCarolina as a State Senator; a South Carolina Circuit Judge; a Governor \nand currently as a U.S. Senator. He served his country in World War II, \nand landed in Normandy on D-Day with the 82nd Airborne Division. He \nwent on to earn 5 Battle Stars during World War II and 18 military \ndecorations during his distinguished military career. He ran for \nPresident in 1948. And in 1959, while serving in the U.S. Senate, \nSenator Thurmond was made a Major General of the U.S. Army Reserve.\n  First and foremost, however, Senator Thurmond is a teacher. He began \nhis distinguished career as a teacher in South Carolina in 1923 and has \ncontinued to emphasize the importance of education in everything he \ndoes. He wrote the South Carolina school attendance law; worked hard to \nincrease the pay to teachers and for longer school terms; and even \ntoday, Senator Thurmond continues to send a congratulatory certificate \nto every graduating South Carolina high school student.\n  Senator Thurmond has taught all of us in this institution, Mr. \nPresident, I am honored to call him a friend and am pleased to rise \ntoday in tribute to this great man, this great American. It is fitting \nthat we name this bill in his honor, and my deepest congratulations go \nout to him.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in tribute to \nthe Chairman of the Armed Services Committee. It is indeed fitting that \nwe dedicate the 1999 Defense Authorization Bill in his honor.\n  Senator Thurmond has a long and distinguished record of service both \nin the military and in the Congress. He was commissioned a 2nd \nLieutenant in 1924 and has since served this nation, and the military, \nin positions of increasing responsibility. During World War II he \nserved in both Europe and Pacific. Afterwards he rose to the rank of \nMajor General in the Army Reserve. During his many years in the Senate \nhe toiled to insure that our military maintained the readiness \nnecessary to defend our great nation.\n  In recent years he has served as Chairman of the Army Services \nCommittee and rightfully earned a place in Senate history as one of the \ngreatest Chairmen of this important Committee. During these years the \nCommittee has faced many challenges in shaping a defense bill that met \nthe needs of a military in a world in change. His great experience in \nmilitary, national and international matters has made the difference in \nproviding for the nation's defense.\n  Senator Thurmond has been a personal inspiration during my years in \nthe Senate. I have always appreciated his guidance. Together, we have \nworked in harmony for the good of the great state of South Carolina and \nthe Nation.\n  Again, I congratulate him!\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am humbled at the action that has been \nsuggested here. I have been on the Armed Services Committee for about \n40 years and been a Member of this body for about 45 years, and I have \nenjoyed every minute of it. It offers many opportunities to those who \nlove this country and feel that they want to serve it and create \nsomething. I am very grateful to Senator Warner, my good friend, \nSenator Levin, my good friend, and others who are interested in this \naction that is being considered. I tell them I appreciate you and I \nappreciate what you are doing, and I will never forget you.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we thank our distinguished colleague, and \nat an appropriate time I am certain the majority leader and Democratic \nleader will be present.

Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by \nSenators Glenn and Sarbanes.\n  I am pleased that this amendment has been accepted by the Chairman \nand Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee, and I thank Senator \nThurmond, Senator Levin and Senator Warner for their assistance.\n  The amendment I am introducing today seeks to change the way we \ndispose of unneeded Navy ships.\n  Our great Navy ships served valiantly--and they should be retired \nwith honor.\n  Instead, men die as they break these ships. Others are maimed \nforever, Our waterways become terribly polluted. Then, when they're \ndone, we're left with torn hunks of metal--polluting our ports--and \nrequiring huge sums of money to clean-up.\n  With the end of the cold war the number of ships to be disposed of in \nthe military arsenal is growing. There are 180 Navy and Maritime \nAdministration ships waiting to be scrapped. These ships are difficult \nand dangerous to dismantle. They usually contain asbestos, PCB's and \nlead paint. They were built long before we understood all the \nenvironmental hazards associated with these materials.\n  This issue was brought to my attention by a Pulitzer Prize-winning \nseries of articles that appeared in the Baltimore Sun written by \nreporters Gary Cohn and Will Englund.\n  They conducted a thorough and rigorous investigation of the way we \ndispose of our Navy and maritime ships. They traveled around the \ncountry and around the world to see firsthand how our ships are \ndismantled, and Mr. President, I must advise that the way we do this is \nnot being done in an honorable, environmentally sensitive, or efficient \nway.\n  I believe when we have ships that have defended the United States of \nAmerica, that they were floating military bases--and they should be \nretired with the same care and dignity with which we close a military \nbase.\n  Let me read from the Sun series:\n\n       As the Navy sells off warships at the end of the Cold War, \n     a little known industry has grown up. In America's depressed \n     ports and where the ship breaking industry goes, pollution \n     and injured workers are left in its wake.\n       The Pentagon repeatedly deals with ship breakers with \n     dismal records, then fails to keep watch as they leave \n     health, environmental and legal problems in their wake.\n\n  Of the 58 ships sold for scrapping since 1991, only 28 have been \nfinished. And oh, my God, how they have been finished. I would like to \nturn to my own hometown of Baltimore.\n  Workers in Baltimore spoke about toiling in air thick with asbestos. \nLaborers scrapped the U.S. Coral Sea, ripping asbestos insulation from \nan aircraft carrier with their bare hands. At times they had no \nrespirators, standard equipment for asbestos workers. As we all know \ninhaling those fibers can have lethal consequences.\n  Workers were ordered to stuff asbestos into a leaky barge to hide it \nfrom inspectors. Dangerous substances from scrapped shipyards have \npolluted harbors, rivers and shorelines, the Sun paper goes on to say.\n  This is what the Coral Sea looked like while it was being dismantled \nin the Baltimore harbor. It looks like it was ravaged. Like it was \ncannibalized.\n  The Coral Sea's dismantling had been marked by several fires. Dumping \noil in the harbor. Lawsuits and repeated delays. The mishandling of \nasbestos. The Navy inspector refused to board the Coral Sea because he \nwas afraid it was too dangerous.\n  I am quoting now the Sun paper. ``September 16, 1993, the military \nsent its lone inspector for the United States to the salvage yard in \nBaltimore. He didn't inspect it because he thought it was too \ndangerous.''\n  The inspector was right to be concerned about his own safety. The \nnext day a 23-year-old worker found out how safe it would be.\n  He walked on a flight deck and he dropped 30 feet from the hangar. \n``I felt the burning feeling inside,'' he said, ``blood was coming out \nof my mouth, I didn't think I would live. He suffered a fractured \nspleen, pelvis, and broke his arms in several places.\n  At the same time we had repeated fires that were breaking out. In \nNovember of 1996, a fire broke out in the Coral Sea's engine room. No \none was standing fire watch. No hose nearby. The blaze burned quickly \nout of control and for the sixth time Baltimore City's fire department \nhad to come in and rescue a shipyard. At the same time the owner of the \nshipyard had a record of environmental violations--a record for which \nhe ultimately was sentenced to jail.\n  All this was happening right in Baltimore Harbor. You've probably \npassed it if you've taken the Baltimore Harbor tour. It is right across \nfrom Fort McHenry--where we defended the United States of America and \nwon the second battle for the War of 1812. And look at it--that's what \nit looks like--it is a national disgrace that was in the Harbor as well \nas a national environmental danger.\n  It wasn't limited to Baltimore. In Terminal Island, California, \nworkers were fired when they told federal investigators how asbestos \nwas being improperly stripped from Navy ships.\n  A scrap yard from the southeast, Cape Fear, North Carolina, was so \ncontaminated with asbestos, oil, and lead, that David Heater, an \nassistant attorney general, said the site looked like one of the levels \nof Dante's hell. Now ship scrappers frustrate regulators by \nconstructing a maze of corporate names and moving frequently.\n  Meanwhile, right down the road from the Coral Sea in Baltimore was \nthe Baltimore city shipyard, the Bethlehem steel shipyard that was \nforaging for work. We were desperate for work in our shipyard. \nDesperate. But no, do you think the Navy turned to shipyards like \nBethlehem Ship?\n  While all of this has been going on, the Navy also planned to send \nour ships overseas--where worker and environmental safety are virtually \nignored.\n  In India, the Sun paper found a tidal beach where 35,000 men scrapped \nthe world ships with little more than their bare hands. They worked \nunder wretched conditions.\n  This is the United States Navy ships being dismantled in India. \nThirty-five thousand people work on a beach, often with no shoes, \ndismantling ships with their bare hands. This is an international \ndisgrace.\n  I introduced a bill to change the way we dispose of unneeded Navy \nships.\n\n[[Page S7124]]\n\nThis bill had two parts. The first would ban the export of ships to \ncountries that don't care about protecting workers or the environment. \nThe second part would create a pilot program to use American shipyards \nto break ships. Because while fly-by-night companies were attempting to \nbreak ships, we had American shipyards foraging for work--both in \nBaltimore and around the country.\n  The amendment I'm introducing today includes only the second part of \nmy legislation. This amendment will create a pilot program to enable \nthe Navy to develop new, efficient ways of breaking ships that meet \nenvironmental and occupational safety standards.\n  The Navy raised legitimate concerns about my original bill. My bill \nfocused on competence. I wanted shipyards to break ships--because I \nbelieve that our shipyards have the experience and facilities to break \nships safely. Shipyards, like the ones in my hometown of Baltimore, \nthat are fit for duty. They know how to build a ship, they know how to \nconvert a ship, they know how to dismantle a ship.\n  But the Navy was concerned that this would limit competition. So I \nchanged my amendment to insure full and open competition. Any competent \ncompany can apply to participate in the pilot program.\n  What do I mean by ``competent?'' I mean that whoever breaks ships \nmust have a record of protecting their workers' safety and the \nenvironment. They must have technical skills, a safe workplace, and a \nrecord of complying with environmental laws.\n  So my amendment addresses competency--as well as competition. It will \nmake sure that ships are broken in a way that protects workers, the \nenvironment, and the American taxpayer.\n  This amendment will enable the Navy to do a better job of disposing \nof unneeded ships. My legislation will give the Navy the will and \nresources to retire our ships with honor.\n  I knew when the Senate saw these pictures they would be as taken \naback as I have. I would like to thank the Sun paper for their \noutstanding series in bringing this not only to my attention but to \nAmerica's attention.\n  They won the Pulitzer prize. But I want the United States of America \nto be sure that we win a victory here today for workers, the \nenvironment--and especially for the Navy. Because I know our Navy wants \nto do the right, honorable thing.\n  Again, I thank Senator Thurmond, Senator Levin, and Senator Warner \nfor their support of my amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President. I would like to comment upon Senator \nMikulski's amendment to establish a Navy pilot program for ship \nscrapping practices. While I support Senator Mikulski's amendment, I \nwould like to clarify some of the issues and concerns regarding this \namendment.\n  Worker safety and environmental issues related to the scrapping of \nthe U.S.S. Coral Sea were raised. I would like to note that the \ncontractor that conducted the scrapping work on behalf of the Navy \nreceived criminal sanctions for environmental violations. In turn, the \nNavy has worked very diligently to resolve and eliminate future \ncontractor problems in this area by adjusting its contractor selection \nmethod to ensure that the contractor has the requisite technical, \nfinancial, environmental, and worker safety qualifications. \nSpecifically, the Navy has replaced the lowest bidder methodology with \nthe requirement that a determination of best value be made in contract \nselection.\n  Finally, there has been reference to the overseas scrapping of Navy \nships, as follows: ``In India, 35,000 men scrapped . . . ships with \nlittle or more than their bare hands. They worked under wretched \nconditions. This is an international disgrace.'' I have been informed \nthat the Navy has not contracted to scrap ships overseas. I have been \napprised of one incident in which the Navy transferred the title of one \nNavy ship, the USS Bennington, to a contractor that misrepresented its \nintentions regarding the use of that ship. That contractor subsequently \narranged for the scrapping of that ship in India. The scenario that I \nhave described involves one ship, not many, as suggested by some. The \nNavy has modified its contracting procedures to avoid that type of \nabuse in the future.\n  I firmly believe that the Navy has worked to resolve the worker \nsafety and environmental problems associated with ship scrapping, \nconsistent with the recommendations of the Department of Defense \nInteragency Review Panel on Ship Scrapping, appointed by Mr. Gansler, \nthe Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition and Technology. It is my \nexpectation that the Navy will continue to make progress as it \ncontinues ongoing ship scrapping operations and develops a credible \npilot program that will ensure best value in the contract selection \nprocess.\n  Under that pilot program, it is yet to be determined whether any \nparticular shipyard or contractor has the requisite expertise and \nqualifications to conduct safe and environmentally sound ship \nscrapping. I have supported the current version of Senator Mikulski's \namendment with the understanding that it allows the Navy the \nflexibility and time to conduct meaningful analysis and to develop a \nviable pilot program.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski for her cooperation in ensuring that this \namendment provides for a ship scrapping pilot program that encourages \ncompetition and discourages favorable treatment of any particular \ncontractor or site.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     AMENDMENT NO. 2792 AS MODIFIED\n\n(Purpose: To provide $2,000,000 for emergency repairs and stabilization \n measures at the historic district of the Forest Glen Annex of Walter \n                  Reed Army Medical Center, Maryland)\n\n       On page 347, below line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2833.

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING THE AUGUST 1995 \n                   ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AGAINST PRESIDENT \n                   SHEVARDNADZE OF GEORGIA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On Tuesday, August 29, 1995, President Eduard \n     Shevardnadze of Georgia narrowly survived a car bomb attack \n     as he departed his offices in the Georgian Parliament \n     building to attend the signing ceremony for the new \n     constitution of Georgia.\n       (2) The former Chief of the Georgian National Security \n     Service, Lieutenant General Igor Giorgadze, after being \n     implicated in organizing the August 29, 1995, assassination \n     attempt on President Shevardnadze, fled Georgia from the \n     Russian-controlled Varziani airbase on a Russian military \n     aircraft.\n       (3) Lieutenant General Giorgadze has been seen openly in \n     Moscow and is believed to have been given residence at a \n     Russian government facility despite the fact that Interpol is \n     conducting a search for Lieutenant General Giorgadze for his \n     role in the assassination attempt against President \n     Shervardnadze.\n       (4) The Russian Interior Ministry claims that it is unable \n     to locate Lieutenant General Giorgadze in Moscow.\n       (5) The Georgian Security and Interior Ministries presented \n     information to the Russian Interior Ministry on November 13, \n     1996; January 17, 1997; March 7, 1997; March 24, 1997 and \n     August 12, 1997, which included the exact location in Moscow \n     of where Lieutenant General Giorgadze's family lived, the \n     exact location where Lieutenant General Giorgadze lived \n     outside of Moscow in a dacha of the Russian Ministry of \n     Defense; as well as the changing official Russian government \n     license tag numbers and description of the automobile that \n     Lieutenant General Giorgadze uses; the people he associates \n     with; the apartments he visits, and the places including \n     restaurants, markets, and companies, that he frequents.\n       (6) On May 12, 1998, the Moscow-based Russian newspaper \n     Zavtra carried an interview with Lieutenant General Giorgadze \n     in which Lieutenant General Giorgadze calls for the overthrow \n     of the Government of Georgia.\n       (7) Title II of the Foreign Operations Appropriations, \n     Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, \n     1998 (Public Law 105-118) prohibits assistance to any \n     government of the new independent states of the former Soviet \n     Union if that government directs any action in violation of \n     the national sovereignty of any other new independent state.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Secretary of Defense should--\n       (1) urge the Government of the Russian Federation to \n     extradite the former Chief of the Georgian National Security \n     Service, Lieutenant General Igor Giorgadze, to Georgia for \n     the purpose of standing trial for his role in the attempted \n     assassination of Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze on \n     August 29, 1995;\n       (2) request cooperation from the Minister of Defense of the \n     Russian Federation and the Government of the Russian \n     Federation to ensure that Russian military bases on Georgian \n     territory are no longer used to facilitate the escape of \n     assassins seeking to kill the freely elected President of \n     Georgia and to otherwise respect the national sovereignty of \n     Georgia; and\n       (3) use all authorities available to the U.S. Government to \n     provide urgent and immediate assistance to ensure to the \n     maximum extent practicable the personal security of President \n     Shevardnadze.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to introduce a resolution \ncalling upon the Administration to do its utmost to protect the \npersonal security of President Eduard Shevardnadze of Georgia. Against \noverwhelming odds, President Shevardnadze has fought for his country's \nsovereignty and independence and has led it to a position where it is \nstarting to achieve positive economic growth and is making great \nstrides towards democracy. President Shevardnadze is a world class \nleader, and he and his country are natural allies of the United States \nin a part of the world that is crucial to the geo-political interests \nof the United States.\n  President Shevardnadze has accomplished these great achievements \nunder the most difficult circumstances one could imagine. There have \nbeen two assassination attempts in the last three years alone and he \nhas been working tirelessly to reach peaceful resolution with the \nseparatist forces within Georgia. As if this weren't difficult enough, \nhe has had to do this in the face of continual undermining by certain \nforces within the Russian Federation.\n  A case in point is Abkhazia: since the break-up of the Soviet Union, \nRussia has been using Abkhazia to maintain control in Georgia and in \nthe Caucasus: the Russians encouraged separatists forces, armed and \nsupported with fighters, intelligence and air power and used the \nresultant instability to force President Shevardnadze and Georgia to \njoin the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).\n  Russia also used this weakness to force the presence of Russian bases \non Georgian territory. President Shevardnadze was forced to sign the \nmilitary base agreement allowing Russia troops to be stationed in \nGeorgia without compensation, in fact Georgia is forced to pay Russia. \nAnd when he objected, President Shevardnadze was told point blank by \nthe Russian Prime Minister either to sign the base agreement or Russia \nwould put someone else in his place to sign it.\n  Russian strategy in Georgia appears to be a combination of factors \ndriven by those who seek to pay President Shevardnadze back for his \ndismantling of the Soviet empire, and those who seek to prevent Caspian \noil and other commerce from following through Georgia to the West, and \nwho wish to break Georgia's increasingly close ties to the West and to \nthe United States in particular.\n  The destabilizing activities have not stopped and include attempts to \nassassinate President Shevardnadze himself. On August 29, 1995 he \nnarrowly survived a car bomb attack as he departed his offices in the \nGeorgian Parliament building to attend the signing ceremony for the new \nconstitution of Georgia. The former Chief of the Georgian National \nSecurity Service, Lieutenant General Igor Giorgadze, after being \nimplicated in organizing this attempt on President Shevardnadze's life, \nescaped to Moscow after fleeing Georgia from the Russian-controlled \nVarziani airbase on a Russian military aircraft.\n  Since that time, Giorgadze has been spotted on a number of occasions \nin Moscow and the Georgians have repeatedly requested his extradition \nto Georgia. But despite the specificity of the information presented to \nthem about Giogadze's whereabouts in Russia, the Russian Interior \nMinistry has claimed repeatedly that it is unable to locate Mr. \nGiorgadze. In short, Russia has refused to extradite him to Georgia for \ntrial.\n  Further, Mr. President, another violent attempt was made on President \nShevardnadze's life in February of this year. Here again, the \nperpetrators of this heinous act fled Georgia from a Russian military \nbase. And barely a month later, two escort planes which were to escort \nthe President's flight from the Turkish border on a return flight to \nthe Georgian capital Tbilsi, were found sabotaged and inoperable, thus \nforcing the President's plane to return unescorted and unprotected and \nin direct danger of air attack. Those disabled planes, Mr. President, \nwere sabotaged while on the ground in a Russian military base in \nGeorgia.\n  Throughout all these events, the Administration has remained \nshockingly silent. This is unacceptable behavior towards a friend an \nally. In the face of the clear pattern of destabilization in which \nRussia is engaged, the Administration should not have to be prodded to \nstand up and speak loudly in defense of this friend and ally. \nUnfortunately, a reticence to engage Russia on its bad behavior in \nGeorgia and the Caucasus has led to an unacceptable passivity on the \npart of the Administration. It is time for this to change. And it must \nchange soon.\n  There is no need to remind my colleagues that Title II of the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \nAppropriations Act, prohibits assistance to any government of the \nformer Soviet Union if that government directs any action in violation \nof the national sovereignty of any other new independent state.\n  The sense of the senate I am introducing today calls upon the \nAdministration to step up its pressure on Russia to extradite Igor \nGiorgadze, the alleged perpetrator of the August 1995 assassination \nattempt on President Shevardnadze; and to stop using its bases in \nGeorgia as an escape for assassins and terrorists; and to provide all \nassistance necessary to provide for the personal safety of President \nShevardnadze.\n  This resolution is just a first step. I believe the United States \nshould be pressing Russia to remove its bases\n\n[[Page S7126]]\n\nfrom Russia--after all, they are there against the will of the Georgian \npeople. And I now call upon the Administration to stand up for \nPresident Shevardnadze and for Georgia, and to publicly and loudly \ncondemn the efforts of any group that seeks to destabilize Georgia. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in sending this message and will \nsupport this resolution.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2907\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Energy to select the technology \n        to be used for tritium production by December 31, 1998)\n\n       On page 398, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3144. DEADLINE FOR SELECTION OF TECHNOLOGY FOR TRITIUM \n                   PRODUCTION.\n\n       (a) Deadline.--The Secretary of Energy shall select a \n     technology for the production of tritium not later than \n     December 31, 1998.\n       (b) Options Available for Selection.--Notwithstanding any \n     provision of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2011 et \n     seq.), after the completion of the Department of Energy's \n     evaluation of their Interagency Review on the production of \n     Tritium, the Secretary shall make the selection for tritium \n     production consistent with the laws, regulations and \n     procedures of the Department of Energy as stated in \n     subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to thank the Chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond, for accepting my \namendment which ensures the dual track strategy the Department of \nEnergy (DOE) is currently pursuing for tritium production will remain \nin place. Acceptance of this amendment ensures the Secretary of Energy \nwill have the flexibility to make the best decision based on a careful \nreview of the cost, technical, schedule and policy issues associated \nwith each of the tritium production options.\n  In May, during the House National Security Committee's deliberation \nof the FY '99 Department of Defense (DOD) re-authorization bill, an \namendment offered by Congressmen Markey and Graham was accepted without \na roll call vote. Their amendment (Markey/Graham amendment) would \npreclude the Secretary of Energy from selecting a commercial light \nwater reactor for the production of tritium. The Markey/Graham \namendment, if passed into law, would force the Secretary of Energy to \nselect the Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) by eliminating the \noption to produce tritium using a Commercial Light Water Reactor \n(CLWR). The APT is the only other option currently available to the \nDepartment of Energy. The results of this action would, in my opinion, \nrequire the Secretary to select the highest risk and most expensive \noption to produce tritium--a decision which could saddle the taxpayers \nwith a $14.5 billion debt. To put this in context, $14.5 billion is \nmore money than the states of Alabama, New Hampshire, South Carolina, \nVirginia, Rhode Island, Idaho, Oklahoma, Mississippi and New Mexico \ncombined will receive during the next five years under the recently \npassed TEA21 transportation bill.\n  The White House, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Defense and the \nCitizens Against Government Waste have all written letters in \nopposition to the Markey/Graham amendment in the House-passed bill, \nwhich would prevent the Department of Energy from making the best \ndecision on tritium production.\n  In a Statement of Administration Policy to House National Security \nCommittee dated May 20th, 1998, the Administration voiced its concern \nover the amendment to the House DoD re-authorization bill and stated:\n\n       ``The Administration strongly opposes . . . amendments . . \n     . to prohibit the use of commercial light water reactors for \n     the production of tritium; by eliminating the least costly, \n     most technically mature option under consideration by DOE. \n     Tritium production in commercial reactors is not inconsistent \n     with U.S. non-proliferation policy''.\n\n  Furthermore, in a letter dated June 23rd, 1998, the Secretary of \nEnergy restated the Administration's position:\n\n       ``The Administration strongly opposes this amendment and \n     any amendment that prejudges departmental decision making \n     within the dual track strategy. A careful and deliberate \n     review of cost, technical, schedule, and policy issues \n     associated with each option is essential to meet our security \n     needs most economically and reliably''.\n\n  And finally, in a letter provided to me June 25th, 1998, the \nSecretary of Defense stated:\n\n       ``DoD opposes the amendments for three reasons. First, if \n     the amendments were to become law, DOE would require an \n     immediate additional investment of nearly $250 million to \n     accelerate the development of APT. The long term impacts of \n     the amendment are far more significant. The life cycle cost \n     of APT could be as high as $8.8 billion. The life cycle cost \n     of the Reactor option could be as low as $1.6 billion. Thus, \n     the amendments could mandate an unfunded liability of up to \n     $7.6 billion . . . Second, the amendments would likely \n     increase the cost of the DOD Stockpile Stewardship Program.\n       Finally, this amendment seems to be predicated on the \n     assumption that the use of commercial reactors is \n     inconsistent with the US non proliferation policy. It is not. \n     The DOE will forward shortly a completed interagency report \n     that concludes the non proliferation policy issues associated \n     with the use of a reactor are manageable and that the DOE \n     should continue to pursue the reactor option as a viable \n     source for future tritium production. . .Therefore, I urge \n     you to oppose amendments which would prohibit the Reactor \n     production of tritium from being considered as an option. \n     Passage of any such amendment would place the Defense \n     Authorization bill at risk''.\n\n  Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that all three letters \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                   Washington, D.C., May 20, 1998.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n  h.r. 3616--national defense authorization act for fiscal year 1999 \n                   (Spence (R) SC and Skelton (D) MO)\n\n       The Administration supports prompt congressional \n     consideration of its national defense authorization \n     legislative proposal for FY 1999. As reported by the \n     Committee on National Security, however, H.R. 3616 raises \n     serious budget and policy concerns which must be addressed \n     satisfactorily. The Administration also has particular \n     concerns, addressed below, about a number of amendments which \n     have been ruled in order for floor consideration.\n\n             Reduction of Department of Energy (DOE) Funds\n\n       The Administration strongly objects to the net reduction of \n     $401 million from DOE's defense activities, particularly the \n     $358 million cut from weapons activities and the earmarking \n     of $60 million from the Stockpile Stewardship account for \n     DOD's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization. A significant \n     portion of the Stockpile Stewardship reduction results from \n     $341 million taken from prior year balances which are not \n     available. This will force real reductions in critical \n     programs needed to ensure the safety, security, and \n     reliability of America's nuclear deterrent.\n       In addition, the Administration opposes the $230 million \n     reduction in the Environmental Management Privatization \n     account that cuts funds which are needed to demonstrate to \n     the financial investment community the Administration's \n     commitment to the privatization approach, and which are \n     required to complete key nuclear waste disposal facilities. \n     The bill would also delay the decision to select a primary \n     source for tritium until the results of tests at the Watts \n     Bar nuclear station are determined. This would delay the \n     selection decision by over one year, increase the costs of \n     the program, and prevent the Department from meeting its 2005 \n     deadline for achieving a tritium production capability. The \n     Administration also opposes the premature sun-setting of the \n     Worker and Community Transition Program, which has \n     facilitated the orderly reduction of 43,000 contractor \n     employees at DOE sites since 1992.\n\n                            Program Funding\n\n       H.R. 3616 would reduce funding for basic and applied \n     research by over $1 billion in FY 1999. This research \n     provides the fundamental knowledge and technical know-how \n     required to develop future defense systems. The failure to \n     provide adequate funding for this research will ultimately \n     result in the inability to upgrade systems at an adequate \n     pace. The Administration strongly urges the House to \n     authorize the Administration's full $4.1 billion request for \n     these programs.\n       Conversely, the bill adds a net total of $250 million for \n     procurement and $450 million for constructions programs. Some \n     of these increases are for programs that, due to higher \n     priority military requirements, are not in the Future Years \n     Defense Program (FYDP). This includes, for example, $398 \n     million for seven additional C-130J airlift aircraft, and \n     $300 million for other unrequested items for the National \n     Guard and Reserve. These increases for lower priority \n     weapons modernization and military construction programs \n     would be at the expense of higher priority defense \n     programs.\n       The Administration appreciates the bill's emphasis on \n     preserving military readiness through strong funding for \n     maintenance and spare parts. Force readiness could be \n     threatened, however, by the bill's reductions to other O \n     programs. The President's request is very tightly constructed \n     within the discretionary caps agreed to the bipartisan budget \n     agreement. Any adjustments must be carefully evaluated to \n     ensure that sufficient funding is available for DoD \n     operations and support programs. The Administration will work \n     with the Congress to reexamine any adjustments to the O \n     programs prior to final congressional action on the bill.\n\n[[Page S7127]]\n\n       In particular, the Administration opposes the bill's $500 \n     million funding reduction for defense contractual services, \n     which are an integral part of DOD functions and are essential \n     to critical military objectives. This reduction would have a \n     direct adverse impact on operational readiness and \n     modernization. The prohibitions and limitations on: (1) \n     accounting procedures for contractual services and (2) the \n     performance of core logistics capabilities are also \n     objectionable. In addition, the bill's requirement for a \n     comprehensive annual review of Defense service contracts \n     would be costly and divert personnel from higher priority \n     areas.\n\n                      Base Realignment and Closure\n\n       The Administration is disappointed that the bill does not \n     adopt the Defense proposal to authorize two additional rounds \n     of base closure and realignment in 2001 and 2005. Defense's \n     base infrastructure is far too large for its military forces \n     and must be reduced if the Department is to obtain adequate \n     appropriations for readiness and modernization requirements \n     during the next decade.\n\n                       Gender Integrated Training\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes any legislatively \n     mandated changes for initial entry training within the \n     military services.\n       The Federal Advisory Committee on Gender Integrated \n     Training and Related Issues made several recommendations on \n     training that have been reviewed by the Secretary of Defense \n     and each of the services. In addition to the Committee's \n     recommendations, the Secretary directed the services to take \n     additional action in the areas of training leadership, \n     training rigor, and recruit billeting. The services have each \n     taken a number of steps in support of the Committee's \n     recommendations and Secretary's additional direction. The \n     implementation of future initiatives will also be monitored. \n     All actions are geared toward providing new recruits with the \n     best training possible in a safe and secure environment. In \n     order to achieve this goal, each service must be allowed to \n     tailor its basic training as needed to prepare recruits for \n     their specific service's missions. Legislation at this time \n     would be counter productive to meeting this goal.\n\n                      Weapons of Mass Destruction\n\n       H.R. 3616 does not include authorities requested to allow a \n     more rapid response to threats to U.S. forces, and permit \n     Defense to support interagency efforts to combat terrorism. \n     The bill also defers action on authorizing the National Guard \n     and Reserves to assist other Federal, state, and local \n     authorities in responding to domestic terrorist incidents \n     involving weapons of mass destruction. These authorities are \n     critical to improving the Nation's ability to deter and \n     combat terrorism. The Administration strongly urges prompt \n     congressional enactment of these important authorities.\n\n                         Bosnia Expenditure Cap\n\n       The Administration opposes section 1201 which would impose \n     an expenditure limitation on funds for U.S. participation in \n     Bosnia peacekeeping operations. It is imperative that the \n     Administration retain the flexibility necessary to meet \n     exigent circumstances.\n\n                      Chemical Weapons Convention\n\n       The Administration urges the House to include the requested \n     authorization of appropriations for the DOD to reimburse the \n     Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for \n     costs incurred in inspecting DOD sites and facilities. These \n     funds are necessary to fulfill the requirements of the \n     recently ratified Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\n                           Management Issues\n\n       A number of provisions in H.R. 3616 would undermine the \n     Administration's efforts to improve governmental operations. \n     For example, the bill would terminate a DOD ``household goods \n     moving services'' pilot program that was designed to adopt \n     corporate business practices and foster competition. The bill \n     would replace this DOD pilot with an approach that was \n     proposed by the industry that perpetuates the current \n     inefficient system.\n       The Administration objects to section 337 which would \n     require DOD to perform depot-level maintenance and repair of \n     the C-17 at Government-owned, Government-operated facilities. \n     This section also states that the C-17 Flexible Sustainment \n     contract does not meet the requirements of law. Although the \n     language is specific to the C-17 support contract, it has far \n     reaching implications for many DOD weapon systems. The bill \n     sets a precedent for bypassing the DOD risk assessment and \n     core determination process, and directing that weapon systems \n     be supported in public depots without regard to cost or \n     readiness. The resulting investments would have a significant \n     adverse affect on DOD's long term plans for funding.\n       Section 336 of the bill would require complicated and \n     cumbersome tests for determining what qualifies as a \n     commercial item under 10 U.S.C. Sec. 2464, and would require \n     application of those tests to determine whether or not a V-22 \n     engine component or system is a ``commercial item'' that, by \n     definition, should be procured with simplified, streamlined \n     procurement procedures. Whether intended or not, the \n     provision would duplicate a capability that already exists \n     commercially.\n       Section 331 of the bill would expand current requirements \n     that the Secretary report to Congress before outsourcing any \n     commercial or industrial type function currently accomplished \n     in-house. This would be counterproductive to efficient and \n     effective government, and should be deleted. These additional \n     requirements would only slow the process, discourage \n     contractors from taking over activities that DOD no longer \n     needs to perform in-house, and waste money that should be \n     used to modernize DOD weapons systems.\n\n                           Military Pay Raise\n\n       H.R. 3616 contains a minimum of a 3.6 percent increase in \n     basic pay for military members, an increase that is 0.5 \n     percent higher than the amount requested. At this time, the \n     Administration is reviewing the implications of a higher pay \n     raise, and will work with Congress to provide a fair pay \n     raise that does not force unacceptable reductions in other \n     high priority Defense programs.\n\n                   Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR)\n\n       The Administration generally supports the bill's \n     authorizations for the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program \n     and urges full funding of the FY 1999 request for CTR. The \n     Administration opposes, however, language that would \n     restrict the use of CTR funds for chemical weapons \n     destruction facility construction. The restriction would \n     preclude any construction until FY 2000, thereby imposing \n     a minimum delay of one year in the current project \n     schedule.\n       The Administration, as it continues to review H.R. 3616, \n     may identify other issues, and will work with the Congress to \n     develop a more acceptable bill.\n\n                        Unacceptable Amendments\n\n       In addition, the Administration strongly opposes a number \n     of seriously problematic amendments that may be offered, \n     including:\n       Any amendment that would further restrict or prohibit \n     licensing of commercial satellite launches by China. Transfer \n     to China or Chinese entities of technology, data, or defense \n     services relevant to ballistic missiles or warhead delivery \n     is controlled under the Arms Export Control Act. Existing \n     procedures, including the bilateral Satellite Technology \n     Safeguards Agreement (negotiated under the Bush \n     Administration and signed in February 1993) explicitly \n     prohibit transfer of ballistic missile technology to China.\n       Any amendment to require licenses for nuclear exports and \n     retransfers to non-OECD countries to be reported to Congress \n     30 days before issuance. Such a requirement is unnecessary as \n     applications for licenses to export controlled nuclear \n     technology and items are already reported to the public \n     immediately upon fling with the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission. The licensing process provides for a unique \n     degree of transparency, including public intervention. To \n     require such a notification before licenses are issued to \n     non-OECD countries would impose significant delays to many \n     commercial contracts, reducing U.S. commercial \n     competitiveness, and reducing U.S. influence with countries \n     of great importance to our nuclear non-proliferation efforts.\n       The amendment which would cap expenditures for NATO \n     enlargement at $2 billion or 10 percent of the total cost. At \n     the Madrid summit Allied heads of State and government agreed \n     that the costs of NATO enlargement would be reasonable and \n     they would be met in accordance with current Alliance \n     procedures. After careful study, NATO agreed that the costs \n     of enlargement to the Alliance common budgets for the first \n     10 years would be $1.5 billion. Using the current shares of \n     NATO common budget that would mean the costs to the U.S. \n     during that period would be approximately $400 million. \n     However, a reduction to 10 percent of enlargement costs as \n     called for in the amendment is neither reasonable nor \n     consistent with the Madrid communique agreed by all Allied \n     heads of state and government.\n       Prohibit the use of commercial light water reactors for the \n     production of tritium; eliminating the least costly, most \n     technically mature opinion under consideration by DOE. \n     Tritium production in commercial reactors is not inconsistent \n     with U.S. nonproliferation policy. There have been several \n     instances of cooperation between U.S. military and civilian \n     nuclear programs, including dual use of uranium enrichment \n     facilities and commercial sale of electricity originating \n     from a weapons material production reactor.\n       The inclusion of such amendments in the bill presented to \n     the President would be unacceptable.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Secretary of Energy\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 1998.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Sessions: The Department of Energy must \n     establish a new source of tritium to maintain the U.S. \n     nuclear weapons stockpile. Currently, the Department is \n     pursuing a dual-track strategy for tritium production, which \n     calls for the development of two technology options: use of \n     an existing commercial light water reactor or the \n     construction of a linear accelerator for the production of \n     tritium. The Department has pursued this strategy for more \n     than two years under the direction of the Congress and with \n     the approval of the Department of Defense through the Nuclear \n     Weapons Council. We remain on schedule to select a new \n     tritium production source by December 31, 1998, consistent \n     with existing law.\n       Last month an amendment to the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for FY 1999 (H.R. 3616) was adopted that \n     would prohibit the Department's ability to pursue the \n     Commercial Light Water Reactor option of the dual\n\n[[Page S7128]]\n\n     track strategy. The Administration strongly opposes this \n     amendment and any amendment that prejudges departmental \n     decision making within the dual track strategy. A careful and \n     deliberate review of the cost, technical, schedule, and \n     policy issues associated with each option is essential to \n     meet our security needs most economically and reliably.\n       The amendment to prohibit the Department's use of a \n     commercial light water reactor for tritium production was \n     predicated on an assumption that the use of such reactors to \n     produce tritium is inconsistent with U.S. proliferation \n     policy. The Department will forward shortly a completed \n     interagency review that concludes that the nonproliferation \n     policy issues associated with the use of a commercial light \n     water reactor are manageable and that the Department should \n     continue to pursue the reactor option as a viable source for \n     future tritium production. This Administration conclusion was \n     reached after an extensive and interactive review process \n     involving a wide range of Executive Branch agencies.\n       I appreciate your consideration of our views and concerns \n     regarding this issue. If you have any questions, please call \n     me or have your staff contact Mr. John C. Angell, Assistant \n     Secretary for Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs, at \n     (202) 586-5450.\n           Sincerely,\n     Federico Pena\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 1998.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express the opinion of \n     the Department of Defense on proposed amendments to the \n     Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Authorization bill that prohibit \n     commercial light water reactors from producing tritium for \n     military purposes.\n       The Department of Energy (DOE) is pursuing a dual-track \n     program to produce tritium. One method is to use a commercial \n     light water reactor (CLWR) to irradiate rods from which \n     tritium could be extracted at a DOE facility--in effect, \n     buying irradiation services. The other approach is to build \n     an accelerator to produce tritium (APT). DOE will decide on a \n     primary method by the end of this calendar year. The proposed \n     amendments would effectively foreclose the CLWR option.\n       DoD opposes the amendments for three reasons. First, if the \n     amendments become law, DOE would require an immediate \n     additional investment of nearly $250M to accelerate \n     development of APT. The long term impacts of the amendments \n     are far more significant. The life cycle cost of APT could be \n     as high as $8.8B. The life cycle cost of the CLWR program \n     could be as low as $1.2B. Thus, the amendments could mandate \n     an unfunded liability of up to $7.6B. Second, the amendments \n     would likely increase the cost of the DOE stockpile \n     stewardship program (SSP). Finally, this amendment appears to \n     be predicated on an assumption that the use of commercial \n     reactors for tritium production is inconsistent with the US \n     nonproliferation policy. It is not. The DOE will forward \n     shortly a completed interagency report that concludes that \n     the nonproliferation policy issues associated with the use of \n     a commercial light water reactor are manageable and that the \n     DOE should continue to pursue the reactor option as a viable \n     source for future tritium production. The DoD fully endorses \n     this position.\n       In conclusion, DOE has a dual-track program to develop an \n     assured supply of tritium. Until DOE reaches its decision \n     later this year, the wisest choice is to leave our options \n     open. Therefore, I urge you to oppose the amendments that \n     would prohibit CLWR from being considered as an option. \n     Passage of any such amendment would place the Defense \n     Authorization bill at risk.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                       Bill Cohen.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that a \nletter sent to me by the Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW), \nalong with a June 25th article from the Washington Times on tritium \nboth be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                       Council for\n\n\n                            Citizens Against Government Waste,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 1998.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sessions: On behalf of America's taxpayers, \n     and the 600,000 members of the Council for Citizens Against \n     Government Waste (CCAGW), we are pleased to endorse your \n     amendment to the FY 1999 National Defense Authorization Act, \n     which ensures that the government procures tritium in the \n     most cost-efficient method.\n       The Department of Energy (DOE) is responding to Defense \n     Department needs for tritium by carefully considering two \n     options recommended by The Weapons Council: use of a nearly \n     complete commercial light water reactor at Bellefonte in \n     Alabama; or construction of a large new accelerator at the \n     Savannah River federal site in South Carolina. While we are \n     not qualified to comment on dependability, technology, and \n     non-proliferation policy issues concerning these two options, \n     CCAGW feels compelled to point out the obvious cost \n     advantages of the light water reactor option. By any \n     measurement, use of a commercial reactor is the lower cost \n     tritium production option. This option should not be \n     legislatively excluded as provided in the House-passed Markey \n     amendment.\n       Every budget estimate confirms that construction and \n     operation of an accelerator costs significantly more than the \n     commercial reactor. DOE estimates that the seven-year startup \n     costs for the accelerator will be $3.9 billion with $120 \n     million in annual operating costs. CBO's cost estimate for \n     the accelerator is $6.72 billion. These cost estimates \n     reflect only a modest level of accuracy since they are based \n     on a preliminary conceptual design. Any cost overruns would \n     be borne by the taxpayers. Recent proposals for modular \n     construction of the accelerator will still cost at least $2.6 \n     billion, and these proposals fail to include substantial \n     engineering design and safety expenses.\n       In contrast, the Bellefonte reactor option will cost only \n     $1.9 billion to complete construction and start producing \n     tritium in five years. Unlike the accelerator, the commercial \n     reactor will generate about $100 million annually in revenues \n     for the Treasury from the production and sale of electricity. \n     The Bellefonte cost estimate is a fixed price that has been \n     certified by several independent reviews as having a very \n     high-level of accuracy. The reactor owner would pay any cost \n     overruns.\n       From a common sense perspective, the commercial reactor \n     option has to be a better deal for the taxpayer. The \n     Bellefonte reactor is already 90 percent complete whereas \n     ground has not even been broken for construction of the \n     accelerator which is still undergoing conceptual design. \n     Finishing a nearly-complete facility obviously must cost less \n     than designing and building a new facility.\n       No matter how you compare it, the commercial reactor option \n     is more cost-effective, Construction of a new accelerator \n     will be anywhere from 70 percent to almost 300 percent more \n     expensive than the guaranteed fixed price of a commercial \n     reactor. Moreover, the commercial reactor will generate \n     revenues every year for the Treasury while the accelerator \n     will require annual appropriations to operate.\n       Given the obviously significant cost advantages, the \n     commercial reactor should not be excluded as an option as \n     proposed by the House. We applaude you placing politics aside \n     and putting the interest of the taxpayers first. We offer our \n     full assistance in this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Council Nedd II,\n     Director of Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 25, 1998]\n\n                  Nuclear Material Causes Senate Spat\n\n                            (By Sean Scully)\n\n       An obscure House amendment to the Defense Department budget \n     is sparking an interstate battle in the Senate--a fight that \n     could cost U.S. taxpayers an extra $4 billion.\n       Without having a debate or taking a recorded vote, the \n     House passed an amendment on May 21 to prohibit commercial \n     nuclear reactors from producing tritium, a radioactive \n     substance used to increase the effectiveness of nuclear \n     weapons. As a result, the Energy and Defense departments must \n     abandon a $2 billion plan to produce tritium in an Alabama \n     reactor in favor of building a new production facility in \n     South Carolina, which could cost up to $6.7 billion.\n       ``I think I am morally bound to do everything I can to stop \n     this colossal error that may be in the making,'' said Sen. \n     Jeff Sessions, Alabama Republican and leader of the effort to \n     block a similar amendment in the Senate.\n       But backers of the amendment say there is far more at stake \n     than cost.\n       The United States has long drawn a sharp line between \n     military and civilian nuclear programs, backers say, and \n     producing tritium at a commercial power plant would blur that \n     line.\n       ``It takes 50 years of policy and turns it on its head. . . \n     . This is a major change of policy that has ripple effects \n     beyond comprehension,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham, South \n     Carolina Republican and cosponsor of the House amendment.\n       If the United States begins using a civilian reactor for \n     military purpose, even for the relatively benign tritium, the \n     administration will have a more difficult time convincing \n     nations such as North Korea and India not to use their \n     reactors to make bomb material, supporters said.\n       ``It's just not smart, it's not the right thing to do,'' \n     especially in light of the recent nuclear tests by India and \n     Pakistan, said Maury Lane, spokesman for Sen. Ernest F. \n     Hollings, South Carolina Democrat.\n       The Alabama faction disagrees. Trituim, they say, is not \n     part of non-proliferation treaties and is widely produced in \n     civilian reactors worldwide, although not in the United \n     States.\n       The real issue is cost, Mr. Sessions said.\n       In May 1997, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that \n     buying an existing reactor, or completing a new one, would \n     cost about $1.9 billion. The Alabama reactor, owned by the \n     Tennessee Valley Authority, is about 85 percent complete. The \n     TVA promises to give the Energy Department 60 percent of the \n     profits from selling electricity produced by the plant--as \n     much as $100 million per year--which could offset much of the \n     cost of building and operating the reactor.\n\n[[Page S7129]]\n\n       The CBO estimated, meanwhile, that the South Carolina \n     plant, known as an accelerator, would cost $6.7 billion. And, \n     while the technology of accelerators is well understood, it \n     has never been used to create tritium on this scale before.\n       ``We simply cannot afford to spend that much extra money in \n     the defense budget, which is extraordinarily tight,'' Mr. \n     Sessions said.\n       The South Carolina side, however, said the CBO numbers are \n     based on outdated data. Mr. Graham said the current \n     accelerator plan is much smaller, costing about $2 billion.\n       ``The costs are--at best--a wash,'' he said.\n       But at the root of the dispute may be home-district \n     politics, a fact that partisans on both sides admit. The CBO \n     estimates that almost 400 jobs are at stake in South Carolina \n     and as many as 800 in Alabama.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, under current law, the Department of \nEnergy has been going forward with a dual track process to decide on \nthe technology selection of tritium. DOE is to choose the best option \nto produce tritium based on cost and merit. The House-passed Markey/\nGraham amendment, eliminates DOE's decision-making authority and would \nput the national defense at risk by relying on an unproven technology. \nThe Markey/Graham amendment is fiscally irresponsible and would prevent \nthe Secretary from making a merit-based decision.\n  Tritium is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen which is used in all \nnuclear weapons of the United States. It has a relatively short half \nlife of 12.3 years and must be replaced periodically as long our \nnation's defense relies on nuclear deterrence.\n  In 1993, Congress required the Secretary of Energy to submit a report \nto Congress with a schedule to produce tritium to meet our defense \nneeds. Later that year, the Secretary submitted a report indicating \nthat under START II, tritium production would need to resume by 2009. \nHowever, since the START II treaty has not been ratified, as is now the \ncase, the DOE has stated tritium production needs to begin by 2005.\n  On December 6th, 1995 the Department of Energy issued a Record of \nDecision to pursue a dual-track approach to produce tritium. This \nprocess was recommended by the President's Nuclear Weapons Council. The \nfirst option is to use the services of a reactor to produce tritium. \nThe second option is to design, build and test a particle accelerator \nat Savannah River to drive tritium producing nuclear reactions. Both \noptions would be required to produce tritium by the 2009 deadline, but \nonly the reactor option could meet the 2005 deadline. The DOE is \nscheduled to announce its choice for tritium production by the end of \n1998.\n  The Department of Energy needs to pursue the dual-track option for \nthe production of tritium. The Markey/Graham amendment prevents the DOE \nfrom making their decision, and ties the Secretary of Energy's hands, \nthrowing competition out the window and saddling the American taxpayer \nwith a huge $16.7 billion dollar debt.\n  Mr. President, the House-passed Markey/Graham amendment to the \nDepartment of Defense re-authorization bill sole sources the Secretary \nof Energy's options for tritium production and forces the Secretary to \nselect the least reliable, highest cost option--APT. Even the DOE's \nAccelerator Production of Tritium program managers suggest the \naccelerator may not be able to produce enough tritium to fulfill our \ndefense needs according to a June 8th, 1998 DOE letter in response to \nmy technical questions regarding the accelerator program.\n  The CLWR option to produce tritium is a proven technology which \nallows the US to maintain its nuclear preparedness. It uses safe, \nreliable technology at no net cost to the DOE. In fact, the reactor \noption to produce tritium could actually net the Federal Government a \n$2.4 billion profit over the forty year life of the program.\n  In contrast, the Accelerator needed for APT is estimated to cost $5.4 \nbillion just to complete. There is no mechanism to ever recapture these \ncosts. In addition, an Accelerator, of the size needed to fulfill our \ndefense needs, would require a tremendous amount of electricity to \noperate. The annual operational costs of the Accelerator are estimated \nto be between $120 - $180 million per year. Using the latest \ninflationary factors developed by Office of Management and Budget of \n2.2% and the $180 million annual operating cost estimate put forth in \nthe May, 1997 Congressional Budget Office report titled Preserving the \nNuclear Stockpile Under a Comprehensive Test Ban, the life-cycle \noperating costs for the Accelerator Production of Tritium would be a \nstaggering $11.356 billion over forty years. In total, the operations \nand maintenance costs, coupled with the cost to complete construction \nof APT could top $16.756 billion.\n  The Commercial Light Water Reactor option to produce tritium will \ncost only $1.9 billion--an investment which will be paid back and \ngenerate additional revenue to the Treasury in excess of $2.4 billion \nover the forty year life of the reactor. It would provide the \ngovernment with a free supply of tritium and generate revenue through \nthe generation and sale of electrical power.\n  The APT will require 2,600,000 megawatts-hours of power each year to \noperate. This is the equivalent of the electricity requirements of a \nmedium size city like Huntsville and Decatur, Alabama. The power \nrequired to operate the APT will result in increased emissions of \nsulfur, carbon, particulate matter and ozone creating gases and serve \nto work against our efforts to clean the environment.\n  According to data collected by the Edison Electric Institute, even \ntoday's cleanest fossil fuel powered electric plants will emit between \n4 million and 9 million tons of carbon; 17,000 and 42,000 tons of \nSulfur Dioxide (major contributor to acid rain); and between 870 and \n7,100 tons of Nitrous Oxide (major ozone contributor) per year just to \ngenerate the same amount of power as the emissions free reactor option \nto produce tritium. Clearly, the reactor option is the preferred choice \nfor the environment.\n  To maintain our country's nuclear preparedness under the only signed \nand enforceable treaty, START I, the Department of Defense needs a \nproduction capacity of at least 3 kilograms of tritium per year by \n2005. The cost estimates on the APT provided by the Department of \nEnergy, at my request, suggest the accelerator, if its experimental \ntechnology were to work without failure or shutdown, may only be able \nto produce 1.5 to 2.0 kilograms of tritium per year. This is not enough \nto maintain our nuclear arsenal.\n  The earliest the APT will be able to produce tritium is 2007 which \ncould cause the Department of Defense to dip into our Tritium Reserve \nStockpile to maintain our readiness. The Reactor option can produce \ntritium using safe, reliable, certified technology by 2003.\n  Mr. President, can we afford to risk our national security on this \nunproven APT technology for our nuclear arsenal's tritium needs by \neliminating a safe and reliable reactor technology so casually?\n  In closing, Mr. President, my amendment will ensure the Secretary of \nEnergy retains the ability to carefully review each of these options \nand select the one which will best serve the tritium needs of our \nnation's nuclear arsenal.\n  I urge my colleagues being appointed to the conference committee on \nthe DOD re-authorization bill, to support my amendment, which preserves \nthe integrity of DOE's decision-making process. We can ill afford to \ndecide the fate of our nation's security on the floor of Congress. \nLet's allow the nation's top experts in this field to make their \ndecision based on the careful considerations of cost and merit \nregarding both options.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, would the able gentleman from Alabama \njoin me in a colloquy regarding the Department of Energy's tritium \nproduction program?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would be happy to engage the Committee \nChairman in a colloquy on the subject of tritium production.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I believe the Senator from Alabama has an interest in \nthe Department of Energy's tritium production program and I believe he \nshares my strong interest in restoring a sound United States tritium \nproduction capability to support our enduring nuclear deterrent.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct. We must have new tritium production to \nmaintain a credible nuclear deterrent. The Department of Energy is \ncurrently assessing two potential technologies to produce tritium for \ndefense purposes.\n\n[[Page S7130]]\n\nOne option is to construct a linear accelerator facility and the other \nis to complete the Bellefonte nuclear plant in my home state of \nAlabama.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I understand the Senator's strong support for our \nnational defense. I also understand that the Senator has offered an \namendment to the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Authorization Act which would \nrequire the Department of Energy to follow applicable laws and internal \nDepartmental policies and procedures in selecting a permanent tritium \nsource.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is my belief that any conference outcome on this \nissue should not limit the ability of the DOE to make a final selection \non the two alternatives. I am hopeful, of course, that the Bellefonte \nplant would be favorably considered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I understand the position of the Senator from Alabama. \nAs he knows well, I support the accelerator alternative. He also \nunderstands well that the dynamics of the House Senate conference \npreclude me from making any pre-conference agreements on conference \noutcomes. However, I assure the Senator from Alabama that despite my \nown interests, and my position as Chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, that I will not work personally to disadvantage the \nBellefonte alternative in the conference. With this understanding, I am \nprepared to accept the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I agree and thank the Chairman for his cooperation and \nunderstanding on this issue. I appreciate your consideration of this \nissue and my amendment.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a position \ntaken by the House last month in their version of the Defense \nAuthorization bill. During House debate, Congressman Graham of South \nCarolina and Congressman Markey of Massachusetts introduced an \namendment to ban the use of commercial nuclear reactors to produce \ntritium. Tritium, as you know Mr. President, is a material essential to \nthe efficacy of our nuclear arsenal which, because it decays, must be \nreplenished over time. Tritium has not been produced in this country \nsince 1988 and a new source is needed to maintain our nuclear weapons \nstockpile at the levels called for in the START II treaty. The question \nnow is where production of the needed tritium will take place.\n  For fifty years the United States has drawn a strong line between \ncommercial and military production of nuclear materials. While tritium \nis produced in commercial reactors as a by-product of the fission \nprocess, this material is not used for nuclear weapon application. \nInstead, tritium for our nuclear arsenal was long produced at the \nDepartment of Energy's Savannah River Site in South Carolina. The DOE \nis now considering the use of a commercial reactor to produce weapons \ngrade tritium. We must not arbitrarily allow this shift in our nation's \nnuclear policy.\n  The recent nuclear tests in India and Pakistan sent a strong signal \nacross the world that the efforts, particularly those of the United \nStates, to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons have not fully \nsucceeded. In this light we must upgrade our efforts to halt nuclear \nproliferation. Should Congress allow the commercial production of \nweapons grade tritium we would take a step backwards in our efforts to \ncurtail proliferation. We would tell the rest of the world that \ncommercial reactors are a viable means to enhance a nuclear arsenal. \nThis is no time to send this kind of message.\n  The DOE's other option is to build a nuclear accelerator at the \nSavannah River Site, where production of tritium for our nuclear \narsenal has traditionally taken place. Mr. President, this is the \ncorrect policy option for our country and for our efforts to prevent \nnuclear proliferation. I hope that when the Senate and the House begin \ntheir conference negotiations on the FY99 Defense Authorization bill \nthe Senate will agree to the language included in the House bill by \nCongressmen Graham and Markey preventing commercial production of \ntritium.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby Mr. Sessions and commend his effort to bring attention to the \nimportant, though obscure issue of tritium production. Since the \nlooming threat of nuclear war dissipated in the aftermath of the demise \nof the Soviet Union, our strategic forces have been pushed to the \nsidelines. But recent events in the Asia subcontinent remind us not \nonly of the danger from the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction but also of the imperative to maintain the deterrent effect \nof our strategic weapons stockpile.\n  Tritium is a radioactive isotope that is used in every nuclear \nwarhead in our nation's stockpile. Like all radioactive matter, tritium \ndecays over time. To compensate for the loss from decay, it is \nnecessary to periodically replenish the level of tritium in each \nweapon. Despite this constant demand, tritium has not been produced for \nstrategic purposes since 1988. Replenishment in the weapons stockpile \nhas continued, however, by recycling tritium from nuclear weapons as \nthey are dismantled. This is only an interim measure, and it is clear \nthat the U.S. will have to resume tritium production sometime soon.\n  In 1995, the Department of Energy decided to follow a dual-track \napproach whereby the two most promising options for tritium production \nwould be explored. The first option is to purchase the radioactive gas \nfrom a commercial nuclear reactor. The second alternative is to design, \nconstruct, and test an accelerator system, which is called the \nAccelerator Production of Tritium or APT. The Department of Energy was \ndirected by last year's National Defense Authorization Act to conduct \nan interagency review of tritium production policy issues. The \nAuthorization Act also directed the Energy Department to determine \nwhich of two tracks will serve as the primary source of tritium \nproduction by the end of this year.\n  There are forces in Congress, however, who are determined to derail \nthis process. Proponents of APT are trying to prohibit the production \nof tritium at a commercial reactor. This misguided attempt would leave \nthe Department of Energy with no choice other than using APT as the \nsource for tritium production. Make no mistake about it, this is a \nthinly disguised attempt to mandate one particular technology that \nbenefits one particular state. It is unfortunate that some are willing \nto put parochial interests in front of the national security imperative \nto develop a cheap, safe source of tritium.\n  As the Secretary of Energy stated, the selection of tritium \nproduction should be based on ``a careful and deliberate review of the \ncost, technical, schedule, and policy issues associated with each \noption.'' These sentiments are supported by the Administration and the \nDepartment of Defense. I suspect that all of us who believe in fair and \nhonest competition would agree that Congress should not interfere with \nthe Department of Energy's process for selecting a tritium production \nsource. If proponents of the APT are successful in their efforts \nhowever, Congress will do just that, and the decision will be based not \non the merits of either option but solely on politics.\n\n  The Congress and the taxpayer should be aware of the staggering \ndifferences in the price tag associated with each competing technology. \nThe Congressional Budget Office estimate that APT will cost from $6.72 \nbillion to construct. In addition to the initial construction cost, the \nAPT option will require an annual appropriation of $150 million to \noperate. Furthermore, these estimates are based on preliminary \nconceptual designs, and the taxpayer of course will be asked to pay for \nany likely cost overruns.\n  On the other hand, Mr. President, the commercial reactor option would \nonly cost $1.8 to $2 billion. Moreover, this initial investment is \nsimilar to a loan, so every tax dollar spent will be returned to the \nTreasury. This has been certified by several independent reviews. I \nwould like to add that this option does not require any additional \nappropriated funds because the commercial reactor owner, not the \nTreasury, will pay any cost overruns.\n  If selected by the Department of Energy, a commercial reactor could \nbegin producing tritium by 2003. This is two years ahead of the \nscheduled that the Departments of Energy and Defense have laid out as \nnecessary to maintain the nuclear stockpile at the START I level. It \nuses a proven design which is currently being demonstrated. The \ncommercial reactor also provides the Department of Energy with the \nflexibility to change tritium production\n\n[[Page S7131]]\n\nquantities in response to changing need without major cost \nimplications.\n  Serious concerns have been raised about the technical feasibility of \nthe accelerator option. While proponents of APT tout its supposed \nbenefits, I would like to point out that the APT does not exist. It is \nstill a paper concept. Also, several components that are critical to \nthe development of this accelerator are still in the prototype stage. \nEven if the APT is developed on schedule, it would not be operational \nuntil 2007, which is two years after the Department's target date. As a \nresult, the ATP option will require that the Department of Energy will \nhave to find an interim source of tritium until the APT is proven. Any \nunforeseen delays in the development of the accelerator technology will \nextend the Department's reliance on an interim source.\n  Mr. President, the issue before us can be boiled down to this: Should \nCongress dictate the tritium production method as a political favor \nregardless of technological risk and cost? I strongly believe that the \ncommercial reactor option should not be removed from consideration by \nlegislation fiat. Instead, the Senate has a responsibility to preserve \nthe integrity of a process that rewards merits and competition. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the Session's amendment and preserve the \nDepartment of Energy's dual-track options for tritium production.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I rise today to discuss my grave concerns about the \npolicy implications if a decision to produce tritium in a commercial \nnuclear reactor were to be made. My concerns are especially serious in \nlight of the nuclear tests conducted by India and Pakistan last month. \nThe recent detonation of nuclear devices in South Asia should serve as \na wake-up call to the U.S. and the international community about the \nunfinished business with respect to the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  Most of the international effort to slow the spread of nuclear \nweapons has been focused on limiting access to plutonium and uranium. \nHowever, less attention has been given to tritium which can increase \nthe capabilities of these nuclear weapons. To those unfamiliar with the \nuse of tritium in nuclear munitions, tritium is to a nuclear weapon \nwhat Tabasco Sauce is to a good bowl of chili--it adds kick. The key \npoint is that it is the tritium which allows the use of smaller \ndelivery systems because it allows a smaller weapon to produce a much \ngreater yield. In the age of concerns about suitcase bombs and the \nsmuggling of weapons across borders, it is critical that we also \nattempt to limit access to tritium.\n  It has been long-standing American policy to discourage the use of \ncommercial reactors to produce weapons material. Instead, the Atomic \nenergy Act mandated that the Atomic Energy Commission would be the \nexclusive owner of production facilities related to nuclear weapons. \nThat authority now lies within the Department of Energy. Unfortunately, \nwhen drafted, the Atomic Energy Act did not specifically list tritium \nas a special nuclear material covered under the act. The House has \npassed legislation that would insure that tritium is covered as a \nspecial nuclear material which is only to be produced in a facility \nowned by the Department of Energy. I believe such an approach is a \nreasonable one given our non-proliferation objectives.\n  Our dwindling supply of tritium and our need to preserve the nation's \nnuclear deterrent require the U.S. to develop a new tritium production \ncapability at this time. To that end, the U.S. is currently considering \ntwo types of tritium production methods. Unfortunately, one of the two \ntechnology options under consideration contrasts sharply with our \ntraditional policy. The use of commercial nuclear reactors raises \nserious concerns about non-proliferation. The U.S. has worked too long \nand too hard to stem the spread of weapons of mass destruction to \nabandon the principles of the Atomic Energy Act which has served as \nwell over the last four decades. How can we urge the governments of \nIndia, Pakistan, North Korea, and any other country seeking a nuclear \nweapons capability not to attempt to use reactors designed for peaceful \nenergy production for military purposes when we are contemplating doing \na very similar thing here in America?\n  Now, I am certainly no expert in nuclear physics and the production \nof nuclear weapons material. However, America has tremendous human \nresources within the Department of Energy in the form of our \nscientists, engineers, and plant workers. These Americans helped win \nthe Cold War. Their contributions are significant and not to be \noverlooked. What is key is that their contributions are not yet done. \nThe Department of Energy's Savannah River Site has been where tritium \nhas been traditionally produced and processed. That is where America's \nexpertise in tritium production lies. That is where we can be assured \nthat our national non-proliferation objectives will never be \nsubordinated to commercial or other concerns. It is my view that we \nshould once again turn to those great workers there to get the job done \nas they have proven they are capable.\n\n  I will certainly admit, proudly, to my constituency interest in \nseeing that the Savannah River Site be given fair consideration. \nHowever, there is a larger issue at stake here than the economic \ninterests of competing constituent interests. Prevention of the spread \nof nuclear weapons and the preservation of American leadership on this \nissue is in the interests of every state, of every region, and of every \nAmerican.\n  I do not have the expertise to determine which technology is most \nviable and cost effective if the choice is between a reactor-based \noption and an accelerator option. However, I do know that at this point \nin history, it would be wrong to turn our backs on one of our most \neffective non-proliferation policies. It is my view that we should \ncontinue to maintain our nuclear weapons capability within DOE \nfacilities where we have traditionally done this work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the tritium production issue that is the \nsubject of the Sessions amendment is a very important issue.\n  The Department of Energy must have a level playing field to make a \nsound decision on a tritium production source. We should not restrict \nthe options available to the Department of Energy in making that \nchoice.\n  The Sessions amendment would ensure a level playing field for the \nDepartment to make its choice. That is why I strongly support the \nSessions amendment.\n  Mr. President, I will work hard to ensure that the conference on the \ndefense authorization bill will result in a level playing field to \nassure the Energy Department can make the best possible choice. That is \nin our national interest.\n  Mr. President, Secretary of Defense William Cohen agrees that there \nshould be no restriction on the options being considered by the \nDepartment of Energy on a future tritium production source.\n  He has sent a letter to the Armed Services Committee today that urges \nthe Senate not to adopt any amendment that would restrict DOE's \noptions. His letter concludes with the following sentence: ``Passage of \nany such amendment would place the Defense Authorization bill at \nrisk.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Secretary \nCohen be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                      The Secretary of Defense\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 25, 1998.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express the opinion of \n     the Department of Defense on proposed amendments to the \n     Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Authorization bill that prohibit \n     commercial light water reactors from producing tritium for \n     military purposes.\n       The Department of Energy (DOE) is pursuing a dual-track \n     program to produce tritium. One method is to use a commercial \n     light water reactor (CLWR) to irradiate rods from which \n     tritium could be extracted at a DOE facility--in effect, \n     buying irradiation services. The other approach is to build \n     an accelerator to produce tritium (APT). DOE will decide on a \n     primary method by the end of this calendar year. The proposed \n     amendments would effectively foreclose the CLWR option.\n       DoD opposes the amendments for three reasons. First, if the \n     amendments become law, DOE would require an immediate \n     additional investment of nearly $250M to accelerate \n     development of APT. The long term impacts of the amendments \n     are far more significant. The life cycle cost of APT could be\n\n[[Page S7132]]\n\n     as high as $8.8B. The life cycle cost of the CLWR program \n     could be as low as $1.2B. Thus, the amendments could mandate \n     an unfunded liability of up to $7.6B. Second, the amendments \n     would likely increase the cost of the DOE stockpile \n     stewardship program (SSP). Finally, this amendment appears to \n     be predicated on an assumption that the use of commercial \n     reactors for tritium production is inconsistent with the US \n     nonproliferation policy. It is not. The DOE will forward \n     shortly a completed interagency report that concludes that \n     the nonproliferation policy issues associated with the use of \n     a commercial light water reactor are manageable and that the \n     DOE should continue to pursue the reactor option as a viable \n     source for future tritium production. The DoD fully endorses \n     this position.\n       In conclusion, DOE has a dual-track program to develop an \n     assured supply of tritium. Until DOE reaches its decision \n     later this year, the wisest choice is to leave our options \n     open. Therefore, I urge you to oppose the amendments that \n     would prohibit CLWR from being considered as an option. \n     Passage of any such amendment would place the Defense \n     Authorization bill at risk.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    William Cohen,\n                                             Secretary of Defense.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 2909 as modified\n\n(Purpose: To require the Secretary of Defense to provide new incentives \n     for retention of personnel for critical military specialties)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 620. RETENTION INCENTIVES INITIATIVE FOR CRITICALLY \n                   SHORT MILITARY OCCUPATIONAL SPECIALTIES.\n\n       (a) Requirement for New Incentives.--The Secretary of \n     Defense shall establish and provide for members of the Armed \n     Forces qualified in critically short military occupational \n     specialties a series of new incentives that the Secretary \n     considers potentially effective for increasing the rates at \n     which those members are retained in the Armed Forces for \n     service in such specialties.\n       (b) Critically Short Military Occupational Specialties.--\n     For the purposes of this section, a military occupational \n     specialty is a critically short military occupational \n     specialty for an armed force if the number of members \n     retained in that armed force in fiscal year 1998 for service \n     in that specialty is less than 50 percent of the number of \n     members of that armed force that were projected to be \n     retained in that armed force for service in the specialty by \n     the Secretary of the military department concerned as of \n     October 1, 1997.\n       (c) Incentives.--It is the sense of Congress that, among \n     the new incentives established and provided under this \n     section, the Secretary of Defense should include the \n     following incentives:\n       (1) Family support and leave allowances.\n       (2) Increased special reenlistment or retention bonuses.\n       (3) Repayment of educational loans.\n       (4) Priority of selection for assignment to preferred \n     permanent duty station or for extension at permanent duty \n     station.\n       (5) Modified leave policies.\n       (6) Special consideration for Government housing or \n     additional housing allowances.\n       (d) Relationship to Other Incentives.--Incentives provided \n     under this section are in addition to any special pay or \n     other benefit that is authorized under any other provision of \n     law.\n       (e) Reports.--(1) Not later than December 1, 1998, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional \n     defense committees a report that identifies, for each of the \n     Armed Forces, the critically short military occupational \n     specialties to which incentives under this section are to \n     apply.\n       (2) Not later than April 15, 1999, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to the congressional defense committees a report \n     that specifies, for each of the Armed Forces, the incentives \n     that are to be provided under this section.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 2923 as modified\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health \n      Affairs to revise the TRICARE policy manual to clarify that \n rehabilitative services are available to a patient for a head injury \n                      under certain circumstances)\n\n       At the end of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 708. ACCESSABILITY TO CARE UNDER TRICARE.\n\n       (a) Rehabilitation Services for Head Injuries.--The \n     Secretary of Defense shall revise the TRICARE policy manual \n     to clarify that rehabilitative services are available to a \n     patient for a head injury when the treating physician \n     certifies that such services would be beneficial for the \n     patient and there is potential for the patient to recover \n     from the injury.\n       (b) Review of Adequacy of Provider Network.--The Secretary \n     of Defense shall review the administration of the TRICARE \n     Prime health plans to determine whether, for the region \n     covered by each such plan, there is a sufficient number, \n     distribution, and variety of qualified participating health \n     care providers to ensure that all covered health care \n     services, including specialty services, are available and \n     accessible in a timely manner to all persons covered by the \n     plan. If the Secretary determines during the review that, in \n     the region, there is an inadequate network of providers to \n     provide the covered benefits in proximity to the permanent \n     duty stations of covered members of the uniformed services in \n     the region, or in proximity to the residences of other \n     persons covered by the plan in the region, the Secretary \n     shall take such actions as are necessary to ensure that the \n     TRICARE Prime plan network of providers in the region is \n     adequate to provide for all covered benefits to be available \n     and accessible in a timely manner to all persons covered by \n     the plan.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President. I rise today to offer an amendment that \nseeks to address some of the inadequacies in the current Armed \nServices' health care system. I know many of my colleagues will be \naware of these inadequacies from their constituents complaints about \nthis system which, at times seems more like a cost cutting operation \nthan the health care system for those brave enough to put their lives \non the line for their country.\n  The inadequacies addressed by my amendment were brought to my \nattention recently through the tragic case of Stephanie Davito, the 14 \nyear old daughter of a nuclear submarine commander who currently lies \nin a coma at Sentara General Hospital in Norfolk, Virginia. This little \ngirl's family has been fighting to get her the care that she needs \nthrough the TRICARE PRIME health care system and they have met time and \ntime again with a wall of bureaucracy. At this time of extreme stress \nand anguish, Commander Davito and his wife Kristine have been forced to \nliterally plead for adequate health care for their daughter. No-one \nshould be forced to plead for covered benefits, least of all our Armed \nServices personnel and their families.\n  Commander Davito, who is a United States Naval Officer from Spring \nValley in Illinois, had been the Executive Officer on board the nuclear \npowered attack submarine U.S.S. Hyman G. Rickover stationed in Norfolk, \nVirginia. In March, he was transferred to STRATCOM in Nebraska. His \nfamily remained in Norfolk to finish out the school year. On May 15th, \ntragedy struck as Commander and Mrs. Davito's young daughter was hit by \na car on her way home from school. She has been in a coma ever since. \nSTRATCOM, as Commander Davito explained in his recent letter to me, was \nwonderful and transferred him temporarily to Commander Submarine Force \nAtlantic in Norfolk, so that he could be with his daughter.\n  However, Commander Davito's experience with TRICARE has been a \nnightmare. Even though Stephanie's neurologist, Dr. Robert Rashti, \nbelieves that Stephanie has a very good chance for recovery, a TRICARE \nbureaucrat tried to argue that because Stephanie was not ``an active \nparticipant'' in her rehabilitation, they would not have to cover her \ntreatment. This is an absolutely outrageous claim. Such a view \nobviously affects anyone covered by TRICARE that is unfortunate enough \nto suffer a coma. To suggest that comatose patients do not deserve \ntreatment is, to me a completely abhorrent suggestion.\n  The TRICARE policy manual does in fact stipulate that Rehabilitation \nis a covered service, though must of the manual reads like alphabet \nsoup with respect to clarity. Clearly, the manual needs to be made more \nexplicit, as my amendment suggests, so that no utilization clerk within \nthe TRICARE system will ever again be confused.\n  TRICARE has on numerous occasions tried to encourage the Davitos to \nput Stephanie in custodial care which, by the way, they do not cover. \nThere, she would not get the Rehabilitation that she needs.\n  The Davitos contacted Senator Warner, Illinois State Representative \nFrank Mautino, and my office to see if we could help them. I want to \ntake this opportunity to thank Senator Warner on their behalf for all \nhis staffs' hard work on this issue. In particular, I believe that Mr. \nSanford in his district office has been extremely helpful to the \nDavitos. In spite of all our offices' repeated intervention on behalf \nof the Davitos, Stephanie's care is still not resolved and we are still \nbeing met with a wall a bureaucracy from the TRICARE system. Secretary \nDalton has personally intervened and I want to sincerely thank him for \nthat. The Navy has been deeply involved in trying to resolve this but \nthey too have met with incredible resistance from TRICARE West with \nrespect to TRICARE committing to treating Stephanie adequately. These \nare not the wars that the Armed Services should have to fight.\n\n[[Page S7133]]\n\n  Stephanie's doctor believes that she has a good chance for recovery, \nif TRICARE would only provide her with the Rehabilitation that she \nneeds. Dr. Rashti wrote on June 15th, and I am quoting from his letter \nto Senator Warner, ``at the time of Stephanie's admission, she was in \ncritical condition due to severe brain swelling from contusions and a \nsmall hematoma in the right frontal region of the head. After a stormy \ncourse lasting two weeks, her brain swelling began to resolve and \nStephanie began to show signs of improvement. . . . Prognostically, her \ndiagnostic studies in conjunction with her evolving clinical course, \nsuggests that this young lady has significant potential for functional \nrecovery. While there is no guarantee, this medical impression is based \non over 26 years of neurosurgical experience, including experience at \nthe Shock Trauma Unit in Maryland and the Multiple Trauma Unit for \ntwenty years here in Norfolk.'' Later in this letter, Dr. Rashti stated \nvery clearly ``From a medical standpoint, it is not felt appropriate \nthat she go to a custodial care facility.'' Another doctor, Dr. Kip \nBurkman was in full agreement with Dr. Rashti's recommendation. Neither \nmedical opinions seemed to sway the administrators of the TRICARE West \nprogram who refused to allow for Stephanie's transfer to the \nImmanuel Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska which is near her family's \nhome and which can provide Rehabilitation services that she needs.\n\n  Can any of us imagine how we would feel if one of our children lay as \nStephanie does in a coma, where the doctors said she would get better \nif only she has access to care, but the cost cutting plan \nadministrators tried to use every ambiguity in the policy manual to \ndeny care? The pain and suffering that Stephanie's parents must be \ngoing through must be incredible. Is this how we treat the families of \na person like Commander Davito who has served his country for 16 years \nand who has time and time again put his life at risk for the good of \nhis country? Is this the kind of health care system that we reward our \nArmed Services with?\n  Further confounding this problem is the issue of whether the network \nof providers in some regions of the country are adequate. Part of the \nproblem that the Davito's are experiencing is due to the absence of a \nRehabilitation facility near the STRATCOM base that is affiliated with \nthe TRICARE West network. The Immanuel Medical Center in Omaha which is \nclose to the STRATCOM base, after TRICARE initially suggested that \nStephanie could be transferred there, was found not to be within the \nTRICARE West network which was probably part of the reason that TRICARE \nWest suddenly became reluctant to allow her to be transferred there. \nHowever, TRICARE West does not have any facilities within their network \nnear the base that are capable of providing Stephanie with the \nRehabilitation recommended by her doctors. TRICARE suggested again that \nshe be placed in a nursing home in Omaha or a nursing home in Lincoln \nNebraska which is over 80 miles from the base, or finally they offered \na place in a hospital in Lincoln, again over 80 miles from Stephanie's \nparents.\n  What would it mean if TRICARE was successful in denying Stephanie \naccess to the care that she needed? Well, it would likely mean that \nwhen she recovers from her coma, she will not be able to walk because \nshe will have been denied the physical therapy necessary to prevent \nmuscle atrophy. A wide variety of other completely avoidable \ncomplications might also result from the denial of rehabilitation.\n  This little girl deserves a chance to get better. After much \nprodding, TRICARE is now saying that maybe she could have one month of \nRehabilitation care at the Immanuel Hospital near the STRATCOM base. \nHowever, the time-frame for recovery from these injuries is 4-6 months \nat a minimum. Stephanie's doctors are suggesting that she may need \nbetween 6 and 12 months of care. As Dr. Rashti pointed out in his most \nrecent letter, ``Progress in any rehabilitation program is usually not \nas rapid as family or insurance companies would like but that is the \nnature of recovering brain injury patients. Their course is frequently \ncharacterized by rapid spurts of improvement interspersed with plateau \nperiods lasting weeks before the next level of improvement begin.'' Dr. \nRashti suggested that Stephanie would likely need 4 to 6 months of \naggressive rehabilitation, with a maximum rehab benefit of about a \nyear. I completely agree with Dr. Rashti when he says ``This child is \n14 years old and deserves every chance to reach her maximum \npotential''.\n\n  My staff has contacted NIH to inquire of their staff at the National \nInstitute of Neurological Disease, as to their opinion for the normal \ntime-frame for recovery from such injuries. They have also indicated \nthat 6 months to 1 year seems appropriate.\n  Everyone except the insurance company seems to be in agreement as to \nthe care that Stephanie needs. I hope that we can make some progress \nduring consideration of the Department of Defense's Reauthorization \nbill to see that this issue gets resolved not only for Stephanie but \nalso for all the other Americans covered by the TRICARE system.\n  My amendment is very simple. It has two parts. The first part directs \nthe Secretary of Defense to revise the TRICARE policy manual to make it \nperfectly clear that Rehabilitative services are available to a patient \nsuffering from a head injury when the treating physician certifies that \nsuch services would be beneficial for that patient and there is \npotential for recovery. This would move medical decisions concerning \ntreatment back where they belong into the hands of physicians and out \nof the hands of HMO bureaucrats that may be more concerned with cost \ncutting than care giving.\n  The second part of my amendment would direct the Secretary of Defense \nto evaluate the adequacy of each TRICARE region's network of providers. \nEach region should have sufficient number, distribution and variety of \nqualified health care providers and facilities to provide all the \ncovered services. If a region is found to have an inadequate network of \nproviders for some covered services, then the Secretary would be \nrequested to take remedial action to improve the adequacy of the \nnetworks. This part of my amendment is very important to those in the \nmilitary who are frequently transferred from station to station. In \nsome areas, where managed care has been around for a long time, the \nnetworks may be good and patients may access all the care that they \nneed and are entitled to. However, in some parts of the country, the \nnetworks are not sufficient and someone that enrolled in TRICARE PRIME \nwhile in California or Oregon suddenly finds that their new network is \ncompletely inadequate. Should our Armed Services personnel be force to \nswap between TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Standard depending on where they \nare currently stationed? Will they only find out when they can't get \nthe care that they need that their region has an inadequate network of \nproviders? Surely, we can provide a getter standard of care to the men \nand women and their families who patriotically serve our country.\n\n  After 4 years in operation, I believe it is time to evaluate the \nTRICARE system and to see if there are regional gaps in service. \nObviously, if it turns out that some regions do not provide adequately \nfor our military's the health care needs, then this should be remedied. \nHowever, if we don't ask for this evaluation, it may take much longer \nto correct problems that may exist.\n  There are those that might argue that providing adequate health care \ncoverage will cost us more. Actually, having inadequate networks may \nalso be extremely costly because when a person is denied care, it may \ntake many navy personnel working in the appeals process to secure them \nthe necessary health care. It may also mean that the Plan has to \ncontract temporarily with an out of network provider. This is not a \nvery efficient way of doing business. As the saving goes, ``You should \nfix the roof while the sun is shining'', we should not leave it to \ntragedies like Stephanies to point out to us when our health care \nsystem for the Armed Services is deficient.\n  I believe that this amendment will take a small step forward to \nmaking sure that the Armed Services have access to a decent health care \nsystem and I hope that my colleagues will support my amendment.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 2976 as modified\n\n                 (Purpose: Relating to Radio Free Asia)\n\n       Add at the end the following new title:\n\n[[Page S7134]]\n\n                      TITLE ____--RADIO FREE ASIA\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Radio Free Asia Act of \n     1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n     systematically controls the flow of information to the \n     Chinese people.\n       (2) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n     demonstrated that maintaining its monopoly on political power \n     is a higher priority than economic development by announcing \n     in January 1996 that its official news agency Xinhua, will \n     supervise wire services selling economic information, \n     including Dow Jones-Telerate, Bloomberg, and Reuters \n     Business, and in announcing in February 1996 the ``Interim \n     Internet Management Rules'', which have the effect of \n     censoring computer networks.\n       (3) Under the May 30, 1997, order of Premier Li Peng, all \n     organizations that engage in business activities related to \n     international computer networking must now apply for a \n     license, increasing still further government control over \n     access to the Internet.\n       (4) Both Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America, as a \n     surrogate for a free press in the People's Republic of China, \n     provide an invaluable source of uncensored information to the \n     Chinese people, including objective and authoritative news of \n     in-country and regional events, as well as accurate news \n     about the United States and its policies.\n       Enhanced broadcasting service to China and Tibet can \n     efficiently be established through a combination of Radio \n     Free Asia and Voice of America programming.\n       (6) Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, in working toward \n     continuously broadcasting to the People's Republic of China \n     in multiple languages, have the capability to establish 24-\n     hour-a-day Mandarin broadcasting to that nation by staggering \n     the hours of Radio Free Asia an Voice of America.\n       (7) Simultaneous broadcastings on Voice of America radio \n     and Worldnet television 7 days a week in Mandarin are also \n     important and needed capabilities.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR INCREASED FUNDING \n                   FOR RADIO FREE ASIA AND VOICE OF AMERICA \n                   BROADCASTING TO CHINA.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations for Radio Free Asia.--\n       (1) Authorization of appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated for ``Radio Free Asia'' $30,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 1998 and $22,000,000 for fiscal year 1999.\n       (2) Limitations.--\n       Of the funds under paragraph (1) authorized to be \n     appropriated for fiscal year 1998, $8,000,000 is authorized \n     to be appropriated for one-time capital costs.\n       (3) Sense of Congress\n       It is the Sense of Congress that of the funds under \n     paragraph (1), a significant amount shall be directed towards \n     broadcasting to China and Tibet in the appropriate languages \n     and dialects.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations for International \n     Broadcasting To China.--In addition to such sums as are \n     otherwise authorized to be appropriated for ``International \n     Broadcasting Activities'' for fiscal years 1998 and 1999, \n     there are authorized to be appropriated for ``International \n     Broadcasting Activities'' $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1998 and \n     $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, which shall be available \n     only or enhanced Voice of America broadcasting to China.\n       Of the funds authorized under this subsection, $100,000 is \n     authorized to be appropriated for each of the fiscal years \n     1998 and 1999 for additional personnel to staff Hmong \n     language broadcasting.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations for Radio \n     Construction.--In addition to such sums as are otherwise \n     authorized to be appropriated for ``Radio Construction'' or \n     fiscal years 1998 and 1999, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated for ``Radio Construction'' $10,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 1998 and $2,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, which \n     shall be available only for construction in support of \n     enhanced broadcasting to China, including the timely \n     augmentation of transmitters at Tinian, the Commonwealth of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORTING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       (a) Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Broadcasting Board of Governors shall prepare \n     and submit to the appropriate congressional committees an \n     assessment of the Board's efforts to increase broadcasting by \n     Radio Free Asia and Voice of America China and Tibet. This \n     report shall include an analysis of Chinese government \n     control of the media, the ability of independent journalists \n     and news organizations to operate in China, and the results \n     of any research conducted to quantify listenership.\n       (b) For the purposes of this section, appropriate \n     congressional committees are defined as the Senate Committees \n     on Foreign Relations and Appropriations and the House \n     Committees on International Relations and Appropriations.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I support the amendment by the Senator from \nArkansas regarding Radio Free Asia. The amendment is virtually \nidentical to the text of H.R. 2232 as reported by the Committee on \nForeign Relations on May 19.\n  As the author of the legislation which created Radio Free Asia (RFA) \nin 1994, I strongly support its efforts to broadcast truth and \ninformation to the people living under dictatorial rule in China and \nelsewhere in Asia.\n  RFA began broadcasts in 1996 on a shoestring budget of roughly $10 \nmillion a year. This bill authorizes, in Fiscal Years 1998 and 1999, a \nsignificant increase in funding for Radio Free Asia, and provides \nadditional funds for the transmission capability needed to broadcast \nthe programming. It is consistent with the funding levels in S. 903, \nthe State Department authorization bill approved by the Senate over a \nyear ago.\n  Modeled on Radio Free Europe, this organization was conceived in \norder to broadcast news and information about internal events in China \nand the other non-democratic states of East Asia. Radio Free Asia thus \nacts as a ``surrogate'' service, acting as a local media--making \navailable information to the Chinese people which is otherwise \nunavailable because of the tight control that the dictatorship in \nBeijing retains on the media in China. As the State Department's Annual \nHuman Rights report noted, the Chinese government and the Communist \nParty ``continue to control tightly print and broadcast media and use \nthem to propagate the current ideological line.''\n  Radio Free Asia is designed to overcome these restrictions on press \nfreedom. The leaders of the new democracies in Eastern Europe have all \ntestified to the importance of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty \nduring the Cold War. No tribute has been more eloquent than that of \nLech Walesa, former President of Poland, who said ``How fortunate that \nthe Iron Curtain could not be raised so high as to block radio \ntransmission. The truth seeped in, unseen by border guards . . . . \nbetween the barbed wire. It provided impossible to stop, impossible to \nsilence.''\n  Radio Free Asia is not, as some cynics have asserted, a propaganda \nservice. Although funding by the U.S. government, it is a private \ncorporation. Its funding is provided by the Broadcasting Board of \nGovernors, a government entity which has considerable autonomy in its \nrole of supervising U.S. government-sponsored broadcasting.\n  In short, Radio Free Asia is a legitimate news organization, staffed \nby legitimate journalists. Its President is Richard Richter, a former \nnetwork news executive, who has insisted on the highest journalistic \nstandards. The Vice-President for Programming, Daniel Southerland, is \nalso an experience reporter who formerly served as the Beijing bureau \nchief for the Washington Post. In the short time that Radio Free Asia \nhas been on the air, they have assembled a very talented and dedicated \nstaff which is committed to honest journalism.\n  The exiling of prominent dissidents by the Beijing government has \nbeen a boon to Radio Free Asia. Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, both \nrecently exiled by China, have signed on to provide regular commentary. \nRadio Free Asia thus provides a platform for voices of democracy--a \nplatform that is, unfortunately, unavailable to these men inside China.\n  China and the other nations to which RFA broadcasts have not been \nthrilled with the honor. Since last year, the Chinese have attempted to \njam Radio Free Asia broadcasts. And this week, the Beijing government \nrescinded visas it had previously issued for three RFA reporters who \nhad sought to accompany President Clinton on his trip to China.\n  The decision by China to rescind the visas is deeply regrettable. Had \nit admitted the journalists, the Chinese government would have provided \na manifest demonstration that it had turned a corner--that it is \nwilling to open up its system to greater pluralism and scrutiny. China \nwants to be a great power. But Great Powers do not obstruct the flow of \ninformation into and out of the country. The Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights provides that everyone has the right to ``seek, receive \nand impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of \nfrontiers.'' If China is to be a modern nation, it should adhere to \nthis universal standard.\n  There is, however, some good news lurking in the decision of the \nChinese government to block the visas for RFA reporters: China must be \nworried about the effect of RFA's broadcasts. In other words, the \nbroadcasts are getting\n\n[[Page S7135]]\n\nthrough--despite the efforts to jam it--and people are listening. \nInformation is subversive of tyranny, as are western investment and \nexchanges, and the Communist government in China apparently recognizes \nthat Radio Free Asia threatened its attempts to control news and \ninformation.\n  Mr. President, Radio Free Asia is an important instrument to advance \nU.S. policy of promoting democratic values in China and elsewhere in \nAsia. This amendment is a modest, but important, step to ensure that it \nhas the tools to do the job.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3017\n\n (Purpose: To authorize $13,584,000 for the construction of a Combined \nSupport Maintenance Shop for the Army National Guard at Camp Guernsey, \n    Wyoming.

I rise to offer an amendment important to Persian Gulf \nWar veterans. My amendment increases Department of Defense spending on \nresearch to determine the causes and possible treatments of those \nsuffering from Gulf War illnesses by $10 million. It is my \nunderstanding that the amendment has been accepted by the bill managers \non both sides.\n  While the Persian Gulf War ended in 1991, the physical and \npsychological ordeal for many of the nearly 700,000 troops who served \nour country in Operation Desert Storm and Desert Shield has not ended. \nIt's been seven years since our troops were winning the war in the \nGulf. Unfortunately, they continue to suffer due to their deployment.\n  Many of our troops returned from the Persian Gulf suffering from a \nvariety of symptoms that have been difficult to trace to a single \nsource or substance. Our veterans have experienced a combination of \nsymptoms in varying degrees of seriousness, including: fatigue, skin \nrash, muscle and joint pain, headache, loss of memory, shortness of \nbreath, and gastrointestinal and respiratory problems. Unfortunately, \nthe initial response from the Pentagon and the Department of Veterans \nAffairs was to express skepticism about veterans' and their loved ones \nwho dealt with the very real affects of their service in the Gulf.\n  I vividly remember a series of roundtable discussions I held with \nveterans across Iowa after being contacted by several families of Gulf \nWar veterans stricken with undiagnosed illnesses. And these folks \nweren't just sick. They were tired. They were tired of getting the \nrunaround from the government they defended. There were tired of people \nwho refused to listen. . . or told them it was in their head . . . or \nthat it had nothing to do with their service in the Gulf.\n  Their stories put a human face on the results of a study I requested \nthrough the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The results add \nto the increasing volume of evidence that what these veterans were \nexperiencing was indeed very real. More than one in three Gulf War \nveterans reported one or more significant medical problems. Fifteen \npercent reported two or more significant medical conditions. These Iowa \nveterans also reported significantly greater problems with quality of \nlife issues than others on active duty at the time but not deployed in \nthe Gulf. For example, Persian Gulf veterans had lower scores on \nmeasures of vitality, physical and mental health, ability to work, and \nincreased levels of emotional problems and bodily pain.\n  In addition, over 80 percent of the Gulf War veterans in the CDC \nstudy reported having been exposed to at least one potentially \nhazardous material during their Persian Gulf Deployment. A recent \nGeneral Accounting Office report provided an alarming laundry list of \nsuch hazards including: ``compounds used to decontaminate equipment and \nprotect it against chemical agents, fuel used as a sand suppressant in \nand around encampments, fuel used to burn human waste, fuel in shower \nwater, leaded vehicle exhaust used to dry sleeping bags, depleted \nuranium, parasites, pesticides, multiple vaccines used to protect \nagainst chemical warfare agents, and smoke from oil-well fires.''\n  To this rather exhaustive list, we can also add exposure to nerve \ngas. The DOD and CIA have admitted that as many as 100,000 or more . . \n. that's 1 in 7 troops deployed in the Gulf . . . may have been exposed \nto chemical agents released into the atmosphere when U.S. troops \ndestroyed an Iraqi weapons bunker. A Presidential Advisory Committee \nalso found credible evidence of exposure to chemical agents in a second \nincident when troops crossed Iraqi front lines on the first day of the \nground war. Chemical weapons specialists in these units said they \ndetected poison gas. Unfortunately, these detections were initially \nneither acknowledged nor pursued by the Pentagon.\n  That being said, the Pentagon and others have been more forthcoming \nrecently with relevant information, documents, and research. But more \nneeds to be done. I am pleased that the President, acting based on \nlegislation, I cosponsored, extended the time veterans will have to \nfile claims with the government for illnesses related to their service \nin the Gulf. Previously, they had to show their illness surfaced within \ntwo years of their service. Now, they have until the end of 2001. This \nis a great victory for our veterans. Gulf War illnesses do not surface \non a time line convenient to the rules of bureaucrats. This extension \nwill help us meet our responsibility to take care of these soldiers. \nBut, more still needs to be done.\n  There is still substantial mystery and confusion surrounding the \nsymptoms and health problems experienced by Gulf War veterans. While \nmany veterans have been diagnosed with a recognizable disease, I am \nconcerned about those who have no explanation, no label, no treatment \nfor their suffering. More needs to be done to help these Americans.\n  For example, the Presidential Advisory Committee has suggested \nresearch in three new areas to help close the gaps in what we know \nabout Gulf War illnesses. They suggest research on the long-term health \neffects of low-level exposures to chemical warfare agents, the combined \neffects of medical injections meant to combat chemical warfare with \nother Gulf War risk factors, and on the body's physical response to \nstress. It is also imperative to ensure that longitudinal studies and \nmortality studies are funded since some health effects, such as cancer, \nmay not appear for several years after the end of the Gulf War.\n  Although there may be no single Gulf-War related disease so to speak, \nit is widely acknowledged that the multiple illnesses and symptoms \nexperienced by Gulf War veterans are connected to their service during \nthe war. Therefore, we must not forget on our solemn obligation to \nthose who willingly served their country and put their lives in harm's \naway.\n  To that end, I offer this amendment to increase research into the \nillnesses experienced by Persian Gulf veterans by $10 million. In the \ncommittee version of the bill, $19 million is included. Therefore, my \namendment would increase that amount to $29 million, providing many \nmore opportunities for the Pentagon to study that many more possible \ncauses and cures. The funds would support much more research, including \nthe evaluation and treatment of a host of nuero-immunological \ndisorders, as well as possible connections to Multiple Chemical \nSensitivity, chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyaglia.\n  Our veterans are not asking for much. They want answers. They wan the \ntruth. Our veterans answered our nations's call in war, and now we must\n\n[[Page S7136]]\n\nanswer theirs. My amendment to increase funding for research into Gulf \nWar illnesses is one step in helping find these answers. Should our \npriorities include our Gulf War veterans? I believe the choice is self \nevident and absolutely clear.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3019\n\n(Purpose: To reauthorize a land conveyance of the Army Reserve Center, \n                           Youngstown, Ohio)\n\n       On page 342, below line 22, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2827.

LYME DISEASE.\n\n       Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated by this Act \n     for Defense Health Programs, $3,000,000 shall be available \n     for research and surveillance activities relating to Lyme \n     disease and other tick-borne diseases.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment, along \nwith Senators Lieberman, Chafee, Reed of Rhode Island and Lautenberg, \nto expand DoD's research into preventing and treating Lyme Disease and \nother tick-borne illnesses.\n  Almost everyone in my state, including myself, has seen the \ndevastating impact the Lyme Disease, in particular, can have on its \nvictims.\n  Most of you know that Lyme Disease has particular meaning for \nresidents of Connecticut. While it wasn't discovered in my state, it \ndid achieve prominence there in the early 1980s, and, in fact, is named \nafter the town of Lyme, Connecticut.\n  Like many northeastern states, CT experiences more than its share of \nthe anguish that this condition inflicts--my constituents face a Lyme \nDisease rate that is 10 times the national average.\n  The damage imposed by Lyme Disease on individuals and on families is \nheartbreaking. Health problems experienced by those infected can \ninclude facial paralysis, joint swelling, loss of coordination, \nirregular heart-beat, liver malfunction, depression, and memory loss.\n  Unfortunately, Lyme Disease mimics other health conditions and \npatients must often visit multiple doctors before they're properly \ndiagnosed. The result is prolonged pain and suffering, unnecessary \ntests, and costly treatments.\n  Long term treatment expenses can exceed $100,000 per person--a \nphenomenal cost to society. But an even greater price is paid by the \nvictims and their families. We can put no price tag on the emotional \ncosts associated with this disease.\n  Tragically, the number of Lyme Disease cases reported to the CDC has \nsky-rocketed--from 500 cases in 1982 to 16,000 cases in 1996. And these \ncases only represent the tip of the iceberg. Several new reports have \nfound that the actual incidence of the disease may be ten times greater \nthan current figures suggest. And due to the warm, wet winter caused by \nEl Nino, infection rates are expected to reach record levels in the \nnear future.\n  The growing number of cases has led the Department of Defense to \nrecognize that Lyme Disease and other tick-borne illnesses pose a \npotentially serious health threat to our troops, civilian employees, \nand residents at military installations all over the world--and thus a \nthreat to our military readiness. Indeed, hundreds of troops have \nalready been infected. And infection rates among enlistees are expected \nto rise along with those in the civilian population. And each time a \nsoldier contracts Lyme Disease, he or she contracts a potentially \ndebilitating illness that could compromise the overall readiness of our \narmed forces.\n  While recently approved vaccines offer hope for significantly \nreducing the number of Lyme Disease cases in the long-term, we can't \nlet down our guard.\n  These vaccines aren't yet 100% effective and aren't approved at all \nfor children or adolescents. Furthermore, the vaccines don't protect \nagainst other rapidly emerging tick-borne diseases. And, of course, \nthese vaccines do nothing to help individuals who are already infected.\n  To protect our troops, DoD must increase its surveillance of these \ndiseases, improve its ability to diagnose and treat tick-borne \nillnesses, and expand its research into new options to prevent the \nspread of Lyme Disease. This amendment would direct the Defense \nDepartment to provide $3 million to put toward these goals.\n  This sum would come out of existing Defense Department funds for \nmedical research--funds which total some $250 million. The amendment \nleaves to the discretion of the Secretary how to best allocate such \nfunds to as to make this necessary commitment to research.\n  I truly look forward to the day when Lyme Disease no longer plagues \nour citizens and troops. It's time that we take Lyme Disease seriously \nand establish a concrete commitment to fighting this devastating \ndisease.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3021\n\n(Purpose: To make available, with an offset, $10,000,000 for the DoD/VA \n                     Cooperative Research Program)\n\n       On page 41, below line 23, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 219. DOD/VA COOPERATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Availability of Funds.--(1) The amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by section 201(4) is hereby increased by \n     $10,000,000.\n       (2) Of the amount authorized to be appropriated by section \n     201(4), as increased by paragraph (1), $10,000,000 shall be \n     available for the DoD/VA Cooperative Research Program.\n       (b) Offset.--(1) The amount authorized to be appropriated \n     by section 201(2) is hereby decreased by $10,000,000.\n       (2) Of the amount authorized to be appropriated by section \n     201(2), as decreased by paragraph (1), not more than \n     $18,500,000 shall be available for the Commercial Operations \n     and Support Savings Program.\n       (c) Executive Agent.--The Secretary of Defense, acting \n     through the Army Medical Research and Materiel Command and \n     the Naval Operational Medicine Institute, shall be the \n     executive agent for the utilization of the funds made \n     available by subsection (a).\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased that this amendment, \nwhich authorizes $10 million for the DOD/VA Cooperative Research \nProgram, has been accepted. This program is a valuable, mutually \nbeneficial association between the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and funds health-related research \nspecifically designed to benefit both active duty military personnel \nand veterans. In fact, fostering this collaborative relationship was \nthe original intent of the DOD appropriation, back when this program \nbegan in 1987. It has been funded every year since then.\n  The DOD/VA Cooperative Research Program provides an excellent example \nof interagency cooperation to achieve a common goal. First of all, the \nVA and DOD jointly designate representatives to oversee the entire \nprocess. Before any money is spent, these representatives identify \nseveral specific research topics of interest to both agencies. The \nDepartments, working together, then decide the priorities of the \nresearch areas and the appropriate funding levels. Research proposals \nthat are received in response to an announcement of the program are \nreviewed by external experts, to preserve the integrity and credibility \nof the research. The result is a program which provides a strong, \ndirect link between DOD and VA investigators to pursue high quality \nresearch of mutual interest.\n\n[[Page S7137]]\n\n  I am cosponsoring this amendment with Senator Harkin and Senator \nDurbin who also recognize the tremendous benefits that can be gained \nfrom continuing this joint research effort. A collaborative approach \nlike this one allows investigators to follow the natural course of \ndisease or injury from the time of onset during active duty, and \nafterwards, in the veteran population.\n  In FY 1998, DOD and VA spent the funds provided for this program on \nstudies of combat casualty care including bone healing and wound \nrepair, and mechanisms of emerging pathogens. These kinds of studies \nare personally important to me, because in my own state of West \nVirginia, we have the highest per capita population of veterans, many \nof whom received grievous injuries during combat. This program is \nfunding research on limb regeneration and recovery from burn wounds at \nVA medical centers that include West Virginia, and offers hope for a \nbetter future for combat-wounded soldiers.\n  Last year's program also included the development of new clinical \nresearch areas on treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder and \nprostate diseases, including prostate cancer. As the Ranking Member of \nthe Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have witnessed the devastating \neffects of PTSD on the lives of former military personnel, and I am \nenormously encouraged by research which may prevent the onset of PTSD.\n  Let me stress that this amendment does not specify research areas for \nfocus. That decision rightly belongs with the Departments, because of \nthe collaborative nature of the joint program. They have expressed \ninterest in continuing research in the areas I just mentioned, \nexpanding the studies of emerging pathogens to include host defenses. \nIn addition to these ongoing areas of research, two new research \ninitiatives have been jointly agreed to by both Departments. The first \nwill focus on exercise physiology and combat readiness, while the \nsecond addresses traumatic brain and spinal cord injury.\n  I am also pleased to note that the VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee \nhas included report language recommending that VA and DOD develop a new \ncooperative research program on alcoholism. Rates of alcohol abuse are \nsignificantly higher in the military than among civilians. These \npatterns of heavy drinking persist in the veteran population, such that \nalcoholism is one of the most common illnesses found among hospitalized \nveterans.\n  As the nature of war changes, the modern military must cope with \nthreats that include environmental hazards and possible biological or \nchemical warfare, as well as the more traditional hazards of combat. \nResearch is needed to ensure that we are ready to meet these new risks. \nWe must also remember to care for our soldiers after they have suffered \nthe ravages of war, whatever the wounds. We need additional research to \nfind effective ways to help them have healthy and happy lives after \nservice, to repay them for the sacrifices that they make for all of us.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3022\n\n(Purpose: Relating to activities of the contractor-operated facilities \n                      of the Department of Energy)\n\n       On page 397, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3137.

The report shall include any recommendations for \n     the extension or expansion of the pilot program, including \n     the establishment of multiple rates of overhead charges for \n     various categories of persons and entities seeking research \n     and other activities in contractor-operated facilities of the \n     Department.\n       (d) Partnerships and Interactions.--(1) The Secretary of \n     Energy may encourage partnerships and interactions between \n     each contractor-operated facility of the Department of Energy \n     and universities and private businesses.\n       (2) The Secretary may take into account the progress of \n     each contractor-operated facility of the Department in \n     developing and expanding partnerships and interactions under \n     paragraph (1) in evaluating the annual performance of such \n     contractor-operated facility.\n       (e) Small Business Technology Partnership Program.--(1) The \n     Secretary may require that each contractor operating a \n     facility of the Department establish a program at such \n     facility under which the contractor may enter into \n     partnerships with small businesses at such facility relating \n     to technology.\n       (2) The amount of funds expended by a contractor under a \n     program under paragraph (1) at a particular facility may not \n     exceed an amount equal to 0.25 percent of the total operating \n     budget of the facility.\n       (3) Amounts expended by a contractor under a program--\n       (A) shall be used to cover the costs (including research \n     and development costs and technical assistance costs) \n     incurred by the contractor in connection with activities \n     under the program; and\n       (B) may not be used for direct grants to small businesses.\n       (4) The Secretary shall submit to the congressional defense \n     committees, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of \n     the Senate, and the appropriate committee of the House of \n     Representatives, together with the budget of the President \n     for each fiscal year that is submitted to Congress under \n     section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, an assessment \n     of the program under this subsection during the preceding \n     year, including the effectiveness of the program in providing \n     opportunities for small businesses to interact with and use \n     the resources of the contractor-operated facilities of the \n     Department, the cost of the program to the Federal government \n     and any impact on the execution of the Department's mission.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, partnerships among our federal \nlaboratories, universities, and industry provide important benefits to \nour nation. They help to create innovative new products and services \nthat drive our economy and improve our quality of\n\n[[Page S7138]]\n\nlife. Today I introduce the DOE Partnership Amendment to the National \nDefense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 1999. This Amendment \nimproves the capabilities at the DOE sites for effective partnerships \nand interactions with other federal agencies, with the private sector, \nand with universities.\n  I have personally observed the positive impacts of well crafted \npartnerships. These partnerships enhance the ability of the \nlaboratories and other contractor-operated facilities of the Department \nof Energy to accomplish their federal missions at the same time that \nthe companies benefit through enhanced competitiveness from the \ntechnical resources available at these sites.\n  I have also seen important successes achieved by other federal \nagencies and companies that utilized the resources of the national \nlaboratories and other Department sites through contract research \nmechanisms. Contract research enables these sites to contribute their \ntechnical expertise in cases where the private sector can not supply a \ncustomer's needs. Partnerships and other interactions enable companies \nand other agencies to accomplish their own missions better, faster, and \ncheaper.\n  I've seen spectacular examples where small businesses have been \ncreated around breakthrough technologies from the national laboratories \nand other contractor-operated sites of the DOE. But, at present, only \nthe Department's Defense Programs has a specific program for small \nbusiness partnerships and assistance.\n  All programs of the Department have expertise that can be driving \nsmall business successes. Historically, in the United States, small \nbusinesses have often been the most innovative and the fastest to \nexploit new technical opportunities--all of the Department's programs \nshould be open to the small business interactions that Defense Programs \nhas so effectively utilized.\n  I have been concerned that barriers to these partnerships and \ninteractions continue to exist within the Department of Energy. In \naddition, the Department's laboratories and other sites need continuing \nencouragement to be fully receptive to partnership opportunities that \nmeet both their own mission objectives and industry's goals. And \nfinally, small business interactions should be encouraged across the \nDepartment of Energy, not only in Defense Programs.\n  For these reasons, I introduced S. 1874 on March 27, 1998, the \nDepartment of Energy Small Business and Industry Partnership \nEnhancement Act of 1998, which was co-sponsored by Senators Thompson, \nCraig, Kempthorne, Bingaman, Reid, and Lieberman. The National \nCoalition for Advanced Manufacturing, or NACFAM, endorsed our actions \nwith S. 1874, describing it as ``a crucial step in reducing barriers to \ncooperation between the national laboratories and private industry, \nhigher education institutions, non-profit entities, and state and local \ngovernments.'' NACFAM also noted that this ``bill supports our shared \nconviction that collaborative R will further strengthen America's \nproductivity growth and national security.''\n  Today I introduce, with Senator Bingaman as a co-sponsor, language \nfor amendment of the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal \nYear 1999 that accomplishes almost the same goals as S. 1874. This \nAmendment was developed through consultation with several of the co-\nsponsors, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the Senate \nCommittee on Armed Services, and the Department of Energy.\n  This Amendment removes barriers to more effective utilization of all \nof the Department's contractor-operated facilities by industry, other \nfederal agencies and universities. The Amendment covers all the \nDepartment's contractor-operated facilities--national laboratories and \ntheir other sites like Kansas City, Pantex, Hanford, Savannah River, or \nthe Nevada Test Site.\n\n  This Amendment also provides important encouragement to the \ncontractor-operated sites to increase their partnerships and other \ninteractions with universities and companies. And finally, it creates \nopportunities for small businesses to benefit from the technical \nresources available at all of the Department's contractor-operated \nfacilities.\n  This Amendment supplements the authority of the Atomic Energy Act, \nwhich limited the areas wherein the Department's facilities could \nprovide research and other services, not in competition with the \nprivate sector, to only those mission areas undertaken in the earliest \ndays of the AEC. My Amendment recognizes that the Department's \nresponsibilities are far broader than the original AEC, and that all \nparts of the Department should be available to help on a contract basis \nwherever capabilities are not available from private industry.\n  One barrier at the Department to contract research involves charges \nadded by the Department to the cost of work accomplished by a site. At \nsome laboratories, these charges now range up to 25%. This Amendment \nrequires that charges to customers for research and other services at \nthese facilities be fully recovered, and sharply limits addition of \nextra charges by the Department to only 3%. The Amendment further \nrequires waiver of these extra charges for small business and non-\nprofit entities and provides a process for the Secretary of Energy to \ncontinue any pre-existing waivers.\n  The Amendment creates a five-year pilot program for external \ncustomers that enables facilities to examine their overhead rates and \ndetermine if an alternative lower rate serves to cover services \nactually used by these customers. For example, where companies or \nuniversities do not require secure facilities or do not utilize the \nextensive special nuclear material capabilities of the laboratories, \nthen the customer will be charged an overhead rate that excludes \nsecurity costs and environmental legacy costs. This pilot program will \nenable the Department and facilities to evaluate the impact of these \nlower overhead rates for one important class of external customers. The \nDepartment is required to report in 2003 on the interim results of this \nPilot and to provide recommendations on possibly continuing this Pilot \nand even extending it to include other federal customers.\n  The Amendment provides direct encouragement for expansion of \npartnerships and interactions with companies and universities by \nrequiring that each facility be annually judged for success in \nexpanding these interactions in ways that support each facility's \nmissions. The Amendment requires that the external partnership and \ninteraction program be considered in evaluating the annual contract \nperformance at each site.\n  And finally, the Amendment sets up a new Small Business Partnership \nProgram in which all of the Department sites participate. This action \nwill enable small businesses across the United States to better access \nand partner with any of the Department's contractor-owned facilities. A \nfund for such interactions up to 0.25 percent of the total site budget \nis available for these small business interactions.\n  With these changes, Mr. President, the Department of Energy \nfacilities will be better able to meet their critical national \nmissions, while at the same time assisting other federal agencies, \nlarge and small businesses, and universities in better meeting their \ngoals and missions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of this \namendment. I cosponsored the bill on which it is based, S. 1874, with \nSenator Domenici and our offices have worked closely together with the \nAdministration and with the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \nto get this amendment cleared. I believe that the amendment \naccomplishes several important objectives. It clarifies the ability of \nthe Department to engage in mutually beneficial research and \ndevelopment interactions with external partners. It reduces red tape \nassociated with these interactions. It encourages DOE facilities to \ncooperate with small businesses. These are all steps that strengthen \nDOE's research capabilities at all its facilities and increase the \ncontribution that the Department can make to our national research and \ninnovation system. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3023\n\n     (Purpose: Relating to Department of Defense aviation accident \n                            investigations)\n\n     SEC. 908. MILITARY AVIATION ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In February 1996, the GAO released a report \n     highlighting a 75% reduction in aviation\n\n[[Page S7139]]\n\n     Class A mishaps, a 70% reduction in aviation mishap \n     fatalities and a 65% reduction in Class A mishap rates from \n     1975-1995 (Military Aircraft Safety--Significant Improvements \n     since 1975).\n       (2) In February 1998, the GAO completed a follow-up review \n     of military aircraft safety, noting that the military \n     experienced fewer serious aviation mishaps in fiscal years \n     1996 and 1997 than in previous fiscal years (Military \n     Aircraft Safety: Serious Accidents Remain at Historically Low \n     Levels).\n       (3) The report required by section 1046 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (Public Law \n     105-85; 111 Stat. 1888) concluded, ``DoD found no evidence \n     that changing existing investigation processes to more \n     closely resemble those of the NTSB would help DoD to find \n     more answers more quickly, or accurately.''\n       (4) The Department of Defense must further improve its \n     aviation safety by fully examining all options for improving \n     or replacing its current aviation accident investigation \n     processes.\n       (5) The inter-service working group formed as a result of \n     that report has contributed to progress in military aviation \n     accident investigations by identifying ways to improve family \n     assistance, as has the formal policy direction coordinated by \n     the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n       (6) Such progress includes the issuance of Air Force \n     Instruction 90-701 entitled ``Assistance to Families of \n     Persons Involved in Air Force Aviation Mishaps,'' that \n     attempts to meet the need for a more timely flow of relevant \n     information to families, a family liaison officer, and the \n     establishment of the Air Force Office of Family Assistance. \n     However, formal policy directions and Air Force instructions \n     have not adequately addressed the failure to provide primary \n     next of kin of members of the Armed Forces involved in \n     military aviation accidents with interim reports regarding \n     the course of investigations into such accidents, and the \n     Department of Defense must improve its procedures for \n     informing the families of the persons involved in military \n     aviation mishaps.\n       (7) The report referred to in paragraph (3) concluded that \n     the Department would ``benefit from the disappearance of the \n     misperception that the privileged portion of the safety \n     investigation exists to hide unfavorable information''.\n       (8) That report further specified that ``[e]ach Military \n     Department has procedures in place to provide redacted copies \n     of the final [privileged] safety report to the families. \n     However, families must formally request a copy of the final \n     safety investigation report''.\n       (9) Current efforts to improve family notification would be \n     enhanced by the issuance by the Secretary of Defense of \n     uniform regulations to improve the timeliness and reliability \n     of information provided to the primary next of kin of persons \n     involved in military aviation accidents during and following \n     both the legal investigation and safety investigation phases \n     of such investigations.\n       (b) Evaluation of Department of Defense Aviation Accident \n     Investigation Procedures.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall \n     establish a task force to--\n       (A) review the procedures employed by the Department of \n     Defense to conduct military aviation accident investigations; \n     and\n       (B) identify mechanisms for improving such investigations \n     and the military aviation accident investigation process.\n       (2) The Secretary shall appoint to the task force the \n     following:\n       (A) An appropriate number of members of the Armed Forces, \n     including both members of the regular components and the \n     reserve components, who have experience relating to military \n     aviation or investigations into military aviation accidents.\n       (B) An appropriate number of former members of the Armed \n     Forces who have such experience.\n       (C) With the concurrence of the member concerned, a member \n     of the National Transportation Safety Board.\n       (3)(A) The task force shall submit to Congress an interim \n     report and a final report on its activities under this \n     subsection. The interim report shall be submitted on December \n     1, 1998, and the final report shall be submitted on March 31, \n     1999.\n       (B) Each report under subparagraph (A) shall include the \n     following:\n       (i) An assessment of the advisability of conducting all \n     military aviation accident investigations through an entity \n     that is independent of the military departments.\n       (ii) An assessment of the effectiveness of the current \n     military aviation accident investigation process in \n     identifying the cause of military aviation accidents and \n     correcting problems so identified in a timely manner.\n       (iii) An assessment whether or not the procedures for \n     sharing the results of military aviation accident \n     investigations among the military departments should be \n     improved.\n       (iv) An assessment of the advisability of centralized \n     training and instruction for military aircraft investigators.\n       (v) An assessment of any costs or cost avoidances that \n     would result from the elimination of any overlap in military \n     aviation accident investigation activities conducted under \n     the current so-called ``two track'' investigation process.\n       (vi) Any improvements or modifications in the current \n     military aviation accident investigation process that the \n     task force considers appropriate to reduce the potential for \n     aviation accidents and increase public confidence in the \n     process.\n       (C) Uniform regulations for release of interim safety \n     investigation reports.--(1)(A) Not later than May 1, 1999, \n     the Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations that \n     provide for the release to the family members of persons \n     involved in military aviation accidents, and to members of \n     the public, of reports referred to in paragraph (2).\n       (B) The regulations shall apply uniformly to each military \n     department.\n       (2) A report under paragraph (1) is a report on the \n     findings of any ongoing privileged safety investigation into \n     an accident referred to in that paragraph. Such report shall \n     be in a redacted form or other form appropriate to preserve \n     witness confidentiality and to minimize the effects of the \n     release of information in such report on national security.\n       (3) Reports under paragraph (1) shall be made available--\n       (A) in the case of family members, at least once every 30 \n     days or upon the development of a new or significantly \n     changed finding during the course of the investigation \n     concerned; and\n       (B) in the case of members of the public, on request.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, for nearly two years, my home state has \nsuffered through an agonizing process, trying to find out what happened \naboard King-56, an Air Force Reserves C-130 that crashed off of the \nCalifornia coast, killing 10 of the 11 Oregon airmen on board in \nNovember, 1996. The families of those victims have worked tirelessly to \nfind out the truth, both for their own peace-of-mind and so that \ncorrections could be made, if necessary, to protect other American \nservicepeople. It should not have been nearly as hard as it has been to \nget this information.\n  Drawing from this experience, my Oregon colleague Senator Smith and I \nhave joined together to put forward this proposal to try to change the \nprocedures that the Air Force uses for investigating crashes of this \nsort, so that others will be spared the suffering that Oregonians have \nhad to ensure.\n  At the outset, let me acknowledge the hard work of the Air Force \nsince reopening the King-56 investigation late last year. For many \nmonths now, a Broad Area Review, or simply BAR, to use the military \nacronym, has been both investigating the cause of the King-56 crash and \nthe safety of the entire C-130 fleet. The BAR, after thoroughly re-\nchecking all available material, and having the help of an experienced \nNTSB crash investigator, was able to narrow down the list of possible \ncauses of the crash to about two dozen, and determined that the only \nway to pinpoint the cause would be to recover additional King-56 \nwreckage. The Air Force candidly admitted that they were mistaken not \nto have collected all the wreckage in the first place, and that they \nwould do everything they could this time to get it right. They are out \nin the ocean right now trying to salvage everything they can. I know \nthat the families are eagerly awaiting the results of the new salvage \noperation, and, hopefully, the Air Force will soon learn the exact \ncause of the crash, and give the families some sense of closure.\n  Finding the exact cause of the King-56 crash has another, very \nimportant purpose. Crews flying other C-130's have frequently reported \nproblems similar to what the Oregon reservists encountered on their \nairplanes. The BAR has been able to apply the lessons learned from the \nKing-56 crash to the entire fleet. For example, a major problem the BAR \nturned up was the near total inconsistency in emergency procedures \nmanuals issued to crews. The Air Force identified this problem, \nstandardized and rewrote the manuals, and issued them to all C-130 \ncrews.\n  And thank goodness they did. Because earlier this year a C-130 took \noff from McChord Air Force Base in Washington state and experienced an \nengine problem known as ``four-engine rollback,'' or loss of power to \nthe engines. The C-130 that went down off the California coast also had \nsimultaneous failure of all four engines. In that instance the \nemergency manual listed as an option ditching the plane in the ocean, \nwhich turned out to be a tragic error, and only one crewman survived. \nHowever, the C-130 that took off from McChord had a newly revised \nemergency manual on board written after the BAR review. They were able \nto bring their plane under control and land it safely. So I am pleased \nthe Air Force found and fixed such problems, making these planes safer.\n  Although this is welcome progress, nagging questions keep coming to\n\n[[Page S7140]]\n\nmind. Why did the original investigation not make as much progress in \nfinding the cause of the accident? Why did the Air Force turn up the \nnumerous flaws and problems in safety procedures in the C-130 fleet \nonly after two Senators stepped in to get them to conduct a more \nthorough review? The plain fact is that the problems with the original \ninvestigation were not an isolated incident. The failure of the \noriginal investigation was a symptom of the shortcomings of current \ninvestigation procedures and guidelines in general.\n  We need an aviation accident investigation process that would have \ngotten it right the first time around. Reports indicate that Pentagon \ncrash investigators are undertrained and under funded. I question \nwhether the current system of conducting two separate investigations, \none public, the other secret, is the best system possible for finding \nthe causes of accidents and applying the lessons learned.\n  So what the Wyden/Smith amendment does is simple and straightforward. \nIt establishes a Pentagon task force to review procedures the \nDepartment of Defense employs to conduct aircraft accident \ninvestigations and to develop solutions for improving the overall \nprocess. I give the Pentagon credit for their renewed diligence on the \nKing-56 investigation and their review of the C-130 fleet. It is my \nhope--and expectation--that they apply this diligence to coming up with \nways to improve the overall process, and make the planes our men and \nwomen in uniform fly every day safer.\n  Our amendment also touches on how families are notified of such \nterrible accidents and of the care and support they receive. The reason \nthe Oregon families first came to Senator Smith and me was because, \nafter losing their loved ones, the Air Force treated them miserably, \nthere's no better way to put it. Not only did the Air Force not provide \nthe families with the support, guidance, and comfort that they \ndeserved, but they refused to provide the answer that would have surely \nbeen at the top of any of our minds had we lost a loved one: how could \nthis possibly have happened? Their treatment was far inferior to the \nway Congress recently mandated families be treated in civilian aviation \naccidents.\n  What the families of King-56 got was a totally inconclusive \ninvestigation report. When they wanted more information, especially \nwhat was contained in the separate, secret safety report, the Air Force \nrefused outright. Senator Smith and I tried to help them obtain the \nanswers they needed, but we, too, were met with more stonewalling. \nAfter we brought significant pressure to bear, the Air Force decided to \nreopen the probe. Since then they have done a better job of keeping the \nfamilies fully informed of the progress of their investigation.\n  The King-56 episode turned up a number of basic problems with the way \nthe Pentagon notifies families in such terrible cases. Working closely \nwith the families, Senator Smith and I passed amendments to last year's \ndefense bill that have led to improvements in family notification \nprocedures. For example, earlier this year the Air Force issued \ninstructions to improve the flow of information to families, to enhance \nthe role of family liaison officers, and to establish an Office of \nFamily Assistance. DoD efforts to improve family notification are still \nongoing, and I intend to watch their progress closely in case further \naction is needed in Congress.\n  Although I welcome this progress, one basic issue has been left out \nof the mix, namely, the problem of providing families with maximum \ninformation not only after an investigation has been concluded, but, \nmore importantly, while the investigation is taking place in the weeks \nand months after an accident. The Air Force has proposed to do a better \njob of informing families about how investigations are conducted and \neven why they can't have any information immediately. While attempts to \nprovide better information are helpful, current efforts just don't get \nat one of the biggest headaches the Oregon families encountered: \nknowing what the investigators know.\n  The Wyden/Smith amendment, in addition to requiring DoD to come up \nwith improvements in accident investigations, gets at this problem. We \nrequire the Pentagon to provide next of kin with regular and timely \ninterim reports on the progress of both legal and safety \ninvestigations, providing them with the best possible information \nduring what must be a most agonizing ordeal. Better information about \nongoing investigations is just one part of what families need, and it \nis my hope that future families will not have to endure what the Oregon \nfamilies were forced to. Again, I think the DoD learned its lesson \nabout how to treat families, especially after the DoD Inspector General \nscrutinized it as a result of our amendment last year, and they are \nactively working on solutions. But the specific need for interim \nreports needs to be addressed as well.\n  I'd like to thank the Air Force again for their diligence in \nreopening the King-56 crash investigation and helping the families \nreach closure on this terrible episode. I am pleased by the progress \nthe Pentagon has made in improving C-130 fleet safety, and by the \nmeasures they've taken to treat families better in the future. It's \ntime to apply the lessons learned from King-56 to all accident \ninvestigations, and I look forward to working with the Pentagon in the \nfuture to make sure our men and women in uniform fly the safest \nairplanes possible, and that their families receive the best possible \ncare and attention, in good times as well as the bad.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague \nfrom Oregon in offering this amendment to the Department of Defense \nAuthorization Bill on the handling of Department of Defense aviation \naccident investigations. In November 1996, 10 Portland-based Air Force \nreservists were killed in a mysterious C-130 King-56 plane crash. For \nnearly 2 years, Senator Wyden and I have been working with the Air \nForce and the families in order to find an explanation for how this \ntragic accident occurred. We have learned more since asking that the \nAir Force renew its investigation, and we are confident that we will \nsoon know the cause of this accident. I wish to thank the Air Force for \nreopening its investigation and for its subsequent efforts. We owed \nthat to the families of these Air Force reservists, that their widows \nand children be given the information needed for understanding.\n  I am pleased to have joined my colleague from Oregon in seeking \nanswers for these families still struggling with their losses and \nensuring greater responsiveness to the families of our military \npersonnel in the future. This Wyden/Smith amendment will create a task \nforce to review aviation accident investigations and identify areas for \nimprovement. I will also ensure that families be provided with regular \nreports regarding ongoing investigations.\n  My thoughts continue to be with the families of the victims from the \nC-130 accident in November. I thank them for bringing this to our \nattention and I commend them on their patience and strength. I also \nthank my Oregon colleague, Senator Wyden, for his leadership on this \nissue. I appreciate the efforts of Air Force officials and look forward \nto working with them in the future to protect our service members and \ntheir families.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3024\n\n(Purpose: To amend Title 5, United States Code, to enable the Secretary \n  of Energy to set a maximum age at which new couriers may enter the \n Department of Energy's nuclear materials courier force and to provide \n   early retirement programs for the Department's nuclear materials \n                               couriers)\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n       Section 1.

Mr. President, the defense authorization bill is one of \nthe most important pieces of legislation we consider each year and by \nfar the largest annual authorization bill. Even though the bill's \noverall numbers are huge by comparison to most others, the Department \nof Defense is being forced to make difficult spending decisions and \ncurtail its program requests for future years in order to live within a \nbudget that has shrunk in real terms. I recognize that this is a \ndifficult challenge.\n  However, I feel compelled to bring to my colleagues attention a \nmatter of great concern to me--funding for the National Guard. The \nDepartment of Defense has not given sufficient attention or resources \nto this important component of our national defense. We all understand \nthe importance of the Active Duty forces, and support for the active \ncomponent must be strong. However, this must not come at the expense of \nan equally important component--the National Guard. I need not belabor \nthe virtues of the National Guard for most of my colleagues. They are \nfamiliar with the cost savings that come from assigning duties to the \nNational Guard. Senators also appreciate the critically important role \nthe Guard plays in times of emergency in our own States. And most \nMembers of Congress understand the intangible political benefits that \ncome from having citizen soldiers and from maintaining a force that is \nintertwined with the fabric of daily life in every state to a much \ngreater degree than the active component. The National Guard and \nReserves are the face of the US military for many Americans, yet they \ncontinue to get second billing when it comes to the distribution of \nresources.\n  In particular, I am concerned about the unintended consequences of \nNational Guard Bureau formulas for distributing manpower and resources \namong the various Guard units. The current system gives priority to top \ntier units, which would seem to make sense at first glance, as those \nare the ones maintained at the highest readiness levels. However, the \nfunding allocated to each unit then comes together somewhat randomly to \nform the mosaic of each State's National Guard and Reserve forces \noverall funding. Distortions sometimes creep in that cannot be \ncorrected at the State level. I have found this to be true in the \ntechnician end strength levels projected for my State's National Guard \nfor the coming years. A steady drop over the past few years combined \nwith a projected cut of 15 percent next year would put the Vermont \nGuard in a very difficult position. It is quite possible that the \nresources coming to Vermont in the near future to support its essential \noperations will fall well below the acceptable level, and below what I \nbelieve even the National Guard Bureau would recognize as appropriate. \nThe Vermont Guard has performed exceedingly well, winning national \nrecognition in some instances, even though most of its units have been \nresourced at only 55 percent. But with projected cuts to 35 percent, \nfor a drop of 20 percent over three years, I worry that Vermont will \nhave to make cuts in its core program, like closing armories.\n  Mr. President, each State's National Guard is a unique compilation of \nduties and responsibilities, all deemed critical to our national \ndefense. No State's mission should be slighted because the formulas \ndon't allow for an overall assessment of the aggregate funding level \nand an opportunity to correct shortfalls that are deemed unreasonably \nharsh for any one State. I can only assume that a few other States' \nNational Guards are suffering in much the same manner as Vermont is.\n  The Armed Services Committee has been helpful to Senator Leahy and me \nin our efforts to address this problem. We offer this amendment to \ndirect the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to examine the process of \nresource distribution and, in particular, to evaluate the effects of \nthese allocations upon each State's ability to carry out its missions. \nThis report should also shed light on the aggregate effects of the \ncurrent formulas for determining allocation and distribution of full-\ntime manning strengths. I trust that this report will clarify the exact \nnature of this problem and allow the Pentagon and Congress to address \nit directly next year.\n  We have agreed not to specify minimum end strength levels for \nmilitary technicians, but we trust that the Committee will make every \neffort to recede in conference to the minimum end strength levels \nendorsed by the House of Representatives in its authorization \nlegislation.\n  I appreciate the support the Committee has given us in this effort \nand I urge my colleagues' endorsement of this amendment.\n\n[[Page S7142]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment with my \ncolleague and friend from Vermont, Senator Jeffords. Recently, I was \ndismayed to learn that the Vermont Army National Guard is programmed to \nreceive yet another cut in its full-time manning. nearly all of us take \npride in supporting our state National Guard units. The Guard is a \ncritical state asset when we experience natural disasters and other \nstate emergencies. The Guard offers professional opportunities and \neducation for our young constituents. Perhaps most importantly, the \nGuard is available in case our nation ever finds itself at war. Fully \n58% of our Army's combat forces are located in the National Guard, and \nan Army Guard combat unit can do the same job as its active duty \ncounterpart for less than half the cost. But all these benefits are \nwasted if we do not provide enough resources for our Guard to train, \nand enough full-time personnel so that our Guardsmen can take full \nadvantage of the limited time they spend in uniform.\n  For many years now, the Army has been giving some Guard units more \nresources than others. The allocation model that the Army uses is based \non which units would be called to fight first. That is fine in \nprinciple, but in practice the resources that have been given to lower \npriority units have been insufficient. For example, in recent years the \nVermont Guard's 86th Brigade has been receiving about 55% of its full \ntime manning requirements. These are the men and women who prepare for \neach month's drill weekend, maintain and fix equipment, recruit new \nsoldiers from the community, and do all the other tasks that need to be \ndone during the month. Higher priority Guard units have been receiving \n70 to 75 percent of their full time manning requirements. Although 55 \npercent was not sufficient, it has been enough for the 86th brigade. \nThey recently were noted for the fact that they qualified one of their \ntank battalions on the regular Army's tough Tank Table 12 live-fire \ntest. The Vermonters were only the second unit in the country to \nachieve this honor, the first being an enhanced unit from Idaho.\n  That is why I was so disturbed that the Army was set to cut Vermont's \nfull-time support down to between 30 and 34 percent, according to a \nletter I received from Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army Jayson \nSpiegal on March 3 of this year. At that level of funding, I have been \ntold that Vermont would have to close some of its armories because it \nwould not have enough funds to keep two soldiers in each armory. Of \ncourse, I am worried about my own state, which has one of the oldest \nmilitia traditions dating back to Benedict Arnold's Green Mountain Boys \nof Revolutionary War fame. But there are eight other National Guard \ncombat divisions spread across the country, and I want to inform my \ncolleagues that each of those units is in danger of suffering a death \nof a thousand cuts by a lack of resources.\n  The Chairman and Ranking Member of the Armed Services Committee have \naccepted this amendment from Senator Jeffords and myself which requires \nthat the Head of the Guard Bureau provide a report to the four defense \ncommittees of Congress to ensure that states with a large number of \nlower-priority National Guard units are not being disproportionately \nimpacted by full-time manning reductions.\n  Mr. President, I want to close by thanking Senator Thurmond and \nSenator Levin for accommodating me and my colleague from Vermont on \nthis amendment. Their expertise and hard work for our nation's defenses \nare appreciated by all of us in this body.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3026\n\n (Purpose: To provide health benefits for abused dependents of members \n                          of the armed forces)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n       Paragraph (1) of section 1076(e) of Title 10, United States \n     Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       (1) The administering Secretary shall furnish an abused \n     dependent of a former member of a uniformed service described \n     in paragraph (4), during that period that the abused \n     dependent is in receipt of transitional compensation under \n     section 1059 of this title, with medical and dental care, \n     including mental health services, in facilities of the \n     uniformed services in accordance with the same eligibility \n     and benefits as were applicable for that abused dependent \n     during the period of active service of the former member.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President today I am introducing an amendment that \nwill show the heart and hands of our government in caring for the \nvictims of domestic violence in the military.\n  My amendment is simple: it will provide health benefits for abused \ndependents of members of the armed forces, who are currently receiving \ntransitional compensation due to their batterer's discharge or court \nmartial for abuse. These health benefits include medical, dental, and \nmental health care at armed forces facilities. Victims, battered women \nand abused children, would be entitled to health benefits for as long \nas they received transitional compensation, which is a maximum of three \nyears. The financial expense would be negligible; but the increased \ncare, safety and dignity given to our military dependents who are \nvictims of abuse would be huge.\n  Domestic violence is one of the most serious issues we face. It knows \nno borders. Neither economic status, geography, or race shields someone \nfrom domestic violence. It is happening to women in your families, your \nneighborhoods, and in your place of work and worship. Most distressing, \nit is happening at an alarming rate in military families.\n  Battering is the one of the single greatest causes of injury to \nwomen. According to Department of Justice statistics, of the 1.4 \nmillion hospital emergency room admissions in 1994, about one quarter \nwere treated for injuries from domestic violence.\n  Among civilians, the DoJ has estimated that, on average each year, \nfrom 1992-1996, about 8 in 1000 women . . . age 12 or older experienced \na violent victimization by a spouse or boyfriend.\n  The numbers for domestic violence victims in the military are deeply \ndisturbing and much bigger. Department of Defense data indicates 17.8 \nto 19.0 women per 1000 for substantiated reports of abuse during the \nsame period. Substantiated reports of abuse are those confirmed by a \nmilitary review panel.\n  Many battered women and their children in the military do not come \nforward because they fear they will be destitute or lose key benefits \nif their spouses are discharged or court-martialed on the grounds of \nabuse. This amendment reduces the disincentives of victims to come \nforward about the violence in their homes. It allows dependent family \nmembers in the military to get the health services they need, so that \nthey can escape their abusers and move toward independence.\n  There have been cases brought to my attention where military \ndependents could have benefited from this legislation, and we know, \nthat sadly, there are many more such stories throughout the military.\n  Annette is the former wife of a Navy Chief Petty Officer and mother \nof two young children. She was routinely beaten by him from June 1994 \nthrough 1996. Military protective orders and civilian restraining \norders failed to protect her and her children. Her ex-husband was \ncharged with twenty-one offenses by the United States Navy, including \neight assault charge involving Annette. He was ultimately court-\nmartialed.\n  Due to domestic violence, Annette has been declared ninety percent \ndisabled by doctors and therapists. She suffers from severe skeletal \nand muscular damage to her back from an attempted rape by her husband; \ndebilitating migraines due to nerve damage; dental problems as a result \nof her teeth being knocked out; and post traumatic stress disorder. \nThese are just a few of her challenges while attempting to raise two \nchildren. She is receiving transitional compensation, but has had no \nhealth benefits. She has several thousands of dollars in unpaid medical \nbills.\n  We need to ensure that military wives and dependents like Annette get \nthe health services they need and deserve to care for their children \nand to heal. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3027\n\n              (Purpose: To eliminate secret Senate holds)\n\n       On page ____, after line ____, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. ELIMINATING SECRET SENATE HOLDS.\n\n       (a) Standing Order.--It is a standing order of the Senate \n     that a Senator who provides\n\n[[Page S7143]]\n\n     notice to leadership of his or her intention to object to \n     proceeding to a motion or matter shall disclose the objection \n     or hold in the Congressional Record not later than 2 session \n     days after the date of the notice.\n       (b) Rulemaking.--This section is adopted--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and as such it is deemed a part of the rules of the Senate \n     and it supersedes other rules only to the extent that it is \n     inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     the Senate to change its rules at any time, in the same \n     manner, and to the same extent as in the case of any other \n     rule of the Senate.\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, fewer than 50 legislative days \nremain in the session. Dozens of nominations are pending and more than \n400 items are on the calender. Being an election year, this is a recipe \nfor an explosion of an extraordinarily powerful Senate practice. . . \nthe use of secret holds.\n  On Monday evening, Senator Grassley and I came to the floor to put \nmembers on notice that we would be offering the same amendment we \noffered last year on anonymous holds. We discussed the Century-old \nSenate tradition of members being granted the courtesy of ``holding'' a \ndebate until they are available to participate. We believe this \nvenerable Senate practice should continue. As a public institution, \nhowever, we believe the use of holds should occur in the full light of \nday. We believe in the not-so-radical notion that the public's business \nshould be done in public.\n  The amendment we are offering is identical to an amendment that the \nSenate adopted last Fall. The amendment would eliminate the secrecy of \nthe Senate's holds procedure. It would simply require that any Senator \nwho notifies leadership of an intent to object to a motion to proceed \nmake that objection public within 48 hours.\n  Last fall, the Senate adopted an identical amendment by voice vote. \nNo Senator spoke out against it. We had discussed this idea for more \nthan a year. But in the closing hours of the last session, our \namendment was dropped from the D.C. Appropriations bill. At that time I \nvowed to stay at it until it's done.\n  Today, as time is running out on the session, we are sure to face the \nsame situation again of a proliferation of anonymous holds. They will \nthreaten the Senate with legislative gridlock. When the Senate dropped \nour amendment last Fall, there were at least 42 holds in play, and even \nthe Minority Leader had to admit to reporters that he didn't know who \nhad placed them. ``If you don't have hold, you ought to feel \nlonesome,'' Senator Daschle said.\n  Over the past eight months, we have been working in a bipartisan \nmanner to lift the secrecy that so often surrounds the use of holds. We \nhave worked with the Leader's Bipartisan Task Force on Senate Reform. \nIn February, nine Senators joined Senator Grassley and me in a \nbipartisan letter to the Senate leadership asking that they work with \nus to change the Standing Orders of the Senate to eliminate anonymous \nholds. We made it clear we are not out to scrap the Senate's holds \nprocedure, but to scrap the secrecy surrounding it.\n  In May, the Bipartisan Task Force on Senate Reform, chaired by \nSenator Bennett, reviewed this idea and discussed it with the floor \nstaff of both parties. The members expressed great interest in it, but \nit was clear from our discussions that certain members in key positions \nwould not look favorably on the task force moving forward with the \nidea.\n  The right of every member of this body to prevent debate on a motion \nor bill is a very powerful tool. But this right can be found nowhere in \nthe Constitution, nowhere in our Federal statutes and nowhere in the \nSenate's rules. In fact, it is not a Senate rule or standing order. It \nis not a right. It is a practice, or a custom that we have come to view \nas a right.\n  Let me be clear: our amendment does not challenge or affect in any \nway the ability of each Senator to place a hold. Our amendment would \npreserve that ability. What we are challenging is the way in which \nSenators use this extraordinary power. Such extraordinary power should \nbe exercised in public.\n  The use of secret holds leads to a curious game of procedural ``hide \nand seek.'' Senator A, for example, blocks Senator B's bill with a \nhold, so B sets off to buttonhole all 99 other Senators, trying to find \nout who is responsible. If the Senator does find out, it is possible B \nwill place a hold on A's bills in retaliation. Sometimes it becomes \neven more complex, with ``revolving holds,'' where the group of \nobjecting Senators simply rotates the hold, always one step ahead of \nthe Senator chasing down the hold to try to move a bill. Another \nsession should not become bogged down with burdensome, anonymous holds.\n  The Senate is a public institution. Our offices are open to the \npublic, we conduct our hearings in public, our debate takes place in \npublic and each time we answer the roll call, everyone knows how each \nSenator voted. But many of our holds are not public. We believe the \npublic's business should be conducted in public.\n  At a time when the American people are increasingly cynical and \nskeptical about government, there should no longer be any room for the \nkind of closed-door dealings represented by the secret hold. The secret \nhold cheapens the currency of democracy. We should open the door on \nthis closet filibuster.\n  Mr. President, our amendment provides that every Senator may continue \nto place a hold on a measure or matter, and simply requires that the \nSenator announce the hold publicly within 48 hours. Our amendment \nenables the Senate both to maintain its proud traditions and to have \nopenness and accountability.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support \nthe Wyden-Grassle amendment banning secret holds. My colleagues should \nbe aware of our efforts by now, but in case they are not, this is what \nwe are trying to do. My good friend from Oregon and I are offering \nlanguage that would require any Senator who wishes to place a hold on \nlegislation or a nomination must notify the Senate and the American \npeople of his or her action.\n  This can be done either through the Congressional Record or a \nstatement on the floor. I want my colleagues to understand: This \namendment does not, I repeat, does not ban holds. With our proposal, \nSenators can continue to place a hold on any legislation they wish. Our \namendment simply requires that they be open about it.\n  I firmly believe this amendment will improve the daily workings of \nthe Senate. First, it will make the Senate more accountable.\n  Too many Americans think that we in Congress don't take \nresponsibility for what we do. This amendment will give Americans \ngreater peace of mind that their public servants are responsible and \naccountable. And we cannot function effectively if we do not have the \nbasic trust of the people we work for--our constituents.\n  I know in my own experience I have had to spend valuable time trying \nto find out who had put a hold on legislation of mine. Tracking down a \nhold is a tremendous waste of time and effort.\n  If someone has put a hold on one of my bills, under this proposal I \ncan immediately go to that Senator and talk about his or her concerns \nand see if we can work things out. When we engage in reasoned debate \nand give and take on issues is when this body serves the best interests \nof the American people most effectively. I believe open holds will do \nmuch to facilitate this.\n  Members may think they could face retribution if they declare a hold.\n  However, Senator Wyden and I have both practiced open holds, and I \ncan tell my colleagues that there is no reason for them to fear \nretribution or reprisal. I have never faced any repercussions from \nstating my intention to place a hold and I would imagine Senator Wyden \nwould say the same.\n  Senators need to know that voting against this amendment will not \nmake it go away, because Senator Wyden and I intend to pursue this \nreform until we succeed. And I know we will succeed because this is the \nright thing to do.\n  It is right to be open with the American people and it is right to be \nopen with your fellow Senators. It is time we made this reform because \nthe secrecy surrounding holds is not required by Senate rules or the \nConstitution or any other instrument of Government that I know of and \nit has been allowed to go on much too long. Our proposal is simple, \nreasonable and fair. I know there are some who say we need to study \nthis issue a little longer. I reject that notion. This is not a \ncomplicated change we are proposing.\n  In closing, I just want to urge my fellow Senators again as \nemphatically as I can to support this amendment. I\n\n[[Page S7144]]\n\nhave heard many of my colleagues express to me and to Senator Wyden \nthat they believe this reform is necessary. Now those of us who support \nopenness and accountability in government have an opportunity to act on \nthose convictions. I urge a yes vote on the Wyden-Grassley open holds \namendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3028\n\n (Purpose: To provide $5,000,000 for research, development, test, and \n        evaluation for the Low Cost Launch Development Program)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 219 LOW COST LAUNCH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM\n\n       (a) Amount From Air Force Funding--Of the total amount \n     authorized to be appropriated under section 201(3), \n     $5,000,000 is available for the Low Cost Launch Development \n     Program.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to provide \n$5 million for programs that will radically reduce space launch costs. \nI understand that this amendment has been accepted by the Chairman and \nRanking Member, and I thank them for their cooperation in this regard.\n  This amendment will provide support for further development of robust \nand cost-effective launch vehicles. One such program, the Scorpius Low \nCost Launch Development Program, has met development goals on or under \nbudget in every instance. Delays in the program have been a result of \nbureaucratic delays, rather than technical problems. This is a solid \nprogram, and it deserves our full support.\n  In addition to a need for the U.S. to regain a competitive position \nin the international market for space launch, critical national \nsecurity concerns can be addressed by reducing these costs.\n  Achieving reduced launch costs is clearly in the national interest. \nFrom 1993 through 1997, the United States spent roughly $11 billion for \nunmanned space launches--well over $2 billion annually. Due to these \nunnecessary and exorbitant costs, we have lost the commercial space \nlaunch industry, which America pioneered, to overseas competitors.\n  Moreover, the excessive costs of space launch in this country have \ninduced current and past Presidents to allow satellite launches from \nChina, Russia and France. It currently costs $10,000 to $12,000 a pound \nto launch a payload using U.S. rockets. In contrast, China charges \n$4,000 to $5,000 per pound. Thus, satellite companies can save up to \n$50 million by using foreign source to put their satellites into orbit.\n  There is a further national security objective that demand cheaper \nspace launch capability. Command and control elements of our military \nforce increasingly rely on digital and satellite communications \ncapability. These communications capabilities and global positioning \nsystems require sufficient satellites for effective implementation. The \nU.S. can either pay exorbitant amounts to attain adequate \ncommunications capabilities or we can support low-cost launch programs \nnow that will radically reduce the costs incurred later.\n  I have been following closely the progress of Microcosm, a small \nCalifornia company, and its Scorpius program. This is an effort to \nlower space launch cost from the current level of over $7,000 per pound \nto low Earth orbit to under $1,000 per pound. If successful, the \ncurrent launch cost for a 15,000 pound military communications \nsatellite would drop from over $75 million to less than $15 million. \nThe over $2 billion per year U.S. cost would drop to less than $255 \nmillion per year--for the same level of effort.\n  The design of these systems is robust with a margin of two-to-one \ncompared to current rockets with a near one-to-four factor, almost \nnothing. Its launch crew is comprised of 12 technicians, not the \ncurrent hundreds, even thousands of engineers needed today. Those same \n12 technicians, when not actually firing the rocket, would be \nassembling them. It is truly a simple design.\n  Scorpius would be a bona fide ``launch on demand'' vehicle, able to \nlift off within 8 hours after the payload arrives at the launch site. \nIts short, squat design, though less elegant than present rockets, \nmakes it oblivious to weather limitations, such as high wind. It would \nnot require the extensive launch infrastructure, such as gantry, \nproviding great flexibility of where it could be fixed. If desirable, \nScorpius could even be sea-launched. Our military field commanders \nwould be able to request and receive the satellite resources they need \nwhen and where they need them.\n\n  Microcosm has already received 12 SBIR contracts for Scorpius \ntotaling roughly $4 million. All SBIR contracts were awarded \ncompetitively. In Fiscal year 1997, Congress specifically funded \nScorpius with the program receiving $7.5 million; in Fiscal Year 1998, \nCongress again specified Scorpius funding, this time at $10 million. \nThe results have been impressive:\n  19 5,000 pound thrust engines built, each at a cost under $5,000--\nestablishing a benchmark cost per pound of thrust of less than $1, a \nsignificant improvement over current engines;\n  19 engines test-fired including 8 each for 200 seconds of continuous \nburn--the performance required to get a payload to LEO (low Earth \norbit);\n  the 5,000 pound thrust engine, with injector, completed and qualified \nfor flight;\n  design completed, including the Critical Design Review, for the \n20,000 pound thrust engine;\n  the entire avionics package completed and successfully qualified at \nMarshall Space Flight Center: Huntsville, Alabama;\n  fuel and cryogenic tanks, with liners, designed and fabricated for \nthe SR-1 sub-orbital vehicle;\n  a new test stand, designed for engines up to 100,000 pounds of \nthrust; and\n  technical spin-offs that could benefit non-Scorpius programs as well, \nsuch as the gas generator.\n  The funding requested for Fiscal Year 1999 would yield similar \nresults. With adequate funding in 1999, Microcosm could achieve the \nfollowing:\n  design, development and test Scorpius engines through 80,000 pounds \nof thrust;\n  preliminary design and testing of the 320,000 pound thrust engine;\n  test flights of the sub-orbital vehicles; and\n  preliminary design of the light-lift orbital vehicle.\n  The program has been subjected to many senior technical reviews by \nboth government and industry experts. No significant technical problem \nhas been identified.\n  Low cost launch programs are a bargain. We have a simple choice. \nEither we will continue to fall behind in our competitive position for \nspace launch costs and risk U.S. security through the transfer of \nsensitive technologies to be launched by other countries, or we can \nattain over 85% savings to taxpayers for space launch needs in the near \nfuture. These leap-frog technologies could make space launch truly \naffordable. With our support these efforts will recapture an American \nindustry--and jobs--now lost to foreign countries.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3029\n\n     (Purpose: To require efforts to continue to increase defense \n                        burdensharing by allies)\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1064.

Mr. President, I am here today to introduce an amendment \nto the Defense Authorization bill which is now before us. But first, I \nwould like to congratulate the members of the Armed Services Committee \nfor the excellent work they have done in preparing this legislation. I \nknow they are being asked to do more and more with less and less, and \nthey are having to make some very tough choices. The Committee has done \nan outstanding job and they deserve to be commended for it.\n  I would also like to pay special tribute to the Chairman, Senator \nThurmond, who is managing this legislation for the final time. His \nrecord of service to this country is remarkable. It is symbolic of the \ngreatness of this country that this paratrooper who landed in Normandy \non D-Day, who fought the tyranny of Nazi Germany and saw it defeated, \nfought the tyranny of the Stalinist Soviet Union and saw it defeated, \nrose to the Senate of our great nation and then to become Chairman of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee. His experience and commitment to \nour national security has strengthened democracy and peace here and \nabroad. We all owe a great debt of gratitude to this great American.\n  Mr. President, defense spending has declined for the last 14 years, \nand is now at the lowest point as a percentage of GDP since before the \nSecond World War. We have decreased military personnel by 39% since the \nend of the Cold War. I supported these reductions during the time that \nI was privileged to serve on the Armed Services Committee. At that \ntime, the federal budget deficit was spiraling out of control and \nbalancing the budget was one of my highest priorities.\n  I think the pendulum may be beginning to swing the other way. We now \nexpect to realize a significant budget surplus this year, perhaps more \nthan $50 billion. In light of this, it may be appropriate to review the \nlimits we have set on defense spending so that we can halt the annual \ndecreases in defense spending. Even holding the defense budget constant \nin real terms would make a significant difference to all those who \nserve in our armed forces.\n  I know that my colleagues Senator Stevens and Senator Dominici share \nthis concern. It has been reported that Navy Secretary Dalton believes \nthat the Navy cannot afford to both modernize and recapitalize our \nnaval forces within current fiscal guidance, placing readiness at \nsignificant risk. I would urge all of my colleagues to recognize the \ngreat strain we are placing on our soldiers, sailors, airmen and \nmarines as we continually ask them to do more while providing them with \nless.\n  I now would like to turn to an amendment that I have introduced, \ntogether with Senator Bennett, which deals with the Y2K problem. I \nunderstand that this amendment will be accepted by both the majority \nand the minority, and I would like to thank both sides for their \nassistance in finding a formulation which is acceptable to both sides.\n  We now are undertaking a massive effort to deal with this problem \nwithin the U.S. Government. The Defense Department alone has over 2800 \ncritical systems that must be ``cured.'' The Russians, however, have \nnot yet determined if they have a similar problem, let alone begun to \nfix it.\n  Given the potential impact of such a problem on military weapons \nsystems, it is in our national interest to work with Russia, and other \nnations with similar problem, to help them identify the scope of their \nY2K problem in strategic systems and to fix it. Our amendment \nauthorizes the Secretary of Defense to enter into cooperative \nagreements with foreign governments to assist them in identifying and \ncorrecting their Y2K problems in strategic and communications systems \nthat would otherwise threaten the national security interests of the \nUnited States.\n  It would be detrimental to our interests if the Russians awoke on the \nmorning of January 1, 2000, with blank screens on their early warning \nradars and command and control systems. What would be even worse is if \ntheir critical systems continued to operate with false and corrupted \ninformation. It is in both U.S. and Russian interests for our countries \nto maintain the highest level of confidence in our command and control \nsystems. We must build this confidence through transparency and other \ncooperative measures. The recent nuclear escalation on the Indian \nsubcontinent demonstrates the importance of mutual trust and \nconfidence, and the danger and instability that can\n\n[[Page S7146]]\n\nresult when uncertainty and miscalculation arise. Assisting the \nRussians with their Y2K problem is an example of cooperation that will \nenhance both Russian and U.S. national security.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3031\n\n    (Purpose: To modify the requirements relating to reports on the \ntransferability of functions of the Defense Automated Printing Service)\n\n       Strike out the matter proposed to be inserted, and insert \n     in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SEC. 1064.

Mr. President, this amendment to S. 2057, the Fiscal \nYear 1999 Defense Authorization Act, seeks to add $17 million for the \nprocurement of M888, 60-millimeter, high-explosive munitions for the \nMarine Corps.\n  The additional funds would help alleviate training constraints for \nMarine Corps units due to shortages in this item, and will help reduce \nthe coming bow-wave of procurement requirements that we may not have \nthe resources to fund in future years.\n  I would like to clarify that funds from the Marine Corps' OPTEMPO and \nbase support lines, both Operations & Maintenance accounts, have been \nidentified to offset this additional funding. The offset draws on funds \nthat were authorized in excess of what was appropriated for these \nparticular funding lines.\n  Initially, I had identified Marine Corps' initial use and base \nsupport lines as an offset for this amendment. I wish to alert the \nSenate Armed Services Committee and the full Senate of this specific \nchange.\n  Lastly, it is my understanding that the Marine Corps supports this \namendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3035\n\n  (Purpose: To require a report on the peaceful employment of former \n             Soviet experts on weapons of mass destruction)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1031.

Mr. President, I want to thank the managers of this bill, \nthe senior Senators from South Carolina and Michigan, for their \nwillingness to work with me on non-proliferation issues and to accept \ntwo amendments that I proposed in this regard. There is a critical need \nto guard against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or \nrelated technology from the former Soviet Union, and I am very pleased \nthat my colleagues share that concern.\n  There is no more critical national security issue than how well we \nhandle the threat of holocaust posed by weapons of mass destruction. \nThe potential for such horrific destruction may well have been \nincreased by the end of the Cold War and the breakdown of superpower \ncontrol over other countries. And a failure to contain the risk of such \nholocausts would dwarf any other foreign policy successes or failures.\n  War between the United States and Russia is no longer a realistic \nthreat, despite the size of our nuclear arsenals. The use of weapons of \nmass destruction by other countries, or even by terrorist groups, is a \nreal threat, however, and there is a real risk that former Soviet \nmaterials or technology will be the engine of proliferation to other \ncountries or groups.\n  No great power is as active as the United States in trying to prevent \nproliferation. Nobody has as many programs as we do to detect \nproliferation activities, to stop them, to pressure illegal buyers and \nsellers, to develop military weapons and tactics for operations against \nsites with weapons of mass destruction, and to assist the\n\n[[Page S7147]]\n\nformer Soviet states, in particular, in safeguarding and destroying \ndangerous material and in reorienting their military industry to the \ncivilian economy.\n  But the fact is, Mr. President, that we are failing to do all that we \ncan to stop proliferation. In particular, we are failing to reach most \nof the highly-trained scientists and technicians who developed weapons \nof mass destruction and ballistic missiles for the former Soviet Union. \nWell over a hundred thousand such skilled personnel served the Soviet \ndeath machine at its peak. Anywhere from ten to fifty thousand \npersonnel still have skills that a rogue state or terrorist group would \nlike to obtain, and are underpaid or unemployed today.\n  How can we remedy these failings? One way is to support and fully \nfund our existing programs of non-proliferation assistance to the \nformer Soviet Union. I am pleased to say that the managers of this bill \nagree with that judgment. Thus, they have accepted a Bingaman amendment \nthat I co-sponsored, to restore the few cuts in these programs that had \nbeen adopted in committee mark-up.\n  The managers of this bill have also accepted an amendment that I \nsponsored, to make available an additional $15 million for the Energy \nDepartment's Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention program and $30 \nmillion for the new ``nuclear cities'' initiative endorsed at the last \nmeeting of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission three months ago. This \namendment parallels one to the Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations Act that Senator Domenici and I sponsored last week. I \nam confident that it will result in these two important programs being \nable to move forward effectively, rather than being a threat to each \nother's existence.\n  As I noted on the floor last week, Initiatives for Proliferation \nPrevention (or IPP) is a program that creates employment opportunities \nfor former Soviet arms specialists by helping them develop their ideas \nfor commercially viable goods and services. As an idea reaches \nfruition, IPP brings the arms specialists into joint ventures with \noutside investors, who gradually take over the funding. For example, \nthanks to IPP, a U.S. firm is working with Ukrainian scientists to \ndevelop and market a device for decontaminating liquids. This device \nwill enable the Ukrainian dairy industry to produce fresh milk despite \nthe lingering effects of the Chernobyl reactor meltdown.\n  IPP had a slow start. It's hard to come up with really viable \ncommercial ventures, to find investors, and to make sure they can \ninvest safely. But IPP has begun to take off. As of this April 15, \nprojects had achieved completely commercial funding and 77 had found \nmajor private co-funding. We all have chosen wisely today, to maintain \nIPP's funding stream and to encourage the many weapons specialists in \nthe former Soviet Union who are searching for new careers in the \ncivilian economy.\n  The ``nuclear cities'' initiative is a more specialized effort to \nimprove employment opportunities for Russian personnel from their \nnuclear weapons labs and manufacturing facilities. This initiative, \ntoo, will focus on finding commercially viable projects and bringing in \noutside investors. The challenge is to find projects that can work at \nthese somewhat isolated cities, which are more or less the Russian \nequivalent of Los Alamos.\n  When the United States funds the ``nuclear cities'' initiative, it \ngets two benefits. First, Russia's Minister of Atomic Energy has \nannounced that he will downsize their nuclear weapons establishment. \nAnd second, by providing civilian job opportunities for some of the \npersonnel who are let go, we will help protect against Russian weapons \nspecialists accepting offers from states like Iran, Iraq, or Libya.\n  One problem in any program that depends upon developing commercially \nviable products and services is that foreign investors are wary of \nputting their funds in ventures that may fail because of confiscatory \ntaxes, local corruption or the difficulty of enforcing contracts. As a \nresult, many otherwise marketable ideas may go without the funding they \nneed to get off the ground and become engines of employment.\n  The senior Senator from Indiana and I sent a letter to the Vice \nPresident recently to suggest that a high-level commission or advisory \ncommittee be formed, with senior U.S. industrialists among its members, \nto survey investment opportunities in the ``nuclear cities'' and \nsimilar areas. This commission would also work with Russian officials \non improving the climate for international investment, so that an \nenlarging civilian economy in Russia can provide new careers for more \nformer arms experts. Fifty years ago, a commission to set up the \nMarshall Plan--led by an industrialist, the CEO of Studebaker--was able \nto convince Western Europe to take bold steps in economic coordination. \nIn a similar manner, perhaps practical help from U.S. industrialists \ntoday can galvanize Russian officials to take the steps that are needed \nfor international investment to jump-start their economic engines.\n  Even with such a commission, however, even if we maintain the \nInitiatives for Proliferation Prevention program, and even if we add \nthe ``nuclear cities'' initiative, there is no way that commercially \nviable ventures can employ all the tens of thousands of Russian \npersonnel who have worked on weapons of mass destruction. At some \npoint, Mr. President, we have to ask whether it is not in our national \nsecurity interest to provide broader assistance.\n  That is why I proposed the other amendment that the managers of this \nbill have accepted, to require the Secretary of Defense to report to \nCongress on this issue. Specifically, that report will tell us: (1) how \nmany former Soviet personnel are at risk of being candidates for \nrecruitment by rogue states; (2) how many can be employed in \ncommercially viable enterprises; (3) how many additional personnel \ncould be employed if we were to subsidize socially useful employment \nthat could not attract outside investment; and (4) what the costs and \nbenefits would be of a 10-year program of such subsidized employment.\n  I am confident that the Department of Defense will find a significant \ngap between the number of Russian arms experts who are at risk and the \nnumber who can be reached by programs that focus upon commercially \nviable ventures. We have much less information, however, regarding \neither the potential or the costs of a program that would provide \nbroader assistance. The Department of Defense report required by this \namendment, which would be prepared in consultation with the Secretary \nof State and the Secretary of Energy, will thus make a significant \ncontribution to the ability of Congress to make sensible policy \ndecisions in this field.\n  The task of assisting the transition of the former Soviet Union from \ntotalitarianism to democracy, from a command economy to a market \neconomy, and from militarism to more peaceful pursuits is indeed \ndaunting. We need many programs, for no single effort will achieve all \nof this. There will be disappointments along with successes. But the \nstakes are so high that we dare not flinch from the challenge to assist \nthat transition.\n  Likewise, we dare not cease our efforts to ensure that former Soviet \narms experts refrain from selling their expertise to those who would \nmisuse it. Today's actions are not the end of this demand upon our \nattention and our resources. But we can take heart from the fact that \nthey are measured steps in the right direction. With luck, we will come \nup with the needed programs and resources in time to prevent weapons of \nmass destruction from becoming a larger factor in the next century than \nthey have been in our own.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3036\n\n(Purpose: To require a study on effective deployment of theater missle \n              defense systems in the Asia-Pacific) region\n\n       On page 268, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1064. INCREASED MISSILE THREAT IN ASIA-PACIFIC REGION.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Secretary of Defense shall carry out a \n     study of the architecture requirements for the establishment \n     and operation of a theater ballistic missile defense system \n     in the Asia-Pacific region that would have the capability to \n     protect key regional allies of the United States.\n       (b) Report.--(1) Not later than January 1, 1999, the \n     Secretary shall submit to the Committee on National Security \n     of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate a report containing--\n       (A) the results of the study conducted under subsection \n     (a);\n\n[[Page S7148]]\n\n       (B) the factors used to obtain such results; and\n       (C) a description of any existing United States missile \n     defense system that could be transferred to key allies of the \n     United States in the Asia-Pacific region to provide for their \n     self-defense against limited ballistic missile attacks.\n       (2) The report shall be submitted in both classified and \n     unclassified form.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleagues for their \nsupport of the Kyl-Murkowski amendment which is intended to foster \nincreased missile defense cooperation between the United States and our \nkey allies in the Asia-Pacific region.\n  U.S. forces and allies in the Asia-Pacific region face a growing \nmissile threat from China and North Korea. China has embarked on a \nprogram to modernize its theater and strategic missile programs and \nBeijing has shown a willingness to use ballistic missiles to intimidate \nits neighbors. During Taiwan's national legislative elections in 1995, \nChina fixed six M-9 ballistic missiles to an area bout 100 miles north \nof the island. Less than a year later, on the eve of Taiwan's first \ndemocratic presidential election, China again launched M-9 missiles to \nareas within 30 miles north and south of the island, establishing a \nvirtual blockade of Taiwan's two primary ports.\n  North Korea's missile program is also becoming more advanced. \nAccording to a recent Defense Department report, North Korea has \ndeployed several hundred Scud missiles that are capable of reaching \ntargets in South Korea. The North has started to deploy the No Dong \nmissile, which will have sufficient range to target nearly all of \nJapan, and is continuing to develop a longer-range ballistic missile \nthat will be capable of reaching Alaska and Hawaii.\n  North Korea's missile program shows no signs of slowing down. In \nfact, Pyongyang recently stated that it would continue to develop, \nproduce, and sell ballistic missiles unless the U.S. lifts economic \nsanctions and compensates the regime for lost earnings from missile \nexports. On June 16th, the official Korean Central News Agency \nannounced, ``We will continue developing, testing, and deploying \nmissiles. If the United States really wants to prevent our missile \nexport, it should lift the economic embargo as early as possible and \nmake a compensation for the losses to be caused by discontinued missile \nexport. Our missile export is aimed at obtaining foreign money, which \nwe need at present.''\n  Theater missile defenses are vitally needed to protect American \nforces and allies in the Asia-Pacific region. This amendment would \nrequire the Administration to conduct a study of how the U.S. could \nbest cooperate with key allies in the region such as Taiwan, South \nKorea, and Japan to establish and operate effective theater missile \ndefenses.\n  I would also note that missile defenses are purely defensive items \nand can only be used to intercept incoming missiles. Therefore, in may \nview, the sale of ballistic missile defenses to Taiwan is consistent \nwith the provisions of the Taiwan Relations Act, which states that \n``the United States will make available to Taiwan such defense articles \nand defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable \nTaiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capability.''\n  Mr. President, in closing I would like to thank Senator Murkowski for \nworking with me on this initiative and would like to thank my \ncolleagues again for their support of this amendment, which I hope will \nlay the groundwork for effective cooperation with our allies to \nconfront a real and growing missile threat in the region.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, Senator Kyl and I have sponsored an \namendment which would require the Secretary of Defense to study the \nissue of effective deployment of a theater missile defense system for \nthe Asia-Pacific region. This is obviously needed to protect our troops \nin Okinawa and on the Korean peninsula. This amendment would further \nrequire that Korea, Japan and Taiwan be allowed to purchase such a \nsystem from the United States, should they desire. I suspect that all \nof them would be extremely interested in such a defense system, Mr. \nPresident, and I think it is incumbent upon us to extend this \nprotection to them.\n  A form of this legislation has already passed the House--albeit the \nHouse version was more specific in relating just to Taiwan. This \nlegislation makes sense, is deeply needed, and would be a good show of \nsupport, meaningful support, to our allies in Korea, Japan and Taiwan.\n  I thank the managers of the bill for agreeing to accept a scaled down \nversion of this amendment. I had hoped that the entire version would \nhave been eagerly accepted by colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nbut clearly there are other issues at play in the Senate at this time.\n  I want the Record to reflect that this scaled down version in no way \nreflects a diminished commitment to Taiwan. Quite the contrary. This \namendment should be seen as a victory--because it is. It is one of the \nonly provisions to be adopted into this bill addressing ballistic \nmissile defense, and one of the only provisions adopted which addresses \nsecurity issues in the Asian theater. And it is perhaps the only \nprovision which addresses China and Taiwan.\n  Our commitment to Taiwan is unwavering. As President Clinton goes to \nChina, this amendment reiterates our support for the people of Taiwan, \nand the government of Taiwan. The question of Taiwan must only be \nresolved through peaceful means--and I again call on President Clinton \nto raise the issue of renouncing the threat of the use of force against \nTaiwan when he meets with President Jiang in Beijing.\n  The Chinese missile tests off the coast of Taiwan in the Spring of \n1996 brought our relations with China to the brink of conflict. Their \nactions were reprehensible and intended only to intimidate, and I think \ntest, whether the United States was serious on the issue of Taiwan. \nThey learned that we are, that the United States is unequivocal on the \nissue of Taiwan's security, and here right to a free and democratic \nsociety. We will not condone efforts to intimidate national free \nelections; the people on Taiwan have chosen to live a life of freedom--\nwe commend them and support them in this.\n  Finally, Mr. President, at a time when the United States is being \npressured to reduce its forces in Asia, ballistic missile defense for \nKorea, Japan and Taiwan is even more important. if we reduce our forces \nin Asia, make no mistake--there will be a security void, a vacuum. Our \namendment is intended to prevent a vacuum; to reduce the impact of \nmissile development by China, North Korea and perhaps others in the \nregion. Mr. President, the Loral Space communications issue has shown \nus one thing--that if our policies, even by accident, allow others to \nimprove their missile capabilities, it is incumbent upon us to provide \nour allies with the support they need to defend themselves. Be \nextending ballistic missile protection to Taiwan, we are doing just \nthat.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3037\n\n (Purpose: To require the submission of a plan and design relating to \n   the relocation of the National Atomic Museum in Albuquerque, New \n                                Mexico)\n\n       On page 397, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3137.

Mr. President, I rise with an amendment to the \nDepartment of Defense Authorization Bill which relates to our chemical \nweapons demilitarization program. I thank the managers of this bill, \nand the professional staff at the Senate Armed Services Committee for \nagreeing to adopt this amendment.\n  This is a straightforward amendment, but may be on track to save us a \nlot of time and money with respect to our chemical weapons stockpile \ndemilitarization program. Over the life of the stockpile \ndemilitarization program which as gone from about $2 billion to $15 \nbillion, to perhaps $16 billion as we speak. The anticipated time it \nwill take to comply with the Chemical Weapons Convention has also been \nextended, and it is increasingly unlikely that we will make the April \n29, 2007 deadline which we agreed to here in the Senate last year.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is intended to help save time and money \nin this program. It simply requires that the Department of the Army and \nthe EPA be allied instead of adversaries. It requires that the \nSecretary of the Army sit down with the Administrator of the EPA and \nreport back to Congress on how these departments can work together to \nhelp expedite the permits which are necessary for the demilitarization \nprogram. Most of these permits are pursuant to the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). While the EPA does not have a \nrole issuing permits, it does act in an advisory capacity to the \nvarious State governments which review and issue permits.\n  Since the States are likely to follow the feds, cooperation between \nthe Army and the EPA is critical. Let's simply make certain that all \narms of the federal government are cooperating. Mr. President, we aim \nto be rid of these weapons by the year 2007. If we are serious about \nmeeting this deadline, we need to do all we can now to give the program \nstewards the tools they need to get the job done.\n  Again, I thank the bill managers for agreeing to adopt this \namendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3039\n\n (Purpose: To amend title 10, United States Code, with respect to the \nadministration of certain drugs to members of the Armed Forces without \n                  the informed consent of the members)\n\n       At the end of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 708.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Committee has accepted \nmy amendment to provide greater oversight and accountability in those \ninstances when the Secretary of Defense determines that U.S. troops \nwould be best protected by the administration of investigational drugs \nin a wartime situation. Our forces increasingly face the threat of \nchemical and biological weapons being used on the battlefield. It may \ntherefore be necessary, in order to protect them from these terrible \nweapons, to require them to take medicines and drugs to counteract or \nprevent these threats from being used to devastating effect. I think \nthat we can all agree that the Secretary of Defense should take all \nreasonable precautions to protect U.S. troops in these situations, and \nthat for a number of reasons, it may not be possible, wise, or safe to \nmake public that decision by asking for the informed consent of each \nand every soldier, sailor, or airman before those preventative measures \nare administered.\n  However, I believe that it is also reasonable to take steps to ensure \nthat when the Department of Defense thinks a particular drug, either \ninvestigational or used in a new way, should be administered without \nthe informed consent of the troops, that such a decision is vetted very \ncarefully, and that such decisions are recorded. Therefore, my \namendment adds a new and higher level of scrutiny to the waiver \nprocess. My amendment requires that the President, the Commander in \nChief, concurs in the decision of the Department of Defense to \nadminister such drugs. It puts the top civilian in charge of the \nmilitary in the loop, and it requires that these decisions to \nadminister drugs to our troops are reported to the Congress.\n  Unfortunately, some examples from history, such as the exposure of \ntroops to atmospheric atomic tests, and other examples of making U.S. \nmilitary men and women ``guinea pigs,'' have left lingering concerns \nabout leaving this decision making process entirely in the hands of the \nmilitary. I hope that my amendment, by bringing civilian leaders and \nrepresentatives of the people into the process, will allay concerns\n\n[[Page S7150]]\n\nthat U.S. troops will ever be given drugs for any reason other than to \nprotect them from real and dangerous threats.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3040\n\n (Purpose: To authorize the conveyance of utility systems at Lone Star \n                     Army Ammunition Plant, Texas)\n\n       On page 342, below line 22, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 2827.

I ask unanimous consent the amendments be agreed to en \nbloc, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  I further ask that statements of explanation for each amendment be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, each of these amendments has been cleared \nby us. Many of these are amendments from this side of the aisle and of \ncourse many from the Republican side of the aisle. But they have all \nbeen cleared. We support the adoption of these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments nos. 2783, 2791 as modified, 2792 as modified, 2823, \n2867 as modified, 2904 as modified, 2907, 2909 as modified, 2923 as \nmodified, 2976 as modified, 3017 through 3032, 3035 through 3040, en \nbloc, were agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2728\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I can have just 30 seconds on the Burns \namendment? I want to commend the Senator from Montana on his amendment. \nWhile there may be priorities which I would give a higher priority to, \nincluding readiness, this amendment fits the needs of our military \npersonnel and meets the tests that the Armed Services Committee has set \nfor military construction projects.\n  I thank him for meeting those criteria. We try to apply those \ncriteria across the board, and here is what they are--if I can just \ntake 30 seconds. Each one of Senator Burns' projects is contained in \nthe Defense Department's Future Year's Defense Program, FYDP; they are \nall considered mission essential by the Defense Department; they are \nconsistent with past Base Closure Commission decisions; and they are \nall projects that can be executed in fiscal year 1999.\n  I thank him for the care with which he has selected these quality-of-\nlife projects. They all meet these criteria.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member of the committee \nand manager of this bill. If he hadn't developed those criteria, we \ncould not have done what we have done in the last 2 years in taking $2 \nbillion out of this and still provide for the needs of our military \npeople on base. We could not have done that.\n  So, there are a lot of people to thank for developing those criteria, \nfor working with us, and for having the discipline to stay within those \ncriteria, whenever we recommend these projects. So I thank my good \nfriend from Michigan.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we can, I think, momentarily proceed to \nthe rollcall votes that are still required. It is likely that at least \ntwo of them are going to be vitiated, which I think is good news to \nall.\n  I want to make certain that the McCain second-degree amendment to the \nBurns amendment, limited to 5 minutes under the control of Senator \nMcCain and 10 minutes under the control of Senator Stevens, is \nreserved, and that time is reserved for the Senator from Arizona prior \nto the vote on the Burns amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2808\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the Feingold amendment with 2 minutes, equally divided.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum because I \nnote the absence of Senator Feingold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. We can now proceed pursuant to the unanimous consent \nrequest to the first rollcall vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. To clarify the Record, the unanimous consent agreement did \nprovide for time on the Feingold amendment, and that time was used with \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Feingold \namendment No. 2808. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Roth) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Hutchinson) is \nabsent due to a death in family.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from Montana (Mr. Baucus), the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn), \nand the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) is absent \ndue to a family illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting the Senator from \nOregon (Mr. Wyden) would vote ``aye.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 20, nays 72, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 178 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--20\n\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Daschle\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Harkin\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Reid\n     Sarbanes\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--72\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--8\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Glenn\n     Hutchinson\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Specter\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 2808) was rejected.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, I thank the managers of the legislation for \ngetting the agreement that has been entered into in an effort to get a \nvote at a reasonable time so we can conclude this matter before the \nnight is out.\n  I ask unanimous consent the remaining votes in this series be limited \nto 10\n\n[[Page S7151]]\n\nminutes in length. That is, votes on the Bumpers amendment, Senator \nByrd's amendment, and final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, we turn to the Bumpers amendment. We \nwill have the 10-minute rollcall vote, preceded by 1 minute to Senator \nBumpers and 1 minute to Senator Coats.\n  I wish to advise the Senate that following the Bumpers amendment \nthere will be a period not to exceed 25 minutes allocated to the \nfollowing Senators to speak: Senator Levin, Senator Snowe, Senator \nKennedy, Senator Coats, Senator Byrd. This is preceding the Byrd \namendment. It is hoped that not all of that time will be used. So there \nwill be a period following the Bumpers amendment, not to exceed 25 \nminutes.\n  I suggest the Chair recognize the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers, \nfor the purpose of speaking on his amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3012\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, we are embarked on buying the most \nexpensive fighter plane in the history of the United States. As a \nmatter of fact, three times more expensive than any fighter plane in \nthe history of the United States, the F-22, $182 million each, $62 \nbillion total--which will surely go to $100 to $125 billion before we \nare finished.\n  When we first started talking about it, the Air Force said we will \ntest this plane, preproduction, 1,400 hours. In 1997, they said no, 600 \nhours. Now this bill says 183 hours, if the Secretary will certify a \ncouple of little deals. You wouldn't buy a golf cart that hadn't been \ntested more than 183 hours.\n  We are going right down the B-1, B-2 lane. I can tell you, we are \nheaded for big-time trouble. All I want to say is, not only is this \nplane very expensive, it is simply not going to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this may sound surprising, but the \ncommittee agrees with Senator Bumpers. We have studied this and we \nabsolutely have language in this bill that requires testing before we \nbuy or before we fly. We have carefully worked out a compromise on this \nissue with the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Air Force, \ncontractors, Members of Congress--those for the F-22 and those against \nthe F-22--to ensure adequate testing, but also to do so in a way that \ndoesn't add unnecessary costs--some estimated at more than billions of \ndollars by delayed production--by unnecessary testing. The Secretary of \nDefense has to certify before we can go forward.\n\n  We urge people to support the committee position. We studied this and \nwe agree with Senator Bumpers: More testing before we fly--but not as \nmuch as Senator Bumpers thinks we need.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Roth) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Hutchinson) is \nabsent due to a death in family.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, this amendment is modified to provide \n$1 million for design money for Fort Bragg for a National Guard \nfacility.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, as the chairman \nof the Readiness Committee, we have approved this, and we appreciate \nvery much the way that the Senator from North Carolina has been willing \nto go into the planning phase so that we will have a chance to go into \nthis project in an orderly fashion. And the funding should not be a \nproblem, because it will be used with existing funds from the National \nGuard.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank Senator Inhofe. I thank Senators Warner and \nThurmond for their help.\n  Since the amendment is now accepted on both sides, the majority and \nthe minority, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the planned rollcall \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I make inquiry of the Senator from \nVirginia. He and I have discussed this question. It is my understanding \nthat the authorization here is discretionary.\n  No. 1, that the words ``may be available'' are now in instead of \n``shall''.\n  No. 2, not only is it discretionary so that if the Secretary chooses \nto do the design, then something also will be forthcoming.\n  It is my understanding that this amendment is not only discretionary, \nbut does not commit us to the construction of this project.\n  I want to ask the Senator from Virginia is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator's understanding is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair and thank the Senators who were involved \nin working this out, the Senator from North Carolina and the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3014), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment, as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I want to commend the able Senator from North Carolina \nfor offering this amendment. Fort Bragg is the logical place for this \nNational Guard Armory. I appreciate his bringing this matter up. It not \nonly concerns my State but many other States, too. The Senator from \nNorth Carolina has done a good job, and we are proud of him.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the chairman, Senator Thurmond.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3011\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, pursuant to the unanimous consent request, \nwe will proceed to the Byrd amendment.

Reserving the right to object, I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest we proceed to the debate on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the order designated by my unanimous \nconsent request--and I now ask that that be adopted. I don't think \nthere is an objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in addition to the five speakers noted, I \nwould add a request on that unanimous consent that Senator Robb of \nVirginia be granted 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment before us goes beyond the \namendment which we considered yesterday.\n  Yesterday, there was a debate on an amendment of Senator Brownback \nwhich related to the question of barracks. The amendment before us \ntoday revisits that issue, and I will come to that in a moment. It goes \nbeyond that to require segregated training for our recruits. This is \nnot a pure revisit of yesterday's amendment that was offered by the \nSenator from Kansas. We are now talking about both the barracks issue \nand the requirement in the Byrd amendment for segregated training.\n  Now, our top uniformed officials have written us strongly opposing \nthis amendment. In a moment I am going to read from the letter of the \nChief of Staff of the Army, General Reimer, who wrote to Strom \nThurmond, our great chairman, on May 19, about this issue. But before I \nquote from his letter, I want to emphasize that what we are being told \nhere is not a matter of political correctness; this is a question of a \ncommander's responsibilities that General Reimer is talking to us \nabout. And this is what General Reimer wrote:\n\n       The company commanders of the training companies are \n     responsible for everything their units do or fail to do. \n     Segregating their units--\n\n  Segregating their units--\n\n     into gender-unique platoons for training and billeting the \n     soldiers by gender in separate buildings will degrade the \n     commander's ability to command and control his or her unit. \n     We do not want to make the commander's responsibilities more \n     difficult or the drill sergeant's duties more challenging \n     than they already are.\n\n  This is part of a letter from General Reimer.\n  Now, the top enlisted members of each of the services, each of the \nservices--and these are the senior advisers\n\n[[Page S7153]]\n\nrelative to the welfare of enlisted members--have written us on June 17 \nsaying the following:\n\n       Each time our Nation has asked the Army, Navy, Air Force or \n     Marines to do a job, it has been done. Men and women \n     soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines accomplish the tasks \n     asked of them every day in places like Bosnia, Haiti, \n     southwest Asia, and the Far East. Their many successes in our \n     gender-integrated, all-volunteer force is a direct result \n     of the training the services currently provide.\n\n  A direct result of the training that these recruits get--and that \ntraining is gender-integrated training.\n  This amendment would end that--not only end it against the \nrecommendation of our top uniformed officials and officers; it would \nend it prematurely and precipitously.\n  Last year, we appointed a commission, the Congress appointed a \ncommission. We picked 10 people on this commission to review the \nrecommendations of the Kassebaum commission. That was our choice, and \nthose citizens are now serving. They are serving at our request, \nreviewing the very recommendations that this amendment would put into \nlaw before that review can take place.\n  I want to read from that part of last year's defense authorization \nbill. It says that the commission--again I emphasize, the commission \nthat we created, we put into place, we appointed--this commission \nshall:\n\n       Consider issues regarding the personal relationships of \n     members of the Armed Forces as follows:\n\n  And No. 3 is:\n\n       To assess the reports of the independent panel, the \n     Department of Defense task force, and the review of existing \n     guidance on fraternization that has been required by the \n     Secretary of Defense.\n\n  Just last year we created a commission, and one of its explicit \nduties is to review the Kassebaum commission's recommendations. A \nnumber of those recommendations are not acceptable to the uniformed \nmilitary, including the ones relative to training.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator's 5 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent request, \nSenators Levin, Snowe, Kempthorne, Coats, and Byrd are allocated time \nnot to exceed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe we had an understanding \ninformally that that time would be alternated between persons in \nopposition and support, so that someone in support of the Byrd \namendment, it seems to me, should now be the person recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to the Senator from Michigan, I think we had better \nproceed and the Senator from Maine is now next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair.\n  The Byrd amendment goes even further than the amendment that was \noffered by the Senator from Kansas last night which we rejected by a \nvote of 56 to 37.\n  The Byrd amendment would essentially eliminate all gender-integrated \ntraining at basic levels. The decision we made last night was to uphold \nthe congressional commission that was created on military training and \ngender-related issues to complete its assessment and to report back to \nthis Congress in March of 1999.\n  This commission was created by Congress last year with the active \ncosponsorship of the Senator from West Virginia--in fact, in deference \nto the position he held on the issue of gender-integrated training. \nThis commission is made up of 10 distinguished individuals who are \nselected by both the Armed Services Committee of the Senate and the \nHouse National Security Committee that will examine a myriad of gender-\nrelated issues and the relationship that gender-integrated adds to our \nperformance levels, to readiness and cohesion and to the morale of our \nAll Volunteer Force. Will we permit this panel of experts to deliberate \non the views and the experiences of the commanders in the field, or are \nwe going to decide this evening to legislate with an instant result \nthrough the Byrd amendment that defies the views of the Secretary of \nDefense, to the service chiefs of the Air Force, the Navy and the Army, \nthe training commanders of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force, the \nsenior noncommissioned officers of the Army, the Navy and the Air \nForce, or the Association of the U.S. Army, or every active duty \nservice member who has testified before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee over the last 2 years.\n\n  Yesterday, we chose the path of deliberation by a commission of our \nown design, rather than imposing on the military another set of \nregulations without the benefit of testimony from the field.\n  The position of many of the military, including all of our top level \nmilitary officers, support gender-integrated training, because they \nbelieve it is an anchor of that readiness. Far from an invention of \nsocial policy activists, they recognize that it is an absolute \nnecessity in a military that cannot maintain an effective and efficient \nvolunteer force without the contributions of our women in uniform. And \nit is a force multiplier, teaching service members the blend of \noperational skills, the codes of personal behavior necessary to our \ngender-neutral position, which is to win wars.\n  Last night, we upheld the integrity of the commission that was \ncreated by this Congress.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may we have order? There are too many \nconversations going on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is entitled to be heard.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine will proceed.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Last night, we upheld the decision to uphold the integrity \nof the commission that we created that includes two retired Marine \nCorps generals, a retired master sergeant, two military sociologists, \nthe former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management and the \nformer Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Personnel.\n  I urge Members of this Senate to reject the Byrd amendment and to \nsupport the views of those of us, including the Senator from West \nVirginia, that we should have a commission to provide an independent \nevaluation and analysis of gender-integrated training, and the \nimportance of it to the readiness and the cohesiveness of our armed \nservices.\n  I urge the Senate to reject the Byrd amendment, that we confirm the \naction that was taken last year by this Congress, which was to create \nthis commission, and to reaffirm the vote that was taken last night to \nsupport the commission in its work and to report back to this Congress. \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho has 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I offer my comments in my capacity as \nthe chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Subcommittee on \nPersonnel. I have the utmost and profound respect for Senator Byrd, a \nman of tremendous integrity and motivation.\n\n  Last year, when we established the commission that would deal with \nthese issues that are very critical issues dealing with the military, \nthe legislation which established it was an amendment that was crafted \nby Senator Byrd and by myself. I cannot turn my back on that commission \nat this point.\n  A few weeks ago, there was a situation among those very talented \ncommission members where some of them walked away. It looked as though \nthe commission was going to collapse. I met with them, Senator Cleland \nmet with them, Congressman Buyer met with them, and we urged them, \nbecause of the magnitude of the issues that they would be dealing with, \nthat they come back together, give us guidance.\n  For me to now say once you have been put back together, we are going \nto go ahead now with legislation, hope you concur--I really think if we \ngo forward with this, we ought to consider disbanding the commission.\n  Last night, in the course of debate, Senator Enzi made a very \ninteresting point, and that was with regard to how many meters a \ngrenade could be thrown and the standards by which a\n\n[[Page S7154]]\n\nfemale would be required to throw the grenade versus how many meters a \nmale soldier would be required to throw the grenade, and that there \nwere differences and should there be differences.\n  I ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate, do you want to get into that \ndebate? Do you really think we ought to be getting down to the details \nof how many meters a grenade should be thrown by a male soldier versus \na female soldier, or are we going just a little too far in \nmicromanaging? That is my concern. That is why on this commission we \nhave outstanding individuals. We have retired Marine Corps generals, a \nsergeant major from the Army--we have folks who have been there. The \nphysical training--how many push-ups should a man do versus a woman? Do \nyou want to debate that? Do you want to get into that detail?\n  We have a commission that has been appointed to do this. If that is \nnot what we intended, the wisdom of this body that last year affirmed \nthat commission, then we should have said so. We should have had this \ndebate last year. We should have been up front about it, because if we \nare going to do this, if I were a commission member, I would say, \n``Here's my resignation.''\n  I don't think that is what we are about, Mr. President. One of the \nthings which I mentioned to that commission in the charge is do not \never, ever consider delivering to us, to this U.S. Senate, to the House \nof Representatives, what is, in your estimation, politically correct. \nWe do not want to know what is politically correct with regard to the \nmilitary of the United States. You tell us what is militarily correct \nfor those men and women who wear the uniform. Don't tell us what is \npolitically correct. This is not a social laboratory. This is the \nmilitary. The courts have upheld that it is the military and things can \nbe different.\n  So let's do what is right, and let's not now make this U.S. Senate \nthe governing body of all the details of how far the grenade should be \nthrown by a female soldier versus a male soldier, how many sit-ups they \nshould do. We can enact the overall policy, but we have put talented \npeople in place in the commission to do so.\n  Please do not undo what you did last year. If you do, then ask \nyourselves, were we wrong last year? Was this deliberative body wrong, \nand we are admitting a mistake? I don't think so.\n  I must, again, in my capacity as the chairman of the Personnel \nSubcommittee, support the commission which I helped create, because I \nhave a belief that they will come back with recommendations which may \nwell totally affirm what Senator Byrd is advocating tonight, totally \naffirm what Senator Brownback was advocating last night, perhaps even \nfarther. But unless you want to get into how far to toss a grenade, I \nask you not to pull the pin here tonight. And with that, I respectfully \nand regretfully have to oppose Senator Byrd's amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, this is an emotional subject, a difficult \nsubject. I am former chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee and still a \nmember of that subcommittee. And it is an issue at which I have looked \nand studied and struggled with for some time.\n  I have come to an opposite conclusion of some of my friends, and I \nwant to tell you why I have. First of all, everyone needs to understand \nthe Byrd amendment is not an effort to return to segregated military \nunits. It is simply designed to say that at that initial entry point, \nwe are dealing with a situation that involves young people, many coming \nout of very disruptive backgrounds, many in a very vulnerable position. \nAnd we have seen--tragically seen--some exploitation of that, which is \nwrong and absolutely needs to be handled in the most direct way and \nthat sends out a very clear signal that we have zero tolerance on this. \nBut I want to make clear, nevertheless, that the situation we are \ndealing with in this amendment is with young people at their initial \nentry point.\n  Now, we do not need another commission. We enacted a commission \nbecause I think a lot of Members did not have any faith that the DOD-\nappointed commission would give an objective view.\n  I think everyone was surprised, including the Secretary of Defense, \nwhen the commission, led by our former colleague, Senator Kassebaum, \ncame back with the conclusion and the recommendation that we ought to \nhave segregated training at that initial entry point, and then that a \nmerger of those two separate units of male and female trainees at the \nnext level of their training. The question is, Why? Why did that \ncommission come back with that recommendation to the surprise of \neveryone, including, I think, the Secretary of Defense?\n  The reason is that the Kassebaum commission went and visited those \nsame sites that I have gone and visited. And they talked to female and \nmale trainees, and male drill instructors and female drill instructors. \nAnd they came away with the inescapable conclusion that I think any of \nus would, or at least most of us would if we went and asked the \nfemales, asked the women and men, asked the people at that initial \nentry point what they preferred, what they thought worked, what was \nbest?\n  I went to Fort Jackson where the Army trains with integrated male-\nfemale training. About 30 percent of the females do not have female \ndrill sergeants in their platoons. They have all male drill sergeants. \nAnd those females said, ``We want female drill sergeants.'' Then I went \nto Parris Island, and at Parris Island, the female marines said, ``This \nis the best thing that ever happened to me to be associated with a \nmentor who can provide me guidance as a young lady in how to deal with \nthese questions, how to deal with these kinds of decisions, how to deal \nwith these tough situations, how to deal with this pressure, how to \ndeal with this demanding training. It prepares me.''\n  I cannot say it better than the letter that was forwarded by a female \ncorporal in the Armed Forces. And it reads:\n\n       `Sir: . . . This is very distressing news to me and my \n     fellow women marines. There is no way I would ever have made \n     it through basic training with men present. I experienced \n     mixed boot camp for just a few days while in basic training. \n     It was the worst training days we had. I am all for equality, \n     but this is madness. With no disrespect to the Army, the \n     problems they have had [ought to] be proof [of this madness]. \n     I can honestly say that if I had it to do over again and \n     basic training was mixed gender, there is no way I would do \n     it. I would not make it, not with the level of dedication and \n     concentration it took when there were only females. I can't \n     imagine having to deal with the underlying sexual tension, \n     the jealousy, and unconscious way I would feel every day.'\n\n  I am convinced that any of us who would take the time to go and visit \nthe women marines in their initial training at Parris Island would feel \nas proud as any American would ever feel about the abilities of women \ncoming out of sometimes very, very difficult situations, gaining the \nself-esteem and bonding together with their female drill instructors \nand each other, and being prepared to move on to that next stage in \ntheir training.\n  And if you listened and asked them, literally to a person, they told \nme--this entire company of women marines told me-- ``This is the way it \nought to be initially. Then we're prepared to move on in our advanced \ntraining and integrate with the men. But we wouldn't give up this \nexperience for anything in the world. This is the way we ought to be \ntrained.''\n  The Marine Corps model is a model that works. It has demonstrated its \neffectiveness. The other services are struggling to make it work, \nwithout the requisite number of female instructors, and with a very \nuncomfortable situation.\n  So why not take a model that works and why not follow the \nrecommendations of the commission that has already been in place, \nappointed by the Secretary of Defense, headed up by our former \ncolleague, Senator Kassebaum, which I do not think anybody thought had \na bias in favor of separated training going in, but came away, after \ntheir exhaustive experience in examining all of the training camps for \nall of the services, and came away with the inescapable conclusion that \nwe ought to have gender segregation at the initial entry training \nlevel. That is what the Byrd amendment is about. I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S7155]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank you.\n  I understand the concerns that have been expressed by our colleague \nfrom Indiana and that undoubtedly underlie the concerns expressed by \nthe distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. I, too, had \noccasion recently to visit the marines who were training in Parris \nIsland. And I talked with the women marines who were completing their \ntraining, completing the crucible.\n  I do not think there was a more inspiring experience that I have had \nin recent years than being with them at the first light in the morning \nas they marched out with their separate training under those \ncircumstances. As a former marine, I could not have been prouder. And I \ndo not want to see us do anything to attempt to change either the \nculture or the success of the training program that the Marines engage \nin.\n  But I do not want to see us change the culture or the success of the \nArmy program or the Navy program or the Air Force program at this point \neither. I also had occasion to visit Fort Jackson and talked to the \nyoung women and young men who were undergoing training at both Fort \nJackson and at Parris Island.\n  I talked to the drill sergeants and the drill instructors. And \nneither program is entirely without some challenges, and indeed there \nwas a significant challenge at Fort Jackson with respect to separation. \nThat has been addressed by the Secretary of Defense. And many of the \nrecommendations that were made by the Kassebaum-Baker commission were \ngood and have already been implemented or are in the process of being \nimplemented.\n  But the bottom line is, we established a commission, as mentioned by \nSenator Kempthorne, to review those recommendations. I personally \nbelieve at this point, although I was skeptical at the outset, that I \nwould prefer to see us take a step back and let the services make these \ndeterminations. But at the very least, I do not want to see us \nprematurely require the services to make changes that the service \nchiefs, the senior enlisted members of those services do not believe \nare in their best interests.\n  And the kind of training and esprit which was clearly evident at \nParris Island, but also evident at Fort Jackson, and in talking to the \nyoung women in training, as well as the drill sergeants--they liked the \nkind of training that they were engaged in. They thought it was \nsuccessful.\n  I hope that this Senate will consider the amendment that we dealt \nwith last night by Senator Snowe from Maine. I think we made the right \ndecision on that occasion. I hope this evening it will be the pleasure \nof the Senate not to pass this particular amendment, and allow our \ncommission to make their report. Then we can take the actions that are \nappropriate under the circumstances.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the chairman and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I respect the viewpoints of all of those who \nhave spoken, those who are opposed to my amendment as well as those who \nhave spoken in support of it.\n  When I read and heard about the problems that were existing in the \nmilitary, I stated publicly that I was going to seek, in the Armed \nServices Committee, to establish a commission to look into the matter. \nWhereupon, I am not implying that Mr. Cohen appointed his commission \nbecause I said that, but he did appoint the commission on his own, or \nindicated he was going to appoint a commission.\n\n  I looked with some askance at a commission that would be appointed by \nthe Secretary of Defense to look into this matter. So he proceeded to \nappoint that commission. I was surprised that he appointed Nancy \nKassebaum-Baker as chairman of that commission. He appointed a good \ncommissioner.\n  So I had approached the matter by pushing for an amendment that would \ncreate a commission. Mr. Kempthorne and I joined in that. But I was \nsuspicious of any commission that would be appointed within the \nadministration by the Secretary of Defense--not that it was the \nparticular Secretary of Defense, but I wanted to establish a fox to \nwatch the chickens.\n  As it turned out, the commission that the Secretary appointed was a \ngood one. It made some excellent recommendations, but by then we had \nalready decided to appoint our commission.\n  Now, there are those who say we should wait on the commission that we \nappointed. The Kassebaum commission is a commission of high integrity. \nWe know the former Senator who served from Kansas, Nancy Kassebaum. We \nknow that she was a great Senator of integrity and one who worked with \nhigh purposes. We all believed in her, and I believed in her \ncommission.\n  So I think that we ought not wait on the commission now that I helped \nto establish to keep an eye on the commission, that the Defense \nSecretary had indicated he was going to appoint. The Kassebaum \ncommission has rendered its recommendations, and my amendment would put \ninto effect the recommendations of the Kassebaum commission. My \namendment would conform to the language of the House, the House \nlanguage, so when the conferees go to conference, if my amendment is \nadopted, this will not be a question in conference because the Senate \nlanguage will conform to the House language.\n  So there are those who have urged that our colleagues vote against my \namendment in order to preserve the integrity of the Senate commission \non gender-integrated training, which will not issue its report until \nnext year. Mr. President, I suggest to my colleagues that it is better \nto preserve the integrity of our Armed Forces and to preserve the \nintegrity and safety of our young recruits.\n  Let us not delay the process of implementing changes recommended by \nformer Senator Kassebaum-Baker and the commission that she headed, a \ncommission established by the Secretary of Defense. Let us not delay \nmaking changes that will improve the discipline, the teamwork, the \ncohesion of our military forces. Put these young recruits in separate \nbarracks, train them separately until they have been instilled in the \nmilitary discipline that will allow them to work together as strong, \nconfident, and effective teams, and keep them focused on the job at \nhand. Let us not put this off for another year, waiting for the Senate \ncommission to report. The Senate commission's purpose is not undermined \nby this action. It may make further recommendations regarding the \nproblems faced today with mixed-gender training that the Secretary may \nwant to adopt.\n  It is also tasked with examining other areas, including \nfraternization policies in the various services which clearly, clearly, \nalso merit review and possible change. There is plenty of work for the \nSenate commission still to do. The Senators have noted in their remarks \nthat senior military officials all supported keeping mixed-gender \ntraining just the way it is. But our colleagues have failed to note \nthat not all of our military services support mixed-gender training \nfrom day 1. The Commandant of the Marine Corps testified before the \nArmed Services Committee that the Marine Corps had decided to keep \ntheir basic training segregated.\n  I think most of my colleagues would agree that the Marine Corps has \narguably the greatest discipline, the greatest order, and the greatest \nunity cohesion of any branch of service. I think it is time that the \nother services model themselves after this successful example.\n  I urge the adoption of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The question is on the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Does the distinguished Senator from West Virginia desire \nthe yeas and nays?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. WARNER. Could the distinguished ranking member--I do have one \nsmall matter.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3041\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we ask unanimous consent an amendment of \nSenator Murkowski be sent to the desk.\n\n[[Page S7156]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] for Mr. Murkowski, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3041.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       No later than December 1, 1998, the Secretary shall submit \n     to the Congress a report recommending alternative means \n     through which a refiner that qualifies as a small \n     disadvantaged business and that delivers fuel by barge to \n     Defense Energy Supply Point-Anchorage under a contract with \n     the Defense Energy Supply Center can--\n       (a) fulfill its contractual obligations,\n       (b) maintain its status as a small disadvantaged business, \n     and\n       (c) receive the small disadvantaged business premium for \n     the total amount of fuel under the contract,\n\n     when ice conditions in Cook Inlet threaten physical delivery \n     of such fuel.\n       Any inability by such refiner to satisfy its contractual \n     obligations to the Defense Energy Supply Center for the \n     delivery of fuel to Defense Energy Supply Point-Anchorage may \n     not be used as a basis for the denial of such refiner's small \n     disadvantaged business status or small disadvantaged business \n     premium for the total amount of fuel under the contract, \n     where such inability is a result of ice conditions in Cook \n     Inlet as determined by the U.S. Coast Guard. Through February \n     1999; and if the Secretary of Defense determines that such \n     inability will result in an inequity to the refiner.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is agreeable on this side, as I think it \nis on the other side.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. My understanding is, it is cleared by both sides.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent when that amendment is sent to the \ndesk it be considered read, it be considered passed, reconsidered, and \ntabled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3041) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to advise the Senate that following the rollcall \nvote, 10 minutes on the Byrd amendment, we now turn to the Burns \namendment pursuant to--I am reciting the existing unanimous consent \norder relative to MilCon--5 minutes equally divided, a McCain second-\ndegree amendment to the Burns amendment, with Senator McCain recognized \nfor 5 minutes and Senator Stevens recognized for 10 minutes.\n  My understanding is, in all likelihood there will not be a rollcall \nvote as a consequence of these statements by our colleagues.\n  Following the disposition of the Burns amendment, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the majority leader and the minority leader be recognized \nfor such period as they desire to address the Senate and then we \nproceed to final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I earlier \nfiled two amendments concerning the authorization of funds for \ncontinuing the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.\n\n  After discussions with the distinguished manager's of the bill, I \nwill not call up those amendments on this bill.\n  The President's budget did not present any request for funds for the \nBosnia mission for FY 1999. The Congress received a supplemental budget \namendment requesting $1.858 billion for Bosnia operations.\n  After four years, there is little merit in treating Bosnia costs as \nan ``unforeseen, emergency requirement'' as required by the Budget Act.\n  I do not oppose the mission in Bosnia. On a visit to Tuzla last \nmonth, the delegation that I and Senator Inouye led were much impressed \nby the commitment and morale of the army forces deployed to Bosnia.\n  Major General Ellis deserves much of the credit for the recent \nsuccess of this mission.\n  Despite these positive indicators, we face dealing with Bosnia costs \nagain this year without a clear plan for the size of the force, OPTEMPO \nlevels or future mission objectives.\n  Further, no decisions have been made about the future funding for \nBosnia in the five year budget plan now under consideration by the \nDepartment of State.\n  Many of us agree we need more money for defense. The army cannot \ncontinue the Bosnia mission without additional funds.\n  As the Senate proceeds to the Defense appropriations bill for 1999, \nwe will have to consider further the approach the Senate will take for \nBosnia.\n  If our forces are to remain, and potentially face additional \nresponsibilities for Kosovo, we must decide how much we are prepared to \nspend, and whether these amounts will come from within the current \ndefense caps, or with additional real appropriations.\n  I appreciate the willingness of the managers to provide me this \nopportunity to discuss these amendments, and for their concern about \nthe impact of Bosnia on the well-being of the men and women of the \nArmed Forces.\n\n\n                       vote on amendment no. 3011\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the Byrd amendment. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Roth) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Hutchinson) is \nabsent due to a death in the family.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from Montana (Mr. Baucus), and the Senator from Ohio (Mr. \nGlenn) are necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) is absent \ndue to family illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nOregon (Mr. Wyden) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 39, nays 53, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 180 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--39\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McConnell\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Stevens\n     Torricelli\n\n                                NAYS--53\n\n     Allard\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--8\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Glenn\n     Hutchinson\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Specter\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 3011) was rejected.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was rejected.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3010\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Gramm amendment \nnumbered 3010 is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3010) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3016\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand now that there is one other \namendment that will be disposed of without a recorded vote, and then we \nwould be prepared to go to final passage.\n  But before we do that, I think it is appropriate that we pause just \nfor a few minutes so that Senator Daschle, and I, on behalf of the \nentire Senate, can express our appreciation and our admiration for the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  All Senators who would like to express their appreciation and their \naffection for this distinguished Senator should feel free to do so \nafter the vote on final passage, and put their remarks in the Record. I \nknow that every Senator will want to do that.\n  But I think it is appropriate that we name this bill the ``Strom \nThurmond National Defense Authorization Act of 1999.'' Just think for a \nminute what\n\n[[Page S7157]]\n\nthis man has done. He is truly one of the legends of the last half \ncentury in this country. Certainly he has had a profound impact on the \nU.S. Senate, with his perserverance, his unfailing gentlemanliness, his \nrespect for each one of us, the institution, and his strong feelings \nabout the importance of national defense for our country.\n  This is a man who has served in a way that probably would take six \nothers of us to even come close to. He was a two-star major general. He \nwas in the Army Reserve after he served in World War II, where he was a \nhero, having crashed behind enemy lines. He was a judge. He is an \nauthor, an attorney, a schoolteacher, Governor, Senator, and \nPresidential candidate.\n  In short, in my opinion, he is ``Mr. Defense'' in the Senate. I think \nthat after all he has done for us as individuals and for this country \nthat it is appropriate tonight that we express our appreciation to him \nfor his leadership, for the tremendous job that he does in getting \nthese important bills through the Senate. They are never easy. The \ndefense authorization bill always takes time and effort. But he is here \nready to do battle for what he feels so strongly about--and that is the \ndefense of our country.\n\n  So, Senator Thurmond, we thank you for what you have done for this \ncountry. We thank you for what you have done in this Senate, and it is \na great honor for me to join others in supporting the naming of this \nlegislation in your honor.\n  Thank you, sir.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to join the majority leader in \nthis tribute this evening and in cosponsoring the amendment to name the \n1999 defense authorization bill after the distinguished chairman.\n  Senator Thurmond joined the Armed Services Committee in January 1959, \nduring the 86th Congress. He has served continuously for 40 years on \nthe committee since then, a truly remarkable achievement.\n  When Senator Thurmond joined the committee, its membership, included \na number of Senators who would go on to greatness, and whose names \nwould become synonymous with a strong national defense: Richard \nRussell, John Stennis, Henry Jackson, to name a few.\n  Over the past 40 years, Senator Thurmond's name has become synonymous \nwith a strong national defense.\n  A lot has certainly changed over the 40 years that our chairman has \nbeen on that committee.\n  One of the first bills the committee addressed in 1959 was a bill to \nextend the draft. Today, of course, we rely on volunteers--both men and \nwomen--to man the force.\n  When Senator Thurmond joined the committee, the cold war was raging, \nand the flash points of the Cuban missile crisis was just a few years \naway. Today, of course, with the collapse of the Soviet empire, the \ncold war is largely a matter for the history books, and the military is \nrepositioning itself to meet the challenges of the next century.\n  During Senator Thurmond's tenure on the Armed Services Committee, our \nNation's military has responded to the challenges of every sort in \nevery corner of the globe: Western Europe, Vietnam, Middle East, the \nCaribbean basin, the Persian Gulf, and today in Central Europe.\n  His steadfast commitment to national defense, and to the men and \nwomen in uniform, has been instrumental in ensuring that our military \nhas always been ready to answer the call whenever and wherever needed.\n  From the day he was first commissioned as a Reserve second lieutenant \nin 1924 until today where he serves as the chairman of the Committee on \nArmed Services, Strom Thurmond has dedicated his life to national \nservice and America's military.\n  I don't know of a more fitting tribute or a more fitting way with \nwhich to say thank you to this leader, to this patriot than to name the \ndefense authorization bill after him tonight.\n  On behalf of all of our colleagues, I congratulate our chairman, \nStrom Thurmond.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, words cannot express how I feel. I thank \nthe majority leader and the minority leader for those kind words.\n  It has been a pleasure to serve in the Senate and serve on the Armed \nServices Committee all these years. We have the greatest country in the \nworld. And what is more important than national defense, preserving \nthis Nation that serves us all so well, gives us more freedom, more \nliberty than any country in the world?\n  I thank from the bottom of my heart Senator Lott, the distinguished \nmajority leader, and the distinguished minority leader for what he had \nto say. And I thank all of you for your cooperation. We could not have \ngotten through this bill or all the other bills in the past without \nyour cooperation. Every one of you are true patriots. We are proud of \nyou.\n  And, again, all I can say is thank you, thank you, thank you.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge the adoption of the Warner-Levin-Lott-Daschle \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3016) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, the remaining item prior to final \npassage is the Burns amendment, and according to the unanimous consent \nrequest relative to MilCon, 5 minutes equally divided, McCain second-\ndegree amendment to the Burns amendment, Senator McCain recognized for \n5 minutes, and Senator Stevens not to exceed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2728\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we offered this amendment earlier in the \nevening, and we gave our points as to why this addition of 22 new \nprojects is being put on the defense authorization.\n  These are quality-of-life projects. All of them stood the criteria of \nbeing added and requested by the Defense Department, and so we added \nthem, because if there is one thing that we are noticing as we visit \nour bases around this country and around the world, it is a \ndeteriorating quality of life and also the retention--keeping some of \nour most skilled military people in place.\n  So in this bill, all these projects have passed the criteria. They \nare for child care centers and health care centers, living quarters, \nand dining facilities and recreation facilities that have been \nrequested by our military.\n  I thank the managers for accepting this, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be brief; the hour is late.\n  We have presently, Mr. President, 11,800 families who are eligible \nfor food stamps. We have a hemorrhaging of qualified men and women out \nof the military. We are now dropping down, as far as our standards for \nrecruiting, to a lower level than any time since the Vietnam war.\n  All objective observers recognize that we are not modernizing our \nforce, nor are we maintaining a level of readiness that is necessary \nobviously to carry out our responsibilities. And what we are finding \nmore and more is an increasingly dangerous world. So when, as happens \naround here from time to time, $200 million was found and appeared, of \ncourse one might suppose that those pressing issues might be addressed. \nBut, no; they came up with a list of 22, guess what, MilCon projects.\n  I looked at the MilCon projects and examined them and had some study \ndone by experts, and I could find only one commonality to these \nprojects, and that is that 90 percent of them happened to be in the \nState or districts of members of the Appropriations Committees.\n  I also found out that the Army got nine projects, one of which was on \nthe unfunded priority list of the Chief of Staff of the Army. Two \nprojects were removed from the original amendment because they could \nnot be completed in the Future Years Defense Plan. So did the committee \ngo to the list of priorities to find the next two most deserving \nprojects? No. They found two other\n\n[[Page S7158]]\n\nlow priority projects from the same State.\n  The Air Force had 40 items of higher priority projects on this list, \nonly 40, about $2 billion worth of projects which were assessed by the \nAir Force to be a higher property. The Army had nearly $2.5 billion \nworth of higher priority projects than any of these projects. The \nNavy's list of unfunded priorities totaled $2.1 billion. Funding \nanything on the unfunded priority list of the Chief of Naval Operations \nwould have been a higher priority since not one of these projects--not \none--was on the list of the Chief of Naval Operations.\n  The facts here are very interesting: 67 percent of the 27 projects \nwere not scheduled to be funded until the last 2 years of the Future \nYear's Defense Plan.\n  As I said before, not a single one was on the priority list of the \nNavy. None of the Air Force's top six unfunded quality-of-life projects \nmade this list. Only 1 of the top 15 did. Ninety percent, as I \nmentioned, of the construction projects in the amendment are to be \nbuilt in the States or districts of Senate and House Appropriations \nCommittee members.\n  Half of the added projects are for the Air Force. The Air Force is a \nfine, fine service, my friends, but it is the service that claims it \nwill be able to meet the new one-plus-one barracks living standard a \nfull 10 years ahead of any of the other services.\n  The Marine Corps gets one project--one project--and it was second to \nthe last on the Commandant's list. This is a service that will take \nnearly 40 years to meet the same standard as the Air Force 33 years \nafter the Air Force. The Navy gets 25 percent of the total number of \nprojects and 14 percent of the money. What is more egregious is the \nfact that the Navy won't get one priority project that the Navy asked \nfor.\n  Mr. President, these are quality-of-life projects. The Senator from \nMontana is right. But no objective observer can view this list as in \nany way addressing first the requirements of the military and much \nneeded improvements in the military, much less the military \nconstruction projects that are needed.\n  Mr. President, as I have said at the beginning of my comments, we \nlive in a very dangerous world. We will have some serious foreign \npolicy crises. I am not sure we have the military that is capable of \nmeeting some of these foreseeable threats, but I know that what we are \ndoing with this $200 million will not do a single thing to improve our \nability to meet that threat.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, does the Senator from Virginia seek time? \nThere is only 10 minutes remaining. Does he seek time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do seek to understand if the Senator from Virginia \nwishes to have some of the 10 minutes. I would be happy to yield some \ntime.\n  Mr. ROBB. If the Senator from Alaska would be kind enough to yield me \n30 seconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the Senator 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend, the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  I simply remind our fellow Senators that the force structure and end \nstrength of our armed services have been cut 30 percent in recent \nyears. Our overseas commitments have increased significantly. Our \nfunding for procurement is down 70 percent. If we are going to support \nthe soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who protect this country, we \nneed to make certain that we provide for the kinds of priorities that \nwill support them. And I join my friend from Arizona in being a scold \non this particular issue. I know it is popular, but we are not doing \nenough to provide the kind of support that we need for our services \ntoday. This is popular, but it is not the right kind of priority.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, military construction is down $2 billion \nfrom 2 years ago. It is down $700 million from last year. This is not \nan increase. To the contrary.\n\n  I do want to assure my friend from Arizona, if there was some test \nthat these projects had to be for members of the Appropriations \nCommittee, I can assure him there would be one for Alaska. There are \nnone for Alaska on this list. This is not a pork list. This is a list \nthat was prepared by our staff, the staff of the subcommittee headed by \nSenator Burns and part of the full committee staff working with the \nstaff from the Pentagon to find quality projects that could be \ncommenced in this next year that are ready to go.\n  We have, I think, a very good list. In times gone by, people have \nsaid we should not proceed with these projects unless they are \nauthorized, so we brought this amendment to this authorization bill to \nbe sure they would be authorized.\n  This is not an increase. We still will be $700 million below 1998 and \n$2 billion lower than 1997. I urge that Senator Burns' amendment be \nadopted.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts 1 minute, if \nhe wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to share with colleagues the \nfeelings expressed both by the Senator from Arizona and the Senator \nfrom Virginia. In the course of the last months, I heard from an \nextraordinary number of our people in uniform who are increasingly \npressured in ways that I think a lot of us have not necessarily been \nparticularly sensitive to or yet taken into account.\n  The operations pace, the pace of employment is such that even those \nReserve units that get called up and taken over to whether it is Bosnia \nor elsewhere, find themselves reassigned in certain ways that suddenly \nput them out on unemployment again.\n  The tension on families is having a profound impact on morale through \nall the services. But in addition to that, the retention rate for some \nof our most highly trained, highly skilled personnel is on a rapid \ndeclining trend.\n  I think we have an enormous amount of bipartisan thinking to do about \nhow we are going to address this new structure and these new demands. \nIt is service by service. The Coast Guard--Admiral Kramek, who retired \na few weeks ago, made very profound comments about the tensions in the \nCoast Guard with the increased duties they have. I think that is \nservice to service.\n  I simply say this is something we need to consider. It has a profound \nimpact on all of us, and I suppose we will.\n  I guess the other question I have is how the other 10 percent got in \nthere.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I only yielded 1 minute. I am sorry. I will only say \nthis: The most important thing in retention is quality of life and \ntreating military families properly. These are projects that are all \nquality-of-life projects. We do not have any pork in this amendment.\n  The Senator from Washington wishes to have time. Let me yield to the \nSenator----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 32 seconds left.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for 1 minute.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield the Senator 1 minute.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President. As the ranking member on \nmilitary construction, I assure my colleagues that we have worked very, \nvery carefully this year to go through the numerous requests and the \nneeds of the military. We are extremely aware of the quality-of-life \nneeds of our military, and they are reflected in this amendment that is \nbefore us.\n  This amendment adds child-care centers, inadequate housing \nconditions, old dining facilities and lack of physical fitness centers. \nThese are quality-of-life issues.\n  I have traveled out and talked to men and women on the military \nbases. These are the issues they are asking us to address, and these \nare the ones that are addressed in this amendment. We worked very \ncarefully in a bipartisan way to put these forward. I assure my \ncolleagues we have done it in a fair\n\n[[Page S7159]]\n\nmanner with the needs of the quality of life of our men and women in \nthe military in mind.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, during the last recess, I took a group of \nour people to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bosnia and Belgium. We talked \npersonally with members of the armed services and questioned them about \ntheir decisions, some of them, not to re-enlist.\n  When we come back from the recess, we will have the defense \nappropriations bill before us. There are initiatives in there to deal \nwith retention, to deal with additional quality-of-life issues, and to \ndeal with some of the basic problems with which the young people in our \nmilitary service are really trying to cope.\n  Mr. President, I had breakfast this morning with the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs. One of the great problems we have in deploying people now \nis very often husband and wife are in the same unit, and they are \nsubject to being deployed. We have to have, literally, foster parents \nto assure that these families are treated right while husband and wife \nare deployed abroad.\n\n  This is not a simple matter to deal with, and it does take money for \nmilitary construction to meet these needs. I hope that the Senate will \nbe ready for a debate when we get to the appropriations bill, because \nthere are some very controversial issues in there that we seek to \ninitiate to try to deal with the problems of families in the armed \nservices today.\n  I urge you to approve this as a quality-of-life amendment. I yield \nback the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge adoption of the amendment by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2728) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on final \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass? The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Roth) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from Arkansas (Mr. Hutchinson) is \nabsent due to a death in family.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) is \nabsent because of illness.\n  Mr. FORD.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as a wind-up, I would like to speak for \nabout 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for their support of \nthis bill. It was their suggestions and comments that make this a \nstrong bill--a bill that I am extremely proud will bear my name. I \nappreciate the support of the able majority leader, Senator Lott. As a \nformer member of the Armed Services Committee, I know he recognizes the \nimportance of this bill to the Nation and our military. I thank the \nable minority leader for his fine cooperation and leadership.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank the members of the Armed Services \nCommittee for their loyalty and support over the past years. I want to \nespecially recognize Senator Warner for his leadership during the past \nhours. It will serve him well in the future.\n  Finally, I want to recognize Senator Carl Levin, the ranking member \nof the Armed Services Committee. During the past 2 years, he has been \nmy friend and counsel. I have the highest respect for his abilities and \nconcern for the security of our Nation, I shall always call him my \nfriend.\n  In closing, I want to recognize the hard work of the staff--both on \nthe committee and in the personal offices. Under the leadership of the \nstaff directors Les Brownlee and David Lyles; they have accomplished \nwonders.\n  I would be remiss if I did not recognize the work of the floor staff. \nThey have spent countless and dedicated hours supporting the Senators \nand our staffs. Without their efforts, it would have been impossible to \npass this bill.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill for our Nation and most important \nto the men and women who wear the uniforms of our military services. It \nis and always will be my greatest honor to be associated with these \npatriots.\n  I thank the President and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me join Senator Thurmond, our chairman, \nin thanking a number of people, the members of our committee. Let me \nnot single out anybody, but I do want to pay a special tribute to \nSenator Warner, Senator Thurmond's loyal lieutenant, who really worked \nalong with Senator Thurmond and made it possible.\n  We have great members of this Armed Services Committee who worked \nwith us on a bipartisan basis--David Lyles on our side and staff on our \nside, Les Brownlee and staff on the Republican side, working together, \nall the time, to try to fashion a bill on which all of us at the end \ncan come together.\n  We want to thank our leaders, Senator Lott, Senator Daschle who \nworked so hard to make this kind of effort happen in just a few days. \nIt seemed like a long period of time this was on the floor, but as \ncomplicated a bill as this is, and involving as many issues and as much \nmoney as this bill does, we really, I think, disposed of this bill with \ngreat dispatch as well as bipartisanship.\n  This bill is a tribute to Senator Thurmond. Many have paid tribute to \nhim tonight, and I won't repeat that except to say I will always \nremember this evening, naming a bill that strengthens our national \nsecurity after Senator Strom Thurmond, who has meant so much to the \nnational security of this country.\n  It has been a real pleasure and an honor to work with Senator \nThurmond. I know that my staff, our staff here, as well as all the \nmembers of the committee on both sides of the aisle felt very, very \ngood that this bill was named after Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I first want to thank my distinguished \nchairman who has been like a big brother to\n\n[[Page S7160]]\n\nme during my 19 years on the Senate and whose steady hand has remained \non the helm of this committee for years, to give us the guidance and \ncounsel that is so valued by all of us. All members of the Armed \nServices Committee have joined in the tribute.\n  I ask unanimous consent all members of the Armed Services Committee \nbe made cosponsors of the amendment that the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan and I, together with our respective leaders, put forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, I join Senator Thurmond and Senator \nLevin in extending our great appreciation to Colonel Brownlee, George, \nDavid Lyles, and all others, and those who represent the Senators who \nhave worked so hard on this bill and could not. We could not have a \nbill of this magnitude without their help. That is night and day and \nweekends. Colonel Browning said there would be no weekend off this \nweekend. I hate to pass that on.\n  Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Michigan. We \ncame to the Senate together, and God willing, we will work together in \nfuture years. We so rarely have a cross word between us. I thank him \nfor his kind remarks.\n  Mr. President, now on behalf of the distinguished chairman, Mr. \nThurmond, I ask unanimous consent that S. 2057, as amended, be printed \nas passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. On behalf of the distinguished chairman, I ask further \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed immediately to the \nconsideration en bloc of S. 2058 through S. 2060, Calendar Order \nNumbers 365, 366, and 367; that all after the enacting clause of those \nbills be stricken and that the appropriate portion of S. 2057, as \namended, be inserted in lieu thereof, as follows:\n  In lieu of S. 2058, Insert Division C of S. 2057, as Passed;\n  In lieu of S. 2059, Insert Division B of S. 2057, as Passed;\n  In lieu of S. 2060, Insert Division A of S. 2057, as Passed; and that \nthese bills be advanced to third reading and passed; that the motion to \nreconsider en bloc be laid upon the table; and that the above actions \noccur without intervening action or debate.\n\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate Report No. 105-189, \nthe report to the Committee on Armed Services on S. 2060, be deemed to \nbe the report of the committee accompanying S. 2057.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2058) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n  (The text of S. 2058 will appear in a future edition of the Record.)\n  The bill (S. 2059) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n  (The text of S. 2059 will appear in a future edition of the Record.)\n  The bill (S. 2060) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n  (The text of S. 2060 will appear in a future edition of the Record.)\n  Mr. WARNER. On behalf of our distinguished chairman, Mr. President, \nwith respect to H.R. 3616, the House-passed version of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, is named in honor of \nour distinguished chairman. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nturn to its immediate consideration; that all after the enacting clause \nbe stricken and the text of S. 2057, as passed, be submitted in lieu \nthereof; that the bill be advanced to third reading and passed; that \nthe title of S. 2057 be substituted for the title of H.R. 3616; that \nthe Senate insist on its amendments to the bill and the title and agree \nto or request a conference, as appropriate, with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses and the Chair be recognized to \nappoint conferees; that the motion to reconsider the above-mentioned \nvote be laid upon the table; and that the foregoing occur without \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3616), as amended, was considered, read the third \ntime, and passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER appointed Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Warner, Mr. McCain, \nMr. Coats, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nSantorum, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bingaman, \nMr. Glenn, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Robb, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Cleland, \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7096-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 2057, S. 2058, S. 2059 and S. 2060\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF COLONEL RON FRANKS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fine Marine \nOfficer, Colonel Ron Franks, the Deputy Legislative Assistant to the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps, who will soon retire from active duty.\n  Colonel Franks' career began more than twenty-five years ago, \nfollowing his graduation from the University of Central Texas, when he \nbecame a Marine aviator flying the venerable Huey helicopter. A few \nyears later, Ron Franks switched from rotor wing aircraft to fixed \nwing, becoming a C-130 pilot, but flying some of the world's most \nadvanced aircraft would not be the limit of this officer's duties.\n  In a career as long as the one Colonel Franks has had, one is bound \nto have some interesting and challenging tasks and assignments. In the \ncase of Ron Franks, his experiences have ranged from leading Marine \naviators into combat during Operation Desert Storm as the squadron \ncommander of VMGR-252 to helping the Commandant of the Marine Corps \nmonitor the activities of the Legislative Branch. Without question, he \nwas most efficient and successful in his duties monitoring Congress and \nworking to represent the interests and concerns of the Marine Corps. \nAdditionally, the Colonel is a graduate of the Naval War College, and \nearned a master's degree in business administration from Boston \nUniversity, both of which are excellent indications not only of his \ncommitment to seeking professional and personal improvement, but of the \nhigh caliber individual who serves as an officer of Marines. Finally, \nin almost three decades of service, Ron Franks has amassed an \nimpressive list of awards and recognitions which include the Defense \nMeritorious Service Medal, the Meritorious Service Medal, and the Navy \nand Marine Corps Commendation Medal.\n  As Colonel Franks prepares to end his military service, I am certain \nthat he will be missed by all those who have worked with him and come \nto know him. He has rendered the Nation a great service through his \ncareer as a Marine Officer and we are grateful for the sacrifices he \nhas made in order that the United States may remain free and safe. I \nwish Colonel Franks, his wife Debby, and their children Kristen and \nKimberly much health and happiness in the years ahead.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7160-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7161]]\n            60TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, sixty years ago today, President \nRoosevelt signed into law an historic piece of legislation. The Fair \nLabor Standards Act established a number of basic protections for \nworkers, including one of the great landmarks of American law--the \nfederal minimum wage.\n  President Roosevelt called that Act ``the most far-reaching, far-\nsighted program for the benefit of workers ever adopted here or in any \nother country.''\n  And he was right. 700,000 workers got a raise in 1938. The minimum \nwage helped pull the country out of the Great Depression. And, in the \ndecades that followed, it helped to lift millions of working families \nout of poverty.\n  Our standard of living has improved steadily and dramatically since \n1938. And, for thirty years, the minimum wage kept pace with those \nimprovements.\n  But the last thirty years have seen an about-face. The real value of \nthe minimum wage has dropped steeply since 1968. To have the purchasing \npower today that it had thirty years age, the minimum wage would have \nto be $7.38 and hour--40% higher than its current level of $5.15.\n  Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, minimum wage workers today \nearn just $10,700 a year--$2,900 below the poverty level for a family \nof three. In the midst of what many experts are calling ``the best \neconomy ever,'' 12 million Americans are earning poverty-level wages.\n  For them survival is the daily goal. If they work hard enough and \ntheir hours are long enough, they can make ends meet--but only barely. \nThey don't have time for their families. They can't participate in \nactivities with their children. They can't afford to buy birthday \npresents or do the countless other things that most of us take for \ngranted.\n  We know who minimum wage workers are. They are teachers' aides and \nhome health aides. They care for our children in child care centers and \nour parents and grandparents in nursing homes. They sell us goods at \nthe corner store, and serve us coffee at the local coffee shop.\n  They clean office buildings in communities across the country.\n  They are workers like Valerie Bell, a custodian for a contractor in \nBaltimore, who told us what a higher minimum wage means in human terms. \nFor workers and their families, it means far more than dollars and \ncents. It means dignity. As she said, ``We no longer have to receive \nfood stamps or other social services to supplement our incomes. We can \nfix up our homes and invest in our neighborhoods. We can spend more at \nthe local grocery store.\n  We can work two low-wage jobs, rather than three low-wage jobs, and \nspend more time with our families. Our utilities won't be cut off. We \ncan pay the medical bills we accumulated from not having health \nbenefits in our jobs.''\n  That's why we say now is the time to raise the minimum wage. Our \nproposal will raise the minimum wage by 50 cents on January 1, 1999 and \n50 cents more on January 1, 2000--bringing the minimum wage to $6.15 an \nhour at the turn of the century. Twelve million working families across \nthe country deserve no less.\n  Our Republican friends just cut capital gains taxes for the \nwealthiest Americans by more than $300 million over the next five \nyears. Yet they oppose giving minimum wage workers an additional $1 an \nhour. ``Let them eat cake,'' they say.\n  Plums for the rich and crumbs for everyone else is the wrong \npriority. We need to do more for hard-working families in communities \nacross America, and we can do more. We can raise the minimum wage. And \nwith the strong support of President Clinton and Democrats in the \nSenate and House, we will raise it.\n  I intend to offer the minimum wage on the first available legislation \nafter the July 4th recess. No one who works for a living should have to \nlive in poverty.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nanniversary of the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act and the \nestablishment of the federal minimum wage. For sixty years, this law \nhas provided hardworking Americans a promise--a promise that, in this \ncountry, we value the labor of all of our workers.\n  Over the last several decades, we have kept that promise by \nperiodically raising the minimum wage. We have passed legislation six \ntimes since 1955 to ensure that this vital safety net is not just \nsymbolic, but, instead, a true standard of decency. It is time to do \nthis again.\n  Just like investors who expect a fair return for the money they put \ninto the stock market, workers should expect a fair return for the \nlabor they invest. In today's thriving economy, investors have gotten \nback more than they could have hoped for. Those making minimum wage, \nhowever, have seen a declining return on their investment. An hour of \nwork does not give back what it used to.\n  In 1997 dollars, the minimum wage of today is more than two dollars \nless than what it was in the late 1960s. Our parents' generation had a \nminimum wage equivalent to $7.33. Now our children--despite an \nunparalleled booming economy--are faced with a minimum wage that places \nthem below the poverty level.\n  That, Mr. President, is outrageous. People who work forty hour weeks \nyear round, trying to provide for themselves and their families, are \nfinding that their efforts are just not enough.\n  Perhaps, most troubling of all, this low minimum wage is having a \ndisproportionately devastating effect on working moms. Sixty-two \npercent of all minimum wage workers are women, many the sole heads of \ntheir households. Where do these moms turn when they can't provide for \ntheir hungry children?\n  Many have been forced to seek outside assistance. Last year, a US \nConference of Mayors study indicated that eighty-six percent of cities \nreported an increased demand for emergency food assistance. Thirty-\neight percent of those people seeking food at soup kitchens and \nshelters were employed. This is an increase of fifteen percent since \n1994.\n  This new trend is alarming. In a nation as great as ours, in a time \nas prosperous as this one, we should guarantee the American people \nthat, if they are willing to work, then they will be able to live off \nof their income; they will be able to feed their children; they will be \nable to afford clothing and shelter, and they will be able to live \ntheir lives with basic dignity and fair compensation.\n  I call upon my colleagues to raise the minimum wage so that we can \nhelp millions of working people lift themselves up from poverty. \nOpponents of the minimum wage claim that we cannot afford to do this. \nBut, for the most vulnerable in America's workforce, the truth is that \nwe simply cannot afford not to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7161-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7161-S7162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRULY A BRIGHT IDEA: NO COST TO TAXPAYERS\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, it is an exciting development that the \nelectrical cooperatives in North Carolina are improving public \neducation and the quality of classroom instruction without spending a \ndime of the taxpayer's money.\n  Since 1994, the electrical cooperatives in my state have sponsored a \ngrant program for teachers called ``Bright Ideas'', and it has been a \nroaring success--encouraging creative teaching by awarding grants of up \nto $2,000 to K-12 teachers in annual competitions. There is no \nrestriction on subject matter to apply; in fact, Mr. President, \nteachers are not required to teach in a cooperative service area to \ncompete.\n  Teachers need only to show that they are using original, innovative \nideas to improve the education of young people. These new teaching \nmethods range from reading and music programs to creative math and \nscience programs; from research involving computers and video \ntechnology to career-oriented programs to prepare teenagers for the \nworking world. 2,000 teachers applied to cooperatives for grants this \nyear, and more than 400 classrooms in North Carolina became ``Bright \nIdeas'' classrooms.\n  Mr. President, North Carolina's electric cooperatives operate in 93 \nof our 100 counties, providing power to almost a quarter of our state's \npopulation. Most members of these cooperatives aren't walking around \nwith deep-pockets. They're hard-working folks in rural areas who \nrecognize the value of a good education.\n\n[[Page S7162]]\n\n  The ``Bright Ideas'' program initiated by these fine people continues \nto flourish. In 1994, North Carolina's electric cooperatives authorized \na collaborative statewide effort and allocated $225,000 annually for \nBright Ideas for a five-year period. But a funny thing happened, Mr. \nPresident. These grants proved so successful that individual \ncooperatives are getting into the act and supplementing already \nallocated funds with money of their own. Their initiative will allow \nthe cooperatives to award more than $1 million dollars in grants a full \nyear ahead of schedule.\n  In fact, Chuck Terrill, Executive Vice-President and CEO of the North \nCarolina Electric Membership Corporation says that ``Bright Ideas'' \ngrants for North Carolina's school will top $1.5 million by the end of \nthe 1998-1999 school year.\n  Mr. President, ``Bright Ideas'' is just one of the many ways the \nmembers of North Carolina's electric cooperatives help their \ncommunities and support their public schools. I congratulate them for \nseeing a need and providing precious resources to challenge the \nchildren in North Carolina's classrooms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7161-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today the United States Supreme Court held \nthe Line Item Veto Act unconstitutional. I voted against that Act when \nit was considered by the Senate and joined the senior Senator from West \nVirginia and others in warning giving the President, any President, \nline item veto authority would result in a dramatic shift in power from \nthe legislative branch to the executive branch that was inconsistent \nwith the constitutional principles of separation of powers. We warned \nthat this shift in power that would damage our fundamental principle of \nmajority rule, encourage horse trading between Members of Congress and \nthe President, and not reduce the deficit in any meaningful way. \nUnfortunately, all of those warnings have come true.\n  In 1997 I called upon Congress to admit its mistake and repeal this \nunconstitutional Act before the courts struck it down. Congress was \ngiven a second opportunity to correct its ill-considered action when \nthe Supreme Court dismissed, on the limited ground of lack of standing, \nthe challenge brought by Senator Byrd. In that case, Byrd v. Raines, \nDistrict Judge Jackson had ruled that the Act violated the \nConstitution.\n  Having failed to do its job properly, the majority in Congress is now \nconfronted with a Supreme Court that was forced to do the Congress' \njob. Consistent with its judicial power under the Constitution, the \nSupreme Court has once again had to preserve the Constitution from \nlegislative attack. As it did when it defended the First Amendment from \nbeing undermined by the so-called Communications Decency Act, and when \nit defended federalism against the encroachment of the Brady Act, here \nagain the Supreme Court has been called upon to preserve, protect and \ndefend the Constitution. As a Senator who voted against these measures \nin spite of their momentary popularity, and as a Vermonter who \ncherishes the Constitution and the freedoms that it guarantees, I thank \nthe Court for its service.\n  I have long been concerned that the line item veto encourages \nminority rule by allowing a presidential item veto to stand with the \nsupport of only 34 Senators or 146 Representatives. That is not \nmajority rule. Those anti-democratic super-majority requirements are \nfundamentally at odds with the principles underlying legislative \naction.\n  Our Founders rejected such super-majority requirements on matters \nwithin Congress' purview. Alexander Hamilton described super-majority \nrequirements as a ``poison'' that serves ``to destroy the energy of the \ngovernment, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an \ninsignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto to the regular deliberations \nand decisions of a respectable majority.'' Such super-majority \nrequirements reflect a basic distrust not just of Congress, but of the \nelectorate itself.\n  In addition, these super-majority requirements hurt small states, \nlike my home State of Vermont, by upping the ante for those who dare \ntake on the President. Under the line item veto, Members from small \nstates have to convince two-thirds of each House to override the \nPresident's veto for the sake of a project. With Vermont having only \none representative in the House, why would other Members risk the \nPresident's wrath to help us with a vetoed project? It is truly a task \nfor Hercules to override a veto. Just look at the record--of the more \nthan 2,500 Presidential vetoes in our history, Congress has been able \nto override 105.\n  As the senior Senator from West Virginia has so forcefully argued, we \nshould tread carefully when expanding the fiscal powers of the \npresidency. The line item veto would have weakened one of the \nfundamental checks and balances that form the separation of powers \nunder our Constitution. The line item veto would have handed over the \npower of the purse to the President.\n  I have heard the howls of some of my colleagues who lost worthy \nappropriations since the approval of the line item veto. And what if \nthe President makes a mistake by line item vetoing a worthy project? \nThe Administration even admitted that it mistakenly vetoed some \nprojects. Do Senators trust the bureaucrats over at the Office of \nManagement and Budget to decide, within a few short days, which \nprojects are deserving and which are not? Is that consistent with the \nFounders' vision?\n  I was born and raised in Vermont and go home almost every weekend. I \nam confident that I have a better sense of Vermont than someone who \nthinks Vermont is an avenue that lies somewhere between K and L streets \nin northwest Washington, D.C.\n  Let us keep the power of the purse with Congress--where it belongs. \nAs the Ranking Member of the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee, I am frequently called upon to visit emerging\n\n[[Page S7163]]\n\ndemocracies. I often hear praise of our system of checks and balances \nand, in particular, the genius of having the power to spend reside in \nthe legislative branch, not the executive. Many officials from new \ndemocracies believe that a legislature's power over the purse is the \nbest weapon to fight the tyranny of a dictatorship. They have been \nthere. They know. And it has proven to be so historically.\n  In his concurring opinion today in Clinton v. City of New York, \nJustice Kennedy noted:\n\n       Separation of powers helps to ensure the ability of each \n     branch to be vigorous in asserting its proper authority. . . \n     . By increasing the power of the President beyond what the \n     Framers envisioned, the statute compromises the political \n     liberty of our citizens, liberty which the separation of \n     powers seeks to secure.\n\n  As I said in the Senate debate on the Line Item Veto Act and in \nSenate debate on proposals to amend the Constitution with a balanced \nbudget amendment, the Constitution is as good a law as has been \nwritten. That is why it has survived as the supreme law of the land \nwith so few alterations throughout the last 200 years. It has \ncontributed to our success as a nation by binding us together, rather \nthan tearing us apart.\n\n  It contains the Great Compromise that allowed small states and large \nstates to join together in a spirit of mutual accommodation and \nrespect. It embodies the protections that make real the pronouncements \nin our historic Declaration of Independence and give meaning to our \ninalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n  The Constitution requires due process and guarantees equal protection \nof the law. It protects our freedom of thought and expression, our \nfreedom to worship or not as each of us chooses, and our political \nfreedoms, as well. It is the basis for our fundamental right of privacy \nand for limiting government's intrusions and burdens in our lives.\n  I have opposed what I perceive to be a growing fascination with \nlaying waste to our Constitution and the protections that have served \nus well for over 200 years. The First Amendment, separation of powers \nand power of the purse should be supported and defended. That is the \noath we all swore when we entered this public service. That is our duty \nto those who forged this great document, our responsibility to those \nwho sacrificed to protect and defend our Constitution, our commitment \nto our constituents and our legacy to those who will succeed us.\n  In this Congress we have seen over 100 constitutional amendments \nproposed. Yesterday, the Judiciary Committee voted to report an \namendment that would cut back on the First Amendment for the first time \nin our nation's history. Today, the Committee was considering a second \nproposed amendment to the Constitution in as many days. Proposed \namendments to our fundamental charter require consideration whether \nthey are, in the language of Article V of the Constitution, \nconstitutionally ``necessary''. I hope that we will not burden the \nstates with a hodgepodge of poll-driven, popular sounding \nconstitutional amendments.\n  This Senate only barely rejected the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution last year. I recall all too well when we were told that we \ncould never achieve a balanced budget without a constitutional \namendment. I recall the stacks of deficit-laden federal budgets \nproposed by Republican and Democratic Presidents since President \nJohnson and being told that the only answer to annual budget deficits \nwas to pass an ill-conceived constitutional amendment whose terms and \neffects could not be explained.\n  I asked then why it is necessary to seek to amend the Constitution? \nIf Congress could get close to a two-thirds majority vote to support a \nconstitutional amendment declaring that we would normally balance the \nbudget, we should be able to achieve a simple majority that will \nactually vote to reduce the deficit and pass a balanced budget.\n  I defended the Constitution during the course of the balanced budget \namendment debate last year and this year President Clinton sent us the \nfirst balanced budget in almost 30 years. What some said could not \nhappen without a constitutional amendment, did happen. With cooperation \nin the Congress, we can enact the first balanced budget since 1969, and \nwe will have done it without inserting a fiscal straightjacket on \nfuture generations into the text of the United States Constitution.\n  They said it could not be done, but it can, as a result of the sound \nfiscal policies of this Administration which have led not only to \nbalance but to the prospect of budget surplus. In 1993, a Democratic \nCongress put us on the right road to fiscal responsibility when we took \nthe hard votes and passed the President's plan. This Congress should \nculminate that extraordinary 5-year effort without further delay.\n  April 15 was the legal deadline for Congress to have passed a budget \nresolution. While the Senate did some preliminary work on a flawed \nproposal earlier this year, Congress is recessing again this week \nwithout completing this fundamental task. The Senate should spend less \ntime seeking to rewrite the work of the Framers and show more courage \nin completing its legislative responsibilities.\n  I hope that as Congress leaves for the Independence Day recess, we \nwill reflect on what makes this country great, and that the majority \nwill return committed to completing work on a balanced budget to serve \nthe American people without additional delay. It should be balanced in \ntwo senses: It should be a balanced series of proposals to meet the \nhealth, education, environmental and law enforcement needs of the \ncountry. And it should also, for the first time in almost three \ndecades, be a budget that will not rely on deficit financing.\n  Completing action on the budget is the first step toward Congress \ntaking action on the annual appropriations bills that are so important \nto the government programs that protect the environment and assist \nState and local governments with education and law enforcement. Those \ncontracting with the government, those working in partnership with \ngovernment services and those dependent on government services deserve \nbetter. Americans deserve peace of mind and the assurance that their \ngovernment is working. Congress needs to complete its budget and \nappropriations legislation so that the agencies and service providers \ncan plan programs, pay workers and serve the American public in an \neffective manner.\n  It is high time for the congressional leadership to do its job and \nfor the Congress to get on about the business of governing. Congress \nshould not be taking breaks without having completed the work of the \npeople. Such callous disregard for the needs of the American people has \nbecome too much the rule as year after year under Republican leadership \nCongress recesses without having completed its work on emergency \nsupplementals, budgets, and appropriations bills. Republican \ncongressional leadership is well-known for shutting down the government \nby not completing work on these basic measures in a timely way.\n  The Senate will also recess again this week without having passed a \nstrong tobacco bill. Tobacco legislation is now added to the litany of \nimportant matters the Congress has left unfinished--added to the \nbudget, campaign finance reform, and the prompt consideration of the \nmany fine men and women the President has nominated to long vacant \nfederal judgeships across the country.\n  I urge that when Congress reconvenes in July and in the 11 weeks in \nsession left in this congressional year, it take seriously its \nresponsibilities to the American people and show respect and \nappreciation for the Constitution by working to fulfil our legislative \nresponsibilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7162-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7163-S7164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ARIZONA'S ELECTRIC POWER COMPETITION ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today as a member of the Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee to call attention to newly enacted \nlegislation in my state of Arizona that stands as a model for opening \nelectric power markets to competition and customer choice.\n  Under the Electric Power Competition Act signed into law May 29 by \nArizona Governor Jane D. Hull, Arizona's public power utilities must \nopen 20 percent of their markets to competition\n\n[[Page S7164]]\n\nby December 31 of this year and 100 percent to competition by December \n31, 2000.\n  Residents, businesses, and multi-national corporations served by \ncompanies like the Salt River Project, a public power and water utility \nserving 670,000 customers in the greater Phoenix area, will gain more \ncontrol over where they spend their energy dollars. Customers will be \nable to shop for savings among sources of electricity, ultimately \nchoose billing and metering providers, and still depend on their local \nutility to provide reliable electric delivery and power backup \nservices.\n  The Arizona legislation requires affected utilities to reduce rates \nfor smaller customers at least 10 percent, as measured over a 10-year \nperiod, and caps rates for larger customers who choose to stay with \ntheir local utility. To protect consumers against deceptive marketing \npractices, power marketers can enroll customers only through written, \nsigned contracts--a provision specifically aimed at stopping the \nnotorious ``slamming'' and ``cramming'' abuses that have occurred with \ntelephone deregulation. Strict enforcement measures are included for \ncompanies that fail to comply. The legislation also mandates that \nArizona public utilities develop and pay for comprehensive public \neducation programs to inform customers about their choices.\n  While the new law does not apply to investor-owned utilities under \njurisdiction of the Arizona Corporation Commission, it creates a \nrelatively uncomplicated means for opening Arizona's entire electric \nmarket to competition. It will encourage the transition from monopoly \nto competitive services within a reasonable timeframe, and will allow \nutilities to recover costs of past investments made to meet growth \nneeds, but that could become ``stranded'' in a competitive market.\n  Improved services, economic efficiencies and new technologies should \nbe among outcomes. At the same time, the legislation offers Arizona \nelectric customers and suppliers a far less burdensome way of achieving \nchoice than the costly plan adopted by California with effects that, so \nfar, have slowed the development of competition. By contrast, Arizona's \nlegislation strikes a balance between benefits stemming from free \nmarkets and the public interest in maintaining an economically secure, \nenvironmentally responsible electric infrastructure.\n  Arizona's Electric Power Competition Act was passed with support of \nmajor industries, consumer groups, low-income advocates, and the \nstate's largest investor-owned utility, Arizona Public Service Company. \nIt puts Arizona in the forefront of the nation's move to electric \ncompetition and establishes a policy that other states would do well to \nconsider.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7163-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7164-S7166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     KYOTO PROTOCOL IMPLEMENTATION\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Last week, the administration's climate change \nnegotiators returned from Bonn, Germany.\n  These negotiators were in Bonn from June 2 through the 12 with their \ncounterparts from many other countries, working out the details of how \nto implement the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change.\n  Mr. President, people often say ``the devil's in the details'' and I \nthink we have a case here with this Kyoto Protocol where the devil is \ndefinitely there--in the details.\n  So, that is just what I want to talk about today--the details.\n  Back in October of last year, President Clinton outlined his climate \nchange proposal during a speech. If it seems strange that I have to \nrefer to the text of a speech to describe the administration's climate \nchange proposal, I have to do that, because the speech is all we have.\n  Last year, I, along with Senators Craig, Hagel, and Helms, asked the \nGeneral Accounting Office to review the administration's climate change \nproposal. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held a hearing \nearlier this month on GAO's results so far.\n  The Office of Management and Budget told the GAO auditors that the \nAdministration has no documentation of its climate change proposal, \nbeyond the President's speech last October. The speech is the plan. I \nmust admit, I was amazed by this.\n  The administration is asking for an increase of $6.3 billion over the \nnext five years for its climate change program, and the documentation \nof that program is a speech that is about 3 or 4 pages long. Out in the \nbusiness world, you don't get $6.3 billion in financing based on a \nthree page proposal.\n  So, in this brief climate change proposal, what do we find? We find a \nstatement of the administration's principles for addressing climate \nchange.\n  One of the administration's principles on climate change is: \n``Developing Countries Must Participate.''\n  The President's climate change proposal says: ``The President has \ncommitted that the United States will not adopt binding obligations \nwithout developing country participation.''\n  Take note that this statement came from the Administration prior to \nthe Kyoto negotiations, when the administration conveniently abandoned \nthat principle, in order to come home with some kind of agreement to \nshow everyone how successful they were.\n  The administration still claims to be committed to ``meaningful \nparticipation''--whatever that means--by developing countries. In fact, \nMr. Dirk Forrister, the chairman of the White House Climate Change Task \nForce, told me during our hearing on June 4 that ``meaningful \nparticipation'' does include China and India.\n  So, the President's climate change proposal says you must have \ndeveloping country participation. Mr. Forrister tells me just three \nweeks ago that we must get China and India to participate.\n  But then, what happens in Bonn, Germany? Over 1200 negotiators met \nthere to start negotiating the details for the Kyoto treaty. The U.S. \nnegotiating team had over 25 members.\n  I wasn't at the Bonn meeting, so let me read from a report of what \nhappened in Bonn. This is from the Washington Times, June 13, 1998. The \nheadline is: ``Third World, EU knock U.S. effort on global warming. Two \nweek talks in Bonn end in impasse.'' The article says:\n\n       Third World and European nations dealt a blow to President \n     Clinton's effort to make the global warming treaty more \n     palatable to Americans at a negotiating session . . . in \n     Germany.\n       China and India, speaking for a group of 77 developing \n     countries, opposed even discussing proposals that would \n     require them to drastically cut so-called greenhouse gas \n     emissions as the United States and industrialized nations are \n     required to do under the treaty.\n\n  Let me repeat that: China and India . . . opposed even discussing \nproposals . . . that would require them to . . . cut . . . emissions.\n  What are we to make of this? The administration says China and India \nmust participate. Yet, in Bonn, China and India led an effort by \ndeveloping countries to oppose even talking about their participation.\n  Let me point out another disconnect. President Clinton's climate \nchange proposal says:\n\n       The President is committed to a market-based emissions \n     trading system, both domestically and internationally, that \n     will har- ness the power of the market to reduce emissions . \n     . .\n\n  The administration's climate change proposal states that an emissions \ntrading system will allow the United States to meet its reductions \ntargets ``with minimal economic costs.''\n  In fact, Janet Yellen, Chairman of the President's Council of \nEconomic Advisors, has testified before Congress that according to the \nadministration's economic analysis--the details of which, by the way, \nalmost no one is allowed to see--that Kyoto targets can be met for \nminimal costs.\n  We are just finding out how you meet the Kyoto targets so cheaply. \nApparently, the administration relies on achieving 85 percent of \nemissions reduction through emissions trading. They think we can ``buy \nour way out'' of the problem.\n  But let's see what happened in Bonn. What did the rest of the world \nhave to say about extensive use of emissions trading?\n  Again, let me quote from the Washington Times article:\n\n       The European Union said it would oppose extensive use of a \n     complicated [emissions trading] scheme Mr. Clinton devised to \n     ensure that Americans pay only modestly higher energy prices \n     under the treaty, saying the\n\n[[Page S7165]]\n\n     United States should bear the brunt of such costs, which \n     could total in the hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\n  So, here are the results of Bonn.\n  1. Developing countries are still saying ``not interested'' when it \ncomes to signing up for binding reduction targets.\n  2. Our European friends are saying, ``Hey America, you can't buy your \nway out of your commitments through emissions trading. We want you to \ntake more expensive action at home.\n  What kind of actions might we take to reduce emissions, if we can't \nrely on emissions trading? To answer that question, I think it's \nhelpful to look at the current situation.\n  Where do we currently get our electricity from? We generate 53 \npercent of our electricity from coal. The administration says coal \npollutes so we have to cut back on dramatically on how much we rely on \ncoal. We generate 18 percent of our electricity from nuclear power. \nThis is our largest emission-free source of power. I've talked about \nthis issue over the years and the percentage of nuclear keeps falling. \nA few years ago we were 22 percent nuclear, last year this figure was \nabout 20 percent. I think we should be clear about why this number is \nfalling.\n  We have an administration that won't deal with the nuclear waste \nproblem. We have a President who says he will veto our nuclear waste \nbill, which has passed both this Congress by wide margins. The bottom \nline is that we are at risk of losing our nuclear power.\n  We generate 14 percent from natural gas, but the administration has \nissued OCS moritoria and won't provide access to public lands for gas \nproduction, so there are limits to what gas can do.\n  We generate 10 percent from hydroelectric power--another emissions-\nfree source of electricity. But again, the Admin opposes hydropower and \nwe have a Secretary of the Interior who brags he will be the first \nInterior Secretary to tear down a dam.\n  We generate about 3 percent--a little bit under 3 percent--from waste \nor ``biomass''. This is electricity from burning wood, garbage, old \ntires. This isn't exactly a carbon-free activity, so we will have to \ncurtail our use of biomass for power production.\n  We generate 2 percent of our electricity from oil. Again, this is \nsomething unpopular with the administration. They are opposed to fossil \nfuel use, and they won't allow access to public lands for further oil \nexploration.\n  The remaining less than 0.1 percent comes from wind and solar. This \nis a very small percentage, yet the administration claims these are the \ntechnologies that will make-up for reductions in all the other sources. \nHow realistic is this?\n  The Sierra Club refers to wind turbines as ``cuisinarts for the \nbirds.'' Wind power also depends on a limited number of sites, with \nstrong, dependable winds.\n  Solar technology has many obvious shortcomings. First of all, the sun \ndoesn't shine at night. Also, solar panels take up a tremendous amount \nof space. It would take about 10,000 square miles of solar panels to \nreplace the 18 percent of our electricity generated with nuclear power. \nThis is about the size of the entire states of Vermont and Delaware, \ncombined.\n  So there are obvious limits to renewable resources, but there are \nplaces where they make sense. For instance, remote villages in Alaska, \nwhere electricity is now generated with diesel fuel for 30-40 cents per \nkilowatt hour. But for large populations these renewable technologies \nprobably are not feasible.\n  How does the President say we will meet our Kyoto targets? In \naddition to buying carbon credits from Russia and Ukraine, the \nPresident says we should increase energy efficiency . . . and ``pay the \nbill'' by deregulating electricity. I'm all for efficiency and rational \nderegulation . . . but if you've endangered your major sources of \ngeneration, efficiency and generation aren't much help.\n  The President is clearly pushing this issue off onto somebody else's \nwatch. So, where does this leave us? Well, we are headed into larger, \nhigher-level negotiations in Buenos Aires, Argentina this fall. Should \nwe be hopeful that we will have any better success than we did in Bonn?\n  Don't get me wrong. I happen to think that principles are a great \nthing to have. The point is you have to stick to them.\n  I fear that in Buenos Aires, the administration will once again be \ndesperate for the appearance of success. In their desperation, the \nadministration might conveniently abandon more of the principles they \nclaim to hold regarding what the U.S. should demand of the rest of the \nworld in a climate change treaty.\n  Mr. President, I have been watching these events unfold for some time \nnow. I have watched this climate change deal become more and more of a \nraw deal for Americans.\n  But to sum up, I don't think I can put it any better than one of my \nconstituents, Sam Tatum from Wasilla, Alaska. He wrote me a letter \nsaying ``this climate change treaty is bad news for our country.'' \nWell, Sam, hold on to your pocketbook and let's see what comes out of \nBuenos Aries.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Washington Times be \nprinted in the Record, plus a table.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 13, 1998]\n\n          Third World, EU Knock U.S. Effort on Global Warming\n\n                           (By Patrice Hill)\n\n       Third World and European nations dealt a blow to President \n     Clinton's efforts to make the global warming treaty more \n     palatable to Americans as a negotiating session that ended \n     yesterday in Germany.\n       China and India, speaking for a group of 77 developing \n     countries, opposed even discussing proposals that would \n     require them to drastically cut so-called greenhouse-gas \n     emissions as the United States and industrialized nations are \n     required to do under the treaty, said participants at the \n     Bonn talks.\n       And the European Union said it would oppose extensive use \n     of a complicated scheme Mr. Clinton devised to ensure that \n     Americans pay only modestly higher energy prices under the \n     treaty, saying the United States should bear the brunt of \n     such costs, which could total in the hundreds of billions of \n     dollars.\n       ``China and India pointed out that the industrialized world \n     still hasn't done anything to reduce emissions, and they \n     didn't feel it was appropriate'' to discuss requiring Third \n     World participation in the treaty until that happens, said \n     Kelly Symms of Ozone Action.\n       The developing nations squelched a move to add discussions \n     about their participation in the treaty to the agenda at the \n     next negotiating session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, this \n     fall. Clinton administration officials vow to nevertheless \n     bring up Third World inclusion for discussion at the session.\n       ``It was the same dynamic'' that Americans encountered in \n     Kyoto, Japan, when the treaty was drafted, with most nations \n     blaming the United States for the global warming problem, \n     since it is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and \n     saying it should bear the costs, said Miss Symms.\n       But Mr. Clinton faces just the opposite problem at home: a \n     Congress that is livid that the Kyoto treaty excludes \n     developing nations, which could become major emitters in the \n     next century, and insisting that costs must be minimal for \n     the treaty to have even a change of being ratified in the \n     Senate.\n       ``We all have our political situations,'' said Rafe \n     Pomerance, deputy assistant secretary of state for \n     environment, acknowledging that none of the Third World \n     nations the administration is negotiating with are ready \n     right now to voluntarily sign on to the treaty .\n       The administration has more hope of winning Europeans over \n     to its emissions-trading scheme, which is designed to allow \n     American companies to lower the cost of emissions cuts by \n     buying credits from other countries where the costs are \n     smaller.\n       The administration is relying on extensive trading of such \n     credits to hold down what could be significant costs for \n     Americans in its analysis of the economic effects of the \n     treaty, he said.\n       Environmentalists say the administration's conclusion that \n     the treaty would impose only ``modest'' costs on Americans \n     assumes that 80 percent of the treaty's emissions reductions \n     are achieved through international trading.\n       The administration only yesterday released details of its \n     controversial and closely held cost estimates to the House \n     Commerce Committee.\n       Europeans stridently oppose the extensive use of emissions \n     trading saying the United States should first impose energy \n     taxes and other measures used by European countries to cut \n     emissions before ``buying'' reductions from the rest of the \n     world.\n       ``Their primary goal is to cripple the U.S. economy'' by \n     quadrupling energy costs to the levels that prevail in \n     Europe, said Deborah Fidelke, spokesman for Sen. Chuck Hagel, \n     Nebraska Republican and a leading opponent of the treaty in \n     the Senate.\n       The two-week-long negotiating session in Bonn--where the \n     world's nations came to agreement on only one technical \n     question involving reforestation--shows the futility of Mr. \n     Clinton's efforts to forge a treaty that he hopes can get \n     through the Senate, she said.\n       ``This whole thing is going nowhere,'' especially in light \n     of the hardships on China and\n\n[[Page S7166]]\n\n     other Asian developing countries resulting from the Asian \n     financial crisis, she said.\n       ``Why on Earth would they now sign on to a treaty that \n     would slow their growth even further?'' she asked. ``We just \n     put economic sanctions on India and now we expect them to \n     sign on to a treaty that will slow their growth?

Mr. President, I rise to call attention to an article \nwhich ran on the front page of the Washington Post yesterday morning \nregarding missile sales by North Korea. Although North Korea has denied \nselling missiles in the past, I for one have never taken them at their \nword on this and have long believed that they have been and continue to \nbe actively engaged in the weapons trade; without question, the sale of \nweapons to rogue states has been and continues to be a major source of \nrevenue for the North Korea government.\n  Well, despite their past denials, the Washington Post reports that \nNorth Korea now admits to selling weapons to countries such as Iran, \nIraq and Syria, and has actively assisted these countries with their \nown missile development programs.\n  Mr. President, this article really comes as no surprise--it simply \nverifies what many of us have suspected all along. But I think we \nshould also consider for a moment whether we have, in no small way, \ncontributed to North Korea's missile development program.\n  I am referring, of course, to the 1994 Agreed Framework, whereby \nNorth Korea would dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for \nAmerican assistance in building two light-water reactors. Without going \ninto the details, Japan and South Korea would contribute several \nbillion dollars worth of assistance to the construction of the \nreactors, and the United States would also supply heavy oil to North \nKorea until the reactors were up and running--this would help North \nKorea meet its energy needs pending construction of the facilities.\n  Mr. President, the Agreed Framework, no matter how well intentioned, \nputs a gaping hole in the international sanctions which we have levied \nagainst North Korea. The United Sates has already given close to $200 \nmillion taxpayer dollars, perhaps more, in combined food aid and to \nsupport the Korean Economic Development Organization (KEDO), which is \ntasked with sending heavy fuel oil to North Korea and carrying out \nother activities under the Agreed Framework. For a country whose \neconomy is completely isolated and strapped for cash, this assistance \nfrees up sizable amounts of money which North Korea can invest in other \nareas--including their national missile development program.\n  So, the North Koreans use the aid which comes from the United States, \nJapan, South Korea and other countries to support other aspects of \ntheir economy, freeing up resources which can be used to develop \nweapons. These weapons are then sold to our enemies, and pointed at our \ntroops, our allies, and even us.\n  Mr. President, last year two North Korean defectors indicated in \ntestimony before the Senate Government Affairs Committee that the North \nKorean missile development program already poses a verifiable threat to \nAmerican forces in Okinawa and is on track to threaten parts of Alaska \nby the turn of the Century.\n  Mr. President, I have no problem with humanitarian aid in itself--\nthis is not the issue. The issue is whether we have an effective policy \ntoward gaining cooperation with North Korea? I would argue, and I think \nthe facts back me up, that we do not! Think about it. Every concession \nNorth Korea has ever granted has been on their terms--not ours, theirs! \nAnd when things do not appear to go their way, they take action which \nwe try to deter through additional concessions. Sounds to me like the \ntail is wagging the dog.\n  Last month, the New York Times ran a story indicating that North \nKorea announced it would suspend their efforts to carry out the 1994 \nnuclear freeze agreement, the Agreed Framework. I would ask that a copy \nof this article appear in the Record at this time.\n  What does this tell us, Mr. President? That North Korea is not \ncommitted to a freeze; and that the freeze is simply a vehicle by which \nNorth Korea can exploit aid and other concessions from the United \nStates and our allies.\n  I am not at this time suggesting that we should cut off all \nassistance to North Korea, nor am I suggesting that we should cut off \nfunding and assistance to KEDO. We can discuss these issues during the \nappropriations process--and I suspect we will.\n  But I am encouraging my colleagues to think hard about this issue. \nLast week, we were honored to receive President Kim Dae-jung from the \nRepublic of Korea. He hinted that the United States should consider \neasing sanctions against North Korea. Well, Mr. President, in light of \nthese incidents, I don't know how we could possibly consider easing \nsanctions against North Korea--although I wonder whether we haven't \nalready vis a vis KEDO and other assistance which we continue to extend \nto the North Korean government.\n  Mr. President, when the Senate turns back to the Defense \nAuthorization bill, Senator Kyl and I will offer an amendment which \nrequires the Secretary of Defense to study the issue of effective \ndeployment of a theater missile defense system for the Asia-Pacific \nregion. This is obviously needed to protect our troops in Okinawa and \non the Korean peninsula. This amendment will further require that \nKorea, Japan and Taiwan be allowed to purchase, should they desire, \nsuch a system from the United States. I suspect that all of them would \nbe extremely interested in such a defense system, Mr. President, and I \nthink it is incumbent upon us to extend this protection to them.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would simply reiterate that the United \nStates needs a policy whereby we can effectively gain cooperation with \nNorth Korea. KEDO does not appear to be that framework. Perhaps we need \nto evaluate this, or whether a different approach is needed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that relevant articles be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [From the Washington Post]\n\n  N. Korea Admits Selling Missiles--Move Seen as Test of U.S. Embargo\n\n                          (By Kevin Sullivan)\n\n       SEOUL, June 16--North Korea declared today that it will \n     continue to develop, test and export ballistic missiles, \n     officially acknowledging for the first time a clandestine \n     weapons trade that analysis say has helped build arsenals in \n     Iran, Iraq and Syria.\n       North Korea's admission added to tensions in Asia following \n     nuclear testing by India and Pakistan, which has also \n     reportedly purchased some of North Korea's Soviet-inspired \n     missiles.\n       The blunt disclosure of the missile program appears to be \n     aimed directly at the United States, which has imposed a near \n     total economic embargo on North Korea. Pyongyang has been \n     trying for years to persuade Washington to lift the embargo, \n     which is strangling North Korea at a time when its economy is \n     in desperate need of outside assistance.\n       In Washington, the State Department branded the North \n     Korean statement ``irresponsible'' and rejected the economic \n     arguments Pyongyang offered to justify missile sales, staff \n     writer Thomas W. Lippman reported.\n       ``Their missile proliferation activities have been of \n     concern to us for a long time,'' a State Department official \n     said. ``It's well known that they sell missiles and \n     technology virtually indiscriminately, including to regions \n     in the Middle East and South Asia where we didn't think it \n     was wise.''\n       If North Korea wants improved relations with the United \n     States and an easing of sanctions, the official said, it \n     should restrain its missile sales, not expand them.\n       The United States has imposed sanctions on North Korea four \n     times for missile exports, most recently in April of this \n     year after Pakistan conducted flight tests of missile of \n     North Korean design known in Pakistan as the Ghauri.\n       Many U.S. officials have pointed to North Korea's missile \n     sales to Iraq and other states as evidence that the Stalinist \n     government in Pyongyang remains a threat to global security. \n     The Clinton administration has pressed North Korea repeatedly \n     to stop exporting missiles--which, until today, North Korea \n     had flatly denied doing.\n\n[[Page S7167]]\n\n       ``We will continue developing, testing and deploying \n     missiles,'' said the official Korean Central News Agency, \n     monitored in Tokyo. ``If the United States really wants to \n     prevent our missile export, it should lift the economic \n     embargo as early as possible and make a compensation for the \n     losses to be caused by discontinued missile export. . . . Our \n     missile export is aimed at obtaining foreign money, which we \n     need at present.''\n       It was unclear whether North Korean officials had timed \n     their statements to take advantage of concern over the Indian \n     and Pakistani nuclear tests. North Korea, facing desperate \n     food shortages and an economy that has been in a downward \n     spiral for eight years, is widely seen as a shrewd \n     manipulator capable of turning tensions on the Indian \n     subcontinent into an opportunity for itself.\n       Pyongyang also may be trying to build on any momentum \n     created by South Korean President Kim Dae Jung's recent visit \n     to the United States. Kim, who favors broader peaceful \n     engagement with North Korea, suggested gently to President \n     Clinton and members of Congress that sanctions could be \n     lifted gradually in exchange for reciprocal acts of good \n     faith by Pyongyang.\n       By pressing the missile point just three days after Kim's \n     return to Seoul, officials in North Korea may be hoping to \n     capitalize on any new softening of Washington's resolve on \n     sanctions.\n       Donald Gregg, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea and \n     now chairman of the Korea Society in New York, said he met \n     today with officials of the North Korean U.N. delegation and \n     was told they were dissatisfied with the pace of oil \n     deliveries from the United States promised under a 1994 \n     agreement. In that deal, North Korea agreed to suspend its \n     suspected nuclear weapons program in exchange for two new \n     nuclear reactors and 500,000 tons of fuel oil each year until \n     the reactors were producing electricity.\n       Several oil shipments have been delayed, and Gregg said the \n     North Koreans complained that the United States was not \n     living up to its end of the deal. He said they argued that \n     steady deliveries of fuel are especially important now during \n     the agricultural growing season.\n       Gregg said the North Koreans also may feel that there had \n     been less movement on the sanctions issue than they expected \n     following Kim's visit to Washington. That, combined with \n     irritation over the oil deliveries, may have spurred today's \n     announcement, he said.\n       ``The hard-liners may have thought, `Well, we've got to \n     make a move,' '' Gregg said, adding that it is good that \n     North Korea's missile program had finally been ``flushed \n     out.''\n       Pyongyang's announcement is not likely to win any friends \n     in Washington. ``With missiles of the United States, which is \n     at war with [North Korea] technically, aiming at our \n     territory, we find no reason to refrain from developing and \n     deploying missiles to counter them,'' the North Korean \n     statement said.\n       The United States and North Korea began talks last year in \n     which American negotiators hope to persuade Pyongyang to \n     freeze its missile program and join an international \n     agreement to restrict missile proliferation. The talks have \n     gone virtually nowhere; the latest round, set for last August \n     in New York, was canceled, and no new sessions are scheduled.\n       North Korea's missiles have long been a matter of grave \n     concern in Asia. In 1993, it test-fired a medium-range \n     Rodong-1 model into the Sea of Japan, demonstrating that \n     parts of Japan, a key U.S. ally in the region, were well \n     within the missile's 1,000-mile range.\n       Defense analysts say North Korea has since developed the \n     Rodong-2 missile, which has a range of 1,500 miles, putting \n     virtually all of Northeast Asia, including the 80 million \n     residents of greater Tokyo, within striking distance. \n     Analysts believe North Korea also is developing missiles with \n     even longer ranges.\n       North Korea's provocative statements about its missile \n     program come as Pyongyang has been more receptive and open on \n     other issues. In recent months, relations between North and \n     South Korea have thawed somewhat, especially on economic \n     matters.\n       Under Kim Dae Jung's ``sunshine policy'' of engaging North \n     Korea, many South Korean business leaders have been traveling \n     to the North to discuss possible ventures there. For example, \n     Chung Ju Yung, founder and honorary chairman of the Hyundai \n     conglomerate, entered North Korea today with a donation of \n     500 cattle for the impoverished nation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    [From the New York Times International, Wednesday, May 13, 1998]\n\n                North Korea Says It Will Unseal Reactor\n\n                        (By Elizabeth Rosenthal)\n\n       Beijing, May 12--North Korean officials have announced that \n     they are suspending their efforts to carry out the 1994 \n     nuclear freeze agreement that was intended to dismantle that \n     country's nuclear program. United States officials have said \n     the program was intended to produce weapons.\n       Protesting that the United States had failed to honor \n     promises to send fuel oil, a high-ranking member of the North \n     Korean Government told a visiting academic on Saturday that \n     North Korea had recently decided to unseal a nuclear reactor \n     that under the agreement, was to have been closed \n     permanently, and had also barred technicians from packing the \n     last of the reactor's spent fuel rods (or shipment out of the \n     country. The rods contain plutonium that can be used in \n     nuclear weapons.\n       Although North Korea's decision to reopen the plant, in \n     Yong Byon, about 90 miles from the capital, Pyongyang, had no \n     immediate effect, some arms experts called it an ominous \n     symbolic action.\n       ``This is like somebody dusting off the old .45 and making \n     sure that it shines, but not loading it,'' said Gary \n     Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms \n     Control. ``They're sending a clever signal in our direction \n     saying, remember, we can stop cooperating.'' Mr. Milhollin \n     also said the approximately 200 rods did not contain enough \n     plutonium to pose a nuclear threat.\n       Under the 1994 agreement, North Korea pledged to dismantle \n     its nuclear program in exchange for American promises to \n     coordinate the building of two light-water reactors to \n     generate electricity and to deliver 500 metric tons of oil \n     annually. North Korea also promised to ease barriers to \n     trade. Although the United States has had trouble raising the \n     billions of dollars required for those measures, it has \n     repeatedly said it would carry out its side of the agreement.\n       But last Friday, North Korea's Government-run Korean \n     Central News Agency expressed deep displeasure with the pace \n     of the United States' efforts, and hinted that the North \n     Korean Government might restart its nuclear program. North \n     Korea ``should no longer lend an ear to the empty promises of \n     the United States side, but open and readjust the frozen \n     nuclear facilities and do everything our own way,'' a \n     statement from an unnamed Foreign Ministry official said.\n       And the next day, North Korea's Foreign Minister, Kim Young \n     Nam, elaborated on the statement in a private two-hour \n     meeting in Pyongyang with an American expert on Korea, Selig \n     Harrison, of the Twentieth Century Fund.\n       According to Mr. Harrison, Mr. Kim said that on April 19, \n     the North Koreans had opened up the previously sealed plant \n     to ``conduct maintenance activities,'' and had also halted \n     the ``canning of spent fuel rods'' from the reactor, which is \n     being conducted under the auspices of the International \n     Atomic Energy Agency. Agency supervisors have been asked to \n     leave the reactor site, although not the country. Two hundred \n     of the reactor's 8,000 rods have not yet been prepared, he \n     said.\n       ``We are keeping up our progress in implementing the \n     nuclear freeze agreement, but the U.S. is behind,'' Mr. Kim \n     told Mr. Harrison, who spoke with reporters in Beijing en \n     route back to the United States. ``So we have now decided to \n     slow down and suspend certain aspects of the agreement.'' He \n     said that once the United States had a chance to ``catch \n     up,'' North Korea would resume cooperation.\n       The North Koreans contend that the United States is behind \n     schedule in heavy fuel shipments and in its preparations to \n     build the new reactors, to be completed by 2003.\n       On Saturday, the State Department said the United States \n     had lived up to its obligations, noting that even though oil \n     shipments have been slow for the first part of the year, the \n     stipulated quota would be met by year's end. ``Anything that \n     would happen to undermine the integrity of that agreement \n     from the North Korean side or from the outside would be, in \n     our view, extremely lamentable and regrettable,'' \n     Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering said.\n       A State Department official who spoke on condition of \n     anonymity said he had no information about the unsealing of \n     the plant. He said that whether that act violates the \n     agreement depends on what those ``maintenance activities \n     are''\n       Although North Korea has generally honored its commitments \n     under the 1994 agreement, the United States has been unhappy \n     with what it sees as North Korea's tepid attempts to improve \n     relations with South Korea. North Korea, in turn, had been \n     angered by it regarded as the United States' halfhearted \n     efforts to remove trade barriers--efforts that have so far \n     been mostly limited to allowing phone and fax lines.\n       Plans for the two reactors promised under the agreement \n     have also been slowed by the financial crisis in Japan and \n     South Korea. The two countries have delayed payments of \n     billions of dollars in cash they had pledged.\n       Despite the announcement, Mr. Harrison said North Korean \n     leaders had made some conciliatory statements during his \n     talks. He said they signaled that they might be willing to \n     negotiate with both the United States and South Korea to \n     create a threeway peacekeeping force and structure for the \n     tense Korean demilitarized zone. North Korea has previously \n     refused to deal with Seoul as an equal partner on the issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7166-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7167-S7168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page S7168]]\n\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7167-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ENTITLED ``SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING INDICATORS--1998''--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 141\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by 42 U.S.C. 1863(j)(1), I am pleased to submit to the \nCongress a report of the National Science Board entitled Science and \nEngineering Indicators--1998.

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 482\n\n       Whereas, section 5536 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, \n     Public Law 105-33, amended Federal law to require each state \n     to have in place laws requiring applicants for recreational \n     licenses (hunting and fishing) to provide their Social \n     Security numbers; and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has implemented \n     this Federal mandate through the amendatory act of December \n     16, 1997 (P.L. 549, No. 58), to Title 23; and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania strongly supports \n     all effective mechanisms to encourage payment of child \n     support obligations; and\n       Whereas, requiring applicants for hunting and fishing \n     licenses to provide their Social Security numbers does not \n     appear to enhance effective enforcement of child support \n     obligations inasmuch as hunting and fishing license records \n     are not retrievable by reference to the Social Security \n     numbers; and\n       Whereas, the vast majority of hunting and fishing licenses \n     are not sold by government agencies but are sold by private \n     businesses ranging in size from large department stores to \n     small bait and outdoor shops; and\n       Whereas, imposing the requirements to collect Social \n     Security number information on the businesses that sell \n     hunting and fishing licenses unduly complicate the license \n     issuance transaction; and\n       Whereas, many purchasers of hunting and fishing licenses \n     object to disclosure of their Social Security numbers to the \n     private businesses that sell these licenses; and\n       Whereas, the legitimate privacy concerns expressed by many \n     purchasers of hunting and fishing licenses from private \n     businesses need to be addressed; and\n       Whereas, collection of Social Security numbers from \n     applicants for hunting and fishing licenses does not aid in \n     effective enforcement of child support obligations but does \n     unduly inconvenience both the sellers and purchasers of these \n     licenses and raises legitimate concerns about protection of \n     personal information, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the President and \n     Congress of the United States to eliminate the requirement \n     that states must require applicants for hunting and fishing \n     licenses to provide their Social Security numbers.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM--498. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 381\n\n       Whereas, costs borne by the taxpayers of the Commonwealth \n     of Pennsylvania for long-term care under Medicaid exceed more \n     than $500 million per fiscal year; and\n       Whereas, the costs of providing care for persons who can no \n     longer take care of themselves have skyrocketed, with a \n     national average of $38,000 per year for a nursing home stay \n     and with costs as high as $50,000 in metropolitan areas like \n     Philadelphia hitting the middle class particularly hard; and\n       Whereas, these costs to the Commonwealth will increase \n     because of the demands of our aging population and the fact \n     that baby boomers will soon be reaching retirement age; and\n       Whereas, a Pennsylvania solution to allow middle class \n     Pennsylvanians to exempt for Medicaid eligibility, assets as \n     a result of a purchase of private sector long-term care \n     insurance so as to reduce the eventual costs borne by \n     taxpayers for their care is stymied by section 1902(r)(2) of \n     the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1396a(r)(2)) which prohibits such shielding; therefore \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the Congress of the \n     United States to enact legislation repealing section \n     1902(r)(2) of the Social Security Act (49 Stat. 620, 42 \n     U.S.C.

A bill to provide transitional community employment for \nunemployed persons, and other individuals in poverty, who live in \ncertain identified communities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             strategic transitional employment program act\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a piece of \nlegislation, and Delegate Eleanor Holmes\n\n[[Page S7173]]\n\nNorton has introduced this on the House side. This legislation is \ncalled the Strategic Transitional Employment Program, STEP. This \nlegislation is an outgrowth of some of my work as a senator in \nMinnesota and in other communities around the country.\n  If I had to summarize my travel in our country in Delta, MS, or East \nLos Angeles, or Watts, or inner-city Baltimore, or inner-city \nMinneapolis, or rural Minnesota, or Appalachia, Letcher County, KY, or \ninner-city Chicago, over and over and over again, the one thing I heard \nfrom people was: Where are the jobs at decent wages that we can support \nour families on? More than anything in the world, Senator, we want to \nbe able to earn a decent living and give our children the care they \nneed and deserve.\n  Congresswoman Norton and I had the opportunity to be at First Baptist \nChurch here in D.C. Pastor Eldridge Spearman's church, in the Greenway \ncommunity, working with the Marshall Heights Community Development \nOrganization. There was a wonderful turnout of people from the \ncommunity. They said this would be the best single thing we could talk \nabout. Over the next 4 years, an effort to create 1.8 million jobs for \npeople, transitional employment, moving toward living-wage jobs, \nopportunity for education, job training, so that we build up the human \ncapital in our communities so that we then can attract the private \ncapital.\n  This is a major issue that is off the political debate screen but \nshould be on the political debate screen and should be part of our \nagenda. There is a jobs gap in our Nation now, close to 5 million jobs, \nand even with the economy humming along at peak economic performance, \nthere are many communities, as the eminent scholar, William Julius \nWilson, points out, where there is no work, work is the most important \nthing we can focus on. When people work, they contribute to family, \nthey contribute to community, they have dignity. But there are too many \ncommunities in our country where there are almost no jobs at all.\n  This legislation speaks to that. I will be bringing to the floor of \nthe Senate some sense-of-the-Senate amendments that talk about the need \nto have thorough study and investigation. I will work out amendments \nthat come from this piece of legislation, build up support, and come to \nthe floor over and over and over again to talk about this. This is a \nstructural problem in our economy, and this is the key to economic \nopportunity.\n  Children do better when their parents are doing better. There is no \nmore important priority than to focus on jobs and to focus on job \nopportunities. That is what this legislation does.\n  I thank Brian Ahlberg, on my staff, and Deanna Caldwell for doing \nsuch superior work, and I thank the Center for Community Change, the \nCenter for Budget and Policy Priorities, Peter Edelman and William \nJulius Wilson for their work, as well.\n  The bill I introduce today, the Strategic Transitional Employment \nProgram (STEP) Act of 1998 addresses what I consider to be one of the \nkey moral issues facing our country. The issue is jobs. I often say \nthat if you want to prevent crime, if you want to prevent drugs, broken \nhomes, violence in our homes, violence in our schools and on the \nstreets, then focus on providing all Americans with a good education, \ngood health care and a good job. Too many Americans who want to work \nand are able to work cannot find a good job.\n  During my recent and continuing travels, I have found that even as \nofficial unemployment figures and other leading indicators suggest that \nwe should be celebrating our economic success, many American \ncommunities continue to struggle with the demoralization of \njoblessness. When I traveled last year to Mississippi, Los Angeles, \nChicago, Baltimore, Kentucky, urban and rural Minnesota, and when I \ntravel to struggling communities, neighborhoods and barrios today, I \nheard and still hear the question: Senator, where are all the good \njobs? We want to work. We are able to work. Where are the jobs?\n  Most Americans are aware that the gap between rich and poor in \nAmerica is widening. Between the late 1970s and the mid 1990s, incomes \nof the richest fifth of families increased on average by 30 percent, or \nabout $27,000 after adjusting for inflation. In contrast, the real \nincomes of the poorest families declined on average 21 percent, about \n$2,500. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, ``In \nthe United States as a whole, the poorest 20 percent of families with \nchildren had an average income of $9,250 in the mid-1990s, while the \naverage income of families with children in the top 20 percent of the \nincome distribution was $117,500, or 13 times as large.''\n  In the United States today, poverty is becoming more and more \nconcentrated, the poor are more and more isolated, and joblessness is \nmore strongly associated with that poverty than ever before. \nConcentrated joblessness is increasing in urban neighborhoods and poor \nrural communities. Meanwhile, the joblessness is becoming more and more \nprolonged--a chronic condition--for residents of those areas.\n  Last Friday I took part in an event at First Baptist Church in \nSoutheast Washington, D.C. First Baptist is just across the Anacostia \nRiver on Minnesota Avenue. It serves the communities of Greenway, \nMarshall Heights and many others across our nation's capitol. District \nof Columbia Delegate Holmes-Norton and I announced that we would be \nintroducing this bill, and I would just like to thank the church, \nincluding its pastor Eldridge Spearman, as well as Mr. and Mrs. \nStrayhorn and others of the church's staff for welcoming us there. \nRepresentatives of the Marshall Heights Community Development \nOrganization also were present and participated in what I believe was \nan important event.\n  The problem of joblessness persists today in Washington, D.C. and in \ncommunities across the country, even at a time when our economy is at \npeak performance. Between 4 and 5 million Americans of working age lack \nthe jobs they need to support themselves and their families. Many have \nbeen jobless for prolonged periods. They have lost their jobs, or they \nhave never been able to find a job. They lack the skills and experience \nto get a job, or there are no jobs nearby where they live. Many are so \ndiscouraged they no longer are seeking work. They are not even counted \nas unemployed.\n  We are not talking only about those who are already or soon will be \nlosing welfare benefits. Those people, many of them women with \nchildren, will be required to find work. We also are talking about more \nthan a million men--African-American men in our cities, men regardless \nof race or background in urban and rural areas. Many jobless men are \nfathers. They want to work. They are able to work. But they remain \njobless.\n  Why has concentrated joblessness and poverty increased and \nintensified for some while the rest of the country is enjoying an \nabundance of work, when in fact in some areas there are labor \nshortages? There are a number of reasons, but two are fundamental: \nchanges in the nature of work and in the location of work. Race is a \nthird important factor.\n  We have experienced profound economic restructuring that has \ntransformed the nature of work and the skills demanded for work. \nIndustrial and manufacturing jobs, once a foundation of our economy, \nhave given way to work that is driven by new technological developments \nand a global marketplace. The demand for skilled workers, those with \neducation and training, is high. Lower-skilled workers, who have always \nbeen the most vulnerable to economic shifts, have seen their work \nopportunities dwindle or vanish. The gap between average earnings of \nhigh school graduates and college graduates has become a gulf. In fact, \n``the unemployment rates for low-skilled men and women are five times \nthat among their college-educated counterparts,'' according to the \nprominent social scientist and Harvard University Professor William \nJulius Wilson.\n  I am pleased that to say that I believe we are on the verge of \ncompleting conference work on the workforce legislation that will \nimprove the country's job-training system. That is a crucial, \nbipartisan work-product of the Senate's Labor Subcommittee on \nEmployment and Training, on which I am proud to serve as Ranking \nMinority Member. I am hopeful we can complete and enact that \nlegislation in the coming weeks. The bill I introduce today is designed \nto fit closely with and complement that reform of the federal job-\n\n[[Page S7174]]\n\ntraining system. It would utilize the streamlined and improved job-\ntraining infrastructure that the workforce bill is designed to bring \nabout.\n  The location of work also has changed. Business has moved to the \nsuburbs. New jobs, even lower-skill jobs, are more likely to be found \nin suburban environments than central city or rural communities. In the \n1980s, 87 percent of new jobs in the lower-paying and lower-skilled \nservice and retail trade sectors were created in the suburbs, according \nto the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). And all too \noften, jobs in the suburbs are inaccessible using public \ntransportation.\n  Race is a further determinant of concentrated poverty and \njoblessness. We cannot ignore or dismiss the impact of racial \ndiscrimination. It has created islands of poverty and joblessness. It \nis no coincidence that the residents of most central cities, of most \npoor rural counties, are more likely to be racial minorities. William \nJulius Wilson describes how many of our central cities have become \nessentially racially segregated and poor:\n\n       In addition to changes in the economy and in the class, \n     racial, and demographic composition of inner-city ghetto \n     neighborhoods, certain government programs and policies \n     contributed, over the last fifty years, to the evolution of \n     jobless ghettos. Prominent among these are the early actions \n     of the FHA in withholding mortgage capital from inner-city \n     neighborhoods, the manipulation of market incentives that \n     trapped blacks in the inner cities and lured middle-class \n     whites to the suburbs, the construction of massive federal \n     housing projects in inner-city neighborhoods, and, since \n     1980, the New Federalism, which, through its insistence on \n     localized responses to social problems, resulted in drastic \n     cuts in spending on basic urban programs. Just when the \n     problems of social dislocation in jobless neighborhoods have \n     escalated, the city has fewer resources with which to address \n     them.\n\n  HUD's State of the Cities report for 1997 observed that, ``In 1995, \nthe poverty rate for whites (not of Hispanic origin) was 6.4 percent; \nfor Asians and Pacific Islanders it was 12.4 percent; African \nAmericans, 26.4 percent; and Hispanics 27.0 percent.''\n  The Eisenhower Foundation recently published a report that examines \nwhat has happened in the 30 years since the historic Kerner Commission \nreport of 1968. Here is one finding from that report: ``Since the \nKerner Commission, the U.S. has had the most rapid growth in wage \ninequality in the Western world, with racial minorities suffering \ndisproportionately. . . [T]here cannot be meaningful progress in \nclosing the racial divide without an economic corollary.''\n  The problem is not only urban. An American Indian in Minneapolis or a \nMexican-American immigrant in Willmar, Minnesota might still not \nreceive fair consideration from too many potential employers. With \nhistoric Civil Rights legislation through the years, we have largely \ntranscended the most blatant policies of racial prejudice and \nsegregation in our country. But to some degree we have replaced them \nwith policies of inaction and neglect. Poor minorities have been made \npoorer, in some cases are more segregated, and many remain stereotyped.\n  We pay for neglect, for the failure to act, in a myriad of ways. \nNeglect breeds destructive behavior that harms individuals, that harms \nthose in close proximity, and that eventually harms those far removed. \nCriminal behavior is a child of neglect. We know that there are strong \nrelationships between poverty, unemployment, and crime. Work deters the \nkind of crime that is found in communities of concentrated joblessness \nand poverty. It may not be all that is needed, but legitimate work \nopportunity is integral. Without it there is no hope.\n  The STEP proposal would build a bridge to close the ``jobs gap''--the \ngap between those who are doing well in today's economy and those who \nare being left behind. The problem in this case is not the cyclical \nnature of our economy. It is chronic and structural joblessness. We \ncannot any longer disregard the substantial portion of our population \nthat is being left out of the benefits of general prosperity.\n  The Center for Community Change estimates a jobs gap of about 4.4 \nmillion. In other words, 4.4 million people are out of work or \neconomically in need of additional employment due to a lack of jobs \nappropriate to their skills and abilities. The estimate includes about \n2.1 million of the officially unemployed who have been without work for \n15 weeks or longer. It also includes about 330,000 persons who are \nwithout work but have given up their employment search and are \ntherefore no longer officially unemployed--also called the discouraged \nworker. And it includes about 2 million full-time equivalent positions, \nwhich represent the nearly 4 million ``economically underemployed,'' \npeople who work part-time because they cannot find a full-time job and \nwho are also not included in the count of the officially unemployed.\n  The answer to the jobs gap is jobs, and our bill will create jobs--\n1.8 million of them over three years. The idea for this legislative \nproposal comes from people who have devoted much of their professional \nlives to attempting to solve this problem: the Center for Community \nChange, the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, Peter Edelman, \nWilliam Julius Wilson and grassroots organizations around the country \nwhich serve low-income communities. Our bill will not create every \npermanent job that is needed. Massive job-creation programs have been \nproposed and even tried in the past. They usually were designed as \ncounter-cyclical interventions in the economy to address recessions. We \nalso acknowledge that there are other reasons for joblessness which our \nbill does not directly address. If there are no jobs nearby, part of \nthe solution may be transportation. If a jobless person is a parent, \npart of the solution may be affordable, quality child care.\n  Rather, the bill proposes for the first time a specific and limited \npolicy tool to address a specific, crucial need. It is a realistic \neffort to provide for out-of-work individuals a transition between \nchronic joblessness and a non-subsidized job in the private or public \nsector. It is a serious, even if initial and partial, effort to close \nthe jobs gap. What I propose today is a plan to provide nearly 2 \nmillion Americans with a significant step toward a full-time, living \nwage job.\n  It will help these jobless individuals living in poverty with \nmeaningful employment experience for one year, as well as with skills-\ntraining and education.\n  It will provide hard-hit communities with needed economic development \nand services so they can attract more investment.\n  It will prepare workers who, at the end of a year of skills-\ndeveloping work, can qualify for many of the positions that private \nemployers are telling us they cannot fill because they can't find able \nand experienced workers. That also will help attract investment.\n  Finally, it will create a new demonstration program at the Small \nBusiness Administration to help target venture-capital investment to \nsmall enterprises that provide jobs in high-unemployment, high-poverty \ncommunities.\n  The core of the bill is a 4-year, $20-billion program to create 1.8 \nmillion entry-level, 12-month, transitional jobs. These will be \ncommunity employment jobs, filling needs in the affected communities. \nThe program would be administered by the Department of Labor, largely \nthrough the existing federal employment and training infrastructure, \nwhich we are in the midst of reforming and improving in substantial \nways. Money and decision-making power would be pushed down to the local \nlevel. Participation by key groups--employers, labor, elected officials \nand community-based organizations--would be assured.\n  We are not simply providing make-work jobs leading to nowhere. State \nand local plans would have to specify how the jobs and the accompanying \nskills development would provide a transition to gainful employment \nafter one year. Nor are we creating an exploited, low-wage workforce to \ndisplace current workers or undercut their wages, such as many allege \nis happening with Welfare-to-Work in some places. Strict anti-\ndisplacement language is included in the bill. Workers in the program \nwould be paid slightly above minimum wage, plus benefits, and would \nreceive full federal labor law protections.\n  The program would be paid for from discretionary funds, so no \nbudgetary offset would be required for its enactment. Nonetheless, \noffsets are included in the bill. It would be paid for by eliminating \nunnecessary current spending. The bill would revoke the current\n\n[[Page S7175]]\n\nsubsidy of excessive executive compensation among large American \ncorporations--prohibiting the federal tax deduction for salaries paid \nto executives which are more than 25 times the compensation of another \nemployee of the same company for the same year. And it would repeal the \ndeferral of income tax owed on assets of U.S.-controlled foreign \ncorporations.\n  Here is how the bill would work.\n  The STEP Act would provide transitional employment to place people \nfirmly on the pathway to economic security.\n  The STEP Act would provide funding over four years to create entry-\nlevel jobs, and provide benefits, for people who have been jobless 15 \nweeks or more, who have a family income at or below poverty, and who \nare living in a community of concentrated poverty and unemployment. The \njobs would be transitional--meaning that eligible participants could \nstay in the program for a maximum of twelve months, although some \nexceptions would be allowed.\n  Under the four-year STEP initiative, States and local communities \nwould spend the first year carefully planning a job creation strategy \nto create, nationwide, 1.8 million jobs over three years. With an eye \ntowards ensuring quality and the coordination of resources, the STEP \nAct incrementally builds the number of jobs created each year to reach \nthe total of 1.8 million jobs. Funding is provided in the second (post-\nplanning) year to create 200,000 jobs; in the third year to create \n600,000 jobs; and in the fourth year to create 1 million jobs.\n  The number one priority of STEP is creating jobs for people who need \nwork--people living in communities of concentrated poverty and \nunemployment. STEP is not just a job that ends in 12 months. It is the \npropellant for landing sustaining employment--employment that pays a \nliving wage, the kind of job that could provide meaningful \nresponsibilities to help people develop work skills and get sound work \nexperience under their belt. At the same time, STEP participants would \nhave paid time--10 hours per week--to get secondary, vocational, or \npost-secondary education. Their annual earnings would be consistent \nwith living wage principals. They would be hooked into services such as \ntransportation and child care which will be critical to their ultimate \nsuccess. Also, they would have job search and job placement assistance \nto help ensure their successful transition out of the STEP program.\n  The second priority is to create jobs in communities where jobs are \nscarce--in communities of concentrated poverty--whenever possible. \nThere is no lack of work to be done in poor neighborhoods. The STEP Act \nwould authorize work, regardless of its location, for environmental \nconservation or restoration, to develop infrastructure or affordable \nhousing, to provide human services or to support small businesses. Poor \ncommunities could use the wage subsidies that STEP would provide to \nhelp with the renovation of schools and community centers, to provide \nchild care or community health care services, to provide elder care, to \nprovide aides to school teachers, to provide after-school and summer \nrecreational programs, to develop parks and playgrounds, to provide 911 \nphone service, to remove lead paint and asbestos, to build or renovate \nhousing, and to provide community safety and crime prevention services. \nThis is just some of the work that could be, and should be, done in \ncommunities with entrenched poverty.\n  The jobs that would be created and the location of those jobs would \nbe determined by the people most familiar with the needs of the \ncommunity and with the needs of local residents. Local community \nmembers, elected officials, labor unions, and representatives from for-\nprofit business would collaborate to develop work proposals and \nidentify worksite employers. When work could be physically located in \nor would benefit a community of concentrated poverty and unemployment, \nthat work would receive funding before other proposals. We would allow \njobs to be located outside a community of poverty for two reasons: (1) \nbecause we understand that the best skill-developing work opportunities \nmay lie outside the boundaries of an impoverished community and our \nfirst priority is getting people to work; and (2) because we recognize \nthat wages alone don't renovate schools or build houses. Other \nresources are necessary and may not be available to those communities. \nParticipants, however, would have to be residents of a community of \nconcentrated poverty and unemployment.\n  Employers could be local public agencies, private nonprofits, or \nprivate employers. Work created in public agencies and in nonprofits \nwould be funded first.\n  The bill contains a number of measures to ensure that current \nemployees would not be harmed or displaced. Labor organizations would \nplay a significant role in selecting job proposals and in monitoring \nwork conditions. It also contains provisions to ensure that workers \nwould be provided health insurance benefits; would be covered by \nFederal, State, and local labor laws; would be covered by anti-\ndiscrimination statutes; and would be eligible for the Earned Income \nTax Credit.\n  The cost of creating 1.8 million jobs over four years as I have \noutlined is $21 billion. That cost of providing jobs to those who need \nthem is a bargain compares to the inescapable price that we pay, and \nthat our children will pay, for doing nothing. The price of neglect is \nhigh--fiscally, emotionally and culturally.\n  The bill also provides funding for community development venture \ncapital--a critical need in most low-income communities. Equity capital \nis in short supply in low-income areas. Grassroots community \ndevelopment organizations have accomplished much through self-help \neconomic development efforts, including microlending and technical \nassistance to businesses. However, few of these organizations have the \nfinancial or technical capacity to make equity investments to launch \nbusinesses or to help them expand. A field of community development \nventure capita (CDVC)l funds is emerging to fill the gap. These CDVC \nfunds are targeting businesses that traditional institutional investors \nshy away from for a variety of reasons. These are businesses that may \nbe located in economically distressed urban or rural areas, or \nbusinesses in need of equity investment in smaller amounts than what \nthe traditional investor would consider. Also unlike the traditional \ninvestment firm, CDVCs target companies that will create good jobs that \npay decent wages and opportunities for advancement. They seek to shape \nthe culture of young companies with respect to sustainable community \ndevelopment and environmental impact. That means providing \nentrepreneurial solutions to social problems, creating jobs and \ngenerating wealth in economically disadvantaged areas, and yielding \ncompetitive long-term investment returns.\n  There are about 30 community development venture capital funds \ncurrently operating around the country. Northeast Ventures Corporation \nin Duluth, Minnesota is an excellent example. Northeast Ventures \ninvests primarily in a seven county area that is a restructured mining \nregion. They invest in a wide range of industries, with ``typical'' \ninitial investments ranging from $150,000 to $350,000.\n  The STEP Act would provide funding of $20 million over four years for \ncommunity development venture capital initiatives. The program would \nhelp to build the capacity of existing CDVC funds and encourage the \ndevelopment of emerging funds. The funds would be channeled through \nexperienced, qualified, nonprofit intermediary organizations to provide \nventure capital financing (loans, grants, and equity investments) to \nventure capital funds that serve low-income people and their \ncommunities. The funding would also be used to provide training, \neducation and operating support to develop the technical and \nadministrative capacity of emerging community development venture \ncapital organizations.\n  Mr. President, the STEP Act would be an important effort towards \nbridging America's jobs gap. I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of groups supporting the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                    GROUPS IN SUPPORT OF STEP ACORN\n\n       Alameda Corridor Jobs Coalition, California\n\n[[Page S7176]]\n\n       Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 998, Milwaukee\n       American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO\n       Anishinabe Council of Job Developers, Inc., Minneapolis\n       Arrowhead Economic Opportunity Agency, Minnesota\n       Californians for Justice\n       Campaign for a Sustainable Milwaukee\n       Center for Community Change\n       Community Resource Center, Colorado\n       Community Voices Heard, New York\n       Georgia Citizens Coalition on Hunger\n       Greater Bethany Economic Development Corporation, \n     California\n       Hartford Areas Rally Together, Connecticut\n       HIRED, Minneapolis\n       Homeless Services Coordination Station, Georgia\n       J.E.D.I.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmake certain changes related to payments for graduate medical education \nunder the medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7172-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7176-S7190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS OF 1998\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Graduate Medical \nEducation Technical Amendments Act of 1998, which is intended to \naddress some of the problems that small family practice residency \nprograms in Maine and elsewhere are experiencing as a result of \nprovisions in the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 that were intended \nto control the growth in Medicare graduate medical education spending.\n  Of specific concern are the provisions in the BBA that cap the total \nnumber of residents in a program at the level included in the 1996 \nMedicare cost reports. Congress' goal in reforming Medicare's graduate \nmedical education program was to slow down our nation's overall \nproduction of physicians, while still protecting the training of \nphysicians who are in short supply and needed to meet local and \nnational health care demands. While it is true that the BBA's \nprovisions will curb growth in the overall physician supply, they do so \nindiscriminately and are thwarting efforts in Maine and elsewhere to \nincrease the supply of primary care physicians in underserved rural \nareas.\n  Because Maine has only one medical school--the University of New \nEngland, which trains osteopathic physicians--we depend on a number of \nsmall family practice residency programs to introduce physicians to the \npractice opportunities in the state. Most of the graduates of these \nresidency programs go on to establish practices in Maine, many in rural \nand underserved areas of the state. The new caps on residency slots \nincluded in the BBA penalize these programs in a number of ways.\n  For instance, the current cap is based on the number of interns and \nresidents who were ``in the hospital'' in FY 1996. Having a cap that is \ninstitution-specific rather than program-specific has caused several \nproblems. For instance, the Maine-Dartmouth Family Practice Residency \nProgram had two residents out on leave in 1996--one on sick leave for \nchemotherapy treatments and one on maternity leave. Therefore, the \nprogram's cap was reduced by two, because it was based on the number of \nactual residents in the hospital in 1996 as opposed to the number of \nresidents in the program.\n  Moreover, residents in this program have spent one to two months \ntraining in obstetrics at Dartmouth's Mary Hitchcock's Medical Center \nin Lebanon, New Hampshire. Because the cap is based on a hospital's \ncost report, these residents are counted toward Dartmouth Medical \nSchool's cap instead of the Maine-Dartmouth Family Practice Residency \nProgram's. Last year, the Maine program was informed that Dartmouth \nwould be cutting back the amount of time their residents are there. But \nthe Maine-Dartmouth Family Practice Residency Program has no way of \nrecouping the resident count from them in order to have the funds to \nsupport obstetrical training for their residents elsewhere.\n  Moreover, the cap does not include residents who continue to be part \nof the residency program, but who have been sent outside of the \nhospital for training. This penalizes all primary care specialties, but \nespecially family medicine, where ambulatory training has historically \nbeen the hallmark of the specialty. This is particularly ironic since \nother specialty programs that now begin training in settings outside \nthe hospital will, under the new rules, have those costs included in \ntheir Medicare graduate medical education funding.\n  All told, the Maine Dartmouth Family Practice Residency Program will \nsee its graduate medical education funding reduced by over half a \nmillion dollars a year as a result of the cap established by the BBA.\n  The example I have just used is from Maine, but the problems created \nby the BBA's graduate medical education changes are national in scope. \nIt has created disproportionately harmful effects on family practice \nresidencies from Maine to Alaska. A recent survey of all family \npractice residency program directors has found that:\n  56 percent of respondents who were in the process of developing new \nrural training sites have indicated that they will either not implement \nthose plans or are unsure about their sponsoring institutions' \ncontinued support.\n  21 percent of respondents report planning to decrease their family \npractice residency slots in the immediate future. The majority of those \nwho are planning to decrease their slots are the sole residency program \nin a teaching hospital. This means that, under current law, they have \nno alternative way of achieving growth, such as through a reduction of \nother specialty slots in order to stay within the cap.\n\n  And finally, the vast majority of family practice residencies did not \nhave their full residency FTEs captured in the 1996 cost reports upon \nwhich the cap is based.\n\n  In addition to this survey, we have anecdotal information from \nresidencies across the country detailing how they have lost funding \neither because of where they trained their residents or because their \nresidents had been extended sick or maternity leave. For example, one \nfamily practice residency in Washington State last year had an \nequivalent of 14 residents training outside of the hospital and four in \nthe hospital. Under the BBA, their cap would be four. By contrast, had \nall of their residents been trained in the hospital up to this point, \ntheir payment base would have been capped at 18, even if they trained \nresidents in non-hospital settings in the future.\n  The Medicare Graduate Medical Education Technical Amendments Act, \nwhich I am introducing today, will address these problems by basing the \ncap on the number of residents ``who were appointed by the approved \nmedical residency training programs for the hospital'' in 1996, rather \nthan on the number of residents who were ``in the hospital.''\n  I am also concerned that the Balanced Budget Act and its accompanying \nregulations will severely hamper primary care residency programs that \nare expanding to meet local needs. Specifically, a new residency \nprogram that had not met its full complement of accredited residency \npositions until after the cutoff date of August 5, 1997, is precluded \nfrom increasing its number of residents unless the hospital decreases \nthe number of residents in one of its other specialty programs. \nHowever,\n\n[[Page S7177]]\n\nover forty percent of the nation's family practice residency programs \nare the only program sponsored by the hospital. This provision \ntherefore completely precludes such a hospital from expanding its \nresidency program to meet emerging primary care needs.\n  To address this problem, the legislation I am introducing today would \nexempt the small number of programs at hospitals that sponsor just one \nresidency program from the cap. In addition, to enable a number of \nfamily practice residency programs that are already in the pipeline to \nget accredited and grow to completion, the bill extends the cutoff date \nto September 1999.\n  And finally, the Balanced Budget Act gave the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services the authority to give ``special consideration'' to new \nfacilities that ``meet the needs of underserved rural areas.'' The \nHealth Care Financing Administration has interpreted this to mean \nfacilities that are actually in underserved rural areas. There have \nbeen several recent expansions in family practice residency programs \nthat include a rural training track, with residents located in outlying \nhospitals, or with satellite programs designed specifically to train \nresidents to work with underserved populations.\n  Even though these new programs or satellites required accrediting \nbody approval, they are still part of the ``mother'' residencies, which \nmay not be physically located in an underserved rural area. While these \nare not technically new programs, I believe that the definition should \nbe expanded to include such endeavors, given the value of these \nprograms in addressing the needs of underserved populations. Therefore, \nthe Medicare Graduate Medical Education Technical Amendments Act would \nexpand the definition to include ``facilities which are not located in \nan underserved rural area, but which have established separately \naccredited rural training tracks.''\n  Mr. PRESIDENT, while the changes I am proposing today are relatively \nminor and technical in nature, they are critical to the survival of the \nsmall family practice residency programs that are so important to our \nability to meet health manpower needs in rural and underserved areas.

A bill to provide for continuation of the Federal research \ninvestment in a fiscally sustainable way, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                    federal RESEARCH investment ACT\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to join my \ncolleagues Senators Frist, Lieberman, Domenici, Bingaman, Burns, Gramm, \nand Breaux in introducing the Federal Research Investment Act. This \nlegislation will set a long-term vision for federal funding of research \nand development programs so that the United States can continue to be \nthe world leader in high-tech industries.\n  This is a very important time in our history. One only needs to look \nas far as the front page of the newspaper to see the effect of high-\ntechnology on our country. New drugs are becoming available for \nfighting cancer; new communication hardware is allowing more people to \nconnect to the internet; and advances in fuel-cell technology are \nleading to low-emission, high-efficiency hybrid vehicles. In fact, \nseventy percent of all patent applications cite non-profit or \nfederally-funded research as a core component to the innovation being \npatented. People are living longer, with a higher quality of life, in a \nbetter economy due to processes, procedures, and equipment which are \nbased on federally-funded research.\n  What I am afraid of is that many people are not aware that these \nproducts do not just `come along.' They are the result of a basis of \nknowledge which has been built up by researchers supported by federal \nfunding. American companies pull from this knowledge base in order to \ndevelop the latest high-tech products which you and I read about in the \npaper and see on our store shelves.\n  I view this knowledge base as a bank. The US government puts in \nmodest amounts of funding in the form of support for scientific \nresearch. The payback comes from the economic growth which is produced \nas this knowledge is turned into actual products by American companies. \nThat is the good news.\n  The bad news is that the United States has been withdrawing more than \nit has been depositing for several years now. Just this year we are \nlooking at the first budget surplus in 29 years. A large part of the \ncurrent rosy economic situation is due to our dominate high-tech \nindustries. High-tech companies are currently responsible for one-third \nof our economic output and half of our economic growth. However, we \nhave not been supporting the fundamental, pre-competitive research \nwhich is critical to these industries at the levels necessary to allow \nus to continue at this pace. We must act now in order to try to correct \nthis situation.\n  Recently, Senators Gramm  and Lieberman, along with Senators Domenici \nand Bingaman, introduced S. 1305 the National Research Investment Act. \nTheir idea was to double R funding in 10 years, a very noble and \ncourageous effort. Even more importantly, I think, this bill caused \nmembers of the scientific and engineering community to pull together \nand fight as a whole for an idea. It has certainly caused the co-\nsponsors of this bill to pull together to try to move forward as a \ngroup with their original idea. Our bill is the next step in this \nprocess.\n  This bill is a long-term vision for federal R funding. It creates \nlegislative language which stresses the importance of R funding to \nthe strength of our nation's innovation infrastructure. It also sets \nout guidelines for Congress to use in prioritizing funding decisions.\n  Based on a careful review and analysis of our past history, our bill \nauthorizes a real funding increase of 2.5% over the rate of inflation \nfor the next 12 years for federally-funded, civilian, R programs. \nThis would increase federal R spending from the current level of 2.1% \nto 2.6% of total, overall budget. It would also cause a doubling, in \n1998 dollars, of R funding in approximately 12 years. In order to \nmake\n\n[[Page S7178]]\n\nsure that these increases are fully incorporated into budgetary process \nwe request that the President include these increases in his annual \nbudget request to Congress.\n  Currently, as I have stated previously, we are in an economic upturn. \nThis is the perfect time to increase funding for R so that we can \ncontinue this growth. I have faith that, as long as the economic \nsituation allows it, my thoughtful and wise colleagues will support \nincreasing R funding to the levels that we have laid out in this \nbill. However, I am also a realist. I realize that the economy may not \nalways remain as strong as it is right now. That is why we have \nintroduced a funding firewall. Without this firewall I am seriously \nconcerned that history will repeat itself. In the past, R funding is \none of the first things that has been cut during times of crisis. This \nis the wrong approach. I believe that cutting R funding levels below \na bare minimum level causes serious, long-term harm to the R \ninfrastructure in the United States. Our firewall would not allow this \nto happen. It is not meant as a goal, it is meant as a bare minimum \nwhich should only be implemented in the leanest of years.\n  Many, if not most, recent `quantum leaps' in knowledge have occurred \nat the interface between traditional disciplines of research. \nTherefore, we legislatively mandate that this funding increase must be \nmacroscopically balanced, so that there is not preferential growth of \none agency, program or field of study at the expense of other, equally \nqualified and deserving agencies. One of the original reasons that I \nstarted to get involved with technology issues such as EPSCoR and \nEPSCoT, was because I believe that technology should be shared by \neveryone, not just those in Silicon Valley or the Route 128 corridor in \nBoston. Therefore, this bill should not be seen as a means of promoting \nelitist science but as a mechanism for allowing for diversity in our \nnational innovation infrastructure.\n\n  Finally, so that we are able to assure other Members of Congress and \nthe general public that this money authorized by this Act would be well \nspent, we have included accountability measures which will assure that \nthere is no waste of federal money on out-dated, or ill-conceived \nprojects. This bill puts into place a system of accountability for each \naffected agency. Our bill institutes a study by the National Academy of \nSciences to determine how to effectively measure the progress of R \nbased agencies and then have them institute performance measures based \non these metrics. This will allow increases in funding without concerns \nover wasteful spending being generated.\n  In conclusion, with the help of Senators Gramm, Lieberman, Domenici, \nand Bingaman, Senator Frist and I have put together a long-term vision \nfor federal R funding which we hope will instigate real increases in \nfederal funding for research and development. Federally-funded research \nhas been, and will continue to be, a driving power behind our economic \nsuccess. If we are to maintain and enhance our current economic \nprosperity we must make sure that research programs are funded at \nadequate levels. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues, the original cosponsors of S. 1305, the members of the \nSenate Science and Technology Caucus, and Senator Breaux, as an \noriginal cosponsor of S. 2217, the Frist-Rockefeller Federal Research \nInvestment Act. This is the next step in the effort to restore federal \ncivilian R investments to their historical levels and assure American \nleadership in science, technology, and innovation into the 21st \ncentury.\n  I was pleased to introduce last October, along with Senators Gramm, \nBingaman, and Domenici, the National Research Investment Act of 1998, \nS. 1305, which now has 19 cosponsors. S. 1305 has been an important \ncoalition-building vehicle that served to galvanize support for federal \nR programs within the Congress. It is time, now, to move forward with \na new legislative instrument that can move through the committee \nprocess and onto the floor.\n  The Frist-Rockefeller bill adds an important policy piece to the \nSenate effort to double federal R investments--based upon the work \nthis year of the Senate Science and Technology Caucus, which I co-Chair \nalong with Senator Frist--and adds performance-based accountability \nprovisions to ensure the quality of programs funded with new monies. \nThe policy piece is especially valuable because it outlines an \ninvestment strategy that can serve as a useful complement to the very \nimportant efforts of the House Science Committee in drafting a national \npolicy for federal R programs.\n  We must fund research and development at levels commensurate with \ntheir contribution to the health and welfare of our citizenry. \nAmerica's research enterprise is the most competitive and productive in \nthe world. The strength of our innovation system depends on the steady \nstream of discovery that flows out of our nation's universities and \nindustrial and national laboratories. The creation of new knowledge, \nand the education and training that is part and parcel of the \nknowledge-creation process, are critical enablers of wealth creation \nand future economic growth. I believe that adequately funding R and \nadvanced scientific and technical education are two of the most \neffective measures we can undertake to promote the health and \nprosperity of America's high-tech economy.\n\n  I welcome the leadership of Senators Frist and Rockefeller. I look \nforward to working with them to assure the continued success of \nAmerica's science and technology enterprise.\n  I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the important work of the \nmany people representing research and educational organizations who \nhave labored long and hard to raise the level of understanding of those \nof us in Congress with respect to the contribution research makes to \nour national well being. They have helped to lay the groundwork for \nthis legislation that was introduced today.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Army, acting through \nthe Chief of Engineers, to evaluate, develop, and implement a strategic \nmaster plan for States on the Atlantic Ocean to address problems \nassociated with toxic microorganisms in tidal and non-tidal wetlands \nand waters; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n    atlantic coast toxic microorganism environmental remediation act\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation, together with my colleagues Senators Faircloth, Warner, \nMikulski and Robb, to help address the serious problems posed by toxic \nmicroorganisms that are affecting the tidal and non-tidal wetlands and \nwaters of the States along\n\n[[Page S7179]]\n\nthe eastern seaboard. The ``Atlantic Coast Toxic Microorganism \nEnvironmental Remediation Act'' authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers \nto develop and implement a strategy to mitigate current and potential \nproblems posed by these aquatic microorganisms.\n  Serious outbreaks of toxic microorganisms, such as Pfiesteria and \nPfiesteria-like dinoflagellates, have recently struck inland waters and \nestuaries in Maryland, North Carolina, Delaware, Florida, and Virginia. \nLinked to the flow of excess nutrients and loss of habitat, these toxic \nmicroorganisms are seriously impacting regional economies and \nthreatening finfish resources and economic and recreational sectors \nalong the Atlantic Coast.\n  Between 1972 and 1995, the number of coastal and estuarine waters \nthat host major, recurring attacks by harmful microbes has doubled. \nLast year alone, approximately 450,000 fish were killed in North \nCarolina by Pfiesteria, while tens of thousands of valuable fish met \nthe same fate in tidal rivers in the eastern shore of my own State of \nMaryland last year. There are other harmful microbes, as well, that are \nsimilar to Pfiesteria in their effects and that may be poised in a \nmoments notice to wreck havoc on our aquatic ecosystems and communities \nand which may pose serious threats to human health and safety.\n  In 1982, scientists were aware of 22 species of harmful water-borne \ndinoflagellates; now they are aware of over 60! So, we now face a \nsituation where more than five dozen different harmful microbes can \npotentially produce catastrophic economic and environmental effects in \nwaters extending along the eastern seaboard.\n  Experts note that such harmful attacks are increasing in frequency or \nseverity in aquatic environments both in the United States and \nworldwide. Toxic dinoflagellates and harmful algae are microscopic, \nsingle-celled organisms that live in the sea, estuaries and near-shore \ninland waters along our coasts. Most species are not harmful, and are a \nkey element in the aquatic food web. Unfortunately, a small number of \nthese species also produce potent neurotoxins than can affect and even \nkill higher forms of life, such as shellfish, finfish, birds, marine \nmammals, as well as impact human health.\n  Last year, the Administration directed that an interagency research \nand monitoring strategy be developed in response to the outbreaks of \nPfiesteria in the Chesapeake Bay. Seven federal agencies participated \nin developing this strategy including NOAA, EPA, the Departments of \nInterior and Agriculture and the Centers for Disease Control. Funding \nto implement actions called for under the plan and the Administration's \nClean Water Initiative was included in the fiscal 1999 budget request. \nUnfortunately, the key Federal agency with expertise in water resources \nand aquatic habitat restoration--the Army Corps of Engineers--was not \nincluded in the interagency task force and habitat and related \nconsiderations were not integrated into the response plans.\n  The bill I am introducing seeks to address this shortcoming and to \nensure that all the available expertise of the Federal government is \nbrought to bear in combating these biotoxins. The legislation \nauthorizes the Army Corps of Engineers, in partnership with State and \nlocal governments as well as other Federal agencies, to conduct an \nevaluation, develop a strategic master plan, and implement recommended \nactions to address problems in the degradation of aquatic habitat \nrelated to the presence of toxic microbes, including Pfiesteria, in \nwetlands and waters along the Atlantic coast. With its expertise in \nwatershed management and restoration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers \nhas a vital role to play in responding to the threats posed by toxic \nmicroorganisms and this legislation provides the funding and authority \nfor this agency to do so.\n  Mr. President: I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2218\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Atlantic Coast Toxic \n     Microorganism Environmental Remediation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) effective protection of tidal and nontidal wetlands and \n     waters of the United States is essential to sustain and \n     protect ecosystems, as well as recreational, subsistence, and \n     economic activities dependent on those ecosystems;\n       (2) the effects of increasing occurrences of toxic \n     microorganism outbreaks can adversely affect those ecosystems \n     and their dependent activities; and\n       (3) there needs to be a comprehensive evaluation, \n     development, and implementation of strategic master plans for \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain irrigation project property to certain irrigation districts in \nthe State of Nebraska; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n     missouri river basin, middle loup division project facilities \n                             conveyance act\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \n``Missouri River Basin, Middle Loup Division Project Facilities \nConveyance Act.''\n  The bill provides for the transfer of title of irrigation project \nfacilities and lands from the Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Department of \nInterior to the Middle Loup Division irrigation districts in central \nNebraska. These districts have operated the facilities there for over \n35 years.\n  The project facilities are part of the Missouri River Basin Project, \nand provide water from the Middle Loup River to over 64,000 acres of \nirrigable land, as well as providing recreation and fish and wildlife \nbenefits. Principal features of the projects include the Sherman Dam \nand Reservoir, the Arcadia Diversion Dam, the Milburn Diversion Dam, \nirrigation canals and laterals, drains and pumping plants.\n  Crops grown on these irrigated lands primarily include alfalfa, small \ngrains, sugar beets, and corn to provide feed for a thriving livestock-\nfeeding economy in my state of Nebraska, which includes beef cattle, \nhogs, and poultry.\n  In 1995 the Vice President indicated that the Bureau of Reclamation \nof the U.S. Department of Interior should transfer title to allow local \nownership of irrigation projects such as this. The Bureau has indicated \nto me that this project is a top candidate for title transfer to be \nachieved. When this legislation passes, Nebraska will become the first \nstate where title transfer efforts have been successful.\n\n[[Page S7180]]\n\n  A Nebraska-Middle Loup River Community Environmental Trust Fund is \nalso created through the transfer, to be administered by a 7-member \nInterlocal Cooperation Agency (ICA). The fund is to be used for \nenvironmental and conservation enhancements to project lands and \nfacilities, as agreed to by the 7-member ICA, and cannot be used for \nroutine operation and maintenance of the project or facilities.\n  The irrigation projects and facilities were constructed between 1955 \nand 1966 under authorities of the Flood Control Act of 1944, and are \ncurrently operated and maintained under contracts between the Bureau \nand the irrigation districts and power producers. The transfer will \nprovide for total repayment of all outstanding obligations on behalf of \nthe irrigation districts and power producers, while retaining all \ncurrent uses and purposes for the projects.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2219\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide the President with expedited Congressional \nconsideration of line item vetoes of appropriations and targeted tax \nbenefits; to the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, \nwith instructions that if one Committee reports, the other Committee \nhave thirty days to report or be charged.\n\n\n                the legislative line item rescission act\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today in response to the decision \nby the Supreme Court striking down the Line Item Veto Act.\n  Today's decision does not surprise many who have looked closely at \nthe constitutional questions raised by this law. The fundamental flaw \nof the Line Item Veto Act was that it violated the Presentment Clause \nof the Constitution by attempting to give the President the power to \namend legislation passed by Congress. In the words of Justice Stevens, \nwho wrote for the majority of the Court, ``If the Line Item Veto Act \nwere valid, it would authorize the President to create a different \nlaw--one whose text was not voted on by either House of Congress or \npresented to the President for signature.''\n  The majority opinion goes on to state that ``if there is to be a new \nprocedure in which the President will play a different role in \ndetermining the final text'' of a law, such change can only result from \namending the Constitution.\n  Some of my colleagues, in reaction to today's decision, have already \nannounced their support for a constitutional amendment giving the \nPresident this power. I hope that, in their haste, they do not overlook \na legislative alternative that I am introducing in the Senate today to \ncreate a process for expedited consideration of presidentially-proposed \nrescissions.\n\n[[Page S7182]]\n\n  I have been a supporter of line-item rescission legislation since the \nbeginning of my first term in the House of Representatives. I first \nintroduced legislation in August 1987, and I was pleased to see support \nfor this concept grow over the years.\n  In November 1987, I wrote to President Reagan's Chief-of-Staff, \nHoward Baker, to request that line-item rescission be discussed during \nthe Economic Budget Summit that was held during that year. Although the \nadministration declined this request, President Reagan's budget \nproposal for Fiscal Year 1989 contained a proposal for line-item \nrescission that was very similar to the legislation that I had \nintroduced.\n  Support continued to grow, and a variety of versions of this \nlegislation were introduced in the House. Eventually, the supporters of \nline-item rescission banded together in 1992 behind a common vehicle, \nH.R. 2164, which passed the House in October of that year. Insufficient \ntime was available in the legislative year, however, for the Senate to \ntake up the bill.\n  After the momentous elections in the fall of 1992, I met with Karen \nHancox of President-elect Clinton's transition team. I requested that \nClinton support the line-item rescission concept. His endorsement \nhelped win easy House passage of H.R. 1578 on April 29, 1993. To my \ndisappointment, however, the Senate did not take up consideration of \nthis bill, and the 103rd Congress adjourned without progress.\n  The 104th Congress brought a change in control of the Congress. With \nthat partisan shift came an inclination to support a new form of line-\nitem rescission, the so-called legislative line-item veto. Unlike line-\nitem rescission, the line-item veto stated that the president's \nrescissions were to be considered automatically approved unless \noverridden by a two-thirds vote of both the House and the Senate. \nAlthough still a cosponsor of line-item rescission, I voted for the new \nbill with the knowledge that it would receive constitutional scrutiny \nby the courts.\n  Now that the Supreme Court has ruled, I believe that Congress should \ntake another look at line-item rescission. The bill I submit today, S. \n2220, does not cede power to the President to alter an act of Congress. \nInstead, it provides for an up-or-down vote in Congress of rescissions \nproposed by the President, thus exposing controversial items of \nspending to the light of day. If Congress believes the spending is \nmerited, then it will vote to reject the rescission bill. Likewise, if \nthe spending does not stand up to scrutiny, Congress can pass the \nrescission bill with a majority vote in each house and send it to the \nPresident for signature.\n  The American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service has \nconducted a preliminary review of my bill. According to this review, S. \n2220 would meet the standard outlined in today's Court decision since \nthe bill would not cede to the President the power to alter the text of \nlegislation passed by Congress.\n  It seems clear that we still need a mechanism to highlight items of \nwasteful spending and to force a vote on this spending. Line-item \nrescission accomplishes this feat without unduly altering the balance \nof power between the legislative and executive branches of government. \nBefore running off to amend the Constitution, we should give line-item \nrescission a try.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. \n        D'Amato):\n  S. 2222. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrepeal the financial limitation on rehabilitation services under part B \nof the Medicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n    Reinstatement of the Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``Reinstatement of \nthe Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Act of 1998 with my colleagues, \nSenators Reid, Hollings, and D'Amato. This legislation will enable \nseniors to receive rehabilitative services based on their condition and \nnot on arbitrary payment limits. A similar version was introduced in \nthe House of Representatives by Congressman Ensign earlier this year.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 is a very important accomplishment \nand one that I am proud to say I supported. However, in our rush to \nsave the Medicare Trust Fund from bankruptcy, Congress neglected to \nthoroughly evaluate the impact the new payment limits on rehabilitative \nservices would have on Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The BBA included a $1500 cap on occupational, physical and speech \ntherapy services received outside a hospital setting. According to a \nrecent study by Muse & Associates, these limitations on services would \nharm almost 13 percent (or 653,000) of Medicare beneficiaries because \nthese individuals would exceed the cap. While many seniors will not \nneed services that would cause them to exceed the $1500 cap, others, \nlike stroke victims, will likely need services beyond what the \narbitrary caps will cover. Unfortunately, it is those beneficiaries who \nneed rehabilitative care the most who will be penalized by being forced \nto pay the entire cost for these services outside of a hospital \nsetting.\n  The bill I am introducing would repeal the cap, which is scheduled to \ngo into effect in January 1999. The Secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services would be required to implement a prospective \npayment system that would recoup any savings lost from the repeal of \nthis provision by January 2000. In essence, the bill attempts to \naccomplish the primary goal of the $1500 cap, budgetary savings, but \nwithout harming the Medicare beneficiary. Payment is based on the \npatient's condition and not on an arbitrary monetary amount. Help us \nrepeal the $1,500 cap, establish a system that makes sense, and still \nachieve the budget savings sought from the BBA without reducing \nMedicare benefits.\n  Please join me and my colleagues in passing this legislation. I ask \nunanimous that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2222\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Reinstatement of the \n     Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF FINANCIAL LIMITATION ON REHABILITATION \n                   SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Repeal.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 1833 of the Social Security Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395l) is amended by striking subsection (g).\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n     shall apply to services furnished on or after January 1, \n     1999.\n       (b) Offsetting Portion of Additional Expenditures Through \n     Payment Reform.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, for outpatient physical therapy services, outpatient \n     occupational therapy services, and outpatient speech-language \n     pathology services covered under title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act and furnished on or after January 1, 2000, the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services shall implement a new \n     payment methodology based on the classification of \n     individuals by diagnostic category, functional status, and \n     prior use of services in both inpatient and outpatient \n     settings.\n       (2) Budget neutrality in implementation.--Such payment \n     methodology shall be designed so that the methodology, taking \n     into account the increased expenditures resulting from the \n     amendment made by subsection (a), does not result in any \n     increase or decrease in the expenditures under title XVIII of \n     the Social Security Act on a fiscal year basis.\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \n``Reinstatement of the Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Act of 1998'' \n(RMRA). This legislation repeals a provision in the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997 (BBA 97) that imposes a $1500 annual per beneficiary cap on \nMedicare outpatient rehabilitation services. RMRA directs the Health \nCare Financing Administration (HCFA) to develop and implement an \nalternative payment system that is based on individual diagnosis and \nprior therapy in both inpatient and outpatient facilities by January 1, \n2000.\n  The BBA created annual caps for two categories of therapy provided to \nbeneficiaries under Medicare Part B: a $1500 annual cap on physical \ntherapy and speech language combined; and a separate cap for \noccupational therapy. These arbitrary limits on rehabilitation therapy \nwere hastily included in the BBA without the benefit of Congressional \nhearings or thorough review by HCFA. As a result, the $1500 limits bear \nno relation to the medical condition of the patient, or the health \noutcomes of the rehabilitative services.\n\n[[Page S7183]]\n\n  The $1500 cap would create serious access and quality problems for \nMedicare's oldest and sickest beneficiaries. Senior citizens who suffer \nfrom common conditions such as stroke, hip fracture, and coronary \nartery disease, will not be able to obtain the rehabilitative services \nthey need to resume normal activities of daily living. A stroke patient \ntypically requires more than $3,000 in physical therapy alone. \nRehabilitation therapy for a patient suffering from Multiple Sclerosis \nor ALS costs even more. Without access to outpatient therapy, patients \nmust remain in institutional settings longer, be transferred to a \nhigher cost hospital facility, or in some cases, just go without \nnecessary services.\n  Coverage for rehabilitative therapy should be based on medically \nnecessary treatment, not arbitrary spending limits that ignore a \npatient's clinical needs. I urge you to join me in protecting \nMedicare's most vulnerable beneficiaries by supporting the \n``Reinstatement of the Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Act of \n1998''.\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my \ncolleagues, Senator Grassley, Senator Reid, and Senator D'Amato in \nintroducing legislation which would repeal provisions of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 pertaining to the establishment of annual caps of \n$1,500 on all outpatient rehabilitation services except those furnished \nin a hospital outpatient department.\n  The ``Reinstatement of the Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Act of \n1998'' that we introduce today is made necessary because of the \nnegative impact these provisions will have on Medicare beneficiaries \nwho require therapy services. Senior citizens suffering from medical \nconditions common to the elderly such as stroke, hip fracture, and \ncoronary artery disease will not be able to obtain the rehabilitative \ncare they need to resume normal activities of daily living because of \nthis arbitrarily imposed cap. This is especially true in South \nCarolina, which has a significant number of Medicare recipients who \nlive in rural areas. A patient who has met the $1,500 cap will have no \nchoice but to seek care in a hospital outpatient department, not only \nat a much greater distance but also at a substantially higher cost.\n  The ``Reinstatement of the Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Act'' \nwould also repeal the provision combining speech-language pathology and \nphysical therapy services under the same $1,500 cap. These are two very \nseparate and distinct functions, and there is no rational basis for \nincluding them under one cap. As my constituent, Beth Fleming of \nAnderson, South Carolina, said recently, and I agree, ``Patients should \nnot have to choose between walking and talking.''\n  I urge my distinguished colleagues to join Senator Grassley, Senator \nReid, Senator D'Amato and me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS (for himself, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Bryan, Mr. \n        Thurmond, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Allard, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Reid, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. \n        Bennett, Mr. Mack, Mr. McCain and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 2223. A bill to provide a moratorium on certain class actions \nrelating to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 mortgage litigation reform act of 1998\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Mortgage \nLitigation Reform Act of 1998. This legislation is a narrowly crafted, \nbipartisan bill. Its goal is to provide relief from frivolous class \naction lawsuits resulting from the regulatory ambiguity over the \npayment of certain fees by mortgage bankers to mortgage brokers.\n  A spate of recent class action lawsuits have called into question the \nlegality of yield spread premiums, although there is no statute or \nregulation ruling that such fees are per se illegal. This legislation \nsimply places a moratorium, from the date of enactment through July 1, \n1999, on class action lawsuits regarding these fees. It is important to \nnote that the bill is narrowly crafted and does not prohibit personal \nrights of action or criminal prosecution related to these payments.\n  During the moratorium period, I am hopeful that either the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development will publish a clear ruling governing \nthe payment of yield spread premiums or, better yet, Congress will \nachieve the long sought after overhaul of the Real Estate Settlement \nProcedures Act (RESPA) and Truth In Lending Act (TILA).\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I introduce legislation entitled \nthe ``Mortgage Litigation Reform Act of 1998'' to stop the filing of \nfrivolous class action lawsuits in the mortgage lending process. At \ndispute in these class actions is whether the payment of a yield spread \npremium by a lender to another lender or a mortgage broker is a \nviolation of RESPA (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act).\n  The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, a federal statute enacted \nin 1974, was passed to provide consumers with meaningful disclosures \nabout the home buying process and protect them from paying unnecessary \nand costly fees when buying a house. Today, the statute is confusing to \nconsumers and no longer meets the needs of industry because of changes \nin technology and business affiliations. I held two hearings on RESPA \nand the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) last summer and found that consumer \ngroups and the real estate and lending community agreed that there must \nbe major overhaul of the statutes.\n  One issue among these problems is whether payment of a yield spread \npremium is legal. HUD's own home settlement booklet indicates that a \nmortgage broker may be paid by a borrower, a lender or both. This would \nindicate to a reasonable person that the payments are legal. However, \nwhen I questioned HUD point-blank on the legality of these fees during \nthe hearings last summer, the Department refused to give me a straight \nanswer. Instead, the agency proposed a cumbersome and confusing rule \nthat would have given legality to some of the fees in certain \ncircumstances. Many of us believed that the rule if put into final form \nwould have encouraged more frivolous litigation.\n  Today, consumer and industry groups and HUD and the Federal Reserve \nare working on legislative recommendations to overhaul RESPA and TILA. \nWe hope to have hearings on those recommendations later this year and \npass a reform package next session. While these efforts are underway, I \nbelieve that we should pass this narrowly-tailored moratorium on class \naction lawsuits until the issue of yield spread premiums is clarified \nby HUD or by the Congress. This bill would not affect the filing of \nprivate rights of action by individual consumers so that the legality \ncan be adjudicated on a case-by-case basis.\n  I believe that much work still needs to be done on RESPA and TILA \nreform but this legislation will enable one of those controversial \nissues to be set aside for the time being.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 2224. A bill to authorize the President to delay, suspend, or \nterminate economic sanctions if it is in the national security or \nforeign policy interest of the United States to do so; to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                 SANCTIONS RATIONALIZATION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on \nbehalf of myself, Senators Hagel, Biden and Roberts. The objective of \nthis bill is to restore some rationality to what has become a very \ncomplex and problematic compilation of Congressionally imposed \nunilateral economic sanctions laws.\n  The bill we are introducing today--the ``1998 Sanctions \nRationalization Act'' would give the President the authority to delay, \nsuspend or terminate a sanction that he believes not to be in the \nUnited States national interest. But it would also give Congress an \nopportunity to review each Presidential exercise such authority, and to \nenact a resolution of disapproval to maintain a particular sanction, \nunder the expedited procedures, within thirty days of Presidential \naction.\n  Mr. President, on June 4, I joined with Senator Lugar and others as a \ncosponsor of S. 1413--the Enhancement of Trade, Security, and Human \nRights Through Sanctions Reform Act. This bill creates a framework for \nfuture\n\n[[Page S7184]]\n\nconsideration by the legislative and executive branches of unilateral \neconomic sanctions. I applaud Senator Lugar for his vision in putting \ntogether this piece of legislation in cooperation with Congressman Lee \nHamilton.\n  I believe that the legislation I am introducing today complements the \nefforts of Senator Lugar and Congressman Hamilton by dealing with \nsanctions that are already imbedded in statute and which have come to \nthreaten the ability of the President of the United States to conduct \nUnited States foreign policy in furtherance of U.S. national interests.\n  Mr. President, U.S. sanctions--predominantly economic, but also \npolitical and sometimes even military penalties--are being employed \nmore and more frequently for a variety of purposes. The United States, \nmore than any other country, uses sanctions to further its many, \nsometimes conflicting, foreign policy objectives. We have used them \namong other things to discourage the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction and transfer of ballistic missiles, to advance human \nrights, to end state supported terrorism, to discourage armed \naggression, to protect the environment, to thwart drug trafficking, and \nin isolated instances to oust unacceptable governments.\n  Some recently released statistics illustrate just how pervasive U.S. \nsanctions have become, and at what cost to the United States. Since \nWorld War II, the United States has imposed sanctions on roughly 100 \noccasions--more than sixty percent of those sanctions have occurred \njust since 1993. Between 1993-1996, sixty-one U.S. laws and executive \norders have been enacted authorizing various types of unilateral \neconomic sanctions against thirty-five countries in the name of foreign \npolicy. The sanctioned countries encompass 42% of the world's \npopulation--roughly 2.3 billion potential consumers of U.S. goods and \nservices.\n  In our zeal to punish foreign governments for offensive behavior, we \nhave managed to cut ourselves off from approximately 20% of the world's \nexport markets. Our allies and trading partners think we are crazy. \nThey have happily filled the American void, often times gaining mid to \nlong term competitive advantages in these markets even after specific \nsanctions have been repealed, to the extent that happens.\n  Rarely, if ever, Mr. President is a careful and thoughtful analysis \ndone of the costs and benefits of the proposed sanction or the \nlikelihood of its altering the sanctioned behavior. In most instances, \nthe issue is rushed to the Senate or House floor, so that the Congress \ncan express its outrage at some perceived misdeed that just appeared in \nprint or live on CNN. To the best of my knowledge there has never been \nany systematic effort on the part of the Congress to review sanctions \nonce imposed, to consider whether they have achieved their objectives \nor have turned out to be counterproductive.\n  Unilateral economic sanctions have truly become the foreign policy \n``flavor of the month'' imposed by the Congress, in the heat of the \nmoment, often at the behest of special interest lobbies. Mr. President, \nwe may make ourselves feel good by voting to cut off foreign access to \nUnited States markets, goods, people and ideas. We may even please the \nparticular domestic constituency that has clamored for Congressional \naction. But in most instances we simply fool ourselves if we think that \nwe have done much, if anything, to alter the behavior or policy of the \ngovernment that has been targeted. In fact, we have probably made it \neasier for governments, particularly the authoritarian ones, to resist \nany internal pressures to change, because they can blame their domestic \nfailures on U.S. sanctions policy.\n  Since we don't appropriate funds to cover the actual private sector \ncosts incurred when sanctions are imposed, some in the Congress have \ncome to view them as a cost free way to influence the Administration's \nconduct of foreign policy. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nSanctions are one of the most pernicious ``unfunded mandates'' that the \nCongress can impose on the private sector, with virtually no prior \nconsultation or input from it.\n  According to the Institute for International Economics, a Washington-\nbased think tank, the cost of sanctions in 1995 alone was nearly $20 \nbillion in lost exports and 200,000 lost American jobs. If we carry \nthose costs forward by five years, these same sanctions would cost the \nAmerican economy $100 billion in foregone exports and one million jobs. \nThat is a high price to pay for a policy that is successful. More often \nthan not U.S. sanctions fail to alter behavior or policies.\n  The costs incurred due to sanctions are more than simply direct \neconomic costs. There are indirect costs as well--tangible and \nintangible. The cost to us diplomatically and politically with our \nfriends and allies can be extremely high. I suspect, for example, that \nUnited States officials have expended a great deal of our diplomatic \ncapital in defusing the anger of European officials and other \ninterested governments concerning the extra-territorial application of \ncertain recently enacted sanctions law. Such capital is not \ninexhaustible, and should be husbanded for those occasions when \ninternational support is critical to the United States effectively \ndealing with a major national security or foreign policy challenge--\nIraq, Bosnia, Pakistan, India and even Kosovo come readily to mind.\n  The time has come to call a halt to the indiscriminate use of \nunilateral sanctions as the foreign policy instrument of ``first \nresort.'' Perhaps we should consider the ``old fashioned'' way of \nconducting foreign policy--it's called diplomacy. While diplomacy may \ntake longer to produce results and isn't as dramatic as voting to \nimpose draconian measures against other countries, it more often than \nnot gets us where we want to go.\n  In saying that, I am not arguing that the United States should remove \nthe sanctions option from its foreign policy arsenal, just as I would \nnever suggest that we rule out the use of force as an option. Clearly \nthere are occasions when sanctions or military force are the \nappropriate responses to a particular situation--Iraq for one. However, \nin recent years we have elected to exercise the sanctions option far \ntoo frequently, and in so doing we are undermining its continued \neffectiveness as a U.S. foreign policy tool.\n  The United States, particularly the Congress must become more precise \nin the choice of sanctions, more realistic with respect to what is \nachievable, better informed of the potential costs to the U.S. economy \nand the American people, and more sensitive to the potential impact on \ninnocent populations and on relations with other governments. It is \nespecially problematic when Congress enacts sanctions and fails to \ninclude any flexibility in the statute to enable the President to \nrespond effectively to what we all know is an ever changing political \nlandscape. I believe that some of the measures enacted by the Congress \nare actually harmful to our long term foreign policy interests.\n  A perfect example of this has occurred recently with respect to India \nand Pakistan. Because of the so called Pressler amendment, President \nClinton had very little to offer in the way of ``carrots'' to Pakistan \nto dissuade it from following India in testing its nuclear weapons \ncapabilities. The President has even less flexibility today to respond \nto the new threat that exists following both India's and Pakistan's \ndefiance of the international community's pleadings to forgo testing. I \nsay this because under existing nuclear non-proliferations statutes \nenacted by the Congress, sanctions are automatic and the President has \nno authority to lift them absent Congressional action to modify \nexisting law.\n  The international reaction to recent events in India and Pakistan has \nbeen very telling. Even our closest allies who share our concerns about \nnuclear proliferation have failed to follow our lead by imposing \neconomic sanctions on India and Pakistan. Why? Because they do not \nbelieve that such an approach is likely to force India and Pakistan to \nsign onto international non-proliferations regimes. In fact, quite the \nopposite. It is likely to further isolate them, heightening domestic \npolitical pressure in both countries and encouraging each one to \nperfect even further their nuclear weapons capability and God forbid, \neven to consider using it against one another in a moment of paranoia.\n  As I have said earlier, I do not believe that we should ever totally \nrule out the use of sanctions as a foreign policy instrument. But \nbefore we impose them we should be clear about\n\n[[Page S7185]]\n\nwhat our foreign policy goals are. We should be selective in our choice \nof sanctions. They should be imposed for a finite time period, with an \noption to extend them, if the situation warrants it. We should also \ninclude a certain measure of flexibility in any Congressionally imposed \nsanctions to allow the Secretary of State and the President to fulfill \ntheir Constitutional obligations to conduct our nation's foreign \npolicy--without their arms tied behind their backs.\n  We should also endeavor to get other governments to join us in \nimposing sanctions. Multilaterally imposed sanctions have a far better \nlikelihood of succeeding than those that are unilaterally imposed and \nthey minimize the competitive disadvantages to the U.S. economy. This \nwill mean that we must have patience as diplomatic efforts are \nundertaken to garner international support.\n  If we find that we must go it alone, we should keep to a minimum the \nadverse effects of our sanctions on third countries, particularly \nfriends and allies. We should also be more selective in the choice of \nsanctions we impose --opting for those that will be felt by the \noffending government officials, rather than those that are more general \nin scope and harm the general population--people who in most cases have \nlittle or no ability to influence the behavior of their government \nleaders.\n  With economic sanctions fast becoming the very core of United States \nforeign policy, I believe that a more thoughtful and comprehensive \napproach to them is desperately needed before we do serious harm to our \nown national interests. The legislation introduced by Senator Lugar \nwould provide such a framework in the context of future sanctions. The \nbill I am introducing today would create a similar framework of \nrationality with respect to existing sanctions regimes.\n  I believe that the Lugar and Dodd bills, taken together, will help to \nsharpen the focus of the debate on this important subject. I believe \nsuch a focus is long overdue. I look forward to working with Senator \nLugar and other interested Senators in forging a comprehensive \nlegislative package that incorporates the approaches contained in the \ntwo bills so that our colleagues will have an opportunity to vote on \nthese very important matters in the very near future.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend from \nConnecticut, as well as Senators Hagel and Roberts, in introducing the \n``Sanctions Rationalization Act of 1998.''\n  The bill establishes a means for the President to delay, suspend, or \nterminate certain unilateral economic sanctions, or a portion thereof, \nif doing so is important to U.S. national interests. The bill also \nprovides a means for Congress to overturn any such decision, and \nprovides for expedited procedures within the House and Senate for \nconsideration of a resolution to reverse a Presidential decision.\n  I have become increasingly concerned that Congress' efforts to impose \nsanctions is unduly hampering the President's ability to conduct U.S. \nforeign policy. To say this is not to suggest that Congress has \nexceeded its authority in the foreign affairs area. Under the \nConstitution, both Congress and the President have considerable foreign \npolicy powers. As Professor Edward Corwin, a noted authority on the \nPresidency, once wrote, the Constitutional design on foreign policy \ntenders an ``invitation to struggle.''\n  Indeed, Congress has several powers under the Constitution in the \nforeign affairs area.\n  It has, among other things, the power of the purse, the power to \ndeclare war, the power to raise and support the military, and the power \nto regulate foreign commerce.\n  Congress is well within its power to impose sanctions against foreign \ngovernments. And in many instances, sanctions--or the embarrassment to \nthe foreign government which flows from their imposition--have had a \npositive effect in advancing U.S. policy.\n  But what Congress cannot do is to conduct the daily business of \ndiplomacy. Only the President can undertake negotiations with foreign \ngovernments and leaders. And any law which limits the ability of the \nUnited States to engage with foreign nations necessarily limits the \noptions available to the President as he seeks diplomatic solutions to \nforeign policy problems.\n  Foreign policy, however, usually involves a complex mosaic of \ninterests, and requires use of a wide range of diplomatic instruments. \nMoreover, foreign policy is not static--constantly changing \ncircumstances often require calibrations in policy.\n  The imposition of statutory sanctions, in many cases, serves to \nundermine the ability of the President to balance the competing \ninterests and to respond to changes on the ground overseas.\n  In sum, statutory sanctions are often a blunt instrument, when the \nsituation at hand may call for an instrument which the President can \nfine-tune.\n  The most significant part of this legislation, in my view, is that it \ngives the President the power to calibrate sanctions once imposed--that \nis, to adjust or modify the application of a sanction as the situation \nmay warrant. Accordingly, he can use the authority in this bill to try \nto induce the desired action by the foreign government by lifting or \nmodifying a sanction progressively.\n  The bill does not allow the President to terminate those measures \nthat are imposed on a multilateral basis, including obligations under \nresolutions of the United Nations Security Council, nonproliferation \nand export control arrangements like the Australia Group, the Nuclear \nSupplier's Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime, and the \nWassenaar Arrangement.\n  The bill also does not allow the President to terminate those \nmeasures taken under treaty obligations, such as those under the \nChemical Weapons Convention, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and \nthe Biological Weapons Convention.\n  Further, the bill does not apply to several types of measures, \nincluding foreign military financing, export controls and restrictions \nunder the Arms Export Control Act, any measure taken pursuant to \nsection 307 of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare \nElimination Act of 1991, any measure to restrict imports of products \nand services in order to protect domestic health or safety, any measure \nto enforce a federal criminal law, and any retaliatory trade measure \nauthorized under our trade statutes or international trade agreements.\n  In proposing this legislation, I do not envisage that the authority \ngranted to the President would be employed casually. Instead, like \nanalogous waiver authority in the Foreign Assistance Act--section 614 \nof that Act--I expect that this power would be used only when \nabsolutely necessary, only after careful consideration in the Executive \nBranch, and only after careful consultation with the appropriate \ncommittees of Congress.\n  And in cases where the President does abuse the authority this bill \ngrants him, Congress would still have the power to reverse the \nPresident's decision, and resolutions to do so will be entitled to \nexpedited procedures which would ensure their prompt consideration.\n  I wish to emphasize that I do not regard this bill as a final \nproduct. Rather, it is a work in progress. This is a complicated \nsubject; defining what constitutes a ``sanction'' is a difficult \nundertaking, as is drafting the necessary exclusions.\n  Accordingly, I welcome contributions from our colleagues, the \nExecutive Branch, and non-governmental organizations.\n  Of course, this is not the only legislation on this subject. Our \ncolleagues, Senator Lugar, and Representative Hamilton, have made an \nimportant contribution in promoting the debate on this subject in \nintroducing their sanctions reform legislation. The Majority and \nMinority Leaders plan to appoint a special task force to review the \nissue, and I am certain that legislative proposals will emerge from \nthose discussions.\n  In closing, I should state that I am under no illusion that passing \nthis legislation will be easy. It may be that we cannot reach a \nconsensus on acceptable legislation in the remaining months of the \n105th Congress.\n  What is important now is that the Executive and the Congress have \ninitiated a dialog, on a bipartisan basis, on a subject of considerable \nimportance to our national interests. I look forward to engaging in \nthat debate in the weeks and months ahead.\n\n[[Page S7186]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Mack):\n  S. 2225. A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \nprohibit new leasing activities in certain areas off the coast of \nFlorida, and to permit exploration, production, or drilling activities \non existing leases only if adequate studies are performed, to require \nadequate information and analyses for development and production \nactivities, and to allow states full review of development and \nproduction activities; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                      FLORIDA COAST PROTECTION ACT\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today with my good friend and \ncolleague Senator Mack I introduce the ``Florida Coast Protection \nAct''. This legislation will protect Florida's fragile coastline from \nouter continental shelf leasing and drilling in three important ways.\n  First, it transforms the annual moratorium on leasing and preleasing \nactivity off the coast of Florida into a permanent ban covering \nPlanning Areas in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, the Straits of Florida, \nand the South Atlantic Planning Area.\n  Second, it raises the bar for approval of development and production \nrequests on existing leases off the coast of Florida. It establishes a \nJoint Federal-State Outer Continental Shelf Task Force comprised of \nexperts from the Environmental Protection Agency, the Minerals \nManagement Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine \nFisheries Service, the Biological Resources Division of the United \nStates Geological Survey, state representatives, and professional \nscientist nominated by the National Academy of Sciences. This Joint \nTask Force will ensure that all data required to make a determination \nof the environmental and economic effects of oil and gas production and \ndevelopment on local communities is available to the Secretary of \nInterior and the State of Florida.\n  Third, the Florida Coast Protection Act corrects an egregious \nconflict in regulatory provisions where an affected state is required \nto make a consistency determination for proposed oil and gas production \nor development under the Coastal Zone Management Act prior to receiving \nthe Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) from the Mineral Management \nService. Our bill requires that the EIS is provided to affected states \nsix months before they make a consistency determination.\n  Mr. President, you may recall that we introduced similar legislation \nunder the same title in June of 1997. The focus of that bill was the \ncancellation of the lease tract 17 miles off the coast of Pensacola, \nresulting in the elimination of six oil and gas leases. Since that \ntime, these leases were relinquished by the Mobil Corporation back to \nthe control of the U.S. Department of the Interior. In addition, these \nareas are covered by the moratorium on leasing in the Eastern Gulf--a \nprotection that President Clinton recently extended through 2012 as \npart of the Year of the Ocean efforts to protect this extremely \nvaluable natural resource.\n  What would this bill mean for Florida? The elimination of preleasing \nactivity and lease sales off the coast of Florida protects our economic \nand environmental future.\n  In 1997, over 47 million tourists visited Florida, spending $41 \nbillion. The five western counties of the Florida Panhandle brought in \nover $8 million from tourist development tax in 1996. Three cities in \nthis area--Panama City, Pensacola, and Fort Walton Beach--recorded over \n$1.5 billion in tourism and recreation taxable sales during the same \nperiod.\n\n  It is home to some of the richest estuarine areas in the world. These \nhabitats provide an irreplaceable link in the life cycle of both marine \nand terrestrial species. Florida's commercial fishing industry relies \nheavily on these estuaries as they support the nurseries for most \ncommercially harvested fish. In addition, nearly 90 percent of the reef \nfish resources in the Gulf of Mexico are caught on the West Florida \nShelf.\n  Mr. President, the environmental and economic value of this area is \nevidenced by the many state and federal land holdings in designated \nenvironmental preservation, conservation, and recreation areas. Fifty \nof these areas are located along 175 miles of coastline in the Florida \nPanhandle.\n  In testimony before the House Resources Subcommittee on Energy and \nMineral Resources on May 14, 1998, Florida Governor Lawton Chiles \nprovided the following perspective on the potential damage to Florida's \ncoastline that could be caused by offshore drilling. He said that ``oil \nspills remain the most visible . . . however, there are other \ndetrimental environmental effects that these activities could have on \nthe shallow, clean water marine communities found on the Florida outer \ncontinental shelf . . . [including] . . . physical disturbances caused \nby anchoring, pipeline placement and rig construction, the resuspension \nof bottom sediments, and the chronic pollution from discharges of \ndrilling effluents, production effluents, and possible accidental \nreleases of oil or other toxic material . . .''\n  Throughout my time in the Senate, I have opposed offshore oil \ndrilling off the coast of Florida because of the threat it presents to \nthe state's greatest natural and economic resource--our coastal \nenvironment. With my colleagues in the Florida delegation, I have \nworked successfully to obtain moratoria on additional leasing off the \nwest Florida coast. With the passage of the Florida Coast Protection \nAct, this annual moratoria will evolve into permanent protection for \nthe Florida coastline.\n  The Florida Coast Protection Act is a milestone in our attempts to \nprotect our natural coastal resources in the State of Florida and \nthroughout the nation. I urge my colleagues to support this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2225\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today with my colleague, Senator \nGraham. I introduce the Florida Coast Protection Act of 1998. It was a \nlittle over a year ago that we introduced similar legislation to \nprotect the pristine environment off of Florida's coasts. That \nlegislation would have banned leasing within 100 miles of the coast of \nFlorida, and would have canceled six oil and gas leases on the Outer \nContinental Shelf closest to Florida's coast held by the Mobil \nCorporation. Fortunately, soon after we introduced our bill, Mobil \ndecided to pull out of those leases. Nevertheless, the threat to \nFlorida's coastline remains.\n  Mr. President, Floridians have always been justifiably concerned \nabout the prospect of oil and gas exploration in the waters off our \nstate. We are well aware of the risk this activity poses to our \nenvironment and our economy because, in Florida. A healthy environment \nmeans a healthy economy. Millions of people come to our State each year \nto enjoy the climate, our beaches, and our fine quality of life. The \ntourism industry in Florida provides millions of jobs and generates \nrevenues in the billion of dollars. It would take only one disaster to \nend Florida's good standing as America's vacationland. We cannot afford \nto let that happen.\n  Throughout my tenure in the Senate I have opposed exploration and \ndrilling off Florida's coasts. My goal--and the goal the entire Florida \nCongressional delegation--is to permanently remove this threat from our \ncoasts. In recent years, we have stood together in opposition to \ndrilling and have successfully extended the annual moratorium on all \nnew leasing activities on Florida's continental shelf.\n  Mr. President, while the opposition of Floridians to oil drilling is \nwell-documented, the reality remains that leases have been let, \npotential drilling sites have been explored and it is likely that \nactual extraction of resources could take place within the next few \nyears. For these reasons, I rise with Senator Graham to protect our \nstate from the ravages of drilling.\n  First, our legislation makes permanent the ban on any new leasing \nactivity within 100 miles of our coast in order to prevent a repeat of \nthe past mistake of leasing in the OCS off Florida. Second, it requires \nadditional studies be conducted prior to the issuance of permits of oil \nand gas production on existing leases. Finally, it gives the state \nflexibility to make a determination regarding the consistency of oil \nand gas development and production plans with The Coastal Zone \nManagement Act after an environmental impact statement detailing the \ndirect and cumulative impacts of the project is completed by the \nMinerals Management Service.\n  Mr. President, removing the threat of oil and gas exploration \npermanently from our shores will require responsible leadership from \nthe Congress. This legislation, in my view, is absolutely necessary to \nprotect our state's economic and environmental well-being. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this worthwhile effort. We look forward to \nworking with Senator Murkowski, Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources, to meet this goal.\n                                  ____\n\n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Kempthorne):\n  S. 2226. A bill to amend the Idaho Admission Act regarding the sale \nor lease of school land; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                 amendments to the idaho admissions act\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today with my friend and colleague \nfrom Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, introduce a bill to amend the Idaho \nAdmission Act of July 3, 1890, to provide for the better management of \nschool lands within our state. In doing so, I note that our Idaho \ncolleagues Congressmen Chenoweth and Crapo will offer identical \nlegislation in the House of Representatives today.\n  Mr. President, this piece of legislation is simple, straightforward, \nand of vital importance to my state. It brings federal statute into \nline with amendments to the Idaho Constitution passed by the Idaho \nState Legislature earlier this year and has but one goal: to bring \nabout the better management of state lands to the financial benefit of \nour public schools.\n  The legislation, along with that passed by the Legislature, were \ndeveloped to implement the recommendations of a special committee of \nstate leaders who sought to secure financial security for Idaho's \nschools. This legislation accomplishes the goal with only a few changes \nto current statute.\n  First, it allows the Board of Land Commissioners to exercise its \nfiduciary responsibility as managers of the state endowments by \ntreating both land and fiscal assets as one trust.\n\n[[Page S7189]]\n\n  Second, the proposal creates an earnings reserve account that will \nserve as a ``shock absorber'' to allow the endowments to provide a more \npredictable income stream.\n  Third, it provides increased and stable funding for public education \nby allowing investments in assets that will provide higher rates of \nreturn. The state committee projected that through this single change, \npublic education in our state could receive up to $20 million or more \nannually without raising taxes.\n  Fourth, it establishes a land bank account for proceeds from the sale \nof endowment lands. The account gives the Board of Land Commissioners \nthe flexibility to re-invest in other real property for the land trust.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we introduce today is supported by the \nIdaho State Legislature and was written in compliance with the Joint \nMemorial passed by the Legislature and sent to us earlier this year. It \nis vitally important to our Governor, the Board of Land Commissioners, \nand all those involved in public education in our state.\n  Like most western states, certain lands within Idaho were reserved \nfor the benefit of public education upon admission to the Union. These \nlands are spread throughout the state and are managed for the financial \nbenefit of our children. The Idaho Admission Act is very specific in \nhow these lands are to be administered. And while these specifications \nworked well in 1890, they have now become outdated. These century old \nregulations have severely limited the state's efforts to maximize \nfunding for public schools. The legislation we introduce today brings \nthe management of endowment lands into modern times and employs modern \nfinancial tools to the benefits of Idaho children.\n  Mr. President, I implore my colleagues to act on this measure in a \ntimely matter and hope they might all join me in this important \nendeavor to help Idaho public education and the children it \nserves.\n Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this Congress and the citizens \nof Idaho must seize a unique opportunity to pass legislation this year \nthat will provide the ability to increase Idaho public education \nfunding at least $20 million and possibly $30 million annually. And it \nwill do so without raising taxes, cutting services or asking the \nfederal government for one thin dime.\n  This is no smoke and mirrors.\n  This is creativity and innovation at its best.\n  This legislation will empower Idaho to be better stewards of the \nendowment created 108 years ago that helps pay for Idaho's public \neducation. By using prudent, time-tested investment strategies, the \nendowment will be better equipped to pay for teaching Idaho's children \nin the 21st century.\n  Legislation I am introducing today with Senator Larry Craig will \nreform federal law that now restricts the way Idaho's Endowment Fund is \nmanaged. This legislation, along with constitutional amendments Idaho \nvoters must approve in November, will modernize the legal framework of \nthe endowment. According to financial experts, this legislative package \nwill substantially increase funds available for Idaho school children. \nSpecifically, this legislation gives greater flexibility for investing \nand managing endowment funds, and for managing the sale and lease of \nendowment lands.\n  The bottom line is that the bill provides more money for educating \nour kids, money that can be used to buy computers, increase teachers' \nsalaries, or buy new textbooks.\n  And all this without raising taxes, cutting services or asking the \nfederal government for one thin dime.\n  I will work to get this bill passed in the Senate, in the House of \nRepresentatives and signed into law by President Clinton this year.\n  Here is the background.\n  In writing the 1890 law that made Idaho the 43rd state, the citizens \nof Idaho worked with Congress to set aside 3.5 million acres of land as \na permanent endowment to help finance the education of Idaho children \nin the 20th century.\n  Today this endowment is worth a combined total of $3.4 billion that \nconsists of 2.5 million acres of land valued at $2.7 billion and an \nendowment fund worth nearly $700 million. In 1997, land and timber \nsales and investment interest generated $110 million of income. Of \nthat, $55 million was reinvested into the endowment; $35 million was \ndevoted to public schools and $10 million paid for other state \nendowments.\n  But we can do even better for Idaho.\n  In FY97, this $3.4 billion endowment earned $110 million, or a rate \nof return of just 3%. By virtually any investment standard, this is a \nlow rate of return. If this rate increased by just one additional \npercent, to 4%, an extra $32 million would be created.\n  The reason the Idaho Endowment Fund earned 3% and not any higher is \nbecause its investment and management structure is terribly outdated. \nThe endowment was created in the 1800s when there was no developed \nsecurities market and before inflation became a major factor in \ninvestment decisions. As a result, the fund has no investment in \nequities or other higher yielding instruments. Right now, the endowment \nis exclusively invested in low yielding debt instruments like \ngovernment securities, mortgages, and corporate bonds.\n  Right now, the law requires the endowment to be managed the way land \nand money were managed in 1890, not in the 1900s. That's like keeping \nlaws on the books that restrict the delivery of health care to \nprocedures and drugs that were available in 1800s.\n  The problem is simple. Current laws keep Idaho from earning higher \nrates of return. This results in less money being available for school \nchildren who do not received as much as they might, and it requires \ntheir parents to pay more taxes to make up the difference. While this \nproblem is simple, so is the solution. And that is to allow the fund to \nbe invested in a broader array of investments and require that \ninvestments must follow what is known as the ``prudent investor'' test. \nThis test requires managers to use reasonable care and caution in \nmaking investment decisions.\n  In addition, both current federal law and the Idaho State \nConstitution contains provisions that restrict the ability of the land \ntrust to maximize the sale and management of the endowment lands.\n  If prudent, time-tested investment strategies were applied to the \nland trust and endowment fund, financial experts agree that rates of \nreturn would increase, investment risk would decrease, and fluctuations \nin annual cash flows would be eliminated.\n  The bottom line is this: More money for Idaho school children. And \nless taxes for their parents.\n  Congress and the citizens of Idaho must work together to prepare the \nIdaho Endowment to meet the needs of children in the 21st century.\n  That's the goal of the legislation Senator Craig and I are \nintroducing today.\n  Section Five of the original Idaho Admissions Act of 1890 created the \nendowment fund, and rules governing sale and lease of endowment land.\n  The measure we are introducing today will replace Section 5 with a \nnew section that gives land and investment managers greater flexibility \nin managing both the endowment land and endowment funds. Here is how:\n  Under current law, income from lands sales can only be placed in the \nendowment fund. Once placed in the endowment fund, funds cannot be used \nto buy land, even if doing so will ultimately produce more funds for \neducation.\n  To provide more flexibility for land sales, legislation we are \nintroducing today would give the state the authority to establish a new \nland bank fund which can be used to purchase additional land. For \nexample, this land bank would allow the state to sell land that is \ndifficult to manage in order to purchase land of higher functionality \nand greater investment return.\n  Under current law, no flexibility exists for managing endowment fund \ncash flow.\n  The legislation we are introducing today establishes an Earnings \nReserve Fund. This earning reserve can be managed in a way that insures \na steady, and likely higher source of funds for public education than \nwhat is now provided. With this earnings reserve in place, the assets \nof the endowment are placed in investments that over time have higher \nyields than less fluctuating, lower yielding investments. This reserve \nfund gives investment managers greater flexibility that have\n\n[[Page S7190]]\n\nhigher returns and facilitate a steadier and higher stream of \ndistributions.\n  Under current law, there is a 10-year limit on leases of endowment \nlands.\n  The Craig-Kempthorne legislation repeals the 10-year limit, and \nallows the state land board to establish agreements that will maximize \nthe long-term financial return on any lease that is made. This \nprovision makes the management of lands available for education \npurposes on equal footing with the management of land in other \nendowments.\n  These changes may sound technical but in truth bring common-sense to \nmanaging the Idaho Endowment. The endowment, if it were created today, \nwould be managed as a whole, and would have a diversified mix of equity \nassets, with smaller portions of fixed income and real estate. In \naddition, cash flow would be better regulated to meet a more \nconsistent, and higher, level of distributions. This is the \noverwhelming practice of most endowments.\n  Instead, the Idaho Endowment is two separate entities, the land trust \nand the endowment fund. There is currently little coordination between \nthese two entities, and each part of the endowment is concentrated in a \nparticular type of asset. The land trust is dominated by timber, and \nthe financial assets are exclusively fixed income, lower-yielding \nassets. There is currently no management of the distributions of \noverall cash flow and the investment policy has no long-term investment \nstrategy, or prudent management of cash flow or a policy to decrease \nthe concentration of assets to reduce investment risk. This is an \noutdated investment strategy. And there is now no comprehensive plan \nfor the entire trust.\n  Governor Phil Batt appointed a committee of financial experts and \npublic officials to review the endowment and land trust. This \ncommittee, chaired by Douglas Dorn, reviewed the endowment and the \ntrust, and made a number of recommendations. Of particular importance, \nthe committee recommended and concluded that the endowment should be \nmanaged as one fund by one governing body that would decide overall \ninvestment strategy using modern day so-called prudent investor \ninvestment strategies.\n  The creation of the land bank and the earnings reserve are key \nelements of this strategy. That is what this legislation provides, and \nI urge the Senate to adopt this bill at the first opportunity. And I \nwill be urging the citizens of Idaho to do their part this November and \nvote for the constitutional amendments that are needed to modernize the \nlegal framework of the Endowment.\n  I commend Governor Batt for his leadership and innovation in \ndeveloping this legislative package which will clearly benefit Idaho \nchildren. I also want to commend Doug Dorn, and his committee of Rep. \nWilliam L. Deal, State Controller J.D. Williams, Robert Montgomery, Dr. \nThomas Stitzel, Robert Maynard, Michael Brassey, Clive Strong and \nMichael Ferguson for their effective and bipartisan work.\n  Today we see the results of the wisdom and foresight of the decisions \nmade 100 years ago by Congress and the citizens of Idaho. I trust this \nCongress and the citizens of Idaho will match the wisdom of their \npredecessors, and adopt this legislative package which will provide \nmore money so we can teach our children well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7176-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7190-S7200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE MEDICARE+CHOICE PAYMENT EQUITY ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, last year's balanced budget \nagreement contained provisions to make Medicare more efficient by \nmoving away from wasteful practices that the private sector long ago \nconsigned to history, while offering seniors in Oregon and other states \nmore and better choices for their health care service. The bipartisan \nbill Senator Smith and I are introducing today will make sure that \nthose provisions are implemented in a way that will indeed bring about \nthe full potential of these reforms.\n  The Medicare+Choice Payment Equity Act of 1998 will finish what we \nstarted with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by creating payment equity \nunder Medicare's formula for paying for managed care services . Without \nequity in payment, beneficiaries in Oregon could be penalized because \nthey may never get the same kinds of services in their Medicare managed \ncare package that are available in other areas of the country with less \nefficient health care systems.\n  For states like Oregon with cost efficient health care systems, the \nMedicare formula resulted in lower payment. While we made progress in \ncorrecting this inequity through the Balanced Budget Act, changes made \nat the last minute in the legislation will actually prevent efficient \nstates from ever gaining full equity in payment under Medicare managed \ncare plans.\n  This legislation corrects that by requiring full funding of what is \nknown as the ``blend'' portion of the formula. With managed care taking \na larger role in Medicare it is more important now to assure equity in \nthe payment formula.

Mr. President, today with my colleague, \nSenator Wyden, I introduce legislation to restore equity in the \nMedicare payment rate otherwise known as the Average Adjusted Per \nCapita Cost (AAPCC) formula under Medicare. This formula, which is \nimplemented by the Health Care Financing Administration, determines the \npayment rates made to health maintenance organizations (HMOs) that \noffer coverage to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, prior to the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997, AAPCC rates were determined by calculating the five-year average \nof per-capita Medicare fee-for-service spending by county, as well as \nthe graduate medical education (GME) and disproportionate share (DSH) \npayments. Since Medicare utilization rates, GME and DSH rates vary from \ncounty to county throughout the United States, those areas that have \nlow Medicare utilization rates subsequently receive a lower payment \nthan other areas where Medicare utilization rates are much higher. In \n1997, those rates varied from $286 in Gilliam County, Oregon to $748 in \nDade County, Florida.\n  The result of such disproportionate levels in payments to HMOs is a \ndisproportionate amount of benefits provided to Medicare beneficiaries. \nFor example, HMOs that provide coverage for Medicare beneficiaries \nliving in Los Angeles, California or Dade County, Florida receive a \nsignificantly higher payment; therefore, they can afford to provide \nadditional benefits such as prescription drugs, eye glasses, and dental\n\n[[Page S7191]]\n\ncoverage. Meanwhile, HMOs that provide coverage to beneficiaries in \nPortland, Oregon receive a lower payment rate and cannot afford to \nprovide such additional benefits. Mr. President, this is blatantly \nunfair, and unacceptable. Medicare beneficiaries deserve the same \naccess to the same benefits, regardless of where they live in this \ncountry.\n  To address this discrepancy, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 included \nthree main provisions to change the calculation of the AAPCC payment \nrates. First, a minimum ``floor'' payment of $367 was implemented to \nprovide assistance to those rural counties with low Medicare \nutilization rates. Second, a blended rate was established to benefit \nlow and mid-level payment counties to slowly bring them up to a more \nequitable level. Third, a minimum two percent ``hold-harmless'' was \nestablished so that all counties, even those at a higher payment level, \nare guaranteed at least a two percent increase in their current payment \nrates.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on the Budget, I was proud to \nsupport these provisions; however, the only component of this proposal \nthat has been implemented, is the guaranteed two percent increase for \nall counties due to budget neutrality restrictions. While the two \npercent increase is a good start in restoring some equity to the \npayment system, beneficiaries living in rural counties in Oregon and \nthroughout the country will not have access to Medicare+Choice options \nif we cannot find a way to provide funding for the blend component. \nThis was the original intent of Congress, and I believe we have a \nresponsibility to implement all three of these provisions in order to \nrestore equity to the Medicare system.\n  The legislation that Senator Wyden and I are proposing today would \nremove the budget neutrality provision used in calculating the blended \ncapitation rate for Medicare+Choice organizations. To put this simply, \nwe propose to fund the blend. Under this legislation, the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services would submit to Congress a legislative \nproposal outlining ways in which to restructure federal Medicare \nexpenditures in order to implement the blend. We believe this is a fair \nand fiscally responsible way to address this matter and look forward to \nthe Finance Committee's consideration of this issue in the year ahead.\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend my colleague, Senator Wyden, \nfor drafting this legislation and for the work of Stephanie Kennan of \nhis staff on this bill. He has been a strong proponent of Medicare \nreform both as a member of the House of Representatives and as a member \nof the Senate Committee on the Budget. I thank him for this opportunity \nto join him in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Levin, \n        Mr. Brownback and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 2228. A bill to amend the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. \nApp.) to modify termination and reauthorization requirements for \nadvisory committees, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n    THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE TERMINATION AND STREAMLINING ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, our democracy depends not just on \nour citizens exercising the franchise at every election. It also \ndepends on the active participation of citizens in the operations of \nthe government. To that end, the federal government has sought input \nand advice from citizens on a wide variety of issues by creating \nadvisory committees. To solicit this input, however, costs the \ngovernment around $180 million a year, and results in an accretion of \nadvisory committees that continue long after their useful purpose is \nsatisfied.\n  The operations of advisory committees are governed by the Federal \nAdvisory Committee Act of 1972, commonly called ``FACA.'' This law was \nenacted out of a concern that federal advisory committees were \nproliferating without adequate review, oversight, or accountability. In \nadopting the FACA, Congress intended that the number of advisory \ncommittees be kept to the minimum necessary and that all advisory \ncommittees operate openly under uniform standards and procedures.\n  Although the FACA was not enacted until 1972, agencies of the federal \ngovernment had been using advisory committees for many years. For \nexample, the Board of Visitors of the Naval Academy was established by \nCongress in 1879. There are four types of advisory committees used by \nfederal agencies: committees mandated by Congress; committees \nauthorized, but not mandated, by Congress; committees mandated by \nexecutive order of the President; and, finally, committees established \nby agencies under their organic statutes. Over the years, the number of \nadvisory committees grew. In enacting the FACA, Congress mandated that \nall then-existing advisory committees terminate within two years but \ndid not apply this mandate to advisory committees established directly \nby Congress, only to those created by agencies themselves. Despite this \ntermination mandate, the number of advisory committees continued to \nincrease after enactment of the FACA. Many of the advisory committees \nterminated two years after the FACA's enactment were simply \nreestablished, and many new committees have since come into existence.\n  While allowing public participation in government, advisory \ncommittees cost the federal government money. According to the General \nServices Administration, the 968 federal advisory committees used by \nfederal agencies cost the government $178 million in fiscal year 1997 \nand consumed 1254 full-time equivalent positions. Advisory committees \nare expected to cost the government $183 million this year. Even though \nthe number of advisory committees has fallen from 1305 in 1993, their \ncosts have continued to increase, even in constant dollars. In 1988, \nthe cost to operate advisory committees was $93 million. The cost to \noperate fewer advisory committees in 1997 was about $136 million in \n1988 dollars.\n  The costs associated with advisory committees would be even higher \nwere it not for initiatives taken to reduce the number of advisory \ncommittees created by executive branch agencies. The number of these \n``discretionary'' committees, those created not at the direction of \nCongress or the President, is limited to 534. The GSA also conducts an \nannual review of advisory committees that no longer serve a useful \npurpose. Through this review, GSA has identified 61 advisory committees \nmandated by law that should be eliminated. The termination of these \ncommittees would save $8.4 million this year.\n  The time has come for Congress to step up and do its part to achieve \nfurther cuts in current advisory committees. Unless Congress acts, the \ncost of advisory committees will continue to increase, as new \ncommittees are created and old, useless committees continue with no \nlegitimate purpose.\n  Today, joined by a bipartisan group of my colleagues on the Committee \non Governmental Affairs, I am introducing the Advisory Committee \nTermination and Streamlining Act of 1998. I am pleased to be joined by \nthe ranking member of the Committee, Senator Glenn, who has a long \nhistory of involvement with the FACA; Senator Cochran; Senator Levin, \nwho formerly chaired the Subcommittee with oversight responsibility for \nthe FACA; Senator Brownback, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight \nof Government Management and Restructuring; and Senator Lieberman, the \nranking member on the Government Management and Restructuring \nSubcommittee. This bill has been developed with the assistance of the \nAdministration, which proposed many of its provisions.\n  Let me briefly lay out what this legislation would accomplish. The \nfocus of the legislation is to force the reappraisal of the need for \nall current advisory committees. To achieve this goal, the bill would \nterminate all advisory committees within three years of the bill's \nenactment. This three-year window applies to all advisory committees, \nwhether established by congressional or presidential mandate, \ncongressional authorization, or agency decision. Any advisory committee \nestablished by presidential order or agency decision will be subject to \ncontinuation if an affirmative decision is made that the committee's \ncontinuation is warranted. Similarly, three years will allow Congress \nenough time to review\n\n[[Page S7192]]\n\nthe advisory committees it has mandated, determine which of these \ncontinue to serve useful functions, and reauthorize such committees. \nThis provision will clear away many advisory committees that continue \nto exist from inertia but no longer serve a useful function.\n  The bill excludes two categories of advisory committees. Advisory \ncommittees that provide peer review of grant applications, such as \nthose used by the National Institutes of Health, will continue, whether \nor not they are reauthorized, as the termination provision does not \napply to them. The second category exempt from the termination \nprovision covers those committees that provide advice relating to the \nacademic certification of federal institutions. This category includes \nthe Boards of Visitors of the service academies. Finally, the bill \nexempts from the termination provision all advisory committees that \n``address critical needs relating to health, safety, national security, \nor other concerns as the President may certify.'' This exemption allows \nsufficient flexibility to preserve those advisory committees that \ncontinue to serve useful purposes in areas deemed important by the \nPresident.\n  The other provisions of the bill can be quickly summarized. First, \nthe bill allows the GSA to issue binding regulations and not just \nadministrative guidelines. This change, proposed by the Administration, \nis needed to promote consistent, uniform application of the FACA's \nrequirements throughout the executive branch. Second, the bill changes \nthe date on which the Administration's annual report on advisory \ncommittees must be submitted to Congress from December 31 to March 15. \nThe GSA has consistently failed to meet the December 31 deadline, due \nlargely to its inability to collect the necessary information from \nother agencies in a timely manner. This change will provide a more \nrealistic date for submission of the report, and the GSA has assured us \nthat it will be able to meet the new March 15 deadline. Finally, the \nbill will allow the GSA to promulgate regulations authorizing notice of \nadvisory committee meetings through means other than publication in the \nFederal Register. Many who have an interest in the work of specific \nadvisory committees do not read the Federal Register, and the \nAdministration is interested in experimenting with providing notice of \nmeetings through the Internet or other electronic formats in order to \ndetermine whether other forms of notice are more effective at reaching \nlarge numbers of interested persons.\n  Mr. President, this bill would streamline the government and save us \nmoney. It will have the additional benefit of requiring Congress and \nthe Administration to work jointly to revisit the charters of all \nadvisory committees and evaluate the need for their continuation. I \nthank the Administration for working with us to develop this bill and \nmy cosponsors for working towards a consensus on this matter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a copy of a June 22, 1998 \narticle from the Gannett News Service entitled ``Committees Dwindle--\nbut Costs Don't,'' which details some of these facts, be inserted in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2228\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Both the number of committee members \n     on the remaining panels and their cost to taxpayers have \n     soared to all-time highs.\n       In 1993, according to the General Accounting Office, 28,317 \n     people served on advisory committees. By 1997, the number of \n     committee members had jumped to 36,586, although the number \n     of committees was way down.\n       Costs were up, too: $178 million last year, compared to \n     $143.9 million in 1993. Even using constant 1988 dollars, the \n     cost to operate advisory committees has risen in the past \n     decade from $93 million in 1988 to about $136 million in \n     1997, GAO said.\n       James L. Dean, director of the Committee Management \n     Secretariat at the General Services Administration, \n     attributes the bulk of the increase in committee members to \n     the National Institutes of Health's increasingly prevalent \n     practice of rapidly rotating memberships on some of its peer \n     review committees.\n       NIH spokeswoman Laura Vazquez confirmed that \n     ``memberships'' on NIH's 141 committees appear to have \n     tripled in recent years as NIH pulled more experts onto its \n     committees for temporary, often one-meeting tenures. In 1997, \n     for example, NIH had 8,366 such short-term participants and \n     4,140 longer-term committee members.\n       But the cost of the committees to taxpayers is not higher \n     simply because there are more members. The cost of caring for \n     each committee member has risen, too: From $90,816 per member \n     in 1988 to $184,868 in 1997, GAO said. Even in constant 1988 \n     dollars, per-member expenses rose from $90,816 to $140,870 in \n     that period.\n       Most of that money--$75.5 million last year--pays for \n     federal staff support for the committees, Dean said. Most \n     panelists are not paid for their time; only $10.4 million \n     went last year to compensate non-federal committee members, \n     said Dean, whose office had eight employees and a $645,000 \n     budget in 1997 (up from $220,000 in 1988).\n       None of this, however, shows up in the annual message the \n     president is required to send to Congress on the status of \n     federal advisory committees.\n       Clinton's last message, sent in September, bragged about \n     how the number of committees has dropped during his tenure \n     and that $2.5 million was saved during the 1996 budget year \n     by cutting out additional panels. There wasn't a mention of \n     how much overall costs and overall membership had \n     risen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Hatch, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 2230. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe work opportunity tax credit for 3 additional years; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             the work opportunity tax credit extension act\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators \nBaucus, Hatch, D'Amato, Conrad, Mikulski, Jeffords and Rockefeller. I \nam introducing legislation that extends the\n\n[[Page S7193]]\n\ncurrent Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) program for three years. The \nprogram expires at the end of this month. While it is clear that the \nprogram will not be extended before we leave for the Fourth of July \nrecess, I hope that Congress will act quickly upon its return to make \nsure that this very important program is reinstated and that no gap in \nthe availability of the credit is created.\n  The WOTC program is a public-private partnership which encourages \nbusinesses to hire individuals on public assistance or who otherwise \nhave life situations that make them difficult to employ. Employers who \nhire these individuals receive an income tax credit of as much as forty \npercent of the first $6,000 in wages they pay.\n  The WOTC program was established in 1996 as a replacement for the \nTargeted Jobs Tax Credit (TJTC). Last year, as part of the Taxpayer \nRelief Act Congress affirmed its strong support for this program by \nextending it for nine months along with the other so-called ``expiring \nprovisions.'' Unfortunately, the tax credit will expire at the end of \nthis month before Congress will have an opportunity to extend it.\n  The legislation we are introducing today extends the program for \nthree years. This extension is vital to the continued success of the \nWOTC program. In speaking with employers who utilize the program, their \nbiggest concern is the on again, off again nature of the credit. \nParticipation in the program requires significant resources and time \ncommitments on the part of the employer. The uncertainty surrounding \nthe continuation of this program makes it very difficult for employers \nto make that commitment. The loss of program certainty reduces the \nincentive to hire those currently on public assistance. During previous \nbreaks employers have scaled back their programs, and some have even \nabandoned the program altogether.\n  Individuals hired under the WOTC program often require substantial \ntime and effort on the part of an employer. In many instances these \nindividuals lack even the most basic skills necessary to hold a job. \nWithout the WOTC program there would be a strong disincentive for \nemployers to make any effort to hire these individuals. The tax credit \nlevels the playing field and gives these individuals an opportunity to \nmove off the welfare rolls and take control of their futures. Thus far, \nnearly 300,000 people--mostly single mothers--have been hired under \nthis program.\n  Those eligible for the WOTC are: members of families receiving AFDC \nbenefits; qualified veterans who are members of families receiving food \nstamp benefits; 18-24 years olds who are members of families receiving \nfood stamp benefits; 18-24 year olds who live in an empowerment zone or \nenterprise community; summer youth (16-17 year olds) who live in an \nempowerment zone or enterprise community who are hired during the \nsummer months; SSI recipients; economically disadvantaged ex-felons; \nand individuals with physical or mental disabilities who have been \nreferred to employers after or while receiving rehabilitative services \nunder the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n  As I mentioned earlier, an employer will receive an income tax credit \nof forty percent of the first $6,000 in wages paid to an employee who \nis a member of one of these groups. Therefore, the maximum credit \navailable is $2,400. The only exception is summer youth employees where \nthe maximum amount of wages used to calculate the credit is $3,000. An \nemployer can only receive this maximum credit, however, if the employee \nis employed for at least 400 hours. While that may sound like a short \nperiod of time, for many of these individuals, that represent a \nsignificant period of employment, perhaps longer than any job they've \never held.\n  A smaller credit equal to 25% of the first $6,000 of wages is \navailable to an employer in those instances where the employee works \nless than 400 hours. No credit is available for any employee who works \nless than 120 hours.\n  The Work Opportunity Tax Credit is an important component of our \nefforts to make welfare reform work over the long term. It provides \ntransitional assistance to employers who are willing to hire and take \nthe time to train individuals before they become long-term welfare \nrecipients and young people at high risk of going on public assistance \nprograms.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting a long-term extension \nof the Work Opportunity Tax Credit.\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my \ncolleague Senator John Chafee in introducing legislation to extend the \nWork Opportunities Tax Credit (WOTC). This program was created after \nextensive consultations between the Congress and the Administration as \na replacement for the Targeted Jobs Tax Credit. It was improved in the \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997 with changes designed to make the program \nmore accessible to employers who identify, hire and train welfare \nrecipients and equip them with basic job skills necessary for long-term \nemployment.\n  As the June 30, 1998 expiration date for the WOTC program approaches, \nwe are introducing this bill as a statement of Congressional commitment \nto the future continuation of the credit. WOTC encourages employers to \nparticipate in the national goal of moving millions from welfare to \nwork through a hiring tax incentive that helps to offset the costs of \nrecruiting, hiring and training those with few basic job skills.\n  Congress enacted welfare reform in 1996. Since that time, employers \nhave utilized WOTC to hire nearly one in four of those coming off \npublic assistance. The time limits that were implemented through the \nwelfare reform legislation are now reaching many of the more difficult \nwelfare cases, those with the fewest job skills that have had the most \ndifficulty finding jobs. As these welfare recipients search for jobs, \nit is extremely important to continue providing an incentive which will \nhelp defray the extra costs experienced by companies hiring these \nworkers.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will extend WOTC for three \nyears. The current practice of extending the credit on a year-to-year, \nor partial-year, basis makes it extremely difficult for employers to \nuse the credit. Small businesses in particular require some time to set \nup and use the program. All employers need some level of certainty for \ntax planning, which is not available when the credit is extended on a \nshort-term basis. A multi-year extension will provide that certainty, \nand will show that Congress is serious about making the program work.\n  I thank Senators Conrad, D'Amato, Hatch, Jeffords, Mikulski and \nRockefeller for joining Senator Chafee and myself as original \ncosponsors of this bill. I look forward to working with all of my \ncolleagues to enact a multi-year extension of the Work Opportunities \nTax Credit before the end of this legislative session.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Mack):\n  S. 2231.

This bill will provide much-\nneeded tax relief from complex and inconsistent tax laws that burden \nour American-owned companies which are attempting to compete in the \nworld marketplace.\n  Our foreign tax code is in desperate need of reform and \nsimplification. The rules in this arena are way too complex and, often, \ntheir results are perverse.\n  Mr. President, the economy of this country has entered into an \nenvironment like no other in our history. The American economy has \nexperienced significant growth and prosperity. That success, however, \nis becoming more and more intertwined with the success of our \nbusinesses in the global marketplace. As the economic boundaries from \ncountry to country merge closer together, as technology blurs \ntraditional geographical boundaries, and as competition continues to \nincrease from previously lesser-developed nations, it is imperative \nthat American-owned businesses be able to compete effectively.\n  It seems to me that any rule, regulation, requirement, or tax that we \ncan alleviate to enhance competitiveness will insure to the benefit of \nAmerican companies, their employees, and shareholders.\n\n[[Page S7194]]\n\n  There are many barriers that the U.S. economy must overcome in order \nto remain competitive that Congress cannot hurdle by itself. All around \nthe world, we have international trade negotiators working hard to \nremove the barriers to foreign markets that discourage and hamper U.S. \ntrade. This is very important to the future economic growth of the U.S. \neconomy. However, this effort has largely ignored the largest source of \nartificial and unnecessary trade barriers experienced by U.S. companies \noperating abroad--the complexities and inconsistencies contained in our \nown tax code.\n  We cannot continue the status quo--we must work to remove the \nbarriers in our own back yard as diligently as we attack those imposed \nby other countries. The failure to do so will even jeopardize our own \ndomestic economy as American companies are lured to other countries \nwith simple, more favorable tax treatment.\n  The business world is changing at an increasingly rapid pace. Tax \nlaws have failed to keep pace with the rapid changes in the world \ntechnology and economy. We enacted some foreign tax simplification in \nlast year's Taxpayer Relief Act, but these changes are not enough. Too \nmany of the international provisions in the Internal Revenue Code have \nnot been substantially debated and revised in over a decade. Since that \ntime, existing international markets have changed significantly and we \nhave seen new markets created. The U.S. tax code needs to adapt to the \nchanging times as well. The continued use of a confusing and archaic \ntax code only results in a mismatch with commercial reality.\n  If we close American companies out of the international arena due to \ncomplex and burdensome tax rules on exports and foreign production, \nthen we are denying them the ability to compete and dooming the, and \nourselves, to anemic economic growth and all its adverse subsidiary \neffects.\n  The bill we are introducing today is not a comprehensive solution, \nneither is it a set of bold new initiatives. Instead, this bill \ncontains a set of important intermediate steps which will take us a \nlong way toward simplifying the rules and making some sense of the \ninternational tax regime. The bill contains provisions to simplify and \nupdate the tax treatment of controlled foreign corporations, fix some \nof the rules relating to the foreign tax credit, and make other changes \nto international tax law.\n  Some of these changes are in areas that are in dire need of repair, \nand others are changes that take into consideration the changes we have \nseen in international business practices and environments during the \nlast decade. The provisions in this bill are necessary to facilitate \nthe American economy's ability to remain the driving economic force in \nthe world of the future.\n  One example of the need for updating our laws to more adequately \nrepresent rapid changes that have occurred in the last few years is the \nfinancial service industry. This industry has seen technological and \nglobal changes that have changed the very nature of the way these \ncorporations do business both here and abroad. This bill contains \nseveral provisions to help adapt the foreign tax regime to keep up with \nthese changes.\n  In particular, I want to highlight the provision regarding a Subpart \nF Exception for active financial services income. This provision is \nbased in large part on the one-year rule embodied in H.R. 2513, the \nHouse-passed bill that resulted from lengthy negotiations between the \nTreasury Department and the financial services industry. The bill's \nprovisions are not intended to replace H.R. 2513. Rather, this bill \ngoes further and provides additional options to facilitate discussion \nregarding the parameters of a permanent rule that would effectively \nlevel the playing field with respect to our foreign competition. This \ndiscussion is even more important in view of the Supreme Court's ruling \non the line-item veto this morning.\n  The bill also allows deferral for cross-border income received by \ncontrolled foreign corporations engaged in the active conduct of a \nbanking, financing, or similar business under narrowly defined \ncircumstances. This provision is designed to preclude opportunities for \nexcessive ``mobility'' of income. The first safeguard is the \nrequirement that income eligible for deferral must be derived from a \ntransaction with a ``customer.'' The definition of a customer would not \npermit a related-party transaction to qualify if one of the principal \npurposes for such transaction was to satisfy the underlying provision. \nSecond, the requirement that employees meet a ``material \nparticipation'' test will reinforce the active nature of the covered \nactivities. Thus, corporations holding passive investments would be \nprecluded from relying on the rule.\n\n  There are many areas of the international tax regime not covered by \nthis bill. This legislation represents a pragmatic collection of \nproposals, not an exhaustive one. One area I think needs to be explored \nis the foreign tax rules as they apply to foreign corporations with \nU.S. operations and subsidiaries. These companies are helping the U.S. \neconomy grow. They buy and sell U.S. products, and they employ U.S. \nworkers. We need to examine the international tax law and any barriers \nit creates for these companies. We must ensure that the U.S. tax law is \nwritten and enforced fairly for all companies operating in the U.S. I \nhope that we can include provisions in this area in future versions of \nthis legislation.\n  This bill is not the end of the international tax debate. if we were \nto pass every provision it contains, we would still not have a simple \ntax code. We would need to make more reforms yet. We cannot limit this \ndebate to only the intermediate changes such as those in this bill. We \nmust not lose sight of the long term. I intend to continue this debate \nwith an eye to the future and propel the discussion to broader, more \nsweeping areas in need of reform such as interest allocation, the \ninternational tax treatment of partnerships, issues raised by the \nEuropean Union, and a broader debate of Subpart F itself. I believe \nthat we must address these concerns in the next few years if we are to \nput U.S. corporations and the U.S. economy in a position to maintain \neconomic position in the global economy of tomorrow.\n  This bill is important to the future of every American citizen. \nWithout these changes, American businesses will see their ability to \ncompete diminished, and the U.S. will have an uphill battle to remain \nthe preeminent economic force in a changing world. This credible \npackage of international tax reforms will help to keep our businesses \nand our economy competitive and a driving force in the world economic \npicture. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very pleased today to join \nwith my colleague, Senator Hatch, to introduce another in our series of \ninternational simplification bills. The International Simplification \nfor American Competitiveness Act of 1998 will provide much-needed \nrelief to American-owned companies that are struggling to compete in \nthe world marketplace by simplifying our overly complicated \ninternational tax rules.\n  America's economy, and economies of our individual States, are \nincreasingly interlinked with the success of our businesses in the \ninternational economy. As the economies of previously less-developed \ncountries around the world begin to expand, and the economic boundaries \nbetween our countries become more blurred, it is increasingly important \nfor our businesses to be able to operate abroad from their most \ncompetitive position. Restraining American companies through redundant \nand unnecessary complexity in our own tax code dampens their ability to \ncompete for foreign business. This only hurts our own economy.\n  I have worked through the Trade Subcommittee to lower barriers to \nforeign markets and encourage agreements to keep trade free and fair. I \nhave sought to open foreign markets for many Montana products, from \nbeef to wheat, because of the positive impact on Montana's economy, and \non the economy of our country. While we have made much progress on the \ntrade front in opening barriers, our tax code remains mired in \nantiquated provisions that have not kept pace with the rapidly \nexpanding global economic frontier. We must simplify our code, remove \nduplicative or outmoded provisions, and provide incentives for trade \nwhenever possible, if we are to ensure continued U.S. success in the \nworld\n\n[[Page S7195]]\n\neconomy. If we miss this opportunity, we risk the erosion of U.S. \ninternational competitiveness as countries with simple, favorable tax \ntreatment of businesses lure away our foreign customers.\n  There is a strong correlation between American corporate \ncompetitiveness overseas and the ability of those companies to continue \nproviding jobs at home. According to a report prepared by the \naccounting firm of Price Waterhouse, United States exports in 1996 \ntotaled over $600 billion and supported almost 7 million direct and \nindirect jobs. Exports alone account for over 11% of our Gross Domestic \nProduct, and when combined with imports, total about 17% of GDP. Even \nin Montana, a state which is struggling to expand its foreign markets, \nexports totaled almost one-half billion dollars and supported 58,000 \njobs in 1996.\n  This bill does not by any means cure all of the problems in the \ninternational tax arena. But it is a good starting point which \nsimplifies existing law, reduces the cost of compliance, and begins to \nrationalize the rules that need to be drafted with the competitiveness \nof U.S. businesses in mind. There are a lot of important international \nissues that this bill does not deal with. The problems associated with \nthe interest allocation rules, for example. But Senator Hatch and I \nfeel that these are larger issues that need more time to resolve, so \nthey have not been included in this bill. I look forward to working \nwith him, the Treasury Department and industry groups in an effort to \nfind solutions to these bigger-picture issues over the next months.\n  We live in a global economy. And we must help make American companies \ncompetitive in this economy, while fairly taxing their profits, if we \nare to keep this unprecedented period of economic expansion going. The \n``International Tax Simplification for American Competitiveness Act of \n1998'' is a major step in that direction, and I look forward to working \nwith Senator Hatch and my other colleagues on the Finance Committee to \nhave its provisions enacted into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUMPERS (for himself and Mr. HUTCHINSON):\n  S. 2232. A bill to establish the Little Rock Central High School \nNational Historic Site in the State of Arkansas, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         Little Rock Central High School National Historic Site\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto designate Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, as a \nNational Historic Site. Central High School is perhaps the most well-\nknown school in the nation, as a result of the high profile and pivotal \nrole it played in the desegregation of public schools in America. I am \npleased to be joined by Senator Hutchinson in sponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its landmark decision, Brown \nversus Board of Education, which held that the segregation of public \nschools was unconstitutional. The following year, in its Brown II \ndecision, the Court ruled that integration of the public schools was \nthe responsibility of local school districts, to be carried out ``with \nall deliberate speed.'' This set the stage for the eventual \nconfrontation in Little Rock.\n  Prior to the Brown decision, Central High was attended only by white \nstudents. Following the Court's decision, the Little Rock School Board \ninitially made plans to comply with the decision in phases to be \ncarried out over six years. However, by the time the district began to \nimplement the decision in the fall of 1957, the political controversy \nhad increased to the extent that only 9 black students decided to \nenroll at Central High, with approximately 1,900 white students. Those \nnine students later became known as the ``Little Rock Nine,'' and are \nan inspiration to America.\n  Mr. President, earlier this Congress, Senator Mosely-Braun and I \nintroduced legislation, S. 1283, to award the Congressional Gold Medal \nto those nine extraordinary individuals--Jean Brown Trickey, Carlotta \nWalls LaNier, Melba Patillo Beals, Terrance Roberts, Gloria Ray \nKarlmark, Thelma Mothershed Wair, Ernest Green, Elizabeth Eckford, and \nJefferson Thomas. It is my strong desire that both S. 1283 and this \nlegislation will be enacted into law in the remaining months of this \nCongress. These nine sons and daughters of Little Rock are proud \nsymbols of the progress we have made and a solemn reminder of the \nprogress we have yet to make.\n  By the time the Little Rock Nine attempted to enter Central High in \nSeptember of 1957, the issue of desegregation had polarized not only \nLittle Rock, but the entire nation. The Governor of Arkansas, Orville \nFaubus, ordered the Arkansas National Guard to prevent the \ndesegregation of Central High. Following several days of unrest, a \nFederal District Court in Little Rock issued an order preventing the \nNational Guard from further obstructing desegregation efforts in Little \nRock. Amid this period of intense feelings and acrimony, President \nEisenhower issued an Executive Order which federalized the National \nGuard and deployed Federal troops to enforce the district court's \norder. Although several events of the following days were tense and \noften ugly, the eventual peaceful resolution that followed helped to \nensure the successful implementation of the Brown decision, not only in \nLittle Rock, but throughout the South.\n  Last fall, on the 40th anniversary of the 1957 events, the attention \nof the nation was once again focused on Central High, and the Little \nRock Nine once again entered through the school's main doors. However, \nthis time those doors were held open by the President of the United \nStates and the Governor of Arkansas.\n  Establishment of the Little Rock Central High School National \nHistoric Site will, for the first time, provide the National Park \nService with the ability to interpret for all Americans the complete \nhistory of the desegregation of our public schools, certainly one of \nthe most important social events in the history of our country. Let me \nhasten to add, Mr. President, that Central High will continue to be a \nfunctioning high school, managed by the Little Rock School District. \nDesignation of the school as a National Historic Site will also \ncomplement the very successful interpretive activities already \nundertaken by the Central High Museum and Visitor Center.\n  There is no question as to the national significance of Central High \nSchool. The school is included on the National Register of Historic \nPlaces, and was designated in 1982 as a National Historic Landmark by \nthe Secretary of the Interior.\n  There is strong support for this bill, both in Little Rock and with \nthe entire Arkansas Congressional delegation. The City of Little Rock, \nthe Little Rock School District, Central High Museum, Inc., area \nresidents, and many other organizations and individuals in Little Rock \nhave expressed support for this proposal. It is my hope to have a \nhearing scheduled for this bill in the very near future, with passage \nby the Senate shortly thereafter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2232\n\n       Be it enacted in the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives in the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision of Brown v. Board \n     of Education, which mandated an end to the segregation of \n     public schools, was one of the most significant Court \n     decisions in the history of the United States;\n       (2) the admission of nine African-American students, known \n     as the ``Little Rock Nine'', to Little Rock's Central High \n     School as a result of the Brown decision, was the most \n     prominent national example of the implementation of the Brown \n     decision, and served as a catalyst for the integration of \n     other, previously segregated public schools in the United \n     States;\n       (3) 1997 marked the 70th anniversary of the construction of \n     Central High School, which has been named by the American \n     Institute of Architects as ``the most beautiful high school \n     building in America'';\n       (4) Central High School was included on the National \n     Register of Historic Places in 1977 and designated by the \n     Secretary of the Interior as a National Historic Landmark in \n     1982 in recognition of its national significance in the \n     development of the Civil Rights movement in the United \n     States; and\n       (5) the designation of Little Rock Central High School as a \n     unit of the National Park System will recognize the \n     significant role the school played in the desegregation of \n     public schools in the South and will interpret for future \n     generations the events associated with early desegregation of \n     southern schools.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to preserve, \n     protect, and interpret for the benefit, education, and \n     inspiration of present and\n\n[[Page S7196]]\n\n     future generations, Central High School in Little Rock, \n     Arkansas, and its role in the integration of public schools \n     and the development of the Civil Rights movement in the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 2.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 2233. A bill to amend section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to extend the placed in service date for biomass and coal \nfacilities; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               Biomass and Coal Facilities Extension Act\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with my friend \nfrom Utah, Senator Hatch, in the introduction of the Biomass and Coal \nFacilities Extension Act. This legislation would extend by eight months \nthe placed-in-service date under section 29 of the Internal Revenue \nCode.\n  This change is necessary in order to alleviate the hardship suffered \nby taxpayers who relied on action Congress took almost two years ago, \nand made substantial commitments of resources to develop alternative \nfuel technology projects. These commitments were made in good faith \npursuant to the 1996 Small Business Protection Act, in which Congress \namended section 29 for synthetic coal and biomass by extending the \n``binding contract'' provision for 12 months to December 31, 1996 and \nextending the ``placed-in-service'' provision for 18 months to June 30, \n1998.\n  That should have settled the matter. However, when the \nAdministration's fiscal year 1998 budget was submitted in February \n1997, it contained a proposal to shorten by a full year the placed-in-\nservice date for facilities producing gas from biomass and synthetic \nfuel from coal. The Administration was concerned about what it \ncharacterized as rapid growth in the section 29 credit. Congress \nconsidered that argument and concluded that any concern about the \ngrowth in the credit had been dealt with adequately in the 1996 Act.\n  In the tax legislative arena, even a mere proposal can have \nconsequences, as the Administration's proposal to shorten the placed-\nin-service date illustrates. The Joint Committee on Taxation's analysis \nof the proposal, made in March 1997, warned Congress about just such a \nconsequence as it noted that ``[b]ecause the binding contract date has \nalready passed * * * the proposal might place an unfair financial \nburden on those taxpayers who are bound to contracts entered into prior \nto the Administration's announcement.''\n  Mr. President, that is exactly what happened--taxpayers in that \nsituation lost their sources of financing because financial \ninstitutions had to treat the Administration proposal as a real \npossibility. Because the tax credit plays a significant role in the \noverall financial situation that lenders have to consider, its \npotential loss made securing necessary financing impossible for \ntaxpayers who were proceeding under binding contracts made in good \nfaith reliance on the Small Business Protection Act of 1996.\n  The bill we offer today would simply restore some of the lost time \nthat taxpayers endured as a result of the unintended consequences \nstemming from Congressional consideration of the Administration's 1997 \nbudget proposal. It would extend the placed-in-service date from June \n30, 1998 to a date eight months from the date of the bill's enactment.\n  Taxpayers took Congress at its word in 1996 when it said that the \ndevelopment of environmentally friendly fuels from domestic biomass and \ncoal resources was worth supporting. Their subsequent investment of \nlarge amounts of time, effort, and money should be allowed to fulfill \nits objectives rather than simply be forfeited as a result of \ncircumstances over which these taxpayers had no control.\n  This is a modest proposal; it would not disturb the ``binding \ncontract'' date of the 1996 Act. Thus, no new projects would qualify \nbecause of its enactment. It seeks only to allow taxpayers who began \nprojects under the 1996 Act to proceed in an orderly manner--an option \nthat was effectively denied them as a result of the uncertainty created \nduring consideration of the fiscal year 1998 budget.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2233\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Biomass and Coal Facilities \n     Extension Act''.\n\n[[Page S7197]]\n\n     SEC. 2 EXTENSION OF PLACED IN SERVICE DATE FOR BIOMASS AND \n                   COAL FACILITIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 29(g)(1)(A) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to extension for certain \n     facilities) is amended by striking ``July 1, 1998'' and \n     inserting ``the date which is 8 months after the date of the \n     enactment of the Biomass and Coal Facilities Extension Act''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today with my colleague, Senator \nConrad, I introduce the Biomass and Coal Facilities Extension Act. This \nlegislation would extend the ``placed in service'' date under section \n29 for facilities that produce alternative fuels by 8 months.\n  Section 29 was originally created to encourage the development of \nalternative fuels to reduce our dependence on imports and to reduce the \nenvironmental impacts of certain fuels. With the enormous reserves of \nlow rank coals and lignite in the United States and around the world, \nand with the potential for use of biomass and other alternatives, it is \nparticularly important to the American economy and the world's \nenvironment that new, more environmentally friendly fuels are brought \nto market here and in developing nations.\n  Bringing new technologies to market is financially risky. In \nparticular, finding investors to take a new technology from a \nlaboratory table to the market is difficult because working the bugs \nout of a first-of-a-kind, full-sized plant is a costly undertaking. \nIncentives to bring new, clean energy technologies to the market in the \nU.S. are a worthwhile use of the code.\n  The 1996 Small Business Protection Act provided sufficient incentives \nto make the development of alternative fuels a viable pursuit. In \nparticular, it extended the section 29 ``placed in service'' date for \nfacilities designed to produce energy from biomass or processed coals \nto July 1, 1998, provided that those facilities were constructed \npursuant to a binding contract entered into before January 1, 1997.\n  However, the Administration's budget proposal, released in February \n1997, effectively nullified the extension granted by Congress in the \n1996 Small Business Protection Act. The Administration proposed that \nthe placed in service date be moved up one year, to July 1, 1997, \nwhich, for many of these projects, was an impossible deadline to meet.\n  Without the assurance of the section 29 tax credit, financing for \nthese projects dried up, stranding taxpayers in contracts, some of \nwhich contained significant liquidated damages clauses, already entered \ninto in reliance on the Small Business Protection Act of 1996. As a \nresult of the Administration's proposal, taxpayers essentially lost 8 \nmonths of the extension given them in 1996.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us would give these lost months back \nto companies with contracts signed by January 1, 1997. This bill does \nnot extend the contract deadline, allow more projects to be initiated, \nor change the 2008 deadline for receiving the section 29 tax credit. \nThis bill simply restores the time taxpayers lost in their efforts to \ndevelop environmentally friendly fuels under section 29.\n  Bringing new alternative fuel technologies to the market is an \nimportant part of our commitment to a cleaner environment and a secure \neconomy. We reflected that commitment in our efforts to mitigate some \nof the financial risk involved in developing this much needed \ntechnology in the Small Business Protection Act of 1996. This bill \nmaintains that commitment. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 2235. A bill to amend part Q of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \nStreets Act of 1968 to encourage the use of school resource officers; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n       THE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS PARTNERSHIP GRANT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the School Resource \nOfficers Partnership Grant Act of 1998, a bill which will be an \nimportant step in our efforts to end crime in our nation's schools. \nThis bill will help build thousands of deep, meaningful and lasting \npartnerships between America's local school systems, school children, \nand local law enforcement agencies. I am joined in introducing this \nlegislation by my friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator Jim \nJeffords, as an original cosponsor.\n  The need for this bill is clear. Violence in schools is both serious \nand deadly. Violence is disrupting our children's opportunity and \nability to learn. No child anywhere in America should have to go to \nschool with fear on their mind, rather than learning. The recent \nschool-related shootings stand as stark and horrific examples of just \nhow urgent the situation has become. These recent school shootings have \noccurred in suburbs, small towns, and major metropolitan areas all \nacross our nation. They have shattered the myth that school violence is \na problem solely confined to the inner cities. Events now clearly show \nthat the potential for serious and deadly school violence is \neverywhere. Something must be done to ensure that our schools provide a \nsafe place for our children to learn and grow.\n  Under this bill, schools in partnerships with local law enforcement \nagencies would be eligible to receive federal funding to hire ``School \nResource Officers'' (SROs). A SRO would be a career law enforcement \nofficer, with sworn authority, deployed in community oriented policing, \nand assigned by the employing police department or agency to work in \ncollaboration with schools and community-based organizations. The SROs \nwould be able to assist in several primary activities. First, SROs \nwould address crime and disorder problems with a special focus on \ngangs, drug-related activities, and other crimes occurring in or around \nour schools. Second, SROs would develop or expand crime prevention \nefforts in cooperation with students. Third, SROs would help educate \npotential school-age victims in crime prevention and personal safety \nawareness. Fourth, SROs would develop or expand community justice \ninitiatives. Fifth, and clearly increasingly more important in light of \nthe recent school shootings, is that the SROs would train students in \nconflict resolution and teach students how to resolve their differences \nwithout feeling the need to resort to violence. Where childhood \nschoolyard hard feelings used to occasionally result in a scuffle, we \nnow live in a time where they are resolved with firearms and lead to \nserious wounds and even death. This simply must end. Sixth, SROs would \nhelp identify changes in the school environment, like new graffiti or \nother indications of gang activity, that provide vital indicators. And \nfinally, SROs would assist with the development of anti-crime, school \npolicy and procedural changes.\n  According to the National School Safety Center, 25 students have been \nkilled in U.S. schools since January 1, 1998. This is the same number \nof students that were killed for the full 1996 school year, but in half \nthe time. At this rate, we are on track to a doubling of the schoolyard \nmurder rate in just two short years.\n  The current school-based partnership grant program, which is \nadministered by the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented \nPolicing Services (COPS), is not defined by statute, nor is the \ndescription of the qualifications and responsibilities of SROs. This \nlegislation would ensure that SROs are career law enforcement officers, \ndeployed in community-oriented policing assignments and directed by \ntheir agencies to work in collaboration with schools and other \ncommunity-based organizations to address crime problems and assist \nschool authorities in educating students about crime and violence \nprevention.\n  This legislation complements the existing school-based partnership \nresearch grant program administered by the COPS office. The existing \ndemonstration program provides funds to specific, and relatively small \nscale, youth crime prevention programs. My legislation would build on \nthis solid foundation, and allow the COPS program resources to be freed \nup for widespread and comprehensive partnerships between our nation's \nschools and law enforcement agencies, with the SROs providing the vital \nlink between the two.\n  In addition, my bill is a companion to H.R. 4009, which our colleague \nin the House of Representatives, Congressman\n\n[[Page S7198]]\n\nJim Maloney of Connecticut, introduced on June 5, 1998. This bill has \nreceived the endorsement of a number of education and law enforcement \ngroups including the National Education Association, the International \nBrotherhood of Police, the Fraternal Order of Police. I believe that \nthis powerful combination of endorsements clearly reflects the strength \nof, and compelling need for, this legislation.\n  On June 23rd , Senator Judd Gregg, Chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and the \nJudiciary, unveiled a $210 million Safe Schools Initiative. Largely \nthanks to Senator Gregg, the funding needed to combat school violence \nis on track to be made available in a few short months, on October 1st, \n1998, the start of Fiscal Year 1999.\n  Together, these initiatives will target important funding and \nresources to where it is most urgently needed, in our nation's schools. \nI urge my colleagues to support passage of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2235\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS.\n\n       Part Q of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \n     Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796dd et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) in section 1701(d)--\n       (A) by redesignating paragraphs (8) through (10) as \n     paragraphs (9) through (11), respectively; and\n       (B) by inserting after paragraph (7) the following:\n       ``(8) establish school-based partnerships between local law \n     enforcement agencies and local school systems by using school \n     resource officers who operate in and around elementary and \n     secondary schools to combat school-related crime and disorder \n     problems, gangs, and drug activities;''; and\n       (2) in section 1709--\n       (A) by redesignating the first 3 undesignated paragraphs as \n     paragraphs (1) through (3), respectively; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) `school resource officer' means a career law \n     enforcement officer, with sworn authority, deployed in \n     community-oriented policing, and assigned by the employing \n     police department or agency to work in collaboration with \n     schools and community-based organizations--\n       ``(A) to address crime and disorder problems, gangs, and \n     drug activities affecting or occurring in or around an \n     elementary or secondary school;\n       ``(B) to develop or expand crime prevention efforts for \n     students;\n       ``(C) to educate likely school-age victims in crime \n     prevention and safety;\n       ``(D) to develop or expand community justice initiatives \n     for students;\n       ``(E) to train students in conflict resolution, restorative \n     justice, and crime awareness;\n       ``(F) to assist in the identification of physical changes \n     in the environment that may reduce crime in or around the \n     school; and\n       ``(G) to assist in developing school policy that addresses \n     crime and to recommend procedural changes.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Helms, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \n        Brownback, Mr. Shelby, and Mr. McCain):\n  S.J. Res. 54. A joint resolution finding the Government of Iraq in \nunacceptable and material breach of its international obligations; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n             iraqi violations of international obligations\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today S.J. Res. 54 \nconcerning Iraq's violations of the cease-fire agreement that ended \nOperation Desert Storm in 1991.\n  Yesterday, the Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission \n(UNSCOM) presented clear and compelling evidence to the U.N. Security \nCouncil that Iraq has lied about a critical aspect of its weapons of \nmass destruction programs.\n  UNSCOM has uncovered proof that Iraq has turned the deadly nerve \nagent known as VX into missile warheads. Iraq still denies the truth \ntoday, but no one should be fooled. The proof is certain.\n  And no one should be surprised. Iraq has consistently lied to UNSCOM \nfor 8 years. It denied having any biological weapons. Iraq concealed \nthe number of missiles it possessed. Iraq has refused to account for \nits chemical weapons programs. Iraq has refused to provide access to \nsites or documents necessary for UNSCOM to complete its work.\n  In the past, under both this administration and the previous \nadministration, Iraq's violations led to action on the part of the U.S. \nIraq has been found to be in material breach on many occasions which \nare spelled out in this resolution. Military action has been threatened \nand even employed to force compliance.\n  But now there is a different tune from the Clinton Administration. \nNow the Clinton Administration is on the defensive. Just keeping U.N. \nsanctions on seems to be enough--even though a U.S. veto would keep \nsanctions in place regardless of Russian or French pressure. I cannot \nunderstand why the Administration has been so passive in the face of \nthe smoking fun demonstrating Iraq's deception to the world.\n  Earlier this year, President Clinton came close to using military \nforce in response to Iraq's violations. Instead, U.N. Secretary General \nAnnan went to Baghdad and made a deal with Saddam Hussein. Hussein \npromised to do what he has been obligated to do since 1991. In return, \na new ``Special Envoy'' for Iraq was created. Special procedures of \ncertain UNSCOM inspections were laid out.\n  If the goal was to avoid the difficult decision to use force, the \nClinton Administration was successful. If the goal was to achieve Iraqi \ncompliance with its international obligations, the Clinton \nAdministration has failed.\n  In recent months there are a number of signs that the Clinton \nAdministration is abandoning a serious policy toward Iraq. First, U.S. \nmilitary deployments in the Persian Gulf have been reduced. There has \nbeen no change in Iraqi behavior. Congress fully funded the deployments \nthrough the fiscal year. Yet the force without which diplomacy is empty \nhas been significantly and unilaterally reduced.\n\n  Second, the Administration refuses to support effective opposition to \nSaddam Hussein. The Congress provided $5 million in support for the \nIraqi democratic opposition and required the Administration to submit \nits plan to Congress for using the money in 30 days. Today, almost 60 \ndays later, we have received no report.\n  The Administration has refused to provide direct support to the Iraqi \nNational Congress--the opposition group most effective in challenging \nSaddam Hussein in the past. Instead, they provided a list of dozens of \nso-called opposition groups that included fronts for Syrian \nintelligence, groups compromised by Iraq, groups linked to Iran, and a \nnumber of cultural and religious groups with no history in political \nopposition. This list--and the absence of a report--make it seem the \nAdministration has no interest in an effective policy of supporting the \nIraqi opposition.\n  Third, the Administration is acting in a very bizarre way in the case \nof Iraqis detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service in \nCalifornia. Six Iraqis involved in efforts to overthrow Saddam \nHussein--part of more than 6,000 evacuated after Saddam invaded \nnorthern Iraq--are now subject to secret deportation proceedings. \nformer CIA Director Woosley is representing them free of charge, but \neven he has been denied an opportunity to see the alleged ``evidence'' \ngathered by INS. Something very suspicious is going on here. The \nCongress will look at why the executive branch is trying to send Iraqis \nwho supported our goals in Iraq back to certain death at the hands of \nSaddam Hussein.\n  Fourth, the U.S. acquiesced in a dramatic expansion of Iraq's oil \nexports for the ostensible purpose of feeding Iraqis. The new program, \napproved just before Secretary General Annan left for Baghdad, allows \nIraq to export more than $10 billion a year. This is not about feeding \nIraqis--it is about repairing Iraq's oil infrastructure, building roads \nand otherwise helping Saddam Hussein provide the services he has been \ndenied because of U.N. sanctions. It goes a long way to allowing Saddam \nHussein to enjoy the benefits of ending sanctions while the U.S. has \nreceived no additional support for keeping sanctions on Iraq. It is a \nbad deal that seems to be getting worse--for our position.\n  Finally, there is the mute response to evidence of the weaponization \nof VX by Saddam Hussein's regime. This is one of the most deadly \nsubstances know to man. A single drop can kill a person. Saddam Hussien \nhad it in missile warheads. He denied it. UNSCOM caught him in his \nlies--again.\n\n[[Page S7199]]\n\n  The Administration needs to do more than simply hear the evidence and \nsay the sanctions should remain. They need to develop and implement a \ncoherent policy that addresses the threat posed by Saddam Hussien's \nregime. The need to respond--as the U.S. and even the U.N.--has \nresponded before to material breaches by Iraq. Instead they are, in \neffect, looking the other way and hoping the French and Russians are \nnot too offended by UNSCOM.\n  This resolution is intended to put pressure on the Administration to \nact on the information uncovered by UNSCOM. This is a material and \nunacceptable breach of Iraq's obligations. If the Administration \nrefuses to act, Congress will be forced to step into the vacuum.\n  I would like to thank the cosponsors of the resolution: Senators \nLieberman, Helms, Kyl, Shelby, Brownback, and McCain. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with them in supporting an effective policy toward \nIraq.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 54\n\n       Whereas hostilities in Operation Desert Storm ended on \n     February 28, 1991, and the conditions governing the cease-\n     fire were specified in United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions 686 (March 2, 1991) and 687 (April 3, 1991);\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 \n     requires that international economic sanctions remain in \n     place until Iraq discloses and destroys its weapons of mass \n     destruction programs and capabilities and undertakes \n     unconditionally never to resume such activities;\n       Whereas Resolution 687 established the United Nations \n     Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) to uncover all aspects of \n     Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programs and tasked the \n     Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency to \n     locate and remove or destroy all nuclear weapons systems, \n     subsystems or material from Iraq;\n       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 715, \n     adopted on October 11, 1991, empowered UNSCOM to maintain a \n     long-term monitoring program to ensure Iraq's weapons of mass \n     destruction programs are dismantled and not restarted;\n       Whereas Iraq has consistently fought to hide the full \n     extent of its weapons programs, and has systematically made \n     false declarations to the Security Council and to UNSCOM \n     regarding those programs, and has systematically obstructed \n     weapons inspections for seven years;\n       Whereas In June 1991, Iraq forces fired on International \n     Atomic Energy Agency inspectors and otherwise obstructed and \n     misled UNSCOM inspectors, resulting in UN Security Council \n     Resolution 707 which found Iraq to be in ``material breach'' \n     of its obligations under United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 687 for failing to allow UNSCOM inspectors access \n     to a site storing nuclear equipment;\n       Whereas in January and February of 1992, Iraq rejected \n     plans to instal long-term monitoring equipment and cameras \n     called for in UN resolutions, resulting in a Security Council \n     Presidential Statement of February 19, 1992 which declared \n     that Iraq was in ``continuing material breach'' of its \n     obligations;\n       Whereas in February of 1992, Iraq continued to obstruct the \n     installation of monitoring equipment, and failed to comply \n     with UNSCOM orders to allow destruction of missiles and other \n     proscribed weapons, resulting the Security Council \n     Presidential Statement of February 28, 1992 which reiterated \n     that Iraq was in ``continuing material breach'' and noted a \n     ``further material breach'' on account of Iraq's failure to \n     allow destruction of ballistic missile equipment;\n       Whereas on July 5, 1992, Iraq denied UNSCOM inspectors \n     access to the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture, resulting in a \n     Security Council Presidential Statement of July 6, 1992 which \n     declared that Iraq was in ``material and unacceptable \n     breach'' of its obligations under UN resolutions;\n       Whereas in December of 1992 and January of 1993, Iraq \n     violated the southern no-fly zone, moved surface to air \n     missiles into the no-fly zone, raided a weapons depot in \n     internationally recognized Kuwaiti territory and denied \n     landing rights to a plane carrying UN weapons inspectors, \n     resulting in a Security Council Presidential Statement of \n     January 8, 1993 which declared that Iraq was in an \n     ``unacceptable and material breach'' of its obligations under \n     UN resolutions;\n       Whereas in response to continued Iraqi defiance, a Security \n     Council Presidential Statement of January 11, 1993 reaffirmed \n     the previous finding of material breach, followed on January \n     13 and 18 by allied air raids, and on January 17 with an \n     allied missile attack on Iraqi targets;\n       Whereas on June 10, 1993, Iraq prevented UNSCOM's \n     installation of cameras and monitoring equipment, resulting \n     in a Security Council Presidential Statement of June 18, 1993 \n     declaring Iraq's refusal to comply to be a ``material and \n     unacceptable breach'';\n       Whereas on October 6, 1994, Iraq threatened to end \n     cooperation with weapons inspectors if sanctions were not \n     ended, and one day later, massed 10,000 troops within 30 \n     miles of the Kuwaiti border, resulting in United Nations \n     Security Council Resolution 949 demanding Iraq's withdrawal \n     from the Kuwaiti border area and renewal of compliance with \n     UNSCOM;\n       Whereas on April 10, 1995, UNSCOM reported to the Security \n     Council that Iraq had concealed its biological weapons \n     program, and had failed to account for 17 tons of biological \n     weapons material resulting in the Security Council's renewal \n     of sanctions against Iraq;\n       Whereas on July 1, 1995, Iraq admitted to a full scale \n     biological weapons program, but denied weaponization of \n     biological agents, and subsequently threatened to end \n     cooperation with UNSCOM resulting in the Security Council's \n     renewal of sanctions against Iraq;\n       Whereas on March 8, 11, 14 and 15, 1996, Iraq again barred \n     UNSCOM inspectors from sites containing documents and \n     weapons, in response to which the Security Council issued a \n     Presidential Statement condemning ``clear violations by Iraq \n     of previous Resolutions 687, 707 and 715.'';\n       Whereas from June 11-15, 1996, Iraq repeatedly barred \n     weapons inspectors from military sites, in response to which \n     the Security Council adopted United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1060, noting the ``clear violation on United \n     Nations Security Council Resolutions 687, 707 and 715'' and \n     in response to Iraq's continued violations, issued a \n     Presidential statement detailing Iraq's ``gross violation of \n     obligations'';\n       Whereas in August 1996, Iraqi troops overran Irbil, in \n     Iraqi Kurdistan, employing more than 30,000 troops and \n     Republican Guards, in response to which the Security Council \n     briefly suspended implementation on United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 986, the UN oil for food plan;\n       Whereas in December 1996, Iraq prevented UNSCOM from \n     removing 130 Scud missile engines from Iraq for analysis, \n     resulting in a Security Council presidential statement which \n     ``deplore[d]'' Iraq's refusal to cooperate with UNSCOM;\n       Whereas on April 9, 1997, Iraq violated the no-fly zone in \n     southern Iraq and United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     670, banning international flights, resulting in a Security \n     Council statement regretting Iraq's lack of ``specific \n     consultation'' with the Council;\n       Whereas on June 4 and 5, 1997 Iraqi officials on board \n     UNSCOM aircraft interfered with the controls and inspections, \n     endangering inspectors and obstructing the UNSCOM mission, \n     resulting in a UN Security Council presidential statement \n     demanding Iraq end its interference and on June 21, 1997, \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1115 threatened \n     sanctions on Iraqi officials responsible for these \n     interferences;\n       Whereas on September 13, 1997 during an inspection mission, \n     an Iraqi official attacked UNSCOM officials engaged in \n     photographing illegal Iraqi activities, resulting in the \n     October 23, 1997 adoption of United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1134 which threatened a travel ban on Iraqi \n     officials responsible for non-compliance with UN resolutions;\n       Whereas on October 29, 1997, Iraq announced that it would \n     no longer allow American inspectors working with UNSCOM to \n     conduct inspections in Iraq, blocking UNSCOM teams containing \n     Americans to conduct inspections and threatening to shoot \n     down U.S. U-2 surveillance flights in support of UNSCOM, \n     resulting in a United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     1137 on November 12, 1997 which imposed the travel ban on \n     Iraqi officials and threatened unspecified ``further \n     measures.''\n       Whereas on November 13, 1997, Iraq expelled U.S. inspectors \n     from Iraq, leading to UNSCOM's decision to pull out its \n     remaining inspectors and resulting in a United Nations \n     Security Council presidential statement demanding Iraq revoke \n     the expulsion;\n       Whereas on January 16, 1998, an UNSCOM team led by American \n     Scott Ritter was withdrawn from Iraq after being barred for \n     three days by Iraq from conducting inspections, resulting in \n     the adoption on a United Nations Security Council \n     presidential statement deploring Iraq's decision to bar the \n     team as a clear violation of all applicable resolutions;\n       Whereas, despite clear agreement on the part of Iraqi \n     President Saddam Hussein with United Nations Secretary \n     General Kofi Annan to grant access to all sites, and fully \n     cooperate with UNSCOM, and the adoption on March 2, 1998 of \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 1154, warning that \n     any violation of the agreement with Annan would have the \n     ``severest consequences'' for Iraq, Iraq has continued to \n     actively conceal weapons and weapons programs, provide \n     misinformation and otherwise deny UNSCOM inspectors access;\n       Whereas on June 24, 1998, UNSCOM Director Richard Butler \n     presented information to the UN Security Council indicating \n     clearly that Iraq, in direct contradiction to information \n     provided to UNSCOM, weaponized the nerve agent VX;\n       Whereas Iraq's continuing weapons of mass destruction \n     programs threaten vital United States interests and \n     international peace and security; and\n       Whereas the United States has existing authority to defend \n     United States interests in the Persian Gulf region; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     Government of Iraq is in material and unacceptable breach\n\n[[Page S7200]]\n\n     of its international obligations, and therefore, the \n     President of the United States is urged to act accordingly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I take the time today to submit an \namendment which will update legislation I introduced last year. On July \n31, 1997, I introduced a bill, S. 1112, which would authorize the Mint \nto produce a commemorative Buffalo Nickel, based on the design of the \noriginal nickel which was in circulation from 1913 to 1938. In February \nof this year, I presented the design of the coin to the Mind and \nprovided testimony regarding the history of the nickel and its design. \nFormer Ambassador to Austria and Colorado buffalo rancher, Swanee Hunt, \njoined me at this presentation to share her support.\n  Since introducing that bill and making the presentation, I have been \nworking closely with officials at the Treasury and the Citizens \nCommemorative Coin Advisory Committee. The recommendation of the \nCommittee is necessary in order to bring the coin into circulation. In \ntheir annual report, the Committee approved the minting of a coin, \nbased on the design of the Buffalo Nickel. However, the CCCAC \nrecommended that the coin be a half-dollar denomination, rather that a \nnickel, which will go into circulation in 2001.\n  This amendment I am submitting today reflects their recommendation \nand complies with Title 31, the Commemorative Coin Act. All proceeds \nfrom the sale of this coin will continue to be paid to the Smithsonian \nInstitution's National Museum of the American Indian, as the original \nlegislation directed. The Committee's recommendation to put the coin \ninto circulation in 2001 will coincide well with the Museum's scheduled \nopening date of 2002.\n  This legislation reflects the goals of all interested parties, and \nstill maintains the original goal of raising funds for the preservation \nof Native American artifacts in the Museum of the American Indian. I \nurge my colleagues to support passage of this bill.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7203-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7204-S7210]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7204]]\n      THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      FAIRCLOTH AMENDMENT No. 3014\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH proposed an amendment to the bill.

His continuous service on \n     that committee covers more than 75 percent of the period of \n     the existence of the committee, which was established \n     immediately after World War II, and more than 20 percent of \n     the period of the existence of military and naval affairs \n     committees of Congress, the original bodies of which were \n     formed in 1816.\n       (2) Senator Thurmond came to Congress and the committee as \n     a distinguished veteran of service, including combat service, \n     in the Armed Forces of the United States.\n       (3) Senator Thurmond was commissioned as a reserve second \n     lieutenant of infantry in 1924.

MILITARY AVIATION ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In February 1996, the GAO released a report \n     highlighting a 75% reduction in aviation Class A mishaps, a \n     70% reduction in aviation mishap fatalities and a 65% \n     reduction in Class A mishap rates from 1975-1995 (Military \n     Aircraft Safety--Significant Improvements since 1975).\n       (2) In February 1998, the GAO completed a follow-up review \n     of military aircraft safety, noting that the military \n     experienced fewer serious aviation mishaps in fiscal years \n     1996 and 1997 than in previous fiscal years (Military \n     Aircraft Safety; Serious Accidents Remain at Historically Low \n     Levels).\n       (3) The report required by section 1046 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (Public Law \n     105-85; 111 Stat. 1888) concluded, ``DoD found no evidence \n     that changing existing investigation processes to more \n     closely resemble those of the NTSB would help DoD to find \n     more answers more quickly, or accurately.''\n       (4) The Department of Defense must further improve its \n     aviation safety by fully examining all options for improving \n     or replacing its current aviation accident investigation \n     processes.\n       (5) The inter-service working group formed as a result of \n     that report has contributed to progress in military aviation \n     accident investigations by identifying ways to improve family \n     assistance, as has the formal policy direction coordinated by \n     the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n       (6) Such progress includes the issuance of Air Force \n     Instruction 90-701 entitled ``Assistance to Families of \n     Persons Involved in Air Force Aviation Mishaps,'' that \n     attempts to meet the need for a more timely flow of relevant \n     information to families, a family liaison officer, and the \n     establishment of the Air Force Office of Family Assistance. \n     However, formal policy directions and instructions have not \n     adequately addressed the failure to provide primary next of \n     kin of members of the Armed Forces involved in military \n     aviation accidents with interim reports regarding the course \n     of investigations into such accidents, and the Department of \n     Defense must improve its procedures for informing the \n     families of the persons involved in military aviation \n     mishaps.\n       (7) The report referred to in paragraph (3) concluded that \n     the Department would ``benefit from the disappearance of the \n     misperception that the privileged portion of the safety \n     investigation exists to hide unfavorable information''.\n       (8) That report further specified that ``[e]ach Military \n     Department has procedures in place to provide redacted copies \n     of the\n\n[[Page S7206]]\n\n     final [privileged] safety report to the families. However, \n     families must formally request a copy of the final safety \n     investigation report''.\n       (9) Current efforts to improve family notification would be \n     enhanced by the issuance by the Secretary of Defense of \n     uniform regulations to improve the timeliness and reliability \n     of information provided to the primary next of kin of persons \n     involved in military aviation accidents during and following \n     both the legal investigation and safety investigation phases \n     of such investigations.\n       (b) Evaluation of Department of Defense Aviation Accident \n     Investigation Procedures.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall \n     establish a task force to--\n       (A) review the procedures employed by the Department of \n     Defense to conduct military aviation accident investigations; \n     and\n       (B) identify mechanisms for improving such investigations \n     and the military aviation accident investigation process.\n       (2) The Secretary shall appoint to the task force the \n     following:\n       (A) An appropriate number of members of the Armed Forces, \n     including both members of the regular components and the \n     reserve components, who have experience relating to military \n     aviation or investigations into military aviation accidents.\n       (B) An appropriate number of former members of the Armed \n     Forces who have such experience.\n       (C) With the concurrence of the member concerned, a member \n     of the National Transportation Safety Board.\n       (3)(A) The task force shall submit to Congress an interim \n     report and a final report on its activities under this \n     subsection. The interim report shall be submitted on December \n     1, 1998, and the final report shall be submitted on March 31, \n     1999.\n       (B) Each report under subparagraph (A) shall include the \n     following:\n       (i) An assessment of the advisability of conducting all \n     military aviation accident investigations through an entity \n     that is independent of the military departments.\n       (ii) An assessment of the effectiveness of the current \n     military aviation accident investigation process in \n     identifying the cause of military aviation accidents and \n     correcting problems so identified in a timely manner.\n       (iii) An assessment whether or not the procedures for \n     sharing the results of military aviation accident \n     investigations among the military departments should be \n     improved.\n       (iv) An assessment of the advisability of centralized \n     training and instruction for military aircraft investigators.\n       (v) An assessment of any costs or cost avoidances that \n     would result from the elimination of any overlap in military \n     aviation accident investigation activities conducted under \n     the current so-called ``two-track'' investigation process.\n       (vi) Any improvements or modifications in the current \n     military aviation accident investigation process that the \n     task force considers appropriate to reduce the potential for \n     aviation accidents and increase public conference in the \n     process.\n       (c) Uniform Regulations for Release of Interim Safety \n     Investigation Reports.--(1)(A) Not later than May 1, 1999, \n     the Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations that \n     provide for the release to the family members of persons \n     involved in military aviation accidents, and to members of \n     the public, of reports referred to in paragraph (2).\n       (B) The regulations shall apply uniformly to each military \n     department.\n       (2) A report under paragraph (1) is a report on the \n     findings of any ongoing privileged safety investigation into \n     an accident referred to in that paragraph. Such report shall \n     be in a redacted form or other form appropriate to preserve \n     witness confidentiality and to minimize the effects of the \n     release of information in such report on national security.\n       (3) Reports under paragraph (1) shall be made available--\n       (A) in the case of family members, at least once every 30 \n     days or upon the development of a new or significantly \n     changed finding during the course of the investigation \n     concerned; and\n       (B) in the case of members of the public, on request.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                THURMOND (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3024\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for Mr. Thurmond for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Thompson, \nMr. Bingaman, and Mr. Frist) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. \n2057, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following: Section 3307 of \n     Title 5, United States Code, is amended as follows:\n       (1) by striking in subsection (a) ``and (d)'' and inserting \n     in its place ``(d), (e), and (f)''; and\n       (2) by adding the following new subsection (f) after \n     subsection (e):\n       ``(f) The Secretary of Energy may determine and fix the \n     maximum age limit for an original appointment to a position \n     as a Department of Energy nuclear materials courier, so \n     defined by section 8331(27) of this title.''.\n       Sec. 2.

Mr. President, today we honor the 60th \nanniversary of the historic Fair Labor Standards Act. The Fair Labor \nStandards Act is landmark legislation, creating the federal minimum \nwage, establishing the forty-hour work week and banning oppressive \nchild labor practices. Each element is an important component in our \nfederal commitment to workers and their families.\n  We can all appreciate the current strength of the economy: 300,000 \nmore Americans started new jobs in May alone; unemployment was steady \nat 4.3%, the lowest in 28 years; and median family income has increased \nfor three years in a row and today, more Americans own their own homes \nthan ever before.\n  However, while the U.S. economy is expanding, all Americans are not \nsharing equally in the benefits of the growing economy. Despite growth \nin both gross domestic product and employment between 1989 and 1994, \nmedian family income in 1994 was still $2,168 lower than it was in \n1989. In the current economy, growth is not leading to improved \neconomic well-being for typical families. Some working families, \nparticularly single women, are falling\n\n[[Page S7212]]\n\nfurther and further behind. For these families, a minimum wage increase \nis not a windfall, but a necessary step to allow them to attain a real \n``living wage.'' This uneven growth should concern us all in Congress.\n  The Clinton Administration's plan is to increase the current minimum \nwage of $5.15 by $0.50 in January 1999 and another $0.50 a year later, \nresulting in a wage floor of $6.15 in the year 2000. I support the \nproposal and would like to take a moment to put the proposed increase \nin context. If we do nothing, the minimum wage in the year 2000 would \nbe equal to $4.82, a level that cannot support a family. The \nadministration proposal, if fully implemented in the year 2000, would \nresult in a minimum wage of $6.15 per hour. However, based on the \ninflation estimates of the Congressional Budget Office, that $6.15 wage \nin the year 2000 would equal only $5.72 in today's dollars.\n  The proposed increase would move the minimum wage back to the level \nof the early 1980s, before inflation was allowed to erode the real \nvalue of the minimum wage by 30 percent. Throughout the 1960s and much \nof the 1970s, the minimum wage was as much as a dollar above the \ncurrent proposal. The fact is that the minimum wage increases in the \n1990s, including the one currently under consideration, will only \nrestore some of the lost ground and real earning power of America's \nlowest paid workers.\n  Despite the 1996 increase, the minimum wage remains below its real \nvalue from 1956 through 1983. And if no action is taken, its value will \nonce again erode over time. From 1980 through 1995, inflation rose 86 \npercent, but the minimum wage increased by only 27 percent. As a \nresult, working families fall further and further behind. Because of \ninflation, it now takes $7.33 to buy what the minimum wage did in 1968. \nThe current minimum wage of $5.15 has nearly 30% less buying power than \nit did thirty years ago. That's unfair for low-income individuals, \nstruggling to provide for themselves and their families.\n  Since the late 1970s, wage inequality has grown steadily. Wage \ninequality is the gap between those at the bottom, the middle of the \nwage scale and those earning the highest income. In 1996, the \nwealthiest one-fifth of the population, those whose earnings place them \nin the highest 20% of household earnings, collected 49% of all national \nincome, an increase from 42.8 percent in 1968. By contrast, the share \nearned by the remaining 80 percent of all Americans declined. The \ndecline in the real value of the minimum wage is a large part of this \nwidening gap. By raising the minimum back to its 1979 level, we can \nhelp close the gap and ensure that low-wage workers get a fairer share \nof the economic growth. The minimum wage helps workers get their fair \nshare of our economic growth and prosperity, raising wages for millions \nof workers across the country.\n  The 60-year-old Fair Labor Standards Act serves as our basic \ncommitment to America's workers. FLSA was subsequently amended by the \nPay Equity Act roughly thirty-five years ago, pledging equal pay for \nequal work. Of the 12 million workers who would benefit from an \nincrease in the minimum wage, 60% are women. Pay equity is an important \nissue in the minimum wage debate.\n  Today, the median annual earnings for women is only 71% of a man's \nearnings, just 71 cents for each dollar. Expressed another way, the \nmedian annual income for women in 1995, less than $22,500, was the male \nmedian earnings level of the early 1980s. We've all been through the \n1980s and shouldn't be expected to go back.\n  After more than a decade of wage growth for most women, the bottom \ntwo-thirds of women in the workforce saw their wages decline between \n1989 and 1995. At the same time, jobs have become less secure and less \nlikely to offer health and pension benefits.\n  By increasing the minimum wage, we can provide strong support and \nraise family income for low income families across the country, helping \nto address widening income inequality for women, particularly single \nwomen raising children.\n  Who are minimum wage workers? They are men and women who operate \nairport metal detectors and X-ray machines at Los Angeles International \nairport are among those making the state's minimum wage of $5.75 an \nhour. They receive no benefits, no sick days, and no vacation, and yet \nthey protect the safety of millions of passengers who travel though the \nnation's second-busiest airport every year.\n  Minimum wage workers are disproportionately women, often single heads \nof households with children. The average minimum wage worker is \nresponsible for providing more than half of his or her family's \nearnings. Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, a minimum wage \nworker earns $10,712 a year, approximately $2,900 below the poverty \nlevel for a family of three.\n  During the successful 1996 effort to increase the minimum wage, \nopposition in the business community argued the increase would trigger \na loss of minimum wage jobs. However, recent studies suggest otherwise. \nA review of the 1996 minimum wage increase found the increase raised \nwages of almost 10 million workers. Approximately 71 percent of those \nwere adults, with roughly half working full time, and another third \nworked 20 to 34 hours a week. The study found no impact on the level of \njobs or inflation, but workers got the raise they deserve.\n  Contrary to Republican critics, the increases were well-targeted, \ndisproportionately benefiting low-income working households. The \npoorest 20% of American households, those with an average income of \n$15,728, received 35 percent of the benefits from the minimum wage \nincrease. Raising the minimum wage lifts family income for low-income \nworkers, without the adverse effects and job loss claimed.\n  During the 1996 welfare reform debate, there was widespread support \nfor the concept of ``making welfare work.'' Raising the minimum wage is \nparticularly important for those moving off welfare as a result of \nwelfare reform. We need to make sure these workers are able to find \nwork that enables them to make ends meet. Minimum wage workers are \nprimarily adults, with more than half serving as their family's primary \nwage earner. Raising the minimum wage plays an important role in moving \npeople from welfare assistance to supporting themselves and their \nfamily.\n  An Oregon study found that, following an increase in the state \nminimum wage, the average wage of an individual leaving welfare \nincreased as well. By contrast, the average wage of an individual \nleaving welfare fell by 5 percent in the years prior to the increase. \nNearly one-third who found work, and one-half of those finding part-\ntime work, received the minimum wage. A strong minimum wage offers \nstrong protection for low-income families and can assist them to make a \nsuccessful transition from welfare to work.\n  Mr. President, by any measure, whether its education level or test \nscores, low-wage workers are equally if not more skilled than the \nworkers of 20 years ago. These workers have more labor market \nexperience, more education and have contributed to an expanding economy \nwhich has experienced overall labor productivity growth of 22 percent \nsince 1979.\n  Yet today's minimum wage earner receives nearly 30% less buying power \nthan they did thirty years ago. That's unfair for low-income \nindividuals, struggling to provide for themselves and their families. \nToday, about 12 million workers earn the minimum wage. These low income \nworkers deserve a share of the benefit. These workers deserve a \nraise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7211-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7212-S7213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A SALUTE TO GENERAL DANIEL SMITH\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, General Daniel Smith, a builder of \ncivilization in the Tennessee Frontier, will be remembered at his home, \nRock Castle in Hendersonville, Tennessee, on October 17, 1998 for his \n250th birthday. As a licensed surveyor, Daniel Smith worked with Thomas \nWalker in 1781 to extend the state lines of North Carolina and Virginia \nto determine the boundary between the unsettled territories of the \nfuture Kentucky and Tennessee.\n  After serving as Captain in the Revolutionary War, he received a \n3,140 acre land grant from North Carolina as payment for his surveying \nwork and service during the Revolution. In 1784, Daniel Smith brought \nhis family from Virginia to the North Carolina Territory that would \nbecome Tennessee. He served as Brigadier General of the\n\n[[Page S7213]]\n\nMetro District and Secretary of the Territory South of the River Ohio.\n  In 1784, Daniel Smith produced the first map of the ``Tennessee \nGovernment.'' As chairman of the committee to draft a state \nconstitution, he is credited with naming the State of Tennessee. He \nserved twice as a United States Senator. I now yield to my colleague \nfrom Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Daniel Smith's many and great accomplishments are far \ntoo numerous to list in this venue, but are celebrated daily in the \nfreedom of our Nation and the struggles of the early Westward movement. \nThomas Jefferson wrote of Smith after his death:\n\n       For intelligence, well cultivated talents, for integrity, \n     and usefulness, in soundness of judgement, in the practice of \n     virtue and in shunning vice he was equaled by few men, and in \n     the purity of motive, excelled by none.\n\n  As Tennessee's United States Senators, we salute the vision of \nGeneral Daniel Smith. He saw the vast potential in this young nation's \nearly Westward movement, and his love of Tennessee is an inspiration to \nus all. We are proud to follow in his footsteps in the United States \nSenate, and we join our fellow Tennesseans in remembering this proud \nstatesman on the 250th anniversary of his birth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7212-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GRAND FORKS EXHIBITION\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am here today to talk about a \nvery special photo exhibit entitled ``Come Hell and High Water,'' which \nis on display this week in the Rotunda of the Russell Senate Office \nBuilding.\n  Through some of the most amazing photographs I have ever seen, the \nexhibit poignantly tells the story of the residents throughout the Red \nRiver Valley of North Dakota and Minnesota who struggled through the \nmost devastating of circumstances during the winter and spring of 1997.\n  From the most brutal winter in 50 years, which, when all was said and \ndone, had dropped more than 100 inches of snow on the region; to the \nmost significant flooding in recorded history that resulted in the Red \nRiver cresting 26 feet above flood stage at Grand Forks and forcing an \nevacuation of nearly all 50,000 residents in the middle of the night; \nto, when no one could imagine it getting any worse, the devastating \nfire that destroyed the heart of downtown Grand Forks; to the \ntremendous outpouring of assistance that brought hope from the \nAdministration and organizations such as the American Red Cross, and \nthe thousands of volunteers from throughout the United States; to the \nbeginning of the recovery process, which continues to this day and will \ncontinue as the cities of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks rebuild \nbigger, better, and stronger than they were before these devastating \nevents. Each of these 37 photographs is worth not only a thousand \nwords, but thousands of lives--the lives that were so greatly impacted \nby these events.\n  I am proud to say to my colleagues today that the City of Grand Forks \nhas made tremendous strides in overcoming these seemingly \ninsurmountable odds. The flood destroyed more than 800 homes in Grand \nForks. Today, Grand Forks Homes, in partnership with several agencies \nand local lenders, have contracted to build 222 new homes in three new \nsubdivisions. Fifty-four of these homes are complete, and 158 homes are \nin the framing stage. During the winter months, 287 families were \nhoused in FEMA-provided mobile homes. Currently, only 119 mobile homes \nare occupied. Of the 41 historic downtown buildings destroyed by flood \nwaters and 11 destroyed by fire, 20 properties have been acquired \nthrough the Central Business District Business Acquisition program, and \n25 more have been targeted for buyout. The Business and Industry \nDisaster Assistance Program has committed more than $1.5 million to 76 \nbusinesses to help provide for post-flood economic development. The \nNoah's Ark building, a 170,000 square foot office and industrial \nbuilding that will provide new economic development opportunities for \nthe community, is slated to be finished July 1st. The Corporate Center, \ncomposed of two buildings currently under construction in downtown \nGrand Forks, will house three larger businesses and will provide \neconomic vitality to this area.\n  I commend the residents of Grand Forks for their strength, \nperseverance, and commitment to their wonderful community.\n  I would like to take this time to thank the exhibit sponsors: the \nBremer Foundation of St. Paul and the Knight-Ridder Corporation of \nMiami, who have allowed this exhibit to be displayed at the Newseum, \nthe U.S. Geological Survey, the Kennedy Center, and throughout the \nState of North Dakota.\n  Also, a special thank you to all the photographers who so \ndramatically captured the events, the lives, the emotions, and the \nheart of the Red River Valley.\n  I urge my colleagues to take the time to view this exhibit and begin \nto truly understand not only the devastation of the events of 1997, but \nmore importantly, the resilience, the spirit, and the strength of the \ncitizens of the Red River Valley.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7213-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7213-S7214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL E. STEPHENS\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mr. Michael \nE. Stephens, the founder of ReLife, Inc., a nation-wide rehabilitation \nsystem, and the namesake of the Michael E. Stephens College of Business \nat the University of Montevallo in Alabama. Mr. Stephens is a \nremarkable man, a distinguished citizen and a leader in the field of \nhealth care and physical rehabilitation.\n  Mr. Stephens was born and raised in Alabama and began attending the \nUniversity of Montevallo in 1962. However, his path through college was \na long, complicated one. Though Michael Stephens is today a highly \nsuccessful entrepreneur, recognized for his many accomplishments and \nhis generous civic spirit, his first attempt at college was incomplete! \nInstead, Mr. Stephens left the University in 1966 for a series of jobs \nin the insurance industry. Several years later, at the age of 26, he \nbroke his neck in a horrible diving accident. Despite being told he \nwould never walk again, with extensive rehabilitation--and steely \ndetermination--Michael Stephens overcame the most significant obstacle \nof his life. Amazingly, he fully recovered in less than a year, and \nalmost ten years after he had begun his college education, Mr. Stephens \nreturned to the University of Montevallo.\n  Michael Stephens received his undergraduate degree in business from \nthe University of Montevallo in 1973 and his Master's Degree in 1975 \nfrom the University of Alabama at Birmingham. He went to work in \nrehabilitative services for the Lakeshore Rehabilitation Hospital. \nBased upon his own experience, Mr. Stephens was committed to providing \ncomprehensive services and quality care to people with physical \ndisabilities. Under his leadership, Lakeshore Hospital became a world-\nclass rehabilitative center. By introducing new rehabilitative \nservices, such as speech therapy, recreational programs, psychological \ncounseling and outpatient job training, Mr. Stephens created a new way \nof dealing with disability. In fact, Forbes Magazine said, ``Stephens \nturned little Lakeshore into a model laboratory for his idea about \nrehabilitation.'' In the mid-1980's, he founded the Lakeshore \nFoundation, a non-profit organization designed to assist people with \nphysical disabilities. Specifically, the Foundation focused on training \nathletes. Almost overnight, Mr. Stephens' athletic program grew. \nLakeshore's athletes went on to become among the most successful in the \nparalympics: breaking records in all events and winning numerous gold, \nsilver and bronze medals. His successful approach to rehabilitation led \nto his founding of ReLife, a publicly-traded national health-services \ncorporation, in 1986.\n  Through ReLife, Mr. Stephens realized his dream of reinventing \nrehabilitation. By 1992, ReLife ran over forty rehabilitation \nfacilities. In 1994, when ReLife merged with HealthSouth Corporation, \nMichael Stephens focused his attention and considerable talents on \nother needs of his community. He became a member of the board of \ntrustees of the Alabama Symphony Orchestra and the Naples, Florida \nPhilharmonic Center for the Arts. Additionally, he is a former member \nof both the President's Committee on Hiring the Handicapped and the \nNational Association of Rehabilitation Facilities and is active in the \nAlabama State Health Coordinating Council. Mr. Stephens' business\n\n[[Page S7214]]\n\nprowess is not limited to rehabilitation: he also owns several car \ndealerships, a real estate development company and a champion horse \nbreeding farm.\n  His leadership was recognized by the University of Montevallo in \n1995, when he was awarded the Doctor of Humane Letters. Mr. Stephens \nserves as a member of the Board of Trustees of the University, and \nrecently donated one million dollars to their capital funds campaign.\n  As a result of business endeavors, community service, philanthropic \nprojects and long-standing support for higher education, on October 9, \n1997, the University of Montevallo honored Mr. Stephens by deciding to \nre-name the business school the Michael E. Stephens College of \nBusiness. The citation issued by the University's Board of Trustees \nstated: ``His leadership and service deserve lasting recognition and \nare worthy of holding as exemplary to this and future generations of \nMontevallo students, faculty, alumni and friends.'' Mr. Stephens has \npromised to remain very active in the Stephens College of Business, and \nI believe that all of the current and future Montevallo students will \nbenefit greatly from his involvement.\n  On that day last year, Michael Stephens, loved and respected by all \nwho have known him, was honored as a friend and leader to not only the \nUniversity of Montevallo, but all the citizens of Alabama. I, too, want \nto honor Mr. Stephen's example of strength, vision, courage and \ncommunity spirit. On behalf of my wife, Annette, an alumna of the \nUniversity of Montevallo, we wish Michael Stephens our sincerest thanks \nand congratulations for his dedication to making a difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7213-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ELLEN BENNETT KANTROWITZ: A REMARKABLE NEW YORKER\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, a milestone will occur on \nTuesday, July 7th, which I do not want to go unacknowledged: Ellen \nBennett Kantrowitz, a remarkable New Yorker, will celebrate her 80th \nbirthday.\n  Mrs. Bennett Kantrowitz is a native of Queens, New York. She married \nMatt Bennett of Brooklyn, New York and had four children: daughter Pat, \nand sons Bill, Mike and Matt. Today they all have achieved much success \nwhich they attribute to the guidance provided by their strong mother. \nPat is a program assistant with the National Association of Secondary \nSchool Principals in Reston, Virginia. Bill is a Long Island \nbusinessman. Mike is News Director of WHUD/WLNA in Peekskill, New York. \nMatt is a partner in a Goshen, New York law firm.\n  Forty years ago, a tragic accident claimed the life of Matt Bennett. \nThe lawsuit which followed led Mrs. Bennett Kantrowitz to enlist the \nhelp of New York lawyer Moses Kantrowitz. Seven years later, the pair \nwere married. For twenty three years this couple lived happily, \ncontinuing to promote and sustain the strong family bonds which \ncharacterize the Bennett Kantrowitz family, until Moses Kantrowitz's \ndeath in 1989.\n  Mrs. Bennett Kantrowitz is the matriarch of a large and loving \nfamily, one which extends throughout the state of New York from \nHuntington, North Babylon, Massapequa, Selden, Brooklyn, Queens, and \nStaten Island to Upstate, Monroe, Highland Mills, Central Valley, \nNewburgh and Beacon. She remains steadfast in her dedication to her \nchildren, grandchildren and great-children, undeterred by age and \nailment.\n  As Ellen Bennett Kantrowitz turns 80 she will be surrounded by family \nat a celebration July 4th weekend in Monroe, New York. With \nappreciation and admiration I take this opportunity to congratulate her \non her 80th birthday, and wish her many more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7214-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                READJUSTING GLOBAL MILITARY FORCE POLICY\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, debate concerning drugs and drug \npolicy has reached new levels. The letters and phone calls which my \noffice receive are a constant reminder that the influx of drugs into \nthis country are at the top of constituents' concerns. Our fight \nagainst drugs exists on two fronts. Within our border we must educate \nour young about the dangers of drugs in an effort to reduce demand.\n  Along our borders there exists another battle. This battle, to keep \ndrugs from entering the U.S. has become increasingly difficult as drug \nrunners have been employing more sophisticated technologies and \ntechniques. Small planes are using remote landing strips to ferry drugs \nacross the border. In the Caribbean traffickers are using high-speed \nboats to escape the Coast Guard. I need not reiterate how these \npreexisting conditions are straining the effort of our front-line law \nenforcement people on the border. As the methods which drug traffickers \nalong the Mexican border continue to improve, we are beginning to lose \nground in our ``War on Drugs.'' This current predicament calls for an \nincreasing and appropriate role for the U.S. military.\n  In recognition of this need, I am joining with Senator DeWine amd \nSenator Graham in sponsoring an amendment which, has been accepted, to \nthe Department of Defense reauthorization bill. This amendment calls \nupon the Secretary of Defense to add drug interdiction and counter-drug \nactivities under military operations other than war, in the Global \nMilitary Force Policy. This would effectively give counter-drug efforts \ngreater priority than military exercises. In addition, it would come at \nno extra cost to the taxpayer. Military resources such as AWAC's and \nother military hardware would be reallocated and instead of being sent \nout on exercises, they would be used to detect and intercept drug \ntraffickers.\n  Elevating the priority of drug interdiction within the Global \nMilitary Force Policy is necessary in helping stem the flow of illegal \ndrugs into this country. In conclusion, if we are to ``get tough on \ndrugs'' in the face of increasingly modernizing drug trade, we must \nseek to incorporate the U.S. military in our effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7214-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7214-S7215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n 81ST ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC COMMISSIONED \n                                 CORPS\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this year marks the 81st \nanniversary of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \nCommissioned Corps, one of the seven uniformed services of the United \nStates. The officers of the NOAA corps play an integral role in the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and serve this multi-\ndisciplinary scientific organization and our nation with distinction.\n  The roots of the NOAA Corps can be found in 1807, when our third \nPresident, Thomas Jefferson, created the United States Coast and \nGeodetic Survey. Directed by Congress, the Department of War and the \nDepartment of the Navy provided the Survey with commissioned officers \nto chart the coastlines and map the shores of our nation, allowing for \nthe expansion of maritime commerce. On May 22, 1917, an Act of Congress \nformally established a uniformed service, patterned after the military, \nto meet the growing responsibilities and unique needs of the Survey. \nThis commissioned service of the United States Coast and Geodetic \nSurvey (C) served with distinction in both world wars.\n  Since its inception, the NOAA Corps has enabled its members to \nperform remote, sometimes hazardous and otherwise arduous duties in a \nwide range of environmental measurement and stewardship \nresponsibilities. Indeed, the NOAA Corps is truly on the front line of \nNOAA's operations. Today's corp officers combine unique qualifications \nas research ship and aircraft operators; as technical experts with \nadvanced academic backgrounds in hydrography, geodesy, fisheries \nsciences, meteorology, and oceanography; and as leaders in technical \nprogram and data management contributing to the coherence, integrity, \nand effectiveness of the administrative structure of NOAA.\n  In order to discharge the responsibilities of NOAA, the NOAA Corps \ncontinues to provide a highly effective interface with other branches \nof the armed forces, most notably the Coast Guard, Navy, Air Force, and \nArmy Corps of Engineers. Additionally, the Corps, our nation's experts \nin nautical charting, ensure the safe navigation of foreign trade, 98% \nof which travels in U.S. coastal waters.\n  In recent years, the NOAA Corps has contributed its valuable \nscientific and engineering skills to the Armed Services and to the \nNation, particularly during times of national emergency.\n\n[[Page S7215]]\n\n Mr. President, you may recall that it was the crew from the NOAA Ship \nRude that so swiftly located the wreckage of TWA Flight 800. The Rude \nand a shore component of NOAA officers were also responsible for \ncreating a highly detailed map which greatly aided Navy divers in their \nretrieval of the wreckage. For their efforts, they were recognized by \nthen Secretary of Transportation Pena and by NOAA's parent bureau, the \nDepartment of Commerce, with the Department's highest award, the \nCommerce Gold Medal.\n  Additionally, it was the NOAA Corps who provided ship, aircraft and \ntechnical expertise for an environmental appraisal and the first \ncomprehensive study of the Persian Gulf following the Gulf War. While \nshore personnel provided expertise in the management of hazardous \nmaterials, scientists above the NOAA Ship Mt. Mitchell evaluated and \ndetermined the extent of environmental damage to the Gulf. Not only did \nthe work of the NOAA Corps grant instant credibility to both the United \nStates and the other nations involved in the Gulf conflict, it also \nprovided a safe, effective research platform. Once again, the Captain \nand crew were lauded for their service, receiving a Commerce Gold and \nSilver Medal, respectively.\n  Whether charting our nation's coastline, assessing its fisheries \nstock, or flying into hurricanes for the benefit of science and \nmankind, today's NOAA Corp maintains a standard of excellence in \nsteadfastly following its mission, always ready to apply their \nscientific and service skills to the management of the United States' \noceanic and atmospheric resources.\n  On this, the 81st anniversary of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nCommissioned Corps, I urge all Americans to join with me in taking a \nmoment to honor these men and women for their distinguished service in \ntheir efforts to explore, chart, and protect the oceans and atmosphere \nnot only of the United States, but of the entire world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7214-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO THE KINGSWOOD HIGH SCHOOL KNIGHTS VARSITY BASEBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate the players of the Kingswood High School varsity baseball \nteam for winning their first division championship.\n  As any baseball fan well knows, winning a division championship is no \neasy task. Yet what makes the Knights' season all the more remarkable \nis the fact that they ended their season with a spectacular record of \n22 wins and only 1 loss. The Knights battled for the championship \nagainst Somersworth High School. Pitcher Kyle Frank and the team's four \nother seniors, Allie Shelley, Shaun St. Ong, Corey Eastman and Matt \nPearson, led their team to an 8-5 victory to win the school's first \nchampionship.\n  Equally as important as the team's victory is the way the players \ncarry themselves both on and off the field. The Kingswood Knights' hard \nwork, fierce determination and positive attitude in the face of tough \ncompetition are traits that exemplify true champions and should make \nevery student at Kingswood Regional High School proud.\n  The Kingswood Knights are a refreshing example of a principle that \noften gets lost in today's sports world: dedicated baseball playing. \nThe Knights play because of a love and respect for the game of baseball \nand this is evident in their division championship.\n  Kingswood's victory is also very special to me personally. Twenty \nyears ago, as a teacher at Kingswood Regional High School, I had the \nprivilege of coaching the Knights and, in fact, had Coach Chip Skelley \non my team. Mr. President, I want to once again congratulate the \nKingswood Knights as well as Coach Skelley and Assistant Coach Bill \nRollins. It is an honor to represent the Kingswood Knights in the \nUnited States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7215-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7215-S7216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHONORING DR. ELBERT W. FRIDAY, JR., ON HIS RETIREMENT FROM THE NATIONAL \n                 OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, in over 30 years as a U.S. \nSenator, I have had the opportunity to work with hundreds of Federal \nemployees. Among all of those hard-working public servants, there are a \nfew individuals who stand out for their commitment to doing the best \npossible job for the American people and who have the skills to get \nthat job done. Today, I would like to recognize one of those \nindividuals on the occasion of his retirement--Dr. Elbert W. ``Joe'' \nFriday, Jr., former director of the Department of Commerce's National \nWeather Service.\n  Dr. Friday has given 38 years of outstanding service to this country. \nTwenty of those years were as a U.S. Air Force Weather Detachment \nCommander in Saigon, Vietnam, and Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, and as the \nDirector of Environmental and Life Sciences in the Office of the Under \nSecretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. The remaining \neighteen years were served in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration (NOAA). During his tenure at NOAA, Joe served as \nassociate administrator for both the National Weather Service and the \nOffice of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research.\n  As the head of the National Weather Service, Joe has guided the \nagency through the most significant changes in its 200-year history. \nWeather service modernization has required the implementation of \npowerful new observational technologies, updated information and \nforecast systems, and a streamlined organizational structure. When \ncomplete, it will yield revolutionary advancements in our national \npublic weather warning and forecast system. In fact, in recent years we \nhave already begun to document dramatic improvements in the accuracy \nand timeliness of the Service's forecasts of weather events. For \nexample, the Weather Service has lengthened the warning time for \ntornadoes from 6 minutes back in 1994 to 10 minutes today. That may not \nseem like a huge accomplishment, but it can mean the difference between \nlife and death for individuals who are caught in a tornado's deadly \npath. Under Dr. Friday's leadership, we have also seen substantial \nimprovements in the accuracy of predicting hurricane landfall, allowing \nlocal managers to make better and less costly evacuation plans and \nemergency preparations.\n  In 1989, an anxious nation watched as Hurricane Hugo moved \nrelentlessly towards the Southeastern coast. As we waited, there was \none person, Joe Friday, that I could count on to answer my questions \nand provide accurate information for tracking the storm. During weather \nservice modernization when local communities in every region raised \nconcerns about the closing of weather stations and the placement of \nradars, one person, Joe Friday, sorted through the rumors, listened, \nand gave us straight information. In recent years, budgetary \ndifficulties have provided Joe with some of his greatest challenges. \nHowever, he succeeded in protecting the National Hurricane Center and \nother essential programs from sweeping cutbacks that would have \nhampered the ability of the Weather Service to do its job.\n  Last year, Joe moved over to NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric \nResearch, where he is responsible for environmental research and \ntechnology programs like Sea Grant and Climate and Global Change. These \nprograms are critical for addressing such diverse issues as global \nwarming, climate prediction, El Nino events, red tides, and Pfiesteria. \nI am sure that many at NOAA would echo my view when I say that I regret \nnot being able to entice Dr. Friday to stay longer in his new position.\n  Throughout his career, Joe Friday has shared credit for successes, \nbut never blamed others for problems or difficulties. He is a rare mix \nof gifted scientist, decorated soldier, and eloquent speaker--a \ncharismatic man who leads by example and has inspired a generation of \nmen and women at the National Weather Service. His strong leadership, \nclear vision, loyalty, and concern for his colleagues were instrumental \nin creating an effective team of professionals. His simple but powerful \nphilosophy has always been that, as a public servant, his \nresponsibility is to provide the highest level of products and services \nto the people of the United States and the world. In all his endeavors, \nhe has supplied endless energy, sound judgment, keen intelligence, and \na sense of humor to the government he\n\n[[Page S7216]]\n\nis so proud to serve. It was no surprise to anyone when he was awarded \nthe 1993 Federal Executive of the Year, an outstanding and well \ndeserved recognition for his contributions.\n  I am confident that I speak for many of my colleagues when I express \nadmiration and thanks to Joe for his invaluable contributions to the \nUnited States of America and to the global scientific community. He has \nour best wishes and deepest gratitude for his accomplishments in his 38 \nyears of Federal Service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7215-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          EDUCATION SAVINGS AND SCHOOL EXCELLENCE ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, the Senate has often heard me speak \nabout the people of North Dakota, and at times I have been compelled to \nspeak about the injustices North Dakotans have been forced to endure \nbecause of something our Federal government has done to them.\n  Today, the Supreme Court handed down a decision which should mark the \nbeginning of the end for the reachback tax, which has been a terrible \nburden for the largest lignite producer and largest coal industry \nemployer in our state.\n  This very important part of our economy was unfairly and unjustly \nsaddled with the reachback tax under the 1992 Coal Industry Retiree \nHealth Benefit Act. The Coal Act has been draining millions of dollars \nfrom this company every year.\n  The Supreme Court, while agreeing that Congress has the power to help \nfund retired unionized bituminous coal miners' health benefits, held \nthat Congress did so improperly. We subjected honest, tax-paying \ncorporate citizens to a truly onerous levy without an adequate basis \nfor doing so. If the Senate had taken the time either in committee or \nin a floor debate to consider fully the scope of this reachback tax, \nperhaps the rebuke Congress received this morning from the Supreme \nCourt could have been avoided.\n  In the opinion of the Court, the Act places a ``severe, \ndisproportionate, and extremely retroactive burden'' on the reachback \ncompany that brought the action. As such, the Court held that the tax \nimposition it reviewed violates the Constitution's takings clause.\n  In short, Mr. President, the Supreme Court has affirmed the arguments \nthat many of us have pursued in this body for some time--namely, that \nCongress needs to revisit the whole problem of how to fund the health \nbenefits for retired unionized bituminous coal miners.\n  Since its inception, I have fought for reform of the Coal Act. Many \nof my colleagues over the years have joined me in this bipartisan \nfight. With the impetus of today's decision by the Supreme Court, the \nSenate should commit itself to fixing the Coal Act soon. I am confident \nthat we can devise a plan that assures benefits for affected retirees \nand their families, treats the industry fairly, and passes \nConstitutional muster.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7216-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO JAMES EDWIN ``JIMMY'' WALKER\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to salute a great \nAlabamian and a great American whose life was cut short by war--\nLieutenant James Edwin ``Jimmy'' Walker. I did not have the pleasure of \nknowing Jimmy, but many people from my home state who knew this young \nman have nothing but praise for him.\n  Born in 1913, Jimmy became one of the most outstanding athletes in \nthe history of Holt High School. He was the captain of the football, \nbaseball, and basketball teams, leading his small school to athletic \nprominence in the state. Jimmy's former high school coach and teacher \ndescribed him as having ``superior athletic abilities, and as being a \ngreat and popular leader.'' He further described Jimmy as ``a joy and \nan inspiration to those who had the good fortune to work and play with \nor for him.''\n  In 1932, Jimmy entered the University of Alabama, in Tuscaloosa, on \nan athletic scholarship. Throughout his three years of varsity \ncompetition, he started on both the football and basketball teams. On \ncampus, as well as on the athletic field, Jimmy was well known, loved \nand respected. He was a member of the ``A'' Club, Alabama Quadrangle, \nJason's Honorary Junior Society, Pi Gamma Alpha Fraternity, O.D.K., \nCotillion Club, and the Court of Appeals of the Student Government. \nNotably, Jimmy was captain of the victorious Rose Bowl and national \nchampionship football team of 1935, as well as captain of the 1934 \nCrimson Tide Basketball team. He was an All-Conference, All-\nSoutheastern, and All-American basketball player while remaining active \non campus and successful in the classroom. Jimmy ultimately received \nhis Bachelor of Science degree in 1935.\n  Jimmy continued in athletics, coaching basketball at Virginia \nMilitary Institute. As in high school, Jimmy led a small school to \ngreat heights. His teams were outstanding, consistently ranking higher \nthan the much larger southern schools. At the time, newspapers called \nhis accomplishment ``a coaching masterpiece.''\n  Despite his considerable professional and personal success and his \ngrowing notoriety, Jimmy asked for a leave of absence from coaching to \njoin the United States Navy at the start of World War II. When he \nbecame a First Lieutenant in the Navy, he told his family that he had \nfinally ``made the team.'' After a period of distinguished wartime \nservice, on December 22, 1943, this Alabama sports-hero-turned-Naval-\nofficer sadly died in South America, from wounds received while in the \nperformance of his official duties.\n  Jimmy died serving his country. He was a true leader, not only on the \nathletic field but in all areas of life. As a coach, a student, and a \nmilitary officer, he was a fine role model for those around him. His \ndedicated, patriotic spirit will be remembered for a long time. He \ntruly gave his all for victory.\n  Today, 45 years after his untimely passing, my thoughts are with \nJimmy's family and friends. His spirit will forever live on in those \nwho knew him. Perhaps Jimmy's sister, Neta Walker Laycock, of \nTuscaloosa, Alabama, captured his outstanding personality best when she \nsaid: ``If you knew him, you loved him. If you didn't, you missed a \ntreat.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7216-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7216-S7218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, the pending military construction \nappropriations bill provides $8.5 billion in new budget authority and \n$2.6 billion in new outlays for Military Construction and Family \nHousing programs for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1999.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the outlays for the 1999 program total \n$9.1 billion.\n  Compared to 1998 appropriations, this bill is $417 million lower in \nbudget authority, and it is $477 million lower in outlays.\n  This legislation provides for construction by the Department of \nDefense for U.S. military facilities throughout the world, and it \nprovides for family housing for the active forces of each of the U.S. \nmilitary services. Accordingly, it provides for important readiness and \nquality of life programs for our service men and women.\n  The bill is within the revised section 302(b) allocation for the \nMilitary Construction Subcommittee. I commend the distinguished \nsubcommittee Chairman, the Senator from Montana, for bringing this bill \nto the floor within the subcommittee's allocation.\n  Because Congress has not yet passed the final 1999 congressional \nbudget resolution, prior year outlays for this bill have not yet been \nrevised to reflect Congress' override of President Clinton's Line Item \nVeto of 37 FY 1998 military construction projects. When this adjustment \nis made, outlays prior to 1999 will be revised upward by $112 million. \nIt is my understanding that this necessary adjustment will be made when \nCBO revises its baseline for this legislation, which should be before \nthis bill is reported back to the Senate from Conference with the \nHouse.\n  The bill provides important increases over the President's request \nfor 1999, and I urge the adoption of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table showing the \nrelationship of the bill to the subcommittee's section 302(b) \nallocation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         S. 2160, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS, 1999--SPENDING COMPARISONS, SENATE-REPORTED BILL        \n                                     [Fiscal year 1999, dollars in millions]                                    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Category                  Defense       Nondefense         Crime         Mandatory         Total    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:                                                                                           \n    Budget authority............           8,481  ..............  ..............  ..............           8,481\n    Outlays.....................           9,120  ..............  ..............  ..............           9,120\nSenate 302(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n    Budget authority............           8,484  ..............  ..............  ..............           8,484\n    Outlays.....................           9,120  ..............  ..............  ..............           9,120\nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n    Budget authority............           7,784  ..............  ..............  ..............           7,784\n    Outlays.....................           9,059  ..............  ..............  ..............           9,059\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n    Budget authority............  ..............  ..............  ..............  ..............  ..............\n    Outlays.....................  ..............  ..............  ..............  ..............  ..............\n                                                                                                                \n  SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED                                                                                 \n               TO:                                                                                              \nSenate 302(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n    Budget authority............              -3  ..............  ..............  ..............              -3\n    Outlays.....................  ..............  ..............  ..............  ..............  ..............\nPresident's request                                                                                             \n    Budget authority............             697  ..............  ..............  ..............             697\n    Outlays.....................              61  ..............  ..............  ..............              61\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n    Budget authority............           8,841  ..............  ..............  ..............           8,481\n    Outlays.....................           9,120  ..............  ..............  ..............           9,120\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.

Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the \nmilitary construction appropriation bill and report for fiscal year \n1999.\n  This bill reflects the bipartisan approach that the ranking Member, \nSenator Murray of Washington, and I have tried to maintain regarding \nmilitary construction and this subcommittee. It has been a pleasure to \nwork with Senator Murray, her staff and the members of the subcommittee \nthroughout this process. I very much appreciate all of their support.\n  Mr. President, this bill was reported out of the full Appropriations \nCommittee on June 11, by a unanimous vote of 27 to 0. The bill \nrecommended by the full Committee on Appropriations is for \n$8,480,574,000. This is $696.5 million over the budget request.\n  However, this bill provides $702 million less than what was \nappropriated last year--a reduction of 8.2 percent overall spending \nauthority for the committee from the amount appropriated in fiscal year \n1998.\n  Further, more importantly, the bill reflects a reduction of 23 \npercent since fiscal year 1997--almost $2 billion less from just two \nyears ago.\n  We have sought to recommend a balanced bill to the Senate, and we \nbelieve it addresses key, military construction requirements for \nreadiness, family housing, barracks, quality of life and the Guard & \nReserve components.\n  This bill honors the commitment we have to our Armed Forces. It helps \nensure that the housing and infrastructure needs of the military are \ngiven proper recognition.\n  Also, I am pleased to report to the Senate that the bill is within \nthe committee's 302(b) budget allocation for both budget authority and \noutlays.\n  Mr. President, this bill has some points I want to mention. We added \n$98 million above the budget request to provide better and more modern \nfamily housing for our service personnel and their families.\n  On another quality of life measure, we have added substantially to \nthe budget request for medical and hospital facilities. We have \nprovided $708 million for some 46 barracks construction projects to \nprovide single service members a more favorable living environment.\n  The committee also fully funds the budget request of $97 million for \nfunding 15 class I violation environmental projects.\n  We also addressed the shortfalls that continue to plague our Reserve \ncomponents. The Department continues to walk away from the total force \nconcept. Recognizing this, we have again lent support by adding $267 \nmillion to the Guard and Reserve accounts. In each case, the funds will \nhelp satisfy essential mission, quality of life or readiness \nrequirements.\n  22 percent of the bill, or $1.731 billion, is for downsizing defense \ninfrastructure, or better known as the Base Closure and Realignment \nProgram. This includes funding for the last two rounds of BRAC.\n  Almost a quarter of all military construction dollars goes toward the \nbase closure and realignment process.\n  All of the projects that we have recommended are included in the \nSenate-passed version of the defense authorization bill. We will work \nvery closely with the Armed Services Committee,\n\n[[Page S7218]]\n\nas we put together a conference package for military construction.\n  We have tried to accommodate the sizeable administration request for \noverseas projects in such places as Korea, Germany and the Middle East. \n18 percent of the administration's budget request for military \nconstruction projects is for overseas areas. We have funded only the \nessential of those projects.\n  There are many other issues that I could speak about at this time. I \nurge the Members of the Senate to support this bill and move it forward \nexpeditiously.\n  I would like to yield to my ranking member, Senator Murray.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to join Chairman Burns \nin recommending for the Senate's consideration the FY 1999 military \nconstruction appropriations bill. Through a bipartisan effort, we have \ncreated what I think is a very fair and just bill that should please \nboth DoD and my colleagues here in the Senate.\n  As he does every year, Chairman Burns had to weigh the priorities of \nthe Department of Defense, the requests of his colleagues, and the \nrecommendations of the Armed Services Committee. He had to do this with \nan unacceptably low budget request of $7.784 billion, which was $1.4 \nbillion less than the $9.18 billion we appropriated last year. Thanks \nto Chairman Sevens, that budget request was raised to an $8.48 billion \nallocation--which we have completely allocated in an equitable and \nbipartisan way.\n  You will find that the budget request yet again tremendously short \nended the Guard and Reserve--asking for only $179 million compared to \nthe $390 million we appropriated last year. Thanks to some creative \nmaneuvering and forward thinking, we were able to fund the Guard and \nReserve this year at $446 million without disadvantaging any other \nportion of our bill.\n  As Chairman Burns noted, the active components were given $2.57 \nbillion for military construction. In an attempt to fund even more \nprojects, Chairman Burns and I have also created a $200 million package \nof quality of life projects that has been added to the authorization \nbill. These adds are included in our bill, and the criteria used in \nchoosing them was that the programs had to be quality of life, had to \nbe in the future year defense plan, and had to represent a broad number \nof States and services. These are inherently valuable projects, and \ninclude improvements to family housing, child development centers, \ndining facilities, barracks renewal, and physical fitness centers. I \nencourage all members to support this important initiative to provide a \nbetter quality of life to our service men and women.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill--and it's a bill that all of the \nSenators here should be pleased to support. Again I'd like to thank \nChairman Burns for his fair, honest, and excellent work at drafting a \nbi-partisan and equitable bill. I'd also like to thank and commend his \nappropriations staff, Sid Ashworth, as well as minority staff in past. \nEmily East and Dick Diamond for commitment to producing this first-rate \nbill. I hope my colleagues can join Chairman Burns and me in supporting \nthis bill and voting to adopt it today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3045 and 3046) were agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, the Senate has confirmed three members to \nthe new Amtrak Reform Board, as provided for under the Amtrak Reform \nand Accountability Act, P.L. 105-134. That law required a new 7-member \nReform Board to replace Amtrak's current Board of Directors. By today's \nconfirmation of Governor Tommy Thompson, Governor Michael Dukaskis, and \nMayor John Robert Smith, along with the automatic confirmation of \nSecretary Rodney Slater, a quorum of new members will be constituted \nand in turn, the new Board will immediately assume the old Board's \nresponsibilities. This action ensures Amtrak's authorization remains in \ntact.\n  I think it is important to discuss the background leading up to \ntoday's confirmations. As my colleagues know, the Amtrak reform \nlegislation enacted last December required Amtrak to operate more like \na real business. After 27 years and more than $22 billion in taxpayers \nsubsidies, that new law finally\n\n[[Page S7221]]\n\nsends a real signal that this is Amtrak's ``last chance'' to turn \nitself into a viable operation. The status quo has been, and remains, \nunacceptable. If Amtrak cannot find a way to free itself from its \nsubsidy ``fix,'' then the Amtrak we know today will cease to exist.\n  Amtrak has been directed to institute substantive changes to enable \nit to operate free of subsidies by 2002. As such, Congress and the \nAdministration agreed that new leadership at Amtrak was imperative, \nwhich is why we provided for a new Reform Board to replace the current \nAmtrak Board of Directors. It is absolutely necessary to instill a `new \nculture' among Amtrak employees and management if Amtrak is ever to \nbecome a legitimate business. And that new culture necessitates changes \nthat start from the top.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that during the last days of negotiations \non the reform legislation, three members of the Amtrak Board of \nDirectors, along with Secretary Slater who is also a Board member, \nnegotiated a new labor agreement to give union employees a raise. In \nthe real world it is not very typical for Board members to negotiate \nlabor deals. Yet these three--and at times four--did. They agreed to \nraise salaries, which is projected to cost Amtrak $35 million in FY \n1998 alone, as it is assumed its terms will be extended to all its \nother unions. It is further projected these costs will grow to $60 \nmillion in future year obligations.\n  One must ask, how could these Board members have been upholding their \nfiduciary responsibilities by agreeing to increase Amtrak's obligations \nat the very time Amtrak is looming on the brink of bankruptcy? Amtrak's \nprojected net loss for FY 1998 is greater than the previous year's due \nin part to the current Board's own actions. Its losses are growing, Mr. \nPresident, even though under the law Amtrak has less than two years to \ndemonstrate it can achieve its financial goals, or risk dissolution.\n  Mr. President, the Democratic Presidentially-appointed Board Members \nwho negotiated the union salary hike assured us at the time that their \nhigh-priced labor agreement would require no action by Congress--nor \nmore importantly, would the labor agreement place any additional \nobligations on the American taxpayers. That was their assurance, even \nthough one of the agreement's contingencies was that the Administration \nhad to request $1.4 billion in additional funding above Amtrak's \nglidepath projections. So, what has the Administration done?\n  The Administration didn't request the additional funding, yet the \nBoard did nothing to nullify the contract. Instead, the Administration \nand Amtrak are now asking Congress to agree to shuffle Amtrak's \noperating and capital costs. Specifically, they want us to agree to \nshift labor costs into Amtrak's ``capital'' account so that Amtrak can \npay for the Board's labor agreement with funds currently directed for \ncapital investment.\n  When are we going to say enough is enough? Just how long are the \nAmerican taxpayers going to be forced to cover the expenses stemming \nfrom Amtrak's poor management decisions? It surely won't be hard for \nAmtrak to tell Congress it met requirements to be free of operating \nsubsidy if the current group at Amtrak can pull this one off. All \noperating costs could essentially vanish with the stroke of a pen and \nbecome capital costs.\n  And, if Amtrak and the Administration are successful--and I \nacknowledge Amtrak's political clout in the Congress--how will Amtrak \nmake up for its loss in capital? If Amtrak is permitted to shift \ncapital funds to cover wage increases and other items traditionally \nconsidered operating costs, would someone please tell me how Amtrak \nwill make up for the corresponding loss in funding for its capital \nimprovements. I think I know how. Amtrak will just come a calling to \nCongress to bail it out, just like always.\n\n  Mr. President, time and again we have been told Amtrak faces critical \ninfrastructure investment needs which must be met if Amtrak is to have \nany chance of becoming a viable operation. Time and again we have been \ntold Amtrak needs capital resources to invest in its future. But as I \nsee it, the change they propose has the potential for completely \njeopardizing Amtrak's abilities to meet its capital needs which it has \nsought so long to accomplish.\n  Mr. President, it is unconscionable that while Congress was under \nintense negotiations to reach agreement on reform legislation, which \nwas required to release the $2.3 billion so-called ``tax credit'' to \nAmtrak, the Amtrak Board was doing anything it could to appease the \nlabor unions. Of course, it is no secret who the democratic party is \nbeholden to. While Amtrak's financial situation is in dire straights--\nlooming on the brink of bankruptcy--its democratic Board members agreed \nto raise union salaries, increasing Amtrak's opperating--and I stress \noperating--costs by millions of dollars annually. By adopting these \nwage increases, the current Board failed to fulfill its fiduciary \nresponsibilities not only to Amtrak, but to the American taxpayer as \nwell. Is it any wonder the Congress decided that the Board has to go?\n  The Congress should be concerned about this situation because two of \nthe six Presidential nominees for the new board are holdovers from the \ncurrent Board. Another holdover is the Secretary of the Department of \nTransportation. That makes THREE holdovers according to my count. And \nthese are three of the four that negotiated this sweetheart deal for \nlabor. Surely we did not call for a new Board only to maintain the \ncurrent members? Doesn't the Administration have any respect for \nCongressional intent?\n  The Administration can not argue that it was unaware of Congressional \nintent because Administration representatives participated in the \nreform legislation negotiations. Let me remind the Administration about \nthe provisions we discuss today. First, a new 7-member reform Board is \nto be established. Second, specific eligibility criteria was \nincorporated in the new law in an attempt to ensure that the new Board \nmembers would be qualified to perform their duties. Third, the law \nrequires the new Board to be comprised of individuals with \ntransportation, corporate, or financial expertise.\n  To further enhance Amtrak's operations, several provisions were \nincluded to prompt timely action by the Administration and Congress on \nfilling the new Board. Unfortunately, the spirit of these provisions \nwas met with little respect by the Administration.\n  The law required the new Board to be in place by March 31, 1998--more \nthan 2 months ago. Yet, the Senate did not receive even a single \nnomination from the President until the eve of the Memorial Day Recess. \nDue to concerns that the Administration may drag its feet \nindefinitely--which only would hurt Amtrak--Amtrak's authorization was \nlinked to the nomination and confirmation of a new Board. Specifically, \nthe law provides that if the new Reform Board has not assumed the \nresponsibilities of the Amtrak Board of Directors before July 1st, \nAmtrak's authorization lapses. The law also automatically discharged \npending Board nomination from the Senate Commerce Committee if the \nCommittee had failed to act by June 1st.\n  As I said, the new Reform Board was to be in place more than two \nmonths ago. Presidential nominations require Senate confirmation, with \nhearings and review by the appropriate Senate Committees accompanying \nnominations. Yet due to the lack of timely action by the \nAdministration, the Commerce Committee had no opportunity to carry out \nits duties prior to the statutory automatic June 1st discharge. I must \nask, was the Administration's timing a direct attempt to circumvent the \nCommerce Committee's authority in this regard?\n  Mr. President, my position regarding the new Board was made clear \nfrom day one. I repeatedly voiced my concerns to the Administration \neach time I heard rumors of its plans to reappoint current members. I \nwas very clear that the Commerce Committee would not report favorably \nany Board hold-overs and I remained firm on that position. I truly \nbelieved even the Administration would acknowledge we didn't create a \nnew Board only to reappoint the same members.\n  So what happened? The Administration sent up the nominations as \nCongress headed into the Memorial Day recess. Two of the six \nnominations needing confirmation were Board holdovers--that is, one-\nthird. The Administration must have known that the Commerce Committee \nwould be unable to fulfill its hearings and review prior\n\n[[Page S7222]]\n\nto the statutory discharge date, given the Administration's stealth \nnomination submission.\n  Mr. President, if a new board is not constituted before July 1st, \nAmtrak's authorization will lapse. That is why the Majority Leader, \nmyself and others are seeking to move forward with some of the \nnominations in order to meet that deadline. But I stand firm that we \nshould not take these or any other confirmations lightly.\n  We should demand the intent of the law be fulfilled. We should demand \nthat the new Board not be riddled with potential conflicts of interest \nby members representing competing transportation businesses and serving \non state transit agencies. We should demand some legitimacy to this \noperation if we really expect Amtrak is to ever become a viable \ntransportation provider.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7220-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I offer substitute amendments to \ntwo similar bills passed out of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee earlier this year. The two bills are S. 1158, a bill to amend \nthe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, regarding the Huna Totem \nCorporation Public Interest Land Exchange, and S. 1159, a bill to amend \nthe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, regarding the Kake Tribal \nCorporation Public Interest Land Exchange. Both of these bills direct \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to conclude land exchanges which \ncollectively will allow Kake and Huna to exchange land needed as \nmunicipal watershed in exchange for other Forest Service lands.\n  By passing these bills two objectives will be met. First, the two \ncorporations will finally be able to fully recognize the economic \nbenefits promised to them under ANCSA. Second, the watersheds that \nprovide the respective communities of Hoonah, Alaska and Kaka, Alaska \nwill be protected in order to provide safe water for those communities.\n  The substitutes I offer today clarify several issues that were raised \nduring the Committee hearings and mark-up. First, the substitutes again \ndirect that the Sealaska subsurface interest will mirror the Kake and \nHuna lands to be conveyed to the Secretary of Agriculture and the new \nlands to be conveyed to the corporations. Second the substitute \nclarifies that these exchange are to be done on an equal value basis. \nBoth the Secretary of Agriculture and the corporations insisted this be \nthe case. I believe this is critical, Mr. President, because both S. \n1158 and S. 1159 provide that any timber derived from the newly \nacquired lands be processed in-state, a requirement that does not \ncurrently exist on the watershed lands the corporations are exchange. \nTherefore, if this exchange was simply done on an acre-for-acre basis \nit is likely that the acreage the corporations are exchanging, without \nany timber export restrictions, would have a much higher value then \nwhat they get in return. It is for this reason that these exchanges \nwere not done on an acre-for-acre basis. If it ends up that either \nparty has to receive additional compensation, either additional land or \ncash to equalize the value, then it is my hope this is done in an \nexpeditious way to allow the exchange to move forward within the times \nspecified in the legislation.\n  I believe these two pieces of legislation are in the best interest of \nthe native corporations, the Alaska communities where the watersheds \nare located, and the Federal government.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7228-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 421, H.J. Res. \n113, a joint resolution approving the location of the Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. Memorial in the Nation's Capital, that the joint resolution \nbe considered read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that the preamble be agreed to with the above \noccurring without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 113) was passed.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to applaud the passage of this \nimportant legislation authorizing the placement of a Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. Memorial in Area I of the Capital.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Senator Sarbanes \nand Congresswoman Morella for the leadership they have both shown over \nthe years we have worked together on legislation authorizing the \nestablishment of a Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial.\n  In 1996, Congress passed and the President signed legislation, also \nsponsored by Senator Sarbanes and myself, authorizing the Alpha Phi \nAlpha Fraternity, the oldest predominantly African-American fraternity \nin the United States, to establish without cost to the federal \ngovernment a memorial to Martin Luther King, Jr., in the District of \nColumbia.\n  The Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity wishes to honor Dr. King with a \nmemorial in the nation's Capital as tangible recognition of his \nremarkable role in the history of our nation. Dr. King's message of \nnonviolence and freedom for all should be passed from generation to \ngeneration. A memorial in his name will be effective in helping us \nreach this important goal.\n  This legislation establishes the memorial in Area I, which consists \nof the Mall and environs. As you know, the Department of Interior, \nafter consulting with the National Capital Memorial Commission, \ntransmitted its formal recommendation that the memorial be located in \nArea I in a letter to the President of the Senate dated January 29, \n1998.\n  Requirements contained in the Commemorative Works Act stipulate that \nthe Department of Interior's recommendation regarding location of a \nmemorial in Area I shall be disapproved if not enacted into law within \n150 days of its transmittal to Congress. Therefore it was critical that \nthe Senate consider and pass this legislation prior to that deadline.\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/25/senate-section/article/S7228-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}]
