The sailors on his three ships were near \ncommitting a mutiny. In Europe, kings and courtiers scoffed and wise \nmen called him a fool. In spite of the ridicule and the impossible \nodds, Columbus said, ``It was the Lord who put it into my mind; I could \nfeel His hand upon me. All who heard of my project rejected it with \nlaughter, ridiculing me. My hope is in the One who created and sustains \nme. He is an ever-present help in trouble.

This afternoon, the Senate will begin a period of morning \nbusiness. Following morning business, the Senate will consider any \nlegislation that may be cleared by unanimous consent only. It is \nexpected that the House will send over a 2-day continuing resolution \nthat will keep the Government operating until midnight Wednesday. That \nwill allow us to continue our negotiations on the omnibus \nappropriations bill.\n  I can report that we have been meeting, of course on Sunday \nafternoon, and we have been meeting this morning, and we are back in \nsessions now between the House, the Senate and the administration. I \nthink some progress is being made. It is, as most negotiations of this \ntype, forward two, back one. A lot of the appropriations work has been \ndone. We are now talking about language problems and also beginning to \nconsider the supplemental appropriations final composition.\n  As a reminder to all Members, it is hoped that the remaining \nlegislation of the 105th Congress can be cleared by unanimous consent. \nHowever, if a rollcall vote is needed on the omnibus bill, all Members \nwill be given ample notice in order to plan their schedules \naccordingly. It would appear to me at this time that there probably \nwould not be--well, there will not be any recorded votes on any subject \nother than the omnibus bill, and that it may not occur until sometime \nWednesday. We would look at the possibility of Wednesday morning, but \nit could be Wednesday afternoon. I think it will be a physical \nsituation at that time, just physically getting the work done and \nallowing everybody to review it to make sure it is as we had agreed it \nwould be. If there develops here in the next 3 or 4 hours the \npossibility that there could be a final vote Tuesday afternoon late, we \nwill immediately notify all Members. But it appears that if a vote is \nrequired, it will probably be sometime during the day Wednesday, at \nleast as things now stand.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience and their assistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12356-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       1999--THE YEAR OF AVIATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, despite the fact that the Senate passed S. \n2279, the Wendell H. Ford National Air Transportation System \nImprovement Act of 1998, it looks like next year will be the year for \naviation. This is disappointing, since S. 2279 promised to bring much \nneeded air service to underserved communities throughout the Nation--a \npromise that will be delayed.\n  The first session of the 106th Congress should prove to be an \nimportant year for our Nation's air passengers. My top aviation policy \npriority remains to increase regional jet competition and flight \nservice to smaller markets. Most Americans do not live in ``Hub'' \ncities and thus do not benefit from the range of choices and \nconcentration of air service options. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues, on both sides of the aisle, and on the Commerce Committee \nto insure that rural and underserved communities receive adequate air \ntransportation with improved flight service and more affordable airline \ntickets.\n  Commerce Committee Chairman McCain has been a tremendous help. He \nunderstands the needs of underserved markets, and fully appreciates \nthat adequate and affordable air service is a vital economic \ndevelopment issue for smaller cities. He too wants to improve the \nquality and quantity of flights originating from smaller airports. He \ngets it. I look forward to working with the chairman to build upon the \nprinciples set forth in the Ford Act.\n  Senator Slade Gorton of Washington, chairman of the Subcomittee on \nAviation, has provided pivotal guidance and has been instrumental in \nbringing focus to the many aspects of aviation. His inclusive and \nenthusiastic approach has engaged all who work with him.\n  Additionally, Senator Bill Frist proved to be a great asset and a \nvery effective advocate for the rural aviation community during this \npast session. His hard work brought small and underserved communities \ncloser to receiving much needed public policy changes for flight \nservice improvements. I look forward to looking with him in the next \nCongress to insure that small town America's aviation interests are \nmet.\n  Aviation policy always effects the management and administration of \nlocal airports. Mr. Dirk Vanderleest of the Jackson International \nAirport is one outstanding Mississippi airport director that counseled \nme on the needs of small and under served markets. His wisdom is \ncherished, and his efforts to push Mississippi's aviation priorities \nare appreciated.\n  Mr. Gene Smith of the Golden Triangle Regional Airport in Columbus \nalso counseled me on Mississippi's aviation needs. He served as a \nmember of the National Civil Aviation Review Commission and \ndistinguished himself as a supporter for regional jet air \ntransportation. I hope the recommendations made by Mr. Smith and the \nother Commissioners are not overlooked in the next Congress. I look \nforward to his continued input in our Nation's future aviation policy \ndiscussions.\n  Next year will be a watershed year for aviation policy. Quality air \nservice for all Americans should be the focus of any aviation \nlegislation. Quality air service is good for economic development, and \nit is good for Americans in the 21st Century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12356-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats).

Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate briefly this \nafternoon on an issue of which the President, Senator Daschle, and \nCongressman Gephardt, and other members of Congress, have spoken on so \nmany different occasions, and most particularly during the last several \ndays--the negotiations on appropriations which are taking place, even \nas we meet here this afternoon, on whether we are going to give the \neducation the priority that it deserves. I believe families all over \nthis country want us to get education funding high priority.\n  Families across the country want the federal government to be a \nhelping hand in improving public schools. This year, the nation will \nset a new record for elementary and secondary school enrollment. The \nfigure has reached an all-time high of 53 million students--500,000 \nmore students than last year. Communities, states, and Congress must \nwork together to see that these students receive a good education.\n  Local communities are doing the very best they can to keep up with \nthe increasing demand for good facilities and high academic standards. \nStates are helping. But the issue today is whether we at the Federal \nGovernment are going to be a partner in helping to improve public \nschools for communities and families across the country. I believe we \nmust be a strong education partner. The President believes we must be a \nstrong education partner. We are very hopeful that the final \nnegotiation allocate scarce resources to strengthening the education of \nthe children of the nation.\n  Mr. President, we know at the outset that money in and of itself is \nnot the answer, but it is a pretty clear indication about what a \nnation's priorities are. If we look over what the budget was for 1998, \nwe will see that only 2 percent of the Federal budget was actually \nappropriated in for education. I think most Americans would believe \nthat that percentage ought to be a great deal higher. I certainly do. \nThe President does.\n  I rise this afternoon to commend the President for making the case he \nhas made in ensuring that in this final funding agreement, we give high \npriority to education. Some may wonder why we have to be concerned \nabout federal support for education?\n  I want to review just for a few moments, Mr. President, the decision \nthat was made by the Republican leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives in the earlier part of the year that shows why we have \nto stay here and fight for education funding. If Americans are \nwondering why the President continues to make statements about the \nimportance of education, let's just review for a few moments how \nRepublicans in the House of Representatives cut funding for education \nin June of this year. They cut $421 million below the President's \nrequest for title I.\n  Now, it is important to try to understand what the title I program \nis. The role of the Federal Government in education is to target the \nchildren in our country that need the most help. We have made a \ncommitment to children from economically distressed families that they \nwould get extra help in order to help them increase their academic \nachievement. We can see the need reflected in a wide variety of \nindicators. In reading, for example, 40 percent of fourth graders are \nreading below grade level. We decided as a nation that we would give \nextra help in reading, math, and other academic subjects, to those \nchildren who would qualify. That has been a time-honored program. An \nincrease in support for the program was in the President's budget and \nit was paid for. But our Republican friends decided to cut the program \nby $421 million below President Clinton's request. I think that cut was \na mistake, but that was a decision made by the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n  Then, the cut a time-honored piece of legislation known as the \nEisenhower Teacher Training Program--a program that helps teachers \nupgrade their skills so they will be more effective teaching science \nand math--by $50 million below last year. I believe very strongly that \none of our main objectives as a nation should be to have a well-\nqualified teacher in every classroom in this country. The Eisenhower \nTeacher Training Program has played a very important and significant \nrole in helping communities meet that goal. Nonetheless, that program \nwas significantly cut back.\n  I think all of us understand there are political leaders--Members of \nCongress, those who are running for Governor, those who are running in \nlocal communities--who are talking about the importance of new \ntechnology in their schools.\n  We in Massachusetts were 48th out of 50 States in access to the \nInternet just 4 years ago. Then, in Massachusetts, we formed what was \ncalled Net Day, a cooperative effort between the private sector and the \npublic sector, to improve children's access to technology. Now \nMassachusetts ranks 10th in the country in schools wired to the \nInternet. That was done by a cooperative effort of the software \nindustries, labor, educators, business and communities. 50 miles of \ncable were laid down in Boston, voluntarily. All of the people who \nhelped wire those schools understand the importance of having new \ntechnology and having Internet access.\n  Therefore, it is difficult for me to understand why, the House of \nRepresentatives cut education technology programs by $137 million below \nthe President's program, and zeroed out the Star School Program, which \nbrings distance learning to rural and underserved communities.\n  With the school budgets being cut back, critical programs are often \neliminated such as music, the arts, and health programs. In addition, \nrural and underserved communities often have difficulty finding \nqualified math and science teachers. So, we developed a Star School \nProgram so that all communities would have access to the best teachers \nwho would be able to enter those schools through satellite. It was an \noverwhelming success. It has been evaluated and reevaluated and it has \nbeen one of the most effective programs that we have, particularly in \nrural areas --in urban areas as well, but particularly in rural areas. \nBut the Star Schools program was zeroed out.\n  They even cut support for after-school programs. After-school \nprograms have an important impact on providing children opportunities \nfor constructive activities, such as doing their homework with the \nassistance of a tutor. It also benefits families because when children \ngo home and see their parents who have been working hard all day, the \nparents will not be in the situation where they must say, ``Go upstairs \nand do your homework,'' but they might have some quality time with \ntheir children.\n  After-school programs also help keep children safe, drug-free and out \nof trouble. We know that juvenile crime peaks in the after-school hours \nbetween, 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. By developing afterschool programs, we \nenhance education but we also have a dramatic reduction in juvenile \ncrime and delinquency. The 21st Century Community Learning Center \nprogram is a modest program to help create models for other communities \nin the best practices for after-school programs. But, the Republicans \ncut the program by $140 million below the President's level.\n  Beyond that, Republicans in the House eliminated the Summer Jobs \nProgram. A program that provides summer jobs for children who are in \nsome of the most difficult educational and economic situations. A \nprogram that is a lifeline in so many communities across this country. \nYet they zeroed it out--they didn't' just cut it by a quarter, or cut \nit in half, or cut it by three-quarters, but they eliminated it.\n  If you go to Chicago--and I see our friend, Senator Durbin, from \nIllinois, who is an expert about this--to find out what is being done \nto reform their schools, you will find that they are providing academic \nenrichment and work experiences to children during the summer vacation. \nBut, the Republicans zeroed out every single nickel for the Summer Jobs \nProgram.\n  If you are asking, as we have heard the Speaker asking and the \nRepublican leader asking, Why should we be suddenly so concerned about \neducation? We need to be concerned because families across the nation \nwant us to help improve education, but instead, Republicans cut the \ntitle I program that help the neediest children. They cut the \nEisenhower Teacher Training Program. They eliminated the Summer Jobs \nProgram. They cut $130 million from the technology programs for \nschools. They cut the afterschool program. That is why these hours are \nimportant; they make a difference.\n\n[[Page S12358]]\n\n  The President has proposed that we make needed investments in \nreducing class size and modernizing our schools. He is making that \nspeech against a background of a GAO report that schools have $112 \nbillion in repair and modernization needs that they cannot address.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for an additional minute and a half.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We ought to be doing all we can to repair and modernize \nthe nation's public schools.\n  What kind of message are we sending to every child in America who \ngoes to a school with leaking pipes, exposed wiring, broken windows, \nfaulty heating systems, and no air conditioning? The message we are \nsending to every child is, they don't make a difference, they don't \ncount.\n  We believe, and the President believes, that the children count, and \nit is important to provide them with safe, modern schools. We are here \nin these final days, to make sure that, unlike the Republican judgment \nthat was made in the House of Representatives in June of this past \nyear, any budget that is going to bear the President's signature or \nhave our vote is going to make these needed investments in education \nthat are essential for every working family in this country.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator agree with me that with this emphasis \non the global economy, if we don't educate our children to the fullest \nmeasure of their capacity, we are not going to be able to compete \ninternationally? It has assumed a dimension now that we have never \nconfronted before in terms of our economic survival in the world \neconomy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. By every kind of \nindicator of which countries are going to continue to survive and \nprosper in a world economy, education is the linchpin for these \ninitiatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12357-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it has been interesting to listen to the \nSenator from Massachusetts beating so industriously upon a dead horse. \nBut the issue before the Congress, I suspect, in these last few days is \nnot going to be on the level of support that the Congress and our \nappropriations bill provides for the education of our children in all \n50 States across the country.\n  The debate now between the President and the leadership who are \nworking on this budget is over who gets to spend it. The President \nbelieves, and the Senator from Massachusetts has outlined in his \nremarks a whole series of categorical aid programs--money for this \nspecific program, money for that specific program--each of which \ncarries with it its own bureaucracy here in Washington, DC, and, \ngenerally speaking, a bureaucracy of the State and always \nadministrators in each school district to fill out all of the forms and \nto make all of the applications for assistance from the Federal \nGovernment. To that extent, an individual school district is lucky if \n60 cents or 70 cents out of every dollar supposedly devoted by the \nFederal Government to education, in fact, ever gets to the classroom \nand to the students.\n  No, the battle in these last few days is not going to be over whether \nor not we shouldn't supply perhaps another billion dollars or more than \na billion dollars above what we are already appropriating for the \neducation of our children. It is going to be over whether or not we \ntrust the teachers, the parents, the principals, the superintendents, \nthe elected school board members and thousands of school districts \nacross the United States to determine how that money can be most \neffectively spent on their students.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator from Washington yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. He will.\n  Mr. CRAIG. About a year ago, the Senator from Washington came to the \nfloor and offered an amendment that would dramatically change the way \nmoney flows out of Washington back to local schools, local units of \neducation. And as I remember, there was a resounding vote here on the \nfloor in favor of that.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Idaho exaggerates a little bit. It was a \nwinning vote; it wasn't quite resounding.\n  Mr. CRAIG. It was a dramatic vote in the sense that Senators were \nvoting their conscience about where the public wanted the educational \ndollar to go, not to get bound up in the Federal bureaucracy and have a \nlot of it spun off here, as the President apparently would want, but \nfor that money to move right back to local units of education. Is that \nnot true, and was that not the goal of this Congress?\n  Mr. GORTON. This Senate voted for just such a program last year. This \nSenate voted for just such a program this year. This Senate did so, I \nam convinced, because while the Federal Government, in spite of all of \nthe speeches on the floor of the Senate and of the House of \nRepresentatives, comes up with only about 7 or 8 percent of the money \nthat is spent in our schools that are, of course, primarily locally and \nState-operated, it comes up with 50 or 60 percent of the rules and \nregulations that must be met by our school districts, by hiring \nadministrators, not teachers, people to fill out forms and read Federal \nregulations rather than librarians and new equipment for our students.\n  It was our attempt last year, and has been our attempt this year, and \nI hope and trust will be our policy when we finish an appropriations \nbill in a few days, that we trust the people in the States and in our \ncommunities and in our schools to come up with better judgments about \nthe varying priorities of their students than can President Clinton or \na Department of Education bureaucracy here in Washington, DC.\n  The thrust of the point that I have been attempting to make for a \ncouple of years now is just exactly that: Where should this money be \nspent? Are we the experts here in this body on how each of 14,000 \nschool districts should go about educating its children? Or is the true \nexpertise in those school districts themselves?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to say in view of the comments \nthat were just made, the Eisenhower Program, I ask the Senator from \nMassachusetts, that dealt with math and science as I understand it?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That was a program that we put into place during the \nEisenhower administration.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I recall, it was done on an overwhelming bipartisan \nbasis.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct again.\n\n[[Page S12359]]\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. It was designed to improve the quality of math and \nscience teachers in the classroom. Now we are being told we are trying \nto direct where the funds should go. The first point I want to make is \nthat this has a long pedigree coming right from the Eisenhower \nadministration.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes, I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think it is very interesting. The comments made by the \nSenator from the State of Washington suggested an enormous percentage \nof the funds which were being appropriated at the Federal level were \nspent on administration. I have in my hand an April 1998 report by the \nSecretary of Education that was requested by appropriators from \nCongress that is based on data from States, the Coopers & Lybrand \nfinancial analysis model, and GAO reports, completed this summer, which \nI think should be part of the Record on this debate, and it says:\n\n       One-half of 1 percent of the Federal funding for elementary \n     and secondary education programs is spent on Federal \n     administration.\n\n  One-half of 1 percent.\n\n       States retain on average an additional 2 percent. The \n     remaining 97.5 percent goes to local school districts.\n\n  End of quote from the report. To suggest that it is 50 to 60 percent \ncost of administration really doesn't square with the facts given us in \nthis report.\n\n       Across more than 20 major State formula programs, States, \n     in fiscal year 1995, retained an average of only 4 percent of \n     the money at the State level; they distributed the remaining \n     96 percent to school districts and other recipients, such as \n     colleges and universities. For the program under the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the percent retained \n     at the State level was even lower--about 2 percent. For Title \n     I, the largest Federal elementary and secondary program, \n     States retain only about 1 percent of the funds. . .\n       The Department uses a very small portion of our \n     appropriation for Federal administration. In fiscal year \n     1999, we will expend only about $87 million to administer \n     some $20 billion in elementary and secondary programs; these \n     funds come from a separate Program Administration budget \n     account, not from funds appropriated for grants to States or \n     school districts. Even with the addition of related research, \n     leadership, and operations costs, the Department spends only \n     the equivalent of about 0.5 percent of elementary and \n     secondary funds for Federal administration.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator for his intervention. That is a \nvery important point. Because the critics stand up and say it is all \ngoing to administration. Now we learn 2.5 percent of it, Federal and \nState, as I understand it from the Senator, is going to administration. \nI think we need to underscore that.\n  I want to come back to this notion that we are trying to direct where \nthe money should go and somehow that is a departure from past practice \nor hasn't in the past, at least, had strong bipartisan support.\n  It is clear that math and science is one of the critical areas. I \nearlier asked the Senator, wasn't this whole education emphasis \nimportant to the U.S. competitive role in the world economy. We can \nlook at what other countries are doing, and we know the kind of \ninvestments they are making in math and science. We started with the \nEisenhower administration, and that, I think, was at the time of \nSputnik that that program was energized to try to improve the quality \nof math and science. We had some successes, but there has been a \nrelapse, there has been a lapse back, and one of the programs that was \ncut, as I understand it from the Senator from Massachusetts, and which \nhe is emphasizing we need to restore, is this program to improve the \nquality of the math and science teachers in the schools all across our \ncountry. Is that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, absolutely correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it seems to me--and the other program, I \ntake it, is we have a deterioration in the physical quality of many of \nour public schools in the Nation. Young children are going to school in \ncircumstances that no one would tolerate. In fact, I understand some of \nthese schools do not meet ordinary building standards. And there are \nserious problems in that regard.\n\n  Once again, we are trying to emphasize a program. Of course, another \naspect of what the President is pushing for is more teachers in the \nclassrooms so we can have smaller class sizes, which most people agree \nis extremely important in the lower grades where we are trying to teach \nreading and we first introduce young people into their education.\n  In fact, I ask the Senator, what is the situation with respect to \novercrowded classrooms across the country?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct in his general summation of \nthe approach of the President. And that is: One, to have smaller class \nsizes; two, to upgrade and modernize schools; three, to have an \neffective after-school program; four, to enhance the quality of \nteaching in the classroom; five, to ensure that we are going to have \naccess to the new technology and that that is going to be available in \nthe public schools so these children are going to be able to move \nahead; six, to raise academic standards for all children; and then \nseven, to try to get the encouragement to those students to go on to \nhigher education.\n  That is all part of the partnership, among the local community, the \nStates, and the Federal Government. This is not just a singular effort; \nthis is a partnership. And when you eliminate the Federal assistance in \nthat partnership, you undermine critical support for improving \neducation that is so important to families and their children.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If I recall the chart that the Senator earlier \ndisplayed on juvenile crime, it peaks in the hours I think between \nabout 3 and 8 p.m., which makes the after-school programs extremely \nimportant.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Maryland has \nexpired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. I yield the floor, Mr. President, and will take my time \nlater because some here need to go ahead. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has up to 30 minutes \nunder the previous order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12358-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12359-S12362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NATIONAL SECURITY AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, in the last 15 years America has been \ninvaded by what has been known as information technology. Like the body \nsnatchers of ``Alien'' that penetrated deep into the human body, \ncomputers and communication technologies have penetrated deep into our \nlives. Unfortunately, the ``Alien'' metaphor may not be apt since for \nthe most part we have invited this force into our homes.\n  We invited these technologies into our homes and our businesses \nbecause they allowed us to do things faster, to do things better and to \ndo things cheaper. Among other things these technologies have reduced \nthe cost of running a home, made our businesses more competitive, \nopened new markets by bringing buyers and sellers closer together, and \nexpanded the horizons of our students not to mention adding \nentertainment value to our lives.\n  The good news of computer and associated communication technology \nhave been offset by our growing dependence. To see how much we are \ndependent one need only look at the high level of concern surrounding \nthe Y2K problem. Computer software is written so that at a second after \nmidnight on January 1, 2000, while hundreds of millions of humans will \nbe celebrating the end of an old millennium and the beginning of a new, \nour computers will act as if it is January 1, 1900. To the machines \nthis will be the equivalent of day light saving century.\n  To some this is the beginning of a humorous and good news story: No \nincome tax, a chance to correct the terrible mistakes of the past 100 \nyears, and so forth. However, for those who operate our banking, \nemergency response, air traffic control, and power systems this will be \nnothing to laugh at. So dire are the predictions of some who understand \nhow dependent on computers and software we have become that they talk \nas though they are storing up food and medical supplies just in case.\n  None of this would have happened if the century had ended 20 years \nearlier because computers, chips, and microprocessors were not yet \nrunning things. Twenty years ago I was hearing people tell me about how \ncomputers were\n\n[[Page S12360]]\n\ngoing to change the world. It would be 5 more years before I had my \nfirst personal computer: an Apple IIE. In 1983 portable computers were \navailable to those with strong backs or a fork lift. E-mail was in its \ninfancy. The internet was 10 years away from its grand opening to the \npublic. Software was built into mainframes and was available to those \nwho knew how to navigate the procession of prompts and confusing signs. \nSpeed was a snail's pace. Capacity was like a rain drop in the desert.\n  Mr. President, what happened in the past 20 years is that we were \nthirsty for the things a computer could do for us. Rapid and accurate \ncalculations enabled even small businesses to get costs under control. \nPersonal computers empowered us. Desk tops enabled us.\n  Lap tops liberated. Decision making - once driven from the top down \nby men and women with MBA degrees--has been distributed outward and \ndownward.\n  Mr. President, now, any PC or Macintosh with average speed and power \nwith state of the art connectivity makes its user a publisher, \nbroadcaster, editor, opinion maker, and analyst of large amounts of \npreviously confusing data.\n  Advances in computer and telecommunications technology have spurred \nchange and growth in our economy. These changes have generated wealth \nand jobs by creating new businesses and destroying old ones. Market \noriented businesses have had to adjust or perish. Public institutions, \nbecause of the nature of democracy--in other words, Majority rules but \nnarrow interests win elections--have been changing much more slowly.\n  Slowly but surely the work of transferring knowledge from a teacher \nto a student is being done with the assistance of computers, software, \nand new systems where new skills are needed.\n  The vision of this 1998 IRS Restructuring and Reform Act is that this \nagency will move from a paper to an electronic world. The National \nImaging and Mapping Agency--a consolidated combat support agency--will \nin a few years talk about maps as those things we used in the good old \ndays back when dinosaurs roamed the Earth.\n  In fact, nowhere are the changes of the computer age more pronounced \nthan in our military and intelligence gathering forces, which is what I \nchoose to discuss on the floor today. Computers and communication \ntechnologies have made America's fighting forces stronger and more \neffective. We should be proud of the men and women who have trained and \nprepared themselves to take advantage of these new tools.\n  However, we also need to be alert to a hard truth: With strength \ncomes vulnerabilities. Just as Achilles was held by his heel as he was \ndipped in the potion that made him unbeatable, we need to be alert to \nthose small spaces where a determined enemy could do us great harm.\n  If we are to maintain our economic success and provide the security \nour citizens expect and deserve, we must as a nation turn to address \nour weaknesses.\n  The ability of people to use information technology to reach into our \nhomes and to amass vast amounts of personal data threatens our sense of \nprivacy. The omnipresence of this technology has caused our society to \ndevelop a dependency on silicon chips and the wires that connect them. \nAnd, the connectivity that now brings us so many benefits may also be a \nvulnerability that nations and terrorists could use to threaten our \nsecurity.\n  We have been blessed by our dominance in high-technology industries \nand in our society's acceptance of new information technology. \nInformation systems are the backbone of America's telecommunications \nand electrical power grids, banking and finance systems, our \ntransportation systems, broadcast and cable industries, and many other \nbusinesses besides. They have helped American workers become more \nproductive, have brought new efficiencies in the use and distribution \nof resources, and have helped our Nation grow to be the most advanced \nand competitive economy in the world.\n  We owe a large part of that success to the ingenuity, perseverance, \nand vision of America's information technology companies and their \nemployees. The story of how computer companies started in garages can \ngrow into multibillion dollar corporations is almost legendary. An \nindustry virtually non-existent twenty five years ago has brought \nenormous wealth and opportunity to thousands of Americans.\n  Mr. President, information technology has transformed our Nation's \neconomy, and, as we enter into the 21st century, our Nation's \nlivelihood will depend on continued development of this industry. But \nthe wonder of this technology is how its success has brought \nextraordinary changes to other aspects of our lives.\n  Modern information technologies provide us with unheard-of \nopportunities in education, business, health care, and other life-\nenriching areas. Information technology empowers people to continue \ntheir educations and upgrade their skills throughout life. Education no \nlonger ends at the schoolhouse door. In addition, new technologies are \nextending lifesaving medical care to remote rural areas and promoting \nhealthy communities across the country. These new avenues to \ninformation better inform our electorate, and the improved means of \ncommunication make it far easier for individual citizens to express \ntheir views to the general public and to their elected representatives.\n  In combination, these technological benefits allow people--both young \nand old--to develop new skills, explore new interests, and improve \ntheir lives.\n  America's technological strength is the envy of nations around the \nglobe. But that strength, if not understood and protected, may also be \nour Achilles' heel.\n  We have been blessed this year with a number of warnings about this \ngrave and far-reaching threat. We have been blessed with warnings about \nthe interdependence of our information infrastructures, the \ninterlocking network that can make local hospitals and airports victims \njust as easily as multinational corporations and media conglomerates. \nWe need to heed the warning and respond to this danger.\n  Just a few weeks ago, the media reported that the electronic mail \nprograms the vast majority of Americans use had vital, hidden flaws.\n  Simply opening an e-mail message could unleash a malicious virus and \nallow that virus to freeze your computer, steal data, or erase your \nhard drive. I realize there are some people in the United States--many \nof them here in the Senate--who still do not use e-mail. But our \nsociety today relies upon electronic mail for use in Government and \ncommercial communications, for business management and project \ncoordination, and personal entertainment and missives. A malicious \nperson could potentially have used these flaws to blackmail people or \ncompanies, to disrupt Government and commercial activity, or to \nsabotage civilian or military databases.\n  Just a few months ago, one satellite orbiting more than 22,000 miles \nabove the state of Kansas began tumbling out of control. It was the \nworst outage in the history of satellites. By conservative estimates, \nmore than 35 million people lost the use of their pagers, including \neveryone from school children and repairmen to doctors, nurses, and \nother emergency personnel.\n  All of that was the result of one small computer on a satellite \n22,000 miles into outer space.\n  Earlier this year, we were in the middle of a very tense standoff \nwith Saddam Hussein. And we were able to track an attack on the \nPentagon's computer system to a site in the Middle East, in the United \nArab Emirates. There was a legitimate question at the time: Was this an \nact of war? Was it a terrorist? Or was it, as it turned out to be, \nteenage hackers inappropriately and illegally using their home \ncomputers? The implications of an effective attack against our \nmilitary's information systems would be devastating during a time of \ncrisis. This attack failed, but will we be as fortunate in the future?\n  I do not think these incidents are a statement about software \ncompanies, the satellite industry, or teenage computer aficionados.\n  These incidents are a warning--loud, clear, and wide--about the \ndependence of the American economy and the American people on \ninformation technology. Our use of information technology has helped us \nachieve and maintain our status as the world's strongest\n\n[[Page S12361]]\n\nnation. But our dependence on information technology also brings \nexploitable weaknesses that, like the Lilliputians to the giant \nGulliver, may enable our weaker adversaries to cause great damage to \nour nation.\n  In Jonathan Swift's tale, the Lilliputians used their mastery of \nmathematics and technology to defeat their much more powerful adversary \nGulliver. Today, weaker adversaries may use their mastery of \ninformation technology to invade our privacy, steal from our companies, \nand threaten our security.\n  The revolution in Information Technology has propelled the United \nStates to an unparalleled position in the global economy. The \nprinciples of freedom and democracy that we champion are ascendant \nthroughout the world.\n  We have the world's largest economy, and we trade more than any other \nnation. Our military strength, in conventional and nuclear terms, is \ngreater than that of any other nation. In short, we are the sole \nremaining superpower in the world.\n  And yet, we still find ourselves vulnerable to individuals or \ngroups--terrorists, criminals, saboteurs--who have a fraction of the \nmanpower, weaponry, or resources we possess. In many ways, we are a \ntechnological Gulliver. America's massive shift toward an economy that \nis based on information technology has been a mixed blessing. Because \nwe have the most complex, multifaceted economy, we are a multifaceted \ntarget.\n  And our strategic vulnerability has risen hand-in-hand with our \neconomic power. Like the Lilliputians, there are people who have used \nthe principles of mathematics and science to master technology.\n  They are so small in scale compared to the threats that we usually \nsee that we have to strain our eyes just to identify them and figure \nout what they are doing. Gulliver, if you recall, did not win his \nfreedom with a single act or weapon. He used a combination of things: \nsometimes he used his power, sometimes he used wit, and he learned from \nhis experience how to deal with his adversaries.\n  Mr. President, Congress urgently needs to establish a bipartisan \nagenda designed to create more economic opportunities in technology and \nto close our vulnerabilities. The following is my attempt to suggest \nwhat is needed:\n  1. We need more competition, not less. Congress passed the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996 with the hopes of increasing competition \nand improving access to communications technologies. Unfortunately, \ncompetition has not developed on the scale anticipated when the Act was \npassed.\n  Nearly 3 years after the Act, most telecommunications customers lack \nthe ability to simply switch telephone companies. In 1999 I hope \nCongress will make changes in the law needed to bring the benefits of \ncompetition - lower prices and higher quality - to the American \nhousehold.\n  2. We need a special effort to make technology a part of our \neducational system. More money should be appropriate for research and \ntraining. Regulations need to be written so the market can offer \ncurricula-relevant courses to students in the home and school. We need \nto settle the disputes surrounding the E-Rate so our school boards can \nplan and budget accordingly.\n  3. We need bipartisan agreement on how to protect privacy and \nsecurity. The encryption debate has hobbled our efforts to write laws \nthat enable our law enforcement and national security agencies to carry \nout their mission of keeping Americans safe while harnessing the power \nof the market to increase security and privacy.\n  Any discussion of security on-line must inevitably involve encryption \nissues. Over the past five years, the debate over encryption policy has \npitted law enforcement, national security, privacy, and commercial \ninterests against one another. Yet, all these interests would agree \nthat providing security in our public networks is essential to fully \nexploit the potential of information technology.\n  Personal privacy in the digital world should not suffer at the hand \nof unreasonable export laws. Therefore, Congress should take action in \nthe coming year to remove export restrictions on encryption products of \nany strength. I am confident that through cooperation between \nGovernment and industry, encryption can be exported without \ncompromising the legitimate needs of law enforcement and national \nsecurity. A compromise can be crafted if all parties, both private and \npublic, are willing to work together to solve the common goal of \nmaintaining America's national security in the new digital age.\n  4. We should create in law a panel consisting of members of Congress, \nAdministration officials, and leaders in high-technology industries to \naddress the implications of information technology on our society and \nour security. We should also create a new national laboratory for \ninformation technology that will both perform research in this field \nand serve as a forum for further discussions of the issues arising from \ninformation technology.\n  Mr. President, it is this fourth idea--a new panel and a new \nlaboratory--that I would like to discuss today. Why do we need this?\n  We need this, for starters, because the new threat of information \nwarfare requires a new paradigm in which the military must rely like \nnever before on other organizations and institutions to achieve \nsuccess.\n  Even if all of the information safeguards for the Defense \nDepartment's data, equipment, and operations were airtight, that would \nnot be adequate. Currently, more than 95% of all wide-area defense \ntelecommunications travel on commercial circuits and networks. And it \nwould be impossible to replicate that type of capability on our own.\n  Should an electronic attack come, it will likely not be aimed just at \nmilitary targets, but at civilian sectors as well. It is not simply \nthat the private sector relies on the military. The military relies on \nthe private sector.\n  That is one reason we as a government cannot afford to ignore the \ndefense of the public and private sector infrastructure: We cannot do \nour most basic job--protecting national security--without that.\n  In this new world of technology, if one of us gets tripped, we all \nrisk a fall.\n  Our Government, as it is now organized, can scarcely cope with these \nnew challenges. We need to address the development and vulnerability of \nthe American information infrastructure now. The regulatory frameworks \nestablished over the past 60 years for telecommunication, radio and \ntelevision may not, in fact, most likely will not, fit the Information \nEconomy. Existing laws and regulations should be reviewed and revised \nor eliminated to reflect the needs of the new electronic age.\n  As a government, we need to reassess the areas of responsibility of \nour different parts, and the lines of authority that connect them, to \nensure we are best organized to face this threat.\n  More than two dozen federal agencies have either jurisdiction or a \ndirect interest in the regulation of information technology as it \napplies to national security or electronic commerce. The Congress is no \nbetter off. In Congress, some 19 committees are responsible for \nlegislation on the same issues.\n  The Government has much to offer, through our understanding of \nsecurity concepts and technology, along with the vulnerabilities of \ninformation technology and systems. We are strongly committed to share \nthis knowledge with the private sector. Such partnerships are crucial, \nbut there are some pitfalls, and we will need to build a balanced \napproach. For example: We have to be careful not to give the impression \nthat Government wants to increase its involvement in the day-to-day \noperations of individual businesses.\n  This is not at all the case, and few things will drive the private \nsector away like the potential for more Government intrusion and \nregulation.\n  ``Government Knows Best'' is not the message we want to send.\n  As a general principle, Government should step in only when problems \nexceed the capabilities of the private sector and the remedies of the \nmarketplace. However, in cases where there are no reasonable business \nreasons for companies to make preparations, such as to counter a \ncoordinated, simultaneous attack against multiple infrastructures, then \nGovernment should be prepared to provide economic incentives and \nsupport.\n  A natural market exists for security and, ultimately, that will be \nour best course of action: a solution that combines the entrepreneurial \nstrength and energy of the private sector with the national mission of \nthe Government.\n\n[[Page S12362]]\n\n  One cannot overstate how important it is to get the Government-\nindustry relationships right, because without them as a foundation, the \nvalue of all other efforts will be significantly diminished. A \nfundamental challenge in many cases is getting information about \nvulnerabilities and threats itself, and this simply cannot be done \nwithout the foundation of public-private sector information sharing. We \ncannot solve this by unilateral Government efforts. We have to move \ntogether to solve it.\n  Mr. President, it is no surprise that both the Government and private \nsector are finding this difficult and complicated and frustrating. To \ncombat cyber attacks--whether by terrorists, spies, disgruntled \nemployees, pranksters--one needs both technical sophistication and \ncooperation among numerous companies, agencies and nations.\n  It is going to be imperative for the protection of our information \ninfrastructure that the private sector, national security officials, \nand law enforcement work together--not just on this issue, but on \nissues for the future.\n  Many fear these discussions would lead to Government intrusiveness \nand abuse of power. Americans have always had a healthy skepticism \ntowards Government power and our Constitution sets strict limits on \nwhat Government can and cannot do. We are a strong and vibrant nation \ndirectly because we enjoy rights of free speech, free assembly, and \nagainst unreasonable searches and seizures. Information technology can \nallow us greater exercise of those rights. When we examine the security \nof information technology, these rights must remain our guiding \nprinciples, and our Government policies should reflect them.\n  We must get past the suspicion between the private sector and \nGovernment and move forward. The information infrastructure is vital to \nAmerica's defense and to America's economy and we cannot preserve one \nwithout protecting the other.\n  Here we need two things: First, we need a mechanism that transcends \nnarrow organizational politics to bring consensus; and, secondly, we \nneed a facility for advanced research into information technology \nprotection that also provides a venue for constructive and ongoing \ndialog with industry, the Government, and academia.\n  I believe Congress should act as soon as possible to create a blue-\nribbon panel of top federal officials, key leaders from Capitol Hill, \nand experts from the high-technology field to address the issues of \ninformation assurance, infrastructure protection, and encryption that \ncut across committee lines. We need to have a panel that can speak with \nauthority on both politics and policy.\n  From the White House, we need to see a commitment of time, attention, \nand resources at the highest levels.\n  Cabinet officers need to play an active role in shaping the solutions \nthat are going to emerge from such a panel. These issues are \ncomplicated and they have far-reaching implications, so at the end of \nthe day we need to have leaders in their respective areas--Cabinet and \nCabinet-level officials--who are prepared to forge the necessary \ncompromises and make the case to industry and to the public. Congress \nneeds to take a similarly pragmatic approach. Committee chairpersons, \nwith their expertise in different areas and institutional memory, need \nto be on this panel and give it all the attention they would a piece of \nlegislation. But in addition we need to acknowledge the politically \ncharged nature of these issues and be prepared to deal with them. So I \npropose that we not only have representatives by issue area, but \nrepresentatives who are designated to speak for each major faction in \nthe Congress: a representative of the majority in the Senate, and one \nfor the House, a representative of the minority in the Senate, and one \nfor the House, and representatives of the legislative caucuses that \nhave an interest.\n  Clearly Government cannot do this alone. We need the perspective, the \ninsight, and the vision of experts who are part of the developments in \nthe information technology field and who can predict on the basis of \nthat experience where technology is going. We need their expertise and \na willingness to work with their government, for otherwise this problem \nwill only grow worse. The panel I envision must therefore have a strong \ncomponent of private sector experts devoted both to the advancement of \ntechnology and to the security of our country.\n  The complement to this Congressional panel should be a forum where \nGovernment, industry, and academic officials can work on these problems \nin a systematic, confidential, and dispassionate way. I propose that we \nlearn from our experience and look to those models of industry-and-\nGovernment cooperation that have worked in the past.\n  We can learn from agencies like the National Safety Transportation \nBoard, DARPA, and other federally funded research and development \ncenters. Specifically, Congress should pass legislation that would \nenable the President to create a new national laboratory and research \nfacility to address information infrastructure protection. The role and \nmission of such an organization would be to target those specific areas \nthat are now suffering from sporadic, contradictory, or insufficient \nattention.\n  We must have a structure that can address the entire range of \nnational security planning and execution--in other words, threat \nassessment and evaluation, development of requirements, R, \nacquisition and procurement, development of strategy and the conduct of \noperations across the entire spectrum, from large-scale conflict to \npeacekeeping and operations other than war. But this center would also \nhelp develop techniques, policies, and procedures to make civilian and \ncommercial information technologies secure.\n  To accomplish that mission, the information technology laboratory \nwould have to: Support research and development by industry or \nGovernment-industry consortiums that aims to protect our privacy, \nshield our commercial interests, and defend our nation against \ninformation technology threats; ensure that there is a secure conduit \nfor the exchange of information about security threats; provide a forum \nfor developing and managing responses and contingency plans, both \ndirectly and in cooperation with a national command authority.\n  The Information Technology Laboratory would be funded through annual \nappropriations as a Federally Funded Research and Development Center. \nBut it should also be able to establish fee-based contracts with \nagencies of federal, state, and local government as well as \nuniversities for specific services so that budget costs could be kept \nto a minimum.\n  The Information Technology Laboratory could also contract with \nprivate industry to do research and development, while taking special \nprecautions to protect the confidentiality of proprietary data or \ninformation. The laboratory would also report annually to the \nappropriate oversight committees in Congress and the President.\n  In just four years from now, knowledge and information workers will \nmake up one third of all the workers in our multi-trillion dollar \neconomy. We can create a safe corridor for their passage to the next \ncentury. Or we can continue to talk past each other while the \nInformation Superhighway attracts more and more robbers and frauds and \nterrorists.\n  We need to come to this task with a clear sense of purpose and full \nunderstanding of the urgency involved. America has gained much from \ninformation technology, and stands to gain much more as these systems \nmature. Our future depends on the success of this technology.\n  But that success and our security depend on finding the policies and \npractices that will identify and correct vulnerabilities before they \nare exploited. Together, I am certain we can address this problem. In a \nnoble but imperfect democracy such as ours, answers are not impossible, \nthey are only impending. I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto face this challenge. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a great deal has been talked about here \nthis afternoon as to what this Congress and our President will do on \nthe issue of education. I am, once again, pleased to see our President \nengaged and spending time talking about education. He spent so much \ntime skipping class and trying to avoid detention that he failed to \nlearn about what Republicans and the majority here in Congress have \nbeen doing on behalf of education for the last good many months.\n  It is with that in mind that I would like to, for a few moments, talk \nabout what we have done and what is being done. I am pleased that the \nPresident is once again engaged. We finally got his attention in the \nlast week. He is staying in the White House and trying to work with us \nto resolve some of these issues. That is important. It is time that \nCongress adjourn, but most important, we must finish our work before we \ngo.\n  The President did come home on occasion to veto a few bills this \nyear, but he seems to have forgotten them. He seems to have forgotten \nthe Coverdell A+ education bill that he vetoed, which would have \nprovided educational savings accounts, would have allowed parents to \nset aside $2,000 a year per child for educational expenses, and teacher \ntesting and merit pay would reward teachers for their performance in \nthe classroom. That was part of the bill that he vetoed. It also \nincluded dollars to the classroom, which would put money directly from \nthe Federal Government into helping students instead of the \nbureaucrats. It is interesting that my colleagues on the other side, a \nfew moments ago, introduced information about what GAO said. Let me \ntell you what the Federal Government said, what the Department of \nEducation said about its own problems with paperwork and the burning up \nof valuable educational dollars. The U.S. Department of Education \nestimates that it takes approximately 48.6 million paperwork hours--the \nequivalent of almost 25,000 employees working 40 hours a week for a \nfull year--to complete the paperwork involving the administration of \nthe Federal education programs. The Senator from Washington spoke about \nthe amount of time that local units of education use filling out the \npaperwork.\n\n  In my State of Idaho, as is true in Iowa, Ohio or any other State \nacross the Nation, 50 percent of its paperwork burden is directly \nrelated to the 5 percent of the money that it gets. What happened? The \nPresident vetoed it. He came home, focused for a few moments, vetoed \nit, and left town again.\n  What about the tax regarding the College Tuition Program, encouraging \nparents to save for their child's college education? That, too, was \nvetoed by the President.\n  So when this President stands up and says, ``I want billions of \ndollars more for education,'' what he is saying is, ``I want billions \nof dollars more here in Washington to be run through a Federal system \nto be directed out for education,'' while this Senate voted, by a \nmajority, to do quite the opposite--to literally turn the public loose \nto fund education without Federal strings.\n  Eighty-four percent of Federal elementary and secondary education \nfunds are used for instruction, according to the April 1998 report by \nthe U.S. Department of Education. What happened to the other \npercentage? Let's see. I guess that would be 16 percent. What happened? \nOverhead and administration. That is what it cost to get the money out.\n  You see, there is a game played in this town. It is how big you can \nbuild the agency and how many times you can roll the paper before you \nsend the money out.\n  That is exactly what this Congress tried to avoid. That is exactly \nwhat we did avoid with legislation passed by this Senate and passed by \nthe House and vetoed by this President.\n  Now that we are attempting to adjourn our Congress, just in the last \nfew days the President is home back in school, not avoiding classes, \nand he is trying to spend, or spin his story about education.\n  Mr. President, why did you veto all of these productive pieces of \nlegislation that were passed by a majority, a bipartisan majority, in \nCongress? Why did you veto legislation that, when polled, well over 60 \npercent of the American people said it gave more power to the family, \nto the parent, to the local education school board? That is what \nAmerica wants. They don't want 100,000 federally paid-for teachers and \na bureaucracy to go along, and over 20 percent of the money staying \nright here to be spent on thousands and thousands of hours of \npaperwork.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky still has his 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair very kindly. I appreciate it very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12363-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12363-S12364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF SENATE COLLEAGUES\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, as the 105th Congress comes to a close, I \nwant to take a moment to say thank you to my fellow colleagues who, \nlike me, will be retiring this year.\n  I came to the Senate in 1974 with Senators Glenn and Bumpers. It was \na different time, when campaigns were still won by going door to door, \nwhen the Senate itself was much more open to compromise and \nbipartisanship.\n  Despite the changes in the Senate, Senator Bumpers has continued to \nbe a voice for his State, never giving up the fight for something in \nwhich he believed. And when the Senate itself began to listen, they \nbegan to respond. In fact, after fighting 19 years to reform the \nNational Parks concessions operations, he finally won approval of the \nlegislation on last Thursday.\n  And while it's true the Senate long ago lost its reputation as a \nplace of eloquent debate, my colleague from Arkansas has proven time \nand again the power of words with his skillful oratory, whether the \nissue was arms control, education or balancing the budget. In all my \nyears here in Washington, I was never so moved as I was by a speech he \ngave on preserving the Manassas, Virginia, Civil War Battlefield. He \nnot only changed votes, but he reminded his colleagues and the American \npeople that our greatest strength lies in our ability to give voice to \nour beliefs and to our constituent's concerns.\n  Like Mark Twain who came into this world with Halley's comet and left \nthis world with the return, Senator Glenn came into the public eye with \nhis historic orbit around the earth and he will close out his public \ncareer with another historic flight into space. In between, he's \ndemonstrated over and over that he's truly made of the ``right stuff.''\n  As the ``Almanac of American Politics'' wrote, he is ``the embodiment \nof the small town virtues of family, God-fearing religion, duty, \npatriotism and hard work . . .''. And over the years, he has brought \nthe same fight and determination that made him a brilliant fighter \npilot to his efforts to expand educational opportunities, increase \nfunding for scientific research, to clean up nuclear waste sites, \npromote civil rights and to make our government more efficient.\n\n[[Page S12364]]\n\n  Despite their long list of contributions in the Senate, perhaps their \ngreatest contributions to this nation are still to come. Senator \nBumpers has talked about going back to Arkansas to teach and Senator \nGlenn has said once he gets back down to earth, he'll work to steer \nyoung people toward public service. I can't think of a greater honor \nthan to say I've served alongside these two men and shared their vision \nof a better America.\n  I also want to thank my two retiring colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. We may not have always agreed on which road to take, but I \nbelieve we always shared a deep commitment to our country and its \nbetterment. Whether you agree or not with Senator Coats' position on \nthe issues, everyone in this chamber will agree he's willing to roll up \nhis sleeves and do the hard work necessary to accomplish his goals. \nHe's brought the same tenacity to the Senate that found him at three \npercent in the polls when he began his first congressional bid and had \nhim winning by 58 percent on election day. He got that win the old-\nfashioned way, organizing block by block and pressing his case one-on-\none.\n  Senator Kempthorne has only been a part of this institution for just \none term, but he has already proven that he can work with his \ncolleagues to pass laws, like the unfunded mandates bill, in a place \nwhere it's often easier to move mountains than a piece of legislation. \nThe Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996 was a perfect example of his \nability to bring together scientists, activists on both sides of the \nissue, and public health experts to craft legislation that each one had \na stake in seeing succeed. So while he may have spent just a short \nwhile in these Halls, he demonstrated that it is only through \ncompromise that we can achieve solutions in the best interest of the \nnation.\n  So Mr. President, let me tell my fellow retirees what a privilege it \nhas been to serve with you over the years and how grateful I am for \nyour commitment to public service and the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12363-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12364-S12365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to make a few brief remarks, share a \nfew thoughts, and express my heart felt thanks to a number of \nindividuals who have made my life in the Senate a little bit easier and \na little bit more enjoyable than it otherwise would have been.\n  I have been privileged to serve in this body since December 28, 1974. \nAs I look back, it is amazing how much progress we have made as a \ncountry during that period. The average life expectancy in this country \nhas increased by 4 years. The average per capita income after adjusting \nfor inflation, has risen 40 percent during this time period. The \nportion of adults with at least a high school diploma has risen from \nabout two-thirds of adults to more than four-fifths. The percentage of \nadults with at least a bachelor's degree has risen from 14 percent to \n25 percent.\n  So we are living longer and healthier lives, we are wealthier, and we \nare better educated.\n  And the quality of life has improved in many other ways as well. We \nhave an almost unlimited ability to communicate. The developments with \ncomputers in recent years have been almost breathtaking. Children \nunderstand computers at an early age--often before they even start \nschool. The percentage of homes with computers keeps rising. We have \ncell phones and laptops and cable TV and satellite dishes and fax \nmachines. Our access to information is better and faster than ever.\n  We have opportunities to travel more, live in bigger homes, and eat \nmore nutritious meals. We spend more on entertainment than ever.\n  But Mr. President, our challenges are probably greater than ever.\n  I entered the Senate at the beginning of a period of deep cynicism \nand distrust of government, having just come through the Vietnam war \nand Watergate. We have always had a very healthy distrust of government \nin this country, but 1974 was an especially troublesome time. And I \nhave witnessed a fascinating national debate on the role of government \nduring the period since. The cynicism from Watergate evolved into a \ncrisis of confidence in our country, and a growing feeling by some \nthrough the 1980's that government was the major source of many \nproblems in our society, not the solution.\n  But the debate of the role of government has continued to evolve. I \nthink we are at the point today where there is a fairly broad consensus \namong Americans about certain aspects of government.\n  There is a consensus about certain things that Americans want from \ntheir government--a strong defense, the best educational system in the \nworld, managing the economy in an efficient way, including balanced \nbudgets, low inflation, low interest rates, low unemployment, and the \nleast amount of taxation and regulation possible. Americans want fair \nrules in the workplace and the marketplace, from family leave to fair \ntrade to basic consumer protection. They want an adequate \ninfrastructure to sustain a successful and growing economy. And they \nexpect minimal safety and health protections, from law enforcement to \nfood and drug safety to providing health care for the elderly and the \npoor.\n  I have found that almost all of my colleagues want these things as \nwell. We often differ on the best approach, or the best philosophy, for \nmeeting these goals and providing what our constituents want, but we \nare all basically after the same things.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of aisle still use the \nrhetoric from the 1980's about being for lower taxes and smaller \ngovernment. Who could be against that? But most of these same \ncolleagues are also for all of the things I just mentioned. They would \nagree with me that these are all things that our constituents demand \nand expect us to address. We all want the smallest government possible, \nbut we want government to deliver on all of these things. So it is a \nchallenge for all of us.\n  And the future challenges for the next Congress and beyond will be \neven more complex. I mentioned earlier that we are living longer. The \nstandard retirement age has not gone up since I came to the Senate. In \nfact, the average private sector retirement age has gone down. But we \nlive longer. The percentage of the population age 65 and older is up to \nabout 13 percent today, and is projected to continue to grow. During my \ntenure in the Senate, I have seen federal spending on Social Security \ngrow from $64 to $380 billion. I have seen Medicare spending increase \nfrom $13 to $220 billion. And roughly half of Medicaid spending, which \nhas gone from $7 to $100 billion in the budget, is attributable to \nnursing home care. These three areas alone--Social Security, Medicare, \nand Medicaid--have gone from about 25 percent of the total budget to \nroughly 42 percent of the total budget. Without question, the major \nbudget issue in the next few years is how we deal with the costs \nassociated with the elderly.\n  And it is a quality issue as well. Many of the same trends which are \ncurrently affecting managed care in the private sector will certainly \naffect the quality of medical care received by the elderly. I wish we \nhad made more progress in these areas before my time in the Senate \nexpired. I wish my colleagues well in addressing these issues and urge \nthem to do so earlier rather than later. I know many colleagues share \nmy sentiments.\n  The other area I would urge my colleagues to address is the financing \nand operation of campaigns. Here is an area that has changed \ndramatically during my 24 years. When I announced my retirement from \nthe Senate, I mentioned the two ``M's,''--Money and Meanness--as major \nreasons why I chose not to run again. Now that we are in the midst of \nthe current campaign season, I believe even stronger about this issue. \nAs reported in the newspaper yesterday, PACs have collected almost $360 \nmillion in the last 18 months. We all like to say that the money does \nnot influence how we vote and how we think, but, truthfully, it is a \nmatter of degree. There needs to be a stronger ethic of avoiding even \nthe appearance of a conflict of interest. We need more of that in \npolitics--much more of it. Senators who solicit campaign contributions \nand then within a very short period of time are casting votes and \nmaking decisions on matters which greatly affect both the contributors \nand the Senator's constituents place themselves in very difficult \nsituations. It goes to the heart of our system of Democracy, and \nwhether it works or\n\n[[Page S12365]]\n\nwill continue to work. There has got to be a better way. There are also \na lot of ideas around here on how to make a better way. I can only hope \nsome of these ideas are translated into law in the very near future.\n  So, Mr. President, I wish may colleagues well. I will miss the \ninstitution dearly. I will miss the daily interaction with my \ncolleagues, many of whom have become such dear friends to me. Let me \nthank you for your friendship. And lastly, let me thank staff. My \npersonal office staff, both here and in the state offices, have been \nlike family to me. I have tried to treat them that way, and it has been \nmutual. The committee staff and floor staff I have been privileged to \nwork with over the years have all been great to me as well--they make \nthis place run and make us all look good from time to time. I thank \nthem all for their support and service to our country. This country \nwould not be nearly what it is without office, committee and floor \nstaff. As I leave the Senate, please know that I will keep you all in \nmy thoughts and prayers, and wish all of you good luck and happiness in \nthe years to come.\n  Mr. President, for perhaps the last time, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

But one of the \nprivileges of serving in this body is serving with some of the best men \nand women I have ever had the opportunity to work with in my life, and \nI count among that group the Senator from Kentucky, Senator Ford.\n  I would like to say, as he leaves the Senate, I thank him for his \npublic service to our country. He, because he served in this body, has \ncontributed to the well-being of America. We are going to miss him a \ngreat deal. I expect he will not be going far. I know he is going \nfishing, and I know he is going to be involved in public service in his \nown way, dealing with educating young people about civic \nresponsibilities and about government.

Mr. President, as we started to hear this debate this \nmorning, and talking about different ways of accomplishing things here \non a nonpartisan basis, it started off a little on the partisan side. \nEducation is very dear to the hearts of all of us because all of us, \nprobably, have had a connection with kids and so have been involved in \neducation. I still have one going to school. But to hear the other side \ntalk, we have done nothing about that.\n  You know, we have increased the funds for special education since the \nRepublicans took over in 1994.\n  We passed education savings accounts that would empower parents to \nmake choices for their own children with regard to books and computers \nand this type stuff. That was a bad idea to the President. He vetoed \nit. I guess he wants to empower bureaucracy rather than empower \nparents.\n  We passed the opportunity scholarships, a highly popular program here \nin Washington, DC, that would allow parents more choice of where to \nsend their kids to school. That was vetoed.\n  We passed a $2.74 billion education bill for classrooms, and we \nguaranteed that 95 percent of it would get to kids. That met with stiff \nopposition from the President.\n  Encouraging States to implement teacher testing and merit pay, what \nis wrong with that? That got vetoed by the President.\n  Strengthening safe schools, the antigun program--that was vetoed.\n  Tax relief to employers who provide workers education assistance, \nfolks we are retraining in this rapidly changing world of technology? \nVetoed by the President.\n  I have to look and say all at once: 2 plus 2 is not making 5, when we \nstart talking about education and who wants to do what for whom.\n  I just noticed here, earlier this year my good friend from \nMassachusetts said we have ``a relationship with Federal, State, and \nlocal community levels in terms of education; it is a partnership.'' \nTell me how good this partnership is. The Federal Government only \nprovides 7 percent of the money but 50 percent of the paperwork. That \nshould not surprise you a lot if you have been around government at any \ntime.\n  In 1969, our expenditure was $68 billion; in 1996, it was $564 \nbillion; and yet even by their own admission, education continues to \nstruggle and go down. That is the point I wanted to make here. I would \nsay whenever we start looking at education, the answer lies in the \nrealization that you cannot kill or do away with an idea. Ideas rule \nthe world.

Mr. President, I wanted, today, to come over and talk \nabout education. I have come back to town to help in some of these \nnegotiations to try to complete the session, but upon hearing Senator \nKennedy this morning, I felt compelled to come over and speak. I have \nseveral ideas I want to talk about. I would like to first talk about \nwhy we are talking about education. Here we are, 2 days before the \nsession ends. In fact, as of last Friday, in the budget negotiations, \nno one at the White House had brought up education at all. Why suddenly \ndo we have the focus on education?\n  I would like to explain why this focus has come about and what I \nthink it is trying to hide. I would like to talk about Senator \nKennedy's education proposals. I would like to talk about the budget \ndebate we have before us. I\n\n[[Page S12366]]\n\nwould like to talk about the failure of our current system. And then I \nwould like to talk about how we ought to change it. That is an awful \nlot of subjects, but having listened to Senator Kennedy, I feel \ncompelled to speak a little on this subject.\n  I would say this is a subject I know something about. I taught for 12 \nyears at Texas A prior to coming to Congress. In fact, I often say \nthat I taught economics for 12 years at Texas A and I have been \nteaching it in Washington, now, for 20 years. You will not be surprised \nto hear me say my students at Texas A were a lot smarter than the \nstudents I have now. And, also, they were a lot more interested in \nlearning. I say that partially in jest.\n  So when I talk about education, it is something I know something \nabout, because I have had the great experience of people calling me \n``Teacher.'' I don't know of any title--maybe ``Rabbi,'' maybe \n``Preacher,'' maybe ``Mr. President''--but there are not many titles \nthat are more important than being called ``Teacher.''\n  First of all, I want to remind everybody, we were busy negotiating on \nthe budget all last week and up through Friday nobody raised the \neducation issue. And why should they? The President, in his fiscal year \n1999 education appropriation, requested $32 billion. In the spending \nbill that we currently have pending in the Senate, we provide $32 \nbillion. So it was not surprising that after a week's negotiation in \ntrying to come together on this budget, there had been relatively \nlittle discussion about education, because the President had proposed \n$32 billion of spending, we had provided $32 billion, and while I am \ngoing to talk a little bit about the differences of how we provide it, \nthe basic point was, this was not a budget issue.\n  But over the weekend, in his radio show, and then as his \nrepresentatives appeared on television on Sunday, suddenly the \nadministration has opened a massive new education front. They are \nsaying this Congress has not done enough for education, they are \nunhappy about what the Congress has done in education, and they want \nmore. Why is this happening? Sadly, I am here to tell you that it is a \nsmokescreen to cover up a robbery. There is a robbery underway on \nCapitol Hill right now. The working men and women of America are in \ndanger of having $25 billion stolen from them this year and in the last \nweek of Congress.\n  I have to say, in a city which is marked by cynicism, it is one of \nthe most cynical acts that I have ever observed. I want to be \nespecially critical of the President of the United States on this \nissue, something I have not made a habit of doing.\n  The President, in his State of the Union Address--the Presiding \nOfficer was there, and I am sure if the American people remember \nanything any political figure has said about anything other than \nscandal this year, they will remember that the President, in his State \nof the Union Address--I ask unanimous consent for 25 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from Illinois \nis waiting to speak. I, by consent, am waiting to speak as well. That \nbrings it to 30 minutes the total requested by the Senator from Texas?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Excuse me, I didn't hear, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will that bring to 30 minutes the time requested by the \nSenator from Texas?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I didn't request any time. I don't know where the 5 \nminutes came from.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thought I heard the Senator request 25 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I was told by the Chair there was 5 additional minutes. I \ndon't know if the world comes to an end--\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have no objection. I thought he asked for 25 additional \nminutes. I have no objection to 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Going back to my robbery occurring on Capitol Hill, the \nreason it seems to me we are suddenly discussing something that was not \nan issue all last week is because there is a real issue now that the \nWhite House doesn't want to talk about, and that real issue is that we \nare in the process of seeing a demand from the White House that the \nCongress spend $25 billion that was never in the President's budget.\n  Many of you will remember in the State of the Union Address when the \nPresident stood up and said, ``Save Social Security first; save every \npenny of the surplus; don't spend any of it; don't give any of it back \nin tax cuts; save Social Security first.'' Quite frankly, Mr. \nPresident, I thought it was a good idea.\n  I have opposed efforts by some in my own party to go ahead and cut \ntaxes now rather than waiting until next year when we can fix Social \nSecurity, I believe, permanently and then debate a tax cut. But what \nhappened is that in January, February, March and all through the \nspring, the President said, don't increase spending and don't cut \ntaxes. Then suddenly during the summer, his message started to change, \nwhich was the first giveaway. The message suddenly became: Don't cut \ntaxes, and he stopped talking about spending.\n  Now the President is demanding in the final days of this session that \nwe spend an additional $20 billion to $25 billion, every penny of which \nwould come out of the surplus, and every penny of which would come out \nof Social Security. So a President who threatened to veto a tax cut \nthat would have taken $6.6 billion away from the surplus is now \ndemanding that Congress, as a price to be able to finish business and \nadjourn, spend an additional $25 billion.\n  We had a surplus for the first time since 1969 as of October 1. Today \nis October 12, and so far, if the President's requests are met, we are \nspending an additional $2 billion a day. In other words, this is going \nto be the shortest recorded surplus in American history, and I am \nconcerned about it.\n  Let me talk a little bit about education, since the President has \nraised the subject. First of all, in Senator Kennedy's remarks today, \nwe heard the same old song that people have sung in Washington since \n1960. That basic siren song is: If we just had a little more money, we \ncould make it work; that the only thing wrong with education in America \nis we don't have enough money, and if we spent more money and we let \nWashington tell you how to spend it, everything would be great.\n  Let me just review a few facts and figures in response to Senator \nKennedy.\n  First of all, in 1969, we spent $68.5 billion on education in \nAmerica. Today, we are spending $564.2 billion on public education, K \nthrough 12.\n  What has happened during that period? As spending has grown almost \n1,000 percent, SAT scores have stagnated, reading scores have declined \nand American students have moved from the top of the list in math and \nscience to either the bottom or near the bottom in both math and \nscience. Today, American students on international tests rank last in \nphysics; they rank next to last in mathematics.\n  When you look at those scores you say, ``Well, if we just had more \nmoney, we could change that.'' But I remind my colleagues, we have \nincreased spending during the period where these scores have plummeted \nfrom $68.5 billion to $564.2 billion.\n  One of our problems is we spend the money so inefficiently. Listen to \nthese numbers: For every dollar we spend on education in Washington, \nDC, 15 cents never gets out of Washington; 15 cents stays here in our \nmassive Federal bureaucracy; 48 cents ends up going to bureaucrats \nbetween here and the classroom; and 37 cents out of every dollar we \nspend in the name of education in Washington, DC, actually gets to the \nclassroom for actual instruction, providing facilities, or providing \nthat teacher in that classroom.\n  No wonder that we rank last in physics and next to last in \nmathematics when our current program, which Senator Kennedy helped \nbuild and which he loves, gets 37 cents out of every dollar we spend in \nWashington into the classroom.\n  We are hearing today that what we really need to do is we need to do \nsomething about class size.\n  First of all, I think it is obvious to anybody that you would rather \nyour child be in a small class than a big class. But if you can see \nthis chart, what has happened since 1960 is that class sizes have gone \ndown dramatically.\n\n[[Page S12367]]\n\n  The pupil-teacher ratio for public K through 12 education was 25.8 to \n1 in 1960 when SAT scores were close to their maximum they ever \nachieved. In 1996, there was 17.1 to 1 or, in other words, a 51-percent \ndecrease compared to today s level.\n  I think lowering the class size is a wonderful thing, but I simply \npoint out that contrary to all the rhetoric about how perfect the world \nwould be if it were lowered, we have lowered it by 51 percent in the \nlast 36 years, and the net result has been a dramatic decline.\n  Is the Senator telling me that my 25 minutes is up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I asked for 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, it was limited to 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent that I may have an additional 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, my point is that while declining pupil-\nteacher ratio is a wonderful thing, and we would all like to have our \nown children given the maximum instruction in the most intense way, the \nplain truth is that in the last 36 years, we have had a dramatic \ndecline in the ratio of pupils to teacher while results have declined.\n  This gets me to what the real debate is on education. Obviously, the \nreal debate is not money. The President requested $32 billion; the \nSenate bill provides $32 billion. The debate is about who is going to \nspend the money. Republicans have proposed something that sounds \nrevolutionary in Washington, but in America it sounds eminently \nreasonable; and that is, except for that money which is targeted to \nthings like special education, we want to give the bulk of the money \ndirectly to school systems so that local teachers, local administrators \nand local school boards can set priorities for using money, so that if \nin my hometown of College Station we think the answer is a lower pupil-\nteacher ratio, we can use the money for that purpose; if we think the \nanswer is something else, we can use it for that purpose.\n  Another thing we are hearing about is building schools. I know our \ndear colleague who is presiding said that a bad idea never dies, that \nyou can't kill an idea with facts. And I understand this will not kill \nthat idea. We will be talking about it for the next 10 years. But I \nwant to point out something which shows, I think clearly, why the \nFederal Government should not be setting policy where we have Members \nof the Senate voting for education policy in schools we have never put \nour foot in, children we have never personally met, families where we \ndo not know their situation.\n  What I have here is the population of enrollment in K through 12. I \ndo not want to draw on this chart which I got from somebody else, but I \nwant you to look right here where we are in 1998. We have just come off \na very rapid increase in students, but we are now in a period where the \npopulation of students in K through 12 is flattening out.\n  Doesn't it strike you as interesting that we are talking about the \nFederal Government mandating that local communities spend more of our \nmoney and theirs on schools at the very time where it is clear that in \nthe past 10 years our problem has been school construction, but as we \nlook at the future it is obvious that the population of students is \nbeginning to flatten out? That is typical of the Federal Government. \nThat is what happens when you have people in Washington setting \neducation policy for students in College Station--when only two Members \nof the Senate have ever been in a school in College Station, and they \nare the two Senators from Texas.\n  What is the difference between what the President wants to do and \nwhat the Congress wants to do? The biggest difference is, the Congress \nwants to spend the same $32 billion but let local school boards, local \nparents, local teachers decide--do they want to build more schools, do \nthey want to do something about the pupil-teacher ratio, do they want \nto buy computers. We want them to decide.\n  Finally, let me put this chart up here and just remind anyone who is \ninterested in this debate that this Congress has been very active on \neducation matters, that, first of all, we have the $32 billion \nappropriation bill--the same amount the President asked for; it is just \nspent differently. More of it is spent locally and not in Washington. \nWe happen to believe that is better. The President thinks it is not \nbetter.\n  But rather than debating us on the issue--because I am sure someone \nat the White House has done a poll or focus group and they have \ndiscovered what we know, and that is, parents in College Station think \nthey know a little bit more about their children's needs than we know \nin Washington--so rather than debate those, the President is now saying \nthat we are shortchanging education.\n  The truth is, we have provided every penny the President asked for, \nroughly $32 billion--both the request and appropriation--it is just \nthat we are letting local school boards and local teachers spend it. \nThe President would spend it here in Washington.\n  But finally, before my time runs out again, I remind my colleagues \nthat we have done quite a bit on education in this Congress. First of \nall, we passed a bill that provided education savings accounts which \nlet parents set aside up to $2,000 a year which they could use for \ntutors, they could use to send their children to summer school \nenrichment programs, they could use for afterschool programs; and, yes, \nif they chose to send their children to parochial or private schools, \nthey could do it. And what happened? Vetoed by the President. It did \nnot represent the teachers union agenda and so the President vetoed it.\n  We provided literacy funding. The President vetoed it.\n  We had a merit pay system for teachers. Can you imagine paying good \nteachers better than we pay bad teachers? Can you imagine having a \nsystem where you would actually pay a teacher more if they did a better \njob of teaching? Well, we could imagine it, but the President and the \nteachers union could not imagine it, nor could they tolerate it, so the \nPresident vetoed it.\n  We provided a school choice system for low-income families so that \nworking families in cities like Washington could do what President \nClinton did, and that is, they could choose to send their children to \nprivate schools if they chose to. But the President vetoed it.\n  We provided tax relief for parents whose kids used a State prepaid \ntuition plan. This is one of the most exciting new developments around \nthe country where if you want your child to go to Texas A is \nyour dream--you have to do two things: One, you set up a program and \nyou pay in advance and pay off the tuition, and, obviously, you get a \nbig discount if you start when your child is 6 months old or before \nthey are born; and the second thing they have to do is get in. But we \nhad a system to make it easier for working parents who had the big \ndream to realize it. The President vetoed it.\n  We had a system for tax relief for employer-provided education \nassistance. Employers all over the country are saying, ``Our kids do \nnot have the skills we need.'' So we had a better idea in Congress. We \nsaid, OK, if you want to send your employees back to school, to junior \ncollege or technical school, or to the University of Missouri, or \nanywhere, you can do it on a tax-free basis because you are investing \nin the future of America. And guess what? The President vetoed it.\n  And finally, our major initiative of this Congress--for the first \ntime since I have been in Congress, we have been successful in doing \nsomething that I came to Congress to try to do, and that is, to get the \nFederal Government out of the business of dictating education policy to \nlocal school boards. We, for the first time ever, passed a provision \nthat would allow local school boards to take the money and spend it as \nthey believed to be in the interest of their children.\n  Maybe people in Washington know better about what children should do \nand take; but it is interesting, when you ask them, ``Well, if you know \nso much about kids in the elementary school at College Hills in College \nStation in the first grade class, tell us their names,'' they don't \nknow them. But they think they know an awful lot about what should be \ndone.\n  We believe that local people should set priorities. We passed a bill \nto do\n\n[[Page S12368]]\n\nthat. The President threatened to veto it.\n  So my final message is, Mr. President, first of all, your \nadministration did not even raise education until Friday. We have been \nnegotiating for a week. This is a ruse to cover up an effort by this \nadministration to bust its own budget and to spend Social Security \nmoney. That is what this is about.\n  Secondly, the President proposed $32 billion for educational \nappropriations. We have provided $32 billion for education, but we have \nprovided it so that local school districts make more decisions and \nWashington makes fewer.\n  So if the President wants to debate, let's debate about the real \nissue. The real issue is not how much money is spent, it is who is \ndoing the spending.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, am I correct in assuming I am recognized \nunder the previous unanimous consent order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12365-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12368-S12369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE BUDGET AND PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the Senator \nfrom Texas. He is always interesting in his presentations. During my \npresentation, I will take issue with a number of the comments he has \nmade.\n  At the start, I want to indicate it is not, in my judgment, the case \nthat this issue of education has just recently been raised in recent \ndays. The last few days, certainly, have included a lot of references \nto education by the President and by others, but going back to January \nand February of this year, the President and Members of Congress on \nthis side of the aisle were pushing very hard for education changes \nthat we think would strengthen the school systems and strengthen \nopportunity for education for all children in this country.\n  I want to speak more generally, first, and then I will address a \ncouple of those issues. I am enormously disappointed that we come to \nthe middle of October in this session of Congress, the 105th Congress, \nand find that at the end of this long, arduous Congress, we have half a \ndozen, maybe a dozen people somewhere in a room--Lord only knows where \nthe room is--negotiating a third to half of the Federal budget in \nappropriations bills that the Congress didn't get completed.\n  First of all, in this year, the Congress passed no budget. It is the \nfirst time, as I understand it, since 1974--no budget. The requirement \nis that the Congress shall pass a budget by April 15. This Congress \ndidn't pass a budget. This Congress, by its inaction, said, no, we \ndon't think there ought to be a budget. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, because the Congress didn't even bother to pass a budget, it \ndidn't pass a good number of its appropriations bills. So we came to \nthe end of the fiscal year, months after when the appropriations bills \nshould have been completed, many months after the budget should have \nbeen passed, and the Congress had to pass a continuing resolution to \nkeep the government operating. Then we have this closed-door bunch of \nfolks in a room making deals on how to resolve these final issues.\n  During this Congress, at a time when no budget was enacted and a good \nmany appropriations bills were not completed, the Congress said no to \ncampaign finance reform, not once, not twice, a good number of times. \nNo, we don't want to do campaign finance reform. They said, no, we \ndon't want to do HMO or a Patients' Bill of Rights reforming the \nmanaged care system and providing certain rights to patients in this \ncountry. They said no to tobacco reform, don't want to do that; no to \nthe education proposals offered in the President's budget calling for \nreduction in class size.\n  Incidentally, I take issue with the charts used moments ago, and I \nguess most parents who have kids in school will take issue with that \nchart, suggesting somehow that classroom sizes are decreasing rather \nthan increasing. I think most parents understand that is not the case \nin their schools. It is not unusual for kids to be going to school with \n22, 24, 28, 30 children in their class. The question is, Does that make \na difference? Does it make a difference for a teacher when there are 15 \nin the class versus 30 in the class? Does it make a difference in terms \nof the personal attention a teacher can devote to children with 30 kids \nin a class versus 15 to 18? The answer is, of course.\n  This Congress, in passing no budget and missing most of its \nappropriations bill, said no to campaign finance reform, no to tobacco, \nno to Patients' Bill of Rights, no to the education proposal offered by \nthe President on school construction and reduction in class size.\n  In the old western movies you will recall the folks that rode \nthemselves into a box canyon, took their hat off and scratched their \nheads wondering why they were being attacked on all sides. Because they \nroad into a boxed canyon is why they are under attack. That is exactly \nwhat happened in this Congress.\n  Is it surprising that a Congress that doesn't pass a budget and \ndoesn't finish its appropriations bills finds itself today, on Monday, \nOctober 12, in a situation where we are scrambling, trying to figure \nout who is doing what with whom, to determine what kind of spending we \nhave in dozens and dozens and dozens of areas? Does it surprise anybody \nwe have this kind of a mess at the end of this session? I don't think \nso.\n  The previous speaker just spoke of a robbery. He used the term \n``robbery'' to describe the amount of money that some are proposing to \nbe offered to deal with certain education issues. I personally think it \nis a significant and exciting and wonderful investment in the young \nchildren of our country to invest in education. That is not a robbery. \nThat is a remarkably effective investment for this country.\n\n  Investment in health care is not a robbery. That is a remarkable \ninvestment for the people of this country.\n  How about for family farmers? Part of this debate is what we do for \nfamily farmers in the middle of a farm crisis. No one should think that \nwould be a robbery, to take some funds during the middle of a farm \ncrisis and say to family farmers when prices collapse and you are down \nand out, we want to give you a helping hand to help you up and help get \nyou through this tough time. That is the issue here. The issue is what \nare our priorities?\n  Let me give an example of a robbery. Yes, there are robberies taking \nplace. I understand there is a tax extender bill that some in Congress \nare trying to slip in, another $500 million little tax incentive for \nsome of the biggest economic interests to move their jobs overseas, \nmake it a little sweeter deal. We have a perverse incentive in our Tax \nCode to say if you want to move American jobs overseas, we will pay you \nfor it, we will give you a tax break. Just take those good old American \njobs, shut your plants, move them overseas, and we will give you a tax \nbreak. Talk about perversity. We have people working to try to juice \nthat up, increase the tax break. That is a robbery. It robs America of \njobs it needs, it robs us of the revenue we ought to have to invest in \nkids and invest in health care.\n  The point is, priorities. What are our priorities? What do we think \nis important? At the start of this century, if you lived in America you \nwere expected to live an average of 48 years of age. Almost 100 years \nhave elapsed and now if you live in this country you are expected, \nperhaps, to live to be 78. Forty-eight to 78--30 years added to the \nlifespan of the average American. Is that success? Yes, I think so. You \ncould solve all the Social Security problems and all the Medicare \nproblems, all the financing of those issues could be solved if you \nsimply take the life expectancy back to the 1940s or the 1920s or the \n1900s. However, for a range of reasons, life expectancy has increased \ndramatically in our country in one century.\n  We have invested an enormous amount in health care research, National \nInstitutes of Health. I am one, and some of my colleagues have joined \nme, who wants to increase the investment in health research. We know 50 \nyears ago if someone had a bad heart, bad knee, bad hip or cataracts, \nthey wouldn't be able to see, they wouldn't be able to walk, and they \nwould probably die after a heart attack. Now they have knee surgery, \nget a new hip, get their heart muscle and arteries unplugged, have \ncataract surgery, and they come to a meeting in that small\n\n[[Page S12369]]\n\ntown and feel like a million dollars. All of that is possible because \nof research, an expenditure in health care in this country. It is \nremarkable. It has been remarkably effective. The same is true with \neducation.\n  My colleague from Illinois is going to follow me on the floor. He \nwill remember--and I have told my colleagues this on previous \noccasions--he will remember Claude Pepper, who served with us in the \nU.S. House. The first time I went to Claude Pepper's office, I saw two \npictures behind his chair. One was Orville and Wilbur Wright making the \nfirst airplane flight; it was autographed to Claude Pepper. Orville \nautographed the picture before he died. And then a photograph of Neil \nArmstrong standing on the moon, and that photograph was autographed to \nCongressman Pepper.\n  I thought, what is the interval between leaving the ground to fly, \nand flying to the moon? What is that interval? It is the most \nremarkable investment in human potential and in education compared to \nanywhere else on Earth. All of the kids that went to our school, that \nbecame the best scientists, the best engineers, the best at whatever \nthey could be the best at, and we discovered we could develop the \ntechnology, through research, to learn how to fly, learn how to fly all \nthe way to the moon. And standing on everyone's shoulders with \naccomplishment after accomplishment, we have now understood that \nvirtually anything is possible. That comes from massive investment in \neducation. That is what the interval in the two pictures told me--that \ninvesting in America's children in education has paid dividends far \nbeyond our wildest imagination.\n  That is why I come here today.\n  Let me make one additional point with respect to family farmers. I \nhave talked about investment in health care and education. Investment \nin America's family farmers is also one of the best investments our \ncountry has ever made. We have the best food in the world for the \nlowest percent of disposable income anywhere on the Earth. Who produces \nthat food? A lot of families living out there in the country, by \nthemselves, taking risks that almost no one else takes--the risk that \nthey might lose everything they have, this spring, this summer, this \nfall if a seed doesn't grow, or if a seed grows and is destroyed by \nnature, or if it grows and is not destroyed and they harvest it and \ntake it to the elevator and it is worth nothing. These family farmers \njust inherit, by the nature of what they do, the most significant risk \nyou can imagine.\n  That is why this country, for 60 or 70 years, has said we want to try \nto help farmers when we have these price depressions, we want to build \na bridge to help them over the price valleys. That is what this fight \nhas been about in recent days here in Congress. That is what the \nPresident's veto is about--about trying to get this country to say, \nduring a time of severe crisis in family farming, during a time of \nabject price collapse, where the price of wheat has gone down 60 \npercent in 2 years--our farmers in North Dakota have lost 98 percent of \ntheir income in 1 year alone. Ask yourself, in any city, on any block, \nany occupation, what would happen to you if you lost 98 percent of your \nincome? Would you be in a severe crisis? Despite that, what do we do \nabout that? Can we extend a helping hand? Can we say, during these \ntough times, that we want to help you over this valley because we want \nyou in our future?\n  Family farmers matter to this country. If we lose family farmers, we \nwill have lost something about ourselves that is very important--broad-\nbased economic ownership, with families living on the land and \nproducing America's foodstuffs. That is what the fight is about. I am \nnot saying one side is all right and the other side is all wrong. But I \nam saying to those who say that farmers aren't worth it at this point, \njust let them float in some mythical free market, that we just don't \nhave the money, or those who perhaps would say if you use the money to \nsave family farmers, it is ``robbery''--I don't understand that.\n  This, after all, is about priorities. What are our priorities? What \nis important to us? A hundred years from now, everybody in this room \nwill likely be dead. The only way anybody might determine about our \nvalue system as a people is to look at how we chose to spend our \nresources. What did we think was important? Education? Family farmers? \nDid we think it was important to deal with health care? What were our \npriorities?\n  President Clinton, at the start of this year, asked for the education \npriorities dealing with school construction and class size. He asked, \nat the start of this year, to deal with health care issues--Medicare, \nmanaged care, and the Patients' Bill of Rights. He asked, at the start \nof this year, for a tobacco reform bill. He asked, at the start of this \nyear, for campaign finance reform.\n  Sadly, we now come to the 12th hour and we have a bunch of folks \nsitting in a room somewhere trying to negotiate probably a third of the \nFederal budget, or a third of the Federal spending, by themselves. I \njust think that is a terrible way for Congress to conduct its affairs. \nMy hope is that when all of these fights are done and the dust has \nsettled, we will have achieved a result that says the priorities for us \nat this point are to try to save family farmers during a time of \ncrisis, the priorities for us are to invest in our kids and our \nschools, and the priorities for us are to decide that, in the future, \nwe ought to do our work in Congress the way the law describes. Let's \npass a budget, pass some bills, do the regular order, and not end up \nanother session the way this session appears to be ending.\n  Mr. President, I know that the Senator from Illinois is waiting to \nspeak. Let me also say, as I conclude, that the Senator from Illinois \nhas been very active on the issue of tobacco legislation, as well as \neducation issues. I think he has been a remarkably effective addition \nto the U.S. Senate. It has been my pleasure to serve with him in the \n105th Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me say at the outset to my friend from \nNorth Dakota, whom I served with in the House of Representatives, he \nhas been not only our floor manager of debate during the course of this \n105th Congress, but he has also been an active leader for his State. \nThe leadership he showed along with Senator Conrad, as well as Senators \nDaschle and Johnson of South Dakota, during the crisis that faced their \nStates earlier when they dealt with floods and fires--it seems like all \nthe furies at once--was the type of leadership that is extraordinary, \nand I thank him for that.\n\n  I know we are going to have even more discussion in the days ahead \nabout the current agricultural crisis in his State. I see his \ncolleague, Senator Conrad, on the floor and I know that they are going \nto carefully monitor the debate going on now about an omnibus spending \nbill to try to do their best to help struggling farmers in their \nState--and, I add, in my State of Illinois, which has its own share of \ndifficulties.\n  I have brought to the floor here a volume, which those of us in the \nSenate know very well, and perhaps those in the gallery may recognize, \nand those at home may find new. It is ``The History of the U.S. \nSenate'' compiled by one of our colleagues here, Senator Robert Byrd. \nHe is the preeminent Senate historian. He has written this history to \ntry to capture what the Senate means and what it has meant to the \nUnited States. I have seen it several times, and I have read portions \nof it. I am determined that I am going to finish it from cover to cover \nsoon. I looked through it to try to remember if there was another \nSenate that you could point to that was parallel to what we are seeing \nhere today.\n  This is the conclusion of my first 2 years in the U.S. Senate, \nrepresenting my home State of Illinois. Prior to that, I served for 14 \nyears in the House of Representatives. I am no stranger to Capitol \nHill, but I am a newcomer to this body. I am surprised that I stand \nhere today on October 12, some 12 days into the new fiscal year, and \nsay that we are still here. We were supposed to be gone, supposed to \nhave finished our\n\n[[Page S12370]]\n\nwork and gone home. Unfortunately, we have not.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota indicated, there is a great deal \nstill being debated. The size and scope of this debate is mind-\nboggling--that we would be talking at this moment about still having \nunresolved questions concerning about a third to a half of the Federal \nbudget that we appropriate.\n  How can we be in on October 12 still talking about these things? It \nis because several things have occurred, which are not historic and not \nin a positive way. This Congress, this House and this Senate, under \nRepublican leadership, failed to pass a budget resolution for the first \ntime in 24 years. So what? Well, the budget resolution is supposed to \nbe the game plan--not the President's game plan, but Congress' game \nplan--of how we will spend money and reach certain budgetary goals, as \nwell as policy goals.\n  I can recall, in the 16 years I have been on the Hill, that there \nwere long and arduous and heated debates about our goals. We would get \nthem out of the way and pass the budget resolution, usually around the \ndate it was due, which is April 15. Does that date ring a bell with \npeople in the gallery? We all meet our obligation to pay our taxes on \nApril 15. Congress was supposed to meet its obligation to pass a budget \nresolution by April 15, but it failed. It has now failed for almost 6 \nmonths.\n  A great deal of blame has been assigned to the President for this \nmess that we are in today in the 105th Congress. But any honest \nappraisal suggests that the President had nothing to do with the budget \nresolution. That was Congress' responsibility. The President doesn't \neven sign it. It is a resolution, not a law. The House passes it, the \nSenate passes another, they come to conference and agree, and then set \nout to spend the money. And they never could agree. The Republican \nHouse and the Republican Senate could not reach an agreement between \nthem, and here we are today. That is unfortunate. Eight to ten of our \nappropriations bills have not been passed.\n  We are still working on theories and concepts when we should be \nwrapping things up and going home. We are going to pass stopgap \nspending measures to try to keep the Government going while we reach an \nagreement that should have started back on April 15.\n  I would like to address a couple of specific issues which this 105th \nCongress has failed to address as well, not just the budget but other \nissues equally important.\n  Earlier this afternoon, Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts spoke to \neducation issues, as did Senator Gramm of Texas, and, to no one's \nsurprise, there is a big difference of opinion about what we should do, \nif anything, about education. I, frankly, think that we have a \nresponsibility at the Federal level. Certainly, the vast resources \ninvested in education come from State and local sources, but we invest \nsome 6 to 7 percent at the Federal level for programs like title I. If \nyour child is falling behind in the classroom, specialized tutoring is \navailable through that Federal program and programs that are designed \nfor disabled children. If you have a child who has a learning \ndisability, a physical disability, some mental handicap, they may have \na chance to come to a regular school and a classroom because of the \nFederal program. Vocational education, a critically important element, \nis one that I think we all understand is important for a lot of \nstudents who will never need to get a college degree but need a good \njob.\n  Federal expenditures--college loans, I wouldn't be standing here \ntoday without one. Frankly, I think that it is a good investment for \nall Americans. Yet, there are those who question whether or not there \nshould even be a Department of Education.\n  In the senate debate in Illinois, the Republican candidate has said \nthat he can't find the word ``education'' in the Constitution. He uses \nthat for an argument that perhaps the Federal Government shouldn't be \ninvolved in it. I see it differently. I think the preamble to the \nConstitution about promoting the general welfare of America necessarily \nincludes looking at education.\n  Think about the turn of the last century, from the 19th century to \nthe 20th. And think about this for a moment. Between 1890 and 1910, in \nthat 20-year period of time, on average in America we built one new \nhigh school every day for 20 years. What was going on? Was it a \nbuilding by a Federal program? No. But it was a decision by States and \nlocalities that they were going to democratize education. So at the \nturn of the century, 10 percent of kids graduated from high school. By \nthe 1930s, it was 30 percent. And now it is up over 90 percent. We have \ndemocratized education. What do we have to show for it?\n  Think about the comments of the Senator from North Dakota. Think \nabout the dramatic progress we have made. Think about Orville and \nWilbur Wright, and Neil Armstrong, to the return of John Glenn from \nspace. Incidentally, this is his desk right here--a man who serves in \nthe Senate now, and on October 29 he will be launched into space again. \nWe are all so excited about that prospect. But the fact that there is a \nspace program and that we have come so far has a lot to do with \neducation.\n  What will we do in the next century in terms of our investment in \neducation? Will we step back and hope things will work out for the \nbest, or will we show initiative?\n  President Clinton in his State of the Union Address in January of \nthis year suggested an initiative that I think is a sensible one--\n100,000 new teachers. Can it make a difference? You bet it can. And \n100,000 new cops across America has made a difference in communities \nfrom Cairo to Chicago in my home State of Illinois. And 100,000 new \nteachers would mean reducing class size until we can say that in K \nthrough 3, your child in the classroom will have no more than 17 \nclassmates in the room. Ask any schoolteacher what the difference is \nbetween having 18 first graders and 30 first graders. It is dramatic.\n  A teacher spoke the other day here in the Capitol and said, ``There \nare days in my classroom of 30 kids when I don't get a chance to speak \nto each individual child in the course of the day.'' She says, ``I go \nhome at night saddened because I have never really believed that you \ncan educate a child unless you can connect personally.''\n  President Clinton says 100,000 new teachers. The Republicans in the \nSenate and the House have not honored that. Now it is a subject of \ndebate.\n  The President suggested in his State of the Union Address reducing \nclass sizes for the lower grades. I honestly believe that if we want to \ngraduate quality high school graduates, quality college graduates, you \nhave to start at the beginning--childhood development, K through 3, the \nbasics, reading and writing and spelling so that kids get a good start.\n  That is the President's program. That is one of the things we are \ndebating. It is one of the things that has been seriously overlooked by \nthis Congress. In fact, the Republicans in Congress have cut the title \nI program, specialized tutoring, for kids who might fall back a grade. \nThey have cut teacher training at a time when our teachers should, \nfrankly, be getting more skills instead of fewer. They have cut the \nsummer jobs program for kids.\n\n  I can tell you a lot of kids don't have a chance to work during the \nsummer. They not only don't make a few bucks and don't have a work \nexperience, but they are tempted to do the wrong thing instead of the \nright thing. And they have cut technology grants to students and \nschools that need them so they can bring in the right technology. That \nis one of the things this 105th Congress has failed to do.\n  They talk about crumbling schools. One of the earlier speakers said \nit is really not a problem that we ought to worry about.\n  Take a look at this chart. K through 12 enrollment is at an all-time \nhigh, and is continuing to rise over the next 10 years. Where are these \nkids going to go to school? Where are their classrooms? Unfortunately, \na lot of the classrooms that currently exist are deficient.\n  This year K through 12 enrollment reached an all-time high, and \ncontinues to rise for the next 7 years. We need 6,000 new public \nschools by 2006 just to maintain the current class size. Due to \novercrowding in schools, they are using trailers for classrooms, \nundermining discipline and increasing student morale.\n  What about those existing classrooms and these crumbling schools? On\n\n[[Page S12371]]\n\nthis particular issue, I salute my colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-\nBraun of Illinois, who has really taken the national initiative on \nthis.\n  Look at the state of current schools in America. Fourteen million \nchildren learn in substandard schools. Seven million children attend \nschools with asbestos, lead paint and radon in the ceilings or the \nwalls. Twelve million children go to school under leaky roofs. One-\nthird attend classrooms without enough panel outlets and electric \nwiring for computers. If we do nothing about this, the burden will \nshift considerably to the property taxpayers across America.\n  But if we have a Federal initiative, as the President suggested, to \nbuild and repair 5,000 schools, it is going to help the kids prepare \nfor our clear needs with more enrollment and to reduce the burden on \nlocal property taxpayers.\n  Let me mention a few other issues that have failed in this Congress. \nOne of the current questions that is asked of most pollsters in almost \nevery poll is, Does this candidate really care about you? It is an \nopen-ended question. It is an invitation for the person who is being \nasked the question to really say, ``Well, I don't know if Senator so-\nand-so really cares about me. I would say no.'' Or yes, whatever it \nmight be. I think the appropriate question for the 105th Congress is, \nDid the 105th Congress really care about you as Americans and American \nfamilies? When it came to education, the cutbacks that I have talked \nabout clearly are not responsive to the needs of many families trying \nto raise their children.\n  In the area of managed care reform, so that we would change health \ninsurance to give doctors more say in treating us and our children, and \nthose we love, so that hospitals would be able to make the right \ndecisions for us medically rather than an insurance company, this \nCongress, this 105th Congress with the Republican leadership, failed to \npass a Patients' Bill of Rights and managed care reform. For those \nfamilies worried about quality health care, I am not certain that we \nhave demonstrated that this Congress and this leadership in Congress \ncares about us.\n  An issue near and dear to me is the question of tobacco. I started \nthis fight about 12 years ago when I banned smoking on airplanes, \njoining Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey in that effort. We had a chance \nthis year, a historic opportunity because of the initiative of State \nattorneys general, to bring the tobacco companies and have them face \ntheir responsibility to the American people. We failed. We failed \nbecause 14 Republican Senators voted in an effort to stop us from \nhaving that happen.\n  That is a sad commentary, because while we languish in this body and \ncannot face our responsibilities to these tobacco companies, they \ncontinue to market and sell their products to our children. I have \nnever in my life met a parent who has said to me, ``I have great news. \nMy daughter came home last night and she started smoking.'' I have \nnever met that parent. Maybe some day I will. Maybe some of the \nSenators in this body have met those parents. I have not.\n  As we have been unable to address this issue about tobacco companies, \nthe number of American kids taking up smoking has risen 73 percent in \nthe last 8 years. More than 1.2 million start smoking every day--kids \nunder the age of 18--and are likely to be addicted, and one-third of \nthem are likely to die because they did it. The rate of smoking--\nbecoming smokers--is increasing. And this Senate turned its back and \nrefused to take action to hold the tobacco companies accountable in \ntheir merchandising, their retailing and sales to kids--another failure \nof the 105th Congress.\n  Another one clearly is in the area of campaign finance reform. I \nmentioned managed care reform. Some insurance companies that don't \nprovide good care didn't want to see managed care reform; they \nsucceeded in the Senate. Certainly the tobacco companies didn't want to \nsee us change the way that they sell their product, and they succeeded. \nNow take a look at the contributions in this campaign, find out which \ncandidates receive the most money from just those two groups, for \nexample, and you will find the same Senators who voted to kill the \ntobacco bill, voted to kill the Patients' Bill of Rights, will be the \nones receiving the money.\n  We have tried on a bipartisan basis to pass campaign finance reform. \nThis 105th Congress has failed. Nothing on education, nothing on \nmanaged care reform, nothing on tobacco reform, nothing on campaign \nfinance reform, and no budget resolution, no effort to preserve Social \nSecurity or Medicare over the long term, no expenditures on behalf of \nthe things that are critical for us.\n  This Congress has stepped away from its responsibilities. Some have \ncalled it the worst Congress that has ever served in this building. I \nam not certain I would go that far, although I searched Senator Byrd's \nhistory of the Senate to find a more ineffectual Senate, and I can't \nfind one. But I will keep looking.\n  Another area where this Congress failed is when it comes to sensible \ngun control. Let's face it; the gun lobby holds sway in the Senate. \nTake a look at the rollcalls. Efforts that we have had by Senators \nBoxer and Kohl to require people to keep a trigger lock on their guns \nso that they are safely stored away from children failed on this floor. \nA bill which I introduced which held the owners of guns responsible to \nsafely store their guns away from children was defeated.\n  I am not arguing about your right to own a gun here, but I say if you \nown one, for goodness sakes, store it safely away from the child. The \nkids who are showing up in these schools and opening fire on their \nclassmates and teachers are kids who have brought guns from home, guns \nthat didn't have a trigger lock, guns that weren't locked away, guns \nthat became instruments of death in the hand of a child. When a 4-year \nold can reach into a grandmother's purse, pull out a loaded handgun and \nshoot another 4-year-old, as happened last year in America, it raises a \nserious question about whether that gun owner has accepted her \nresponsibility to store that gun safely.\n  That radical notion of holding gun owners responsible for storing \ntheir guns safely is the law in 15 States and was defeated soundly in \nthis Chamber because the gun lobby didn't want it. And the Brady law, \nwhich has stopped literally hundreds of thousands of convicted felons, \npeople with a history of serious mental illness and the like, from \nbuying guns expired, and as it expires the waiting period of 3 to 5 \ndays to check on the background is going to go away in many States.\n  This Senate and this House of Representatives failed to respond. Does \nthis Senate, does this House care about families across America? When \nyou look at the litany here, frankly, there is not much to point to.\n  Some have suggested it is not an ineffectual Senate or Congress; it \nis a retrograde Congress--one that is moving back, and I think that is \ntrue. We have now reached that pinnacle where we are moving toward a \nreal balanced budget, and having reached that pinnacle many in \nleadership on the Republican side can't think of a reason why they are \nhere. And failing that, they have failed the American people time and \nagain on education, on health care and protecting our children.\n  I hope that in the closing hours, in some room here in the Capitol \nwhere the negotiators are sitting together trying to work out their \ndifferences, they will at least listen carefully to the administration \nand to the Democratic side. We do need to do something about education \nbefore we leave, something about 100,000 teachers across America and \nsmaller classroom sizes. I hope we will have more money for title I, \nmore money for summer jobs, more money for teachers and technology \ngrants.\n  It is not likely we are going to have a Patients' Bill of Rights. It \nis not likely we are going to have a tobacco bill. We are certainly not \ngoing to have campaign finance reform. But in 3 weeks the voters of \nthis country get a chance to go to the polls. They get to look forward \nand decide what their vision of the 106th Congress will be--more of the \nsame or new and different leadership.\n  I hope that they agree, as I do, there is an important national \nagenda, an agenda which should be served whether the leadership is \nDemocrat or Republican. This 105th Congress will put its tail between \nits legs and go whimpering out of town, back to their States,\n\n[[Page S12372]]\n\nback to their districts to carry on the campaigns, but we squandered an \nopportunity here, an opportunity to lead, an opportunity to show that \nwe truly care about families across America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe these are times in which \nanyone, anywhere would wish to live--times of boundless opportunity \nwhen distant horizons are brought near. Since the second year of Ronald \nReagan's first term, America has seen her GDP climb every year but one. \nOur unemployment rate stands at a historic low. Poverty has dropped by \nmore than ten percent. And our budget is in surplus for the first time \nin a generation.\n  For the first time since 1969, the federal government will run a \nsurplus estimated to be $70 billion. It is a surplus that could allow \nus to do so much for so many. We could free American families from a \ndebilitating tax burden or help the forgotten middle class keep more of \nwhat they earn with tax relief.\n  Beyond meaningful tax relief, the surplus offers another great \npotential--ensuring the long-term solvency of the Social Security Trust \nFund.\n  The surplus is an opportunity for us to honor our commitment to the \nmen who scaled the cliffs at Normandy and the mothers who sent their \nson to defend America's freedom halfway around the world. It is, Mr. \nPresident, a once in a lifetime chance for us to make the paper IOUs in \nthe Social Security Trust Fund real--to pay our debts and keep our \nword. We can use the surplus to do this.\n  Unfortunately, the President and his apologists on Capitol Hill have \na different plan. It is an attack given to platitudes rather than \nprinciple, an approach long on meaningless rhetoric and short on \nmeaningful reform. It is a plan that calls for a return to the \nprofligate spending of yesterday at the cost of a brighter tomorrow.\n  As I suggested last Monday on the Senate floor, since late September \nthe President has submitted a series of requests to fund new \n``emergency'' spending initiatives. And, because current law subjects \ndiscretionary spending to annual caps through FY 2002, this so-called \n``emergency'' spending would increase the discretionary spending caps, \ndecrease the budget surplus, and take money from the Social Security \nTrust Fund.\n  And what are the President's ``emergency'' spending requests? What \nare the eleventh hour developments that have made Social Security's \nsolvency a low priority instead of a high one? The President is \nproposing that the equivalent of at least 24% of this year's surplus--\n$14.4 billion to date--be spent on a Bosnia deployment that is now four \nyears old, government computer repairs, increased embassy security and \na variety of other initiatives.\n  Now, I will be the first to concede that many of the President's \nrequests constitute real and important funding issues. But emergencies? \nMr. President, the lives of our elderly are too important for half-\ntruths and doublespeak.\n  Social Security should not be betrayed by emergencies that are \nconjured up and have been anticipated for quite some time. The \ndefinition of an emergency is not something that we have known about \nfor 4 years or 2 years or something that we are really trying to get \nmoney to spend in the last fiscal year and not in this one.\n  In his January 1998 State of the Union address, President Clinton \nmade the following statement: ``What should we do with this projected \nsurplus? I have a simple four word answer: Save Social Security first. \n. . . I propose that we reserve 100 percent of the surplus--that's \nevery penny of any surplus--for Social Security.''\n  And just 10 days ago, the President repeated his demand again \n(October 2, 1998). ``I made it clear and I want to make it clear again. \n. . . We simply have to set aside every penny of it [the budget \nsurplus], . . . to save Social Security first.''\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, you can't have it both ways. We can't \nhide from the truth. More to the point, you can't save Social Security \nby wasting the surplus on mislabeled emergencies or more big spending. \nEven as I speak here, the President and his aides are working to see \nthat our seniors' Social Security checks either are shipped overseas or \nsquandered on more bureaucrats in Washington, DC, with more spending \nprograms proposed for money to be shipped overseas or bigger \nbureaucracies here in the nation's capital. Tragically it is what \nChairman Greenspan warned us about just weeks ago. Referring to whether \nthe surplus should be spent, saved, or returned to the taxpayers, \nGreenspan said, ``. . . I am also, however, aware of the pressures that \nwill exist to spend it, and that in my judgment would be the worst of \nall outcomes.''\n\n  Greenspan says, ``. . . the pressures . . . to spend it . . . would \nbe the worst of all outcomes.''\n  Mr. President, if increased spending is labeled as ``emergency'' as \nan accounting gimmick in order to authorize us to spend the surplus, I \nwill not be a party to it. Labeling the taxpayers' money ``emergency'' \ndoesn't make it any less wasteful. Just because it is called emergency \ndoesn't prevent it from adding government and adding bureaucracy. As \nwas said by another, putting a sign on a pig and calling it a dog \ndoesn't make the pig any less of a pig. And there is going to be plenty \nof pork in this ``Mother of All Pigs,'' that is coming to the Senate \nfor its approval by way of a proposal for spending.\n  For example, the Wall Street Journal this morning reported that \nLabor, Health and Human Services and Education account for the single \nlargest part of the Omnibus bill in terms of add-ons sought by the \nAdministration. The President wants a total of $1.6 billion, including \nalmost $1.2 billion for his ``class size'' initiative and another $182 \nmillion for a child care block grant.\n\n  Mr. President, all of this $1.6 billion dollars in increased \neducation spending is paid for from the Social Security Trust Fund. The \nPresident has not offered one dime in spending cuts to pay for his \n``priorities,'' which he has labeled as ``emergencies.''\n  What is equally as shocking is that the underlying Labor/HHS/\nEducation appropriations bill is estimated to be about $4 billion over \nits spending allocation even before accounting for the extra money \nsought by the Administration this weekend.\n  The President should explain to the voters that his pledge to ``save \nevery penny of any surplus'' was untrue. His promise to ``save Social \nSecurity first'' was just a slogan--offered during his State of the \nUnion with a wink and a nod, and broken days later.\n  Only days after first promising to save the surplus, he submitted a \nbudget to Congress calling for $150 billion in additional spending. And \nin the entire legislative year since the President made his pledge, he \nhas done nothing to fix the Social Security problem--and far too much \nto fix the blame. He has wasted this entire year, just as he is \nproposing to waste our senior's Social Security checks on overseas \ndeployments and projects.\n  If the President truly meant what he said about Social Security, he \nwould propose real fixes instead of empty promises. If the President \ntruly meant what he said about saving the surplus, he would not be \ntrying to spend the taxpayer's money under the camouflage of bogus \n``emergencies.''\n  This whole notion of false ``emergency'' spending is a dangerous \nploy. It\n\n[[Page S12373]]\n\nputs the President of the United States in the position of the little \nboy who cried wolf. If and when we face a true emergency, we will be \nforced to fund it through this discredited process. And when that time \ncomes, we will regret having engaged in this sleight-of-hand, in this \nlegerdemain, in this charade. Words should have real meaning, Mr. \nPresident, and actions should have consequences. Two lessons we would \ndo well to remember.\n  Mr. President, the normal appropriations process is what every \nAmerican family does when they plan their spending for the upcoming \nweek, or month, or year. Families measure how much they can afford to \nspend, and where they have to cut back. In some years, when there is an \nillness or a recession, they may have emergency savings that they use. \nPerhaps it is a rare occurrence--one they take only in extraordinary \ncircumstances.\n  But think what would happen if families used their savings for non-\nemergencies--for a new car or a new dress. They would quickly find \nthemselves unprepared for true emergencies.\n  The Federal Government should treat its emergencies the same way \nfamilies do. Necessary but non-emergency problems should be addressed \nby achieving savings in lower priority federal spending programs.\n  The President's commitment to send troops to Bosnia was made 4 years \nago. It is time to account for that in the normal appropriations \nprocess. The Year 2000 problem is a very real threat. But it is also a \nproblem that we have known about for some period of time--since we do \nhave calendars here in Washington. No, instead of anticipating the need \nand including it in the regular budget process, the President has \nchosen to ask for this kind of additional funding in the ``emergency'' \ncategory. The President is crying wolf and I only hope the Republican \nCongress has the good sense say, ``No.''\n  Mr. President, I don't agree always with what I read in the \nnewspaper, but here's an editorial with which I do agree. ``Republicans \nrightly point out,'' the Christian Science Monitor recently noted, \n``that there's a double standard here: It's OK for Clinton and the \nDemocrats to propose spending $20 billion of the coming surplus for \n`emergencies,' but when the GOP suggests returning some of it to \ntaxpayers, that's a `threat' to Social Security.'' (Christian Science \nMonitor editorial, September 28, 1998)\n  The Christian Science Monitor had it right in that editorial. And the \ndouble standard is even worse than the Monitor suggests. For when this \n$20 billion is spent, the money will be gone. Whereas if we had given \nit back to the taxpayer, at least we would have provided some measure \nof relief from the highest tax burden in the history of this republic--\na helping hand to the forgotten middle class.\n  And that is the key question here. Who owns the surplus? President \nClinton and the Democrat Party see the surplus as own private slush \nfunds--money he can hoard with the shield of false promises, but spends \nwhenever it suits them.\n  I would argue that the American people own the surplus. And it is \ntime to give it back. As we have learned with all too great a frequency \nin recent years, if we leave the surplus in Washington, supposedly far-\nsighted bureaucrats will find a way to spend it.\n  For there is no end to the good Washington believes it can do with \ntheir brains and our money. This town specializes in spending.\n  I believe it is time for us to make the American people aware of the \ndeceitful and dishonorable efforts to use the budget surplus on \nmislabeled emergencies and increased spending. I came to Washington 4 \nyears ago to cut taxes and decrease government interference in our \nlives.\n  I also made a sacred commitment that I would protect and defend the \nSocial Security Trust Fund. I intend, therefore, to oppose any effort \nto spend the elderly's Social Security checks on overseas deployments \nor the bureaucracy in Washington, D.C., and mislabeling those things as \n``emergencies'' will not change my commitment or determination.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12372-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12373-S12375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to respond to some of the \nthings I have heard over the weekend, and now some of the things I have \nheard on the floor of the Senate. I heard over the weekend on some of \nthe talk shows that the reason the Congress does not have its work done \nfor the year, the new fiscal year which began October 1, is that it is \nthe President's fault.\n  We have no budget resolution passed by this Congress. For the first \ntime in 24 years, there has been a failure to pass a budget resolution. \nThat budget resolution was due by April 15. The President plays no role \nin a budget resolution; that is the responsibility of this Congress. In \nfact, the President does not even have a chance to sign or veto a \nbudget resolution. It is purely the responsibility of this Senate and \nthe House of Representatives, and these bodies have failed in their \nresponsibility, and they have failed for the first time in 24 years.\n  It is easy to blame the President for everything in this town, but \nwhen it comes to a failure to pass a budget resolution, it is not the \nPresident's fault. The fault lies right here, right here in the U.S. \nSenate and at the other end of this building in the House of \nRepresentatives. It was our responsibility to pass a budget resolution. \nIt was our obligation to pass a budget resolution. That is the \nblueprint that is to be followed in order to coordinate all of the \nappropriations bills.\n  Little wonder, now that the new fiscal year has already started. The \nnew fiscal year started October 1, and we don't have our work done. In \nfact, most of the appropriations bills have not been passed. That is \nnot Bill Clinton's failure. That is not President Clinton's failure. \nThat is the failure of this Congress.\n  I also heard colleagues assert that the President is proposing \nspending the surplus. That is not true. The President is not proposing \nspending the surplus. The new spending on education the President is \nproposing is to be fully offset. He is not spending the surplus on \neducation. That additional spending will be paid for by reducing other \nspending. That is the President's proposal, not spending the surplus.\n  Then we hear assertions that the President is proposing spending the \nmoney on emergencies. Anybody who understands the budget rules of \nCongress understands that we set the budget rules and we say that if \nthe money is for an emergency, it does not count in the normal budget \nprocess. Those are our rules. Now I hear my colleagues standing up and \nblaming the President. It is not his fault that we have said if it is \nemergency spending it is outside the normal budget process.\n  What are these emergencies? I heard a lot of talk moments ago that \nthis is for bureaucrats in Washington. Wait a minute. What are the \nemergencies that have been designated by our own rules as emergencies?\n  First of all, money for the farm crisis that is occurring across \nAmerica. If that is not an emergency, I don't know what is. We have had \na series of natural disasters all across America, and much of this \nspending that the President has proposed as emergency spending is to \nrespond to natural emergencies, natural disasters. That is exactly what \nwe should do.\n  It doesn't stop there, because we also have a crisis in agriculture \nbecause of collapsed income. In my State, from 1996 to 1997, farm \nincome dropped 98 percent. If that is not a disaster, I don't know what \nis. I will just say to my colleagues who say the disasters in \nagriculture are not emergencies, go ask your farmers and see what they \nsay. I tell you, the farmers in my State say it is an emergency. They \nunderstand they have had extraordinary natural disasters, from the \nincredible drought in Texas and Oklahoma to the extraordinary wet \nconditions in my part of the country that has led to an outbreak of a \ndisease called scab that has decimated the crops. That, according to \nour own budget rules, is an emergency, and when you have an emergency, \nit is outside the normal budget process. The President is not \nadvocating spending the Social Security surplus, he is following the \nrules that we have laid down.\n  What are some of the other emergencies the President has asked us to\n\n[[Page S12374]]\n\nrespond to? One is the terrorist bombing of our Embassies in Africa. \nThe terrorist bombings, are those emergencies? Without question, they \nare. That is according to our own budget rules. That is not money for \nbureaucrats in Washington, that is money to respond to a terrorist \nattack on the United States of America, and, according to our own \nbudget rules, rules that we set down, that is an emergency.\n  The President is not advocating spending the Social Security surplus. \nInterestingly enough, it is our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who proposed dipping into the surplus. It is our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle who proposed a massive tax-cut scheme that \nwould be spending the Social Security surplus, because every penny--\nevery penny--of their tax cut schemes would have come out of the Social \nSecurity surplus--every penny. That is raiding Social Security, and the \nPresident stood up and said, ``No, you don't touch that money.'' He \nsaid to them not to touch it. He is not touching it. He is following \nthe rules that we have laid down. Those are the facts.\n  When I look at the history of how we have gotten to where we are, I \nalso have to respond to what I heard from some of my colleagues, that \nthe Republican majority here is responsible for the first budget \nsurplus in 30 years. Mr. President, here is the record on our budget \ndeficits. This shows we have balance for the first time in 30 years. \nThese are the deficits. We can see the deficits rose until, in the last \nadministration, they reached $290 billion. In every year of this \nadministration, the deficits have come down, so that this year we are \nshowing a $70 billion surplus.\n  When our colleagues say that it is the Republicans who brought us to \na balanced budget, I have to say, wait a minute, let's check the \nrecord, let's check the facts. In 1993, the President put before \nCongress a plan to dramatically reduce the deficit. The Democrats \nsupported that plan. Not a single Republican voted for it--not one. Not \none Republican in the House, not one Republican here in the Senate, \nvoted for that deficit reduction plan--not one. Yet, that plan is the \nonly plan in the 12 years I have been in the Senate that has worked. It \nwas a 5-year plan to reduce the deficit. It cut spending and it raised \ntaxes on the wealthiest 1.5 percent of the people in this country.\n  The Republicans say, yes, but we had a bipartisan budget deal in 1997 \nthat we played a role in, and it is the reason that we balanced the \nbudget. I will give my friends on the other side of the aisle some of \nthe credit. It is true, they participated, along with Democrats. That \nwas a bipartisan plan in 1997. This chart shows how much of the deficit \nreduction has come from the 1993 plan and how much of it has come from \nthe 1997 plan. What you can see is that nearly 90 percent of the \ndeficit reduction that has occurred flowed from the 1993 plan that not \none single Republican voted for--not one. This part of the job has been \ndone by the 1997 plan that was a bipartisan agreement. It accounts for \nabout 15 percent of the total. Those are the facts.\n  When I hear my friends on the other side of the aisle beating their \nchests saying they are the ones who balanced the budget, wait just a \nminute; the action that has done most of the heavy lifting was done by \nDemocrats, and Democrats alone, in 1993. In 1997, the balanced budget \nplan, the thing that finished the job off, was done by both parties \nwalking hand in hand. Those are the facts.\n  The result of the economic policy that was put in place by the 1993 \n5-year plan has been one of the most successful economic plans ever \nadopted by this country. Again, not a single Republican voted for it. \nIn fact, they said at the time--I remember so well because I am on the \nBudget Committee and I am on the Finance Committee, and I remember our \nfriends across the aisle saying, ``If you pass this plan, it is not \ngoing to reduce the deficit, it is going to increase the deficit.''\n  Our friends across the aisle said, ``It won't reduce inflation, it \nwill increase inflation.''\n  Our friends across the aisle said, ``If you pass this plan, it is \ngoing to crater the economy.''\n  Well, they were wrong on each and every count.\n  Here is what has happened in terms of economic growth: During the \nClinton administration, it has average 3.9 percent; during the Bush \nadministration, 1.3 percent; the Reagan administration, 3 percent; the \nCarter administration, 3.6 percent; the Ford administration, 0.9 \npercent; the Nixon administration, 3.6 percent; the Johnson \nadministration, 5.3 percent.\n  In other words, this plan, this economic plan, has the highest level \nof private sector economic growth of any administration since the \nJohnson administration. Of course, in the Johnson administration the \neconomy was fueled by a war. This is a peacetime expansion of an \neconomy that has been remarkable and the strongest of any \nadministration since the Johnson administration.\n  On job growth, the economic plan that we put in place in 1993 has \nproduced now over 17 million jobs--17 million jobs. The Reagan \nadministration, that administration, generated 8.7 million.\n  On real business productive investment, we see the highest rate of \ngrowth of any administration in decades--see real business productive \ninvestment growing at a rate of nearly 13 percent a year.\n  That is the economic record. You can see we passed the economic plan \nin 1993; it has been virtually straight up since that time.\n  That is not the only measure of economic performance. If we look at \nthe inflation rate, we see that the inflation rate is now at its lowest \nin 33 years--lowest rate of inflation in 33 years.\n  If we look at unemployment, we see that unemployment is at the lowest \nin 28 years--again, largely a result of the economic plan put in place \nin 1993, without a single vote from the other side--not one. That \neconomic plan has produced truly remarkable results.\n  If we look at interest rates, we can see, going back to 1977, we now \nhave the lowest interest rates--measured as yield on a 30-year Treasury \nbond--the lowest in 20 years; under 5 percent for the first time in 20 \nyears.\n  If we look at other measures of the economic plan that was put in \nplace by this President, and with votes of the Democratic Party, we can \nsee the effect on welfare caseloads. Welfare caseloads now--the \npercentage on welfare--are the lowest in 29 years. That was the \nsuccessful welfare reform plan that we passed. And we passed a crime \nbill that has produced 5 years in a row of declining violent crime in \nAmerica. That is the record.\n  When our friends want to talk about the record, they do not ever want \nto compare the results in the last three administrations. So maybe we \nshould remind them of what the results were in the last three \nadministrations.\n  This shows the Reagan administration record on deficits. When he came \nin, the deficit was about $80 billion. When he left, it was up to $150 \nbillion. In between, it had gone up to over $200 billion a year in \ndeficits.\n  When the Bush administration came in, the deficit was running about \n$150 billion a year. Before he was done, it was $290 billion a year.\n  Then the Clinton administration came in, and we passed the 1993 \nplan--again, without one single Republican vote--and each and every \nyear of that 5-year plan the deficit has come down, until this year we \nhave the first balanced budget in 30 years.\n  When I say it is the first balanced budget, let me just say that in \nWashington what they call a balanced budget is not what we call a \nbalanced budget anywhere else in America. In Washington, they call a \nbalanced budget one that counts the Social Security surpluses.\n  Here is another way of looking at what has happened. It shows that we \nhave made dramatic progress. It also shows that we have not yet truly \nbalanced the budget. The blue line shows what they talk about in \nWashington when they talk about the budget. But it is important to \nunderstand that it includes all of the revenue of the Federal \nGovernment and all of the expenditures of the Federal Government.\n  That would make some sense if some of the revenues were not coming \nfrom trust funds. And if you exclude the Social Security trust fund, \nwhat you see is much the same pattern; that is, a dramatic reduction in \nthe deficits. But what you also find is that if you exclude the Social \nSecurity surplus, we still have a deficit this year of $35 billion.\n\n[[Page S12375]]\n\n  Now, it is true, that is down dramatically from the last year of the \nBush administration, when the true deficit, instead of being $290 \nbillion, was really $341 billion if you excluded the Social Security \nsurplus. But if you exclude the Social Security surplus this year, \ninstead of having a $70 billion surplus, you have a $35 billion \ndeficit.\n  Some economists say, well, you really ought to put it all together. \nWell, maybe that is why they are economists. I can tell you this: If \nyou were running a company and you tried to take the retirement funds \nof your employees and throw those into the pot, you would be in big \ntrouble because that is a violation of the law. It is called fraud. You \ncannot take the retirement funds of your employees, throw those into \nthe pot, and say you have balanced your operating budget. But that is \nwhat is done with the Federal budget.\n\n  So I think it is important to understand that while it is true we \nhave made enormous progress, we have come down dramatically with \nrespect to the deficit, and in fact in terms of a unified budget, we \nare balanced for the first time in 30 years. If we did not count the \nSocial Security surplus, we would still have a deficit of $35 billion.\n  Mr. President, let me just conclude by saying, the fact is, when I \nhear our colleagues say, No. 1, President Clinton is responsible for \nour failure to have a budget resolution, that is absolutely untrue. \nThere is not a Member of this body who does not understand the \nPresident does not have one thing to do with the budget resolution. The \nbudget resolution is just that--it is a resolution by both Houses of \nCongress. It is our responsibility to pass a budget resolution, and \nthis Congress has failed.\n  For the first time in 24 years, there is no budget resolution. The \nSenate passed a budget resolution, but the Republicans in the House and \nthe Republicans in the Senate could never agree, and so for months the \nappropriations bills were delayed. So here we are at the start of a new \nfiscal year--no budget, no appropriations bills, and we are sitting \nhere wondering how it is going to end.\n  I think we know how it is going to end, Mr. President. It is going to \nend with a huge continuing resolution. There will probably be thousands \nof pages. There will probably be seven or eight appropriations bills \nall glommed into one package. And remember what Ronald Reagan said \nabout that kind of process? He said in his 1987 State of the Union \nAddress:\n\n       . . . the budget process is a sorry spectacle. The missing \n     of deadlines and the nightmare of monstrous continuing \n     resolutions packing hundreds of billions of dollars of \n     spending into one bill must be stopped.\n\n  Our Republican friends in the House and the Senate must not have been \nlistening to former President Reagan, because they have not stopped it. \nIn fact, what they have done is, every year for the last 3 years that \nthey have been in control of this Senate and the House, that is exactly \nwhat they have done. They failed to do their work on time and, instead, \nthey have handed us a stack of thousands of pages in a continuing \nresolution, with no time to review.\n  And Ronald Reagan said the very next year, on February 18 of 1988, in \nhis budget message:\n\n       As I have stressed on numerous occasions, the current \n     budget process is clearly unworkable and desperately needs a \n     drastic overhaul. Last year, as in the year before, the \n     Congress did not complete action on a budget until well past \n     the beginning of the fiscal year. The Congress missed every \n     deadline it had set for itself just 9 months earlier.\n\n  He could have been referring to this Congress, because this Congress \nhas failed to meet every single budget deadline. In fact, for the first \ntime in 24 years, they have produced no budget. Our colleague across \nthe aisle was talking about how a family operates. I do not know many \nfamilies that never bother to come up with a budget, but that is what \nhas happened here under the leadership of our friends on the other side \nof the aisle. For the first time in 24 years, there is no budget--none. \nThat is their failure, not the President's failure. It is their \nfailure.\n  President Reagan went on to say that Congress missed every deadline. \nHe said, ``In the end, the Congress passed a year-long 1,057-page \nomnibus'' appropriations bill with an accompanying conference report of \nover 1,000 pages and a reconciliation bill over 1,100 pages long.\n  President Reagan said:\n\n       Members of Congress had only 3 hours to consider all three \n     items. Congress should not pass another massive continuing \n     resolution [President Reagan said in 1988.]\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n     --and as I said in the State of the Union Address, if they \n     do, I will not sign it.\n\n  What a difference 10 years makes. Ten years ago, a Republican \nPresident said there should not be passed another continuing \nresolution. But here we are with a Republican-controlled Congress who \nhas failed to even write a budget. That is the most basic \nresponsibility of any Congress, to write a budget. This Congress, under \nRepublican control, has failed in that most basic duty for the first \ntime in 24 years. Why? Because the Republicans in the U.S. Senate who \ndid pass a budget resolution--we passed it on a bipartisan basis--could \nnever get together with the Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives. So what we have is a colossal failure.\n  I don't know how else to say it, but this is mismanagement on a grand \nscale. I hope people will remember what the record is because it does \nmake a difference. America has enjoyed unprecedented prosperity in the \nlast 5 years, prosperity that I believe came in significant part \nbecause of an economic plan that was passed in 1993, the 5-year budget \nplan, that actually did the job. It reduced the budget each and every \nyear. I will show the comparison chart again.\n  It reduced the budget each and every year since it was passed. When \nPresident Bush left town, he had a $290 billion deficit. If you weren't \ncounting Social Security surpluses, it was even worse than that; it was \n$341 billion. Let's talk on a unified basis for a moment because that \nis how the press always reports it. Clinton came in and each and every \nyear after we passed that 1993 plan, the deficit has come down. So now \nwe have a $70 billion surplus.\n  Again, I am quick to say I don't consider this a surplus because it \nis counting the Social Security surplus. Nonetheless, dramatic progress \nhas been made in reducing the deficit. That has given rise to the \nstrongest economy in almost anyone's memory.\n  Our friends on the other side who are now in control are responsible \nfor a dramatic failure, a failure to write a budget for the United \nStates of America. The result is, here we are, the new fiscal year has \nstarted, we have no budget, half the appropriations bills aren't done, \nthey will all be rolled into a stack of paper that will be probably 3 \nfeet high, it will be slammed on our desks, and we will be told to vote \non it 3 hours later.\n  What a way to govern. What a way to manage.\n  It is not Bill Clinton's fault that no budget was written here. A \nbudget resolution is the distinct responsibility of the Congress. This \nCongress has failed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12373-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12375]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last Thursday the Senate approved, by \nunanimous consent, the conference report on H.R. 2281, the Digital \nMillennium Copyright Act (DMCA). I rise today to laud the House's \naction in adding its vote of approval to that of the Senate. The bill \nnow goes to the President, who I expect will move\n\n[[Page S12376]]\n\nswiftly to sign this important legislation into law.\n  As I said last Thursday, and on many other occasions, I believe the \nDMCA is one of the most important pieces of legislation to be \nconsidered by Congress this year, even in recent memory. It has been \nover twenty years since such significant copyright law reforms have \nbeen enacted in this country, and this vote has come at a critical \njuncture in our nation's transition to a ``digital millennium.''\n  But all this would not have happened without the critical support of \ncountless parties who have come together in negotiations to refine the \nbill and reach a compromise that best promotes American interests at \nhome and abroad.

I also want to \nconvey my appreciation for the dedicated efforts of Congressman Henry \nHyde, the distinguished Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, \nCongressman John Conyers, the distinguished Ranking Member of the House \nJudiciary Committee, and Congressman Howard Coble, the distinguished \nChairman of the House Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property. \nThey have been committed to seeing this bill through from the start and \nhave been wholly undeterred by other pressing business that has \noccupied the House Judiciary Committee in recent weeks. I also want to \nrecognize Congressman Tom Bliley, the distinguished Chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, for his willingness to consider the Senate's views \nobjectively and dispassionately.\n  In addition, I want to acknowledge once again the hard work done by \nstaff. In particular I want to recognize the efforts of Manus Cooney, \nEdward Damich, and Troy Dow of my staff, whose long hours and tireless \nefforts were key to guiding this bill through every stage of the \nlegislative process. Bruce Cohen, Beryl Howell, and Marla Grossman, of \nSenator Leahy's staff, likewise provided invaluable assistance on all \nlevels. I also want to thank Garry Malphrus of Senator Thurmond's staff \nfor his work in conference, as well as Paul Clement and Bartlett \nCleland of Senator Ashcroft's staff for their invaluable assistance in \nreaching key compromises in the Judiciary Committee. Finally, I want to \nthank the House staff, including Mitch Glazier, Debra Laman, Robert \nRaben, David Lehman, Bari Schwartz, Justin Lilley, Andrew Levin, Mike \nO'Rielly, and Whitney Fox.\n  I also want to recognize the long hours and persistent dedication of \nthe many people who engaged in hard-fought, but ultimately fruitful, \nprivate-sector negotiations on related issues. Many of the compromises \nembodied in this legislation would not have been reached without the \nsupport of these parties. For example, we would not be lauding the \npassage of a bill today at all were it not for the willingness of the \ncopyright industries, Internet service providers, educators, libraries, \nand others in the fair use community to come together at the direction \nand under the supervision of the Judiciary Committee to arrive at a \nconsensus position regarding standards for limiting the copyright \ninfringement liability of Internet service providers.\n  Many other negotiations were conducted and agreements reached that \nmade this legislation possible, including agreements between copyright \nowners and manufacturers of the consumer electronics devices that make \nthe use of their works by the public possible. One such agreement \nreflects the understanding of the motion picture industry and consumer \nelectronics manufacturers regarding standards for the incorporation of \ncertain copyright protection technologies in analog videocassette \nrecorders. This agreement was the basis for the new section 1201(k) of \nthe Copyright Act, as added by the DMCA, which requires analog \nvideocassette recorders to accommodate specific copy control \ntechnologies in wide use in the market today. I have received a letter \nfrom Mr. William A. Krepick, President and Chief Operating Officer of \nMacrovision Corporation--the producer of such copy protection \ntechnology--assuring me of his commitment to adhere to the spirit of \nthis agreement by making such technology available on reasonable and \nnondiscriminatory terms, which in some circumstances will include \nroyalty-free licenses. I would ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthis letter be incorporated in the Record immediately after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the DMCA is a remarkable bill that is the \nresult of a remarkable process. By enacting this legislation in a \ntimely fashion, the United States has set the marker for the rest of \nthe world with respect to the implementation of the new WIPO treaties. \nAs a result, the United States can look forward to stronger world-wide \nprotection of our intellectual property and a stronger balance of trade \nas inbound revenues from foreign uses of our intellectual property \ncontinue to increase. I am pleased to have been a part of this great \neffort, and I look forward to the President's signing of H.R. 2281.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                      Macrovision Corporation,\n\n                                   Sunnyvale, CA, October 7, 1998.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch: I am writing this letter to you in \n     your capacity as Chairman of the Senate-House Conference \n     Committee on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. We \n     understand that the Conference Committee is prepared to \n     include in the final legislation to be reported to the Senate \n     and House of Representatives a provision that requires that \n     analog videocassette recorders manufactured and/or sold in \n     the United States must conform to two analog copy control \n     technologies certain aspects of which are proprietary to \n     Macrovision Corporation. As you may know, Macrovision \n     Corporation has been in business for 15 years providing \n     various copy control technologies to help copyright owners \n     protect their valuable intellectual property. We license \n     various technologies to hardware manufacturers, including \n     manufacturers of consumer electronics and various computer-\n     based products, and to Hollywood movie studios and other \n     independent video producers.\n       We are a small company and have worked very hard over the \n     past two-and-a-half years to demonstrate to the consumer \n     electronics, computer, and motion picture companies and \n     industries that our copy control technologies offer the best \n     solution to digital-to-analog copy protection for the DVD \n     format, as well as in its traditional analog videocassette \n     application. We have worked with the companies and industries \n     to ensure that compatability and effectiveness are assured, \n     and, as a result, our technologies have been required for use \n     to provide protection of the analog outputs of DVD playback \n     devices implementing the two encryption-based copy protection \n     systems now in the market--the Content Scramble System (CSS) \n     and DIVX.\n       We support the legislative proposals that are being \n     considered by the Conference Committee, in the form of \n     Subsection ``k'' and its corresponding legislative history as \n     attached to this letter. We also recognize the unique \n     position that such legislation provides to our technology and \n     our company. Accordingly, we are writing to assure you and \n     your colleagues on the Conference Committee that we will not \n     abuse our position in our licenses for the technologies for \n     which responses are being required by this legislation. \n     Specifically, we are willing to assure you and the Committee \n     that any licenses that may be necessary to implement these \n     technologies will be offered on reasonable and non-\n     discriminatory terms, as that phrase is commonly used and \n     understood in industry standards processes. We will modify \n     certain terms and conditions of our baseline analog copy \n     control license agreements--and offer the same modifications \n     to existing licensees--if this legislation is enacted in \n     order to eliminate our contractual requirements that analog \n     videocassette recorders manufactured in or sold in the United \n     States respond to our technologies and that certain display \n     device manufacturers ensure that their products are \n     compatible with our technologies, in the sense of not \n     displaying visible artifacts or distortions in the authorized \n     playback of material protected using our analog copy control \n     technologies. The first of these requirements will now be the \n     subject of the statutory requirement that is the subject of \n     the legislative provision.\n       The second requirement will now be the subject of an inter-\n     industry forum on compatability issues, that will afford all \n     interested parties an opportunity to work together to resolve \n     such issues as they arise. We hasten to add that we do not \n     expect such problems to arise, since our technologies have \n     been proven to the satisfaction of the manufacturers that \n     they do not cause problems, and we do not expect to make any \n     material modifications to them in the future. Manufacturers \n     already know what the technologies are and can test their \n     products before finalizing their design. We commit to you and \n     your colleagues that any changes that are made to our \n     technologies will be the result of inter and intra industry \n     consensus on the changes before they are made. Nevertheless, \n     in order to reassure everyone involved, we are prepared to \n     cooperate in the\n\n[[Page S12377]]\n\n     inter-industry forum that is being established. We have been \n     assured that this forum will be established within six months \n     after passage of this legislation and will include equal \n     representation from the consumer electronics, computer, and \n     movie studio industries.\n       With regard to our licensing terms, we commit to you and \n     your colleagues that we will from the date of enactment \n     adhere to the following points--which are essentially \n     reflective of our current licensing policies. First, as \n     stated above, our proprietary analog copy protection \n     technology will be offered on reasonable and non-\n     discriminatory terms, as that phrase is used in the normal \n     industry parlance. Second, in relation to certain specific \n     circumstances:\n       (a) Manufacturers of consumer-grade analog VHS and 8mm \n     analog video cassette recorders/camcorders that are required \n     by the legislation to conform to our proprietary analog copy \n     protection technologies (and any new format analog \n     videocassette recorder that is covered by paragraph (1)(A)(v) \n     of the legislation and thereby required to conform to our \n     proprietary analog copy control technologies) will be \n     provided royalty-free licenses for the use of our relevant \n     intellectual property in any device that plays back packaged, \n     prerecorded content, or that reads and responds to or \n     generates or carries forward the elements of these \n     technologies associated with such content;\n       (b) In the same circumstances as described in (a), other \n     manufacturers of devices that generate, carry forward, and/or \n     read and respond to the elements of these technologies will \n     be provided with licenses carrying only modest fees (in the \n     current dollar range of $25,000 initial payment and lesser \n     amounts as recurring annual fees);\n       (c) Manufacturers of other products, including set-top-\n     boxes and other devices that perform similar functions \n     (including integrated devices containing such functionality), \n     will be provided with licenses on reasonable and non-\n     discriminatory terms, including royalty and other \n     considerations.\n       In the absence of the specific attached legislative and \n     explanatory language, Macrovision would not have made the \n     above referenced commitments regarding our licensing terms \n     and our contract clauses on VCR responsiveness and \n     playability issues. We very much appreciate the work of you \n     and your colleagues in helping to draft and, hopefully, \n     ultimately enact this legislation. We also appreciate and \n     acknowledge the leadership and cooperation of certain \n     companies and individuals in getting this proposal to this \n     point.\n       I understand that this letter will be incorporated into the \n     official report of the Conference Committee and that the \n     Conferees are relying on our representation herein. If you or \n     other members of the Conference have any questions or need \n     any clarification on any point, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me, or have one of your staff contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William A.

Mr. President, I am delighted at the recent passage of S. \n505, the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act. The main purpose of \nthe bill is to ensure adequate copyright protection for American works \nabroad by extending the U.S. term of copyright protection for an \nadditional 20 years. The late Sonny Bono was an avid supporter of the \nbill, and he fully appreciated what its passage would mean to the \nAmerican economy. It is therefore an appropriate memorial to this fine \nAmerican.\n  20 years ago, Mr. President, Congress fundamentally altered the way \nin which the U.S. calculates its term of copyright protection by \nabandoning a fixed-year term of protection and adopting a basic term of \nprotection based on the life of the author. In adopting the life-plus-\n50 term, Congress cited three primary justifications for the change: \n(1) the need to conform the U.S. copyright term with the prevailing \nworldwide standard; (2) the insufficiency of the U.S. copyright term to \nprovide a fair economic return for authors and their dependents; and, \n(3) the failure of the U.S. copyright term to keep pace with the \nsubstantially increased commercial life of copyrighted works resulting \nfrom the rapid growth in communications media.\n  Developments over the past 20 years have led to a widespread \nreconsideration of the adequacy of the life-plus-50-year term based on \nthese same reasons. Among the main developments is the effect of \ndemographic trends, such as increasing longevity and the trend toward \nrearing children later in life, on the effectiveness of the life-plus-\n50 term to provide adequate protection for American creators and their \nheirs. In addition, unprecedented growth in technology over the last 20 \nyears, including the advent of digital media and the development of the \nnational Information Infrastructure and the Internet, have dramatically \nenhanced the marketable lives of creative works. Most importantly, \nthough, is the growing international movement towards the adoption the \nlonger term of life-plus-70.\n  Thirty five years ago, the Permanent Committee of the Berne Union \nbegan to reexamine the sufficiency of the life-plus-50-year term. Since \nthen, a growing consensus of the inadequacy of the life-plus-50 term to \nprotect creators in an increasingly competitive global marketplace has \nlead to actions by several nations to increase the duration of \ncopyright. Of particular importance is the 1993 directive issued by the \nEuropean Union, which requires its member countries to implement a term \nof protection equal to the life of the author plus 70 years by July 1, \n1995.\n  According to the Copyright Office, all the states of the European \nUnion have now brought their laws in compliance with the directive. \nAnd, as the Register of Copyrights has stated, those countries that are \nseeking to join the European Union, including Poland, Hungary, Turkey, \nthe Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, are likely, as well, to amend their \ncopyright laws to conform with the life-plus-70 standard.\n  The reason this is of such importance to the United States is that \nthe EU Directive also mandates the application of what is referred to \nas ``the rule of the shorter term.'' This rule may also be applied by \nadherents to the Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright \nConvention. In short, this rule permits those countries with longer \ncopyright terms to limit protection of foreign works to the shorter \nterm of protection granted in the country of origin. Thus, in those \ncountries that adopt the longer term of life-plus-70, American works \nwill forfeit 20 years of available protection and be protected instead \nfor only the duration of the life-plus-50 term afforded under U.S. law.\n  Mr. President, as I've said previously, America exports more \ncopyrighted intellectual property than any country in the world, a huge \npercentage of it to nations of the European Union. In fact, in 1996, \nthe core U.S. copyright industries achieved foreign sales and exports \nexceeding $60 billion, surpassing, for the first time, every other \nexport sector, including automotive, agriculture and aircraft. And, \naccording to 1996 estimates, copyright industries account for some 5.7 \npercent of the total gross domestic product. Furthermore, copyright \nindustries are creating American jobs at nearly three times the rate of \nother industries, with the number of U.S. workers employed by core \ncopyright industries more than doubling between 1977 and 1996. Today, \nthese industries contribute more to the economy and employ more workers \nthan any single manufacturing sector, accounting for over 5 percent of \nthe total U.S. workforce. In fact, in 1996, the total copyright \nindustries employed more workers than the four leading noncopyright \nmanufacturing sectors combined.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, America stands to lose a significant part of \nits international trading advantage if our copyright laws do not keep \npace with emerging international standards. Given the mandated \napplication of the ``rule of the shorter term'' under the EU Directive, \nAmerican works will fall into the public domain 20 years before those \nof our European trading partners, undercutting our international \ntrading position and depriving copyright owners of two decades of \nincome they might otherwise have. Similar consequences will follow in \nthose nations outside the EU that choose to exercise the ``rule of the \nshorter term'' under the Berne Convention and the Universal Copyright \nConvention.\n  The public performance of musical works is one of the copyright \nrights that will be benefited by the 20-year extension. But--\nironically--in title II of the bill, Mr. President, we are cutting back \non that right by expanding the exemption that currently exists in the \nCopyright Act for ``mom-and-pop'' establishments. Because of the public \nperformance right, businesses that use music to attract customers are \nrequired to obtain a license. The licenses can be obtained from the \nperforming rights organizations (PROs), namely, ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC. \nThe PROs, in turn, pay the owners of copyright in\n\n[[Page S12378]]\n\nthe music--music publishers, composers, and/or songwriters--from the \nproceeds. Because the rates charged by the two biggest PROs, ASCAP and \nBMI, are monitored by the Rate Court of the U.S. District Court of the \nSouthern District of New York, the rates today amount to a very small \namount per annum per business. The rates are even smaller for the kinds \nof performances covered by title II of the bill--performances of music \nover television and radio sets that businesses turn on for the benefit \nof their customers. And, as I said, ``mom-and-pop'' establishments do \nnot have to pay anything. Nevertheless, some have sought for over 3 \nyears to eliminate the licensing of music that arrives in a business \nestablishment through the reception of radio and TV signals.\n  I have a stellar record in supporting legislation that benefits small \nbusiness, but this includes songwriters, who themselves are small \nbusinesses. I have yet to discover a reason to eliminate or even reduce \nthe charge for the commercial use of some one else's property. In my \nview, property is property whether it's dirt or intangible, and I have \nalways been a defender of property rights.\n  The associations that want to eliminate the public performance right \nfor business establishments have held up passage of copyright term \nextension for more than three years, although they had no quarrel with \ncopyright term extension on its merits. Since copyright term extension \nis so important to America, Mr. President, I began a series of \nnegotiations last year to try to resolve the problem. Other \nnegotiations were begun by others, and, in the end, a compromise was \nworked out. This compromise is included in title II of the bill.\n  Title II greatly expands the current ``mom-and-pop'' exemption in the \nCopyright Act. Indeed, data supplied by the Congressional Research \nService reveals that over 65.2% of restaurants will be exempt.\n  But lest we think that the music licensing issue has been put to bed, \nI want to sound a note of caution. Despite the months of negotiations \nthat produced title II, an unanticipated problem popped up just as a \ncompromise was reached--the exemption contained in title II applies to \nradio broadcasts licensed by the FCC and does not cover Internet radio. \nWe did not have time to address this problem, and, frankly, the novel \nnature of Internet radio precluded a simple solution. This issue \nconcerns me, however, and I will turn to the music licensing question \nagain in the future, if I see that a disparity exists between FCC-\nlicensed radio and Internet radio. I would not want businesses to turn \naway from new technology because of artificial forces acting on the \nmarket. If we do turn to this question, we may discover that it is \nimpossible to integrate Internet radio and TV into the exemption \nwithout modifying its scope.\n  Nevertheless, Mr. President, on balance, S. 505 is a good bill. I'm \nglad it passed, and I'm glad that a compromise was worked out on music \nlicensing to allow the copyright term to be extended. I thank all who \nhad a hand in the solution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12377-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      WIPO COPYRIGHT TREATIES IMPLEMENTATION ACT CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. I rise in support of the WIPO Copyright Treaties \nImplementation Act Conference Report adopted by the Senate on October \n8, and commend the Senator from Utah for his efforts in crafting \nlegislation that will greatly aid American copyright owners and users \nin the digital world. This legislation is of great importance to the \ncitizens of Minnesota, including many companies that produce \ncopyrighted materials as well as the hard-working men and women \nemployed by them.\n  As the Senator form Utah is also aware, however, I have a great \ninterest in Senate action to protect database owners, to continue the \navailability of quality and reliable products and services for users \nhere and abroad. Earlier this summer, I introduced S. 2291 to provide \nthis protection, and worked to include this language into the WIPO \nImplementing legislation. I greatly regret this legislation could not \nbe included as part of this Conference Report.\n  Would the Senator from Utah and his colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee agree to take up this issue as a priority item early in the \n106th Congress? I believe we need fair and balanced database protection \nlegislation, similar to S.2291.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for his comments.

Mr. President, it is with great pride and honor that I \nrise today to pay tribute to my retiring colleague from Idaho, Senator \nDirk Kempthorne. In his six years of service to the United States \nSenate, he has proven himself to be a very thoughtful and determined \nleader and I am honored to have the opportunity to rise and speak on \nhis accomplishments.\n  It was a pleasure to work with Senator Kempthorne as he crafted one \nof the most important bills we have passed in the United States Senate, \nthe Unfunded Mandates bill. I was particularly pleased that the private \nsector was included in the assessment of Unfunded mandates and Dirk was \ngenerous and extraordinarily helpful to me and my staff throughout the \nlegislative process as we developed and negotiated this legislation. \nNot only did the junior Senator from Idaho manage two weeks of debate \non the Senate floor which sometimes lasted 12 hours a day, but his \nskillful leadership and influence brought affected parties to the table \nto negotiate and produce legislation which passed both the House and \nSenate by overwhelming margins. Clearly, without his strong commitment \nto American small businesses, this objective would not have been \nachieved.\n  In addition to his service on the Small Business Committee and Armed \nForces Committee, Senator Kempthorne was given the responsibility of \nchairing the Drinking Water, Fisheries, and Wildlife subcommittee of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. He wrote an update of the \nSafe Drinking Water Act which won bipartisan praise. He worked many \nlong and arduous hours crafting legislation to reauthorize and reform \nthe Endangered Species Act, an issue extremely important New Mexico and \nother WesternStates. Dirk's perseverance and hard work was instrumental \nin laying the groundwork for long overdue reform of this law and I am \nhopeful that we can be as diligent and compromising as he has been in \ncrafting and passing ESA reform legislation in the future.\n  The state of Idaho is fortunate to have a statesman of his caliber. \nDuring his tenure, he has earned the respect and admiration of his \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle because of his unique ability to \nnegotiate, compromise, and foster positive working relationships not \nonly with his colleagues, but between federal, state, and local \ngovernments. These skills will serve him well as he faces new \nchallenges in the future. Although we will miss his presence in this \nbody, I know that he will continue to be a valuable asset not only to \nthe state of Idaho but to this Nation.\n  Finally, I understand the challenges and difficulties associated with \nraising a family while serving in Congress and I respect and admire his \ndecision to do what is right for his family and their future. Nancy and \nI wish Dirk, Patricia, and their children all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12378-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12378-S12379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR JOHN GLENN\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute on my \nbehalf, and on behalf of the people of New Mexico, to a true American \npatriot, Senator John Glenn. It has indeed been a privilege to serve in \nthis Chamber for 24 years with a man of such honor and distinction.\n  Although I only served with Senator Glenn on the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee for a brief time, I have been able to witness \nfirsthand John Glenn's legendary fairness and leadership. I doubt there \nhas ever been a Senator who could match his dogged determination. He \nworked tirelessly for\n\n[[Page S12379]]\n\nmany years to cut government waste and improve the efficiency of \ngovernment, and I applaud his efforts.\n  Since his arrival in 1974, John Glenn has championed the cause of \nspace exploration and research, an area of particular interest and \nimportance to my home state of New Mexico. He has long understood, and \nI strongly concur with him, that the United States has a unique \nopportunity and obligation to the pursuit of knowledge and exploration \nof the heavens. Thanks to Senator Glenn's continuing sense of duty and \nservice to his country, we will expand our understanding of space and \nits effects on the human body.\n  The success of our space program has enabled our children to dream of \ndifferent worlds, our scientists to explore the nature of matter and \nthe origins of time, and us to be able to look up into the night sky \nand to understand what we see. John Glenn played a crucial role in \nachieving this success. His flight on Friendship 7 was one of the first \nindications of the greatness of America's space program. His flight on \nDiscovery will be a continuation of the greatness John Glenn helped \nestablished--and a confirmation of the contributions senior Americans \ncan, and do, make in our society.\n  John Glenn's life as a military hero, space pioneer, and statesman is \nthe stuff of legends. Although his time here in the Senate draws to a \nclose, he assures us that the legend will grow when he takes off on the \nshuttle Discovery later this month. It truly has been a pleasure to \nwork with the distinguished Senator from Ohio.

I have been here since the beginning of his Senate career and \nhave witnessed his many accomplishments over the years. His tenure has \nrepresented a shining example of hard work, honesty, and integrity.\n  Senator Ford and I served on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee for many years together and shared a mutual interest in \nenergy policy. He has been a strong advocate of the disposal of \nchemical weapons at the Blue Grass Army Depot in Kentucky and has stood \nfirm in his commitment to exploring safe, affordable, and \nenvironmentally sound alternatives to chemical weapons incineration. He \nunderstands the threats of nuclear proliferation and we have shared a \ncommon desire to ensure proper stewardship of nuclear stockpiles across \nthe globe. I have appreciated his valuable contribution to this mission \nand will miss his presence on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee.\n  An accomplished public servant, Senator Ford served his country in \nWorld War II, was elected Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and \nas a Senator, established himself as a national leader in energy, \naviation, and federal-election reform policy. However, he may be best \nknown for his steadfast commitment to serving the people of his beloved \nhome state, Kentucky. He has diligently sought to create opportunities \nfor the people of America and I am confident that upon his return to \nKentucky, he will continue to give as generously of himself as he did \nduring his 22 years of service in Congress.\n  I believe that I speak on behalf of all members of the Senate when I \nsay that Wendell's leadership, talent, and friendship will be sorely \nmissed. I am grateful that I had the opportunity to work with him and \nhope that when the time comes for me to leave office, I will be as well \nrespected as Senator Wendell Ford by my constituency and colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  Wendell, on behalf of myself and the State of New Mexico, I commend \nyou on job very well done and wish you and Jean continued health and \nhappiness in your retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12379-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12379]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about some of \nthe impending debate going on right now to try to close out these final \ndays of this Congress. As you know, most of the talk is centered around \nthe issue of education. While I was sitting here listening, I thought \nreally that most Members of Congress that are up for election were back \nhome campaigning. But I guess they are not, because some have been here \nthis afternoon campaigning on the floor of the Senate. I heard today \nsome of the outlines of what was basically their very liberal agenda, \nwhich did not pass some very radical proposals that this Congress did \nnot accept.\n  They talked about delays and about the lack of work in this session, \nbut they didn't mention that this Congress has required more cloture \nmotions just to try to get issues onto the floor. We have also heard, I \nthink, some real tall tales of revision of the history of budget \nnegotiations, et cetera, talking about how much credit should go to \nthis President for the current economic benefits that we are reaping. \nBut somehow they forget a lot of the work done during the 1980s, like \nthe tax cut, deregulation of many industries, the productivity of \nworkers and companies that have basically produced more revenue for \nthis Government to allow us to balance the budget. It really hasn't \nbeen anything that this President has done to balance the budget.\n  If you talked about this big budget plan offered in 1993--which I am \nproud to say not one Republican supported because the centerpiece of \nthat plan was just like every other Democratic proposal over the last \n40 years--that was to raise taxes on the American people in order to \ntry to solve what they saw as a crisis or problem, but the real intent \nwas to enlarge and expand the size and scope of Government, to bring \nmore control to Washington. This plan raised $263 billion in new \ntaxes--the largest tax increase in history in this country--which has \nnow taken the average American family to the highest levels of taxation \nin history, with over 42 percent for the average American going to \ntaxes. That means you work just about as much time to support \nGovernment as you are allowed to work to raise your family, to support \nyour family--health care, educational needs, food, clothing, shelter, \net cetera.\n  I have to say that if it was such a great idea to raise taxes and \nthat solves the problems, I don't know why we don't simply say let's \nraise taxes to\n\n[[Page S12380]]\n\n100 percent of what you make so the Government can be real sure that it \ntakes care of every need that you have, and we can be on the floor here \nbragging next year, or the year after and the year after how great \nWashington has done.\n  When you see some of the waste, fraud and abuse in this Government, \nthe bureaucracy--and we can sit here and say that Washington can handle \nproblems better than the American family. Mr. President, that kind of \nbaffles the mind. Some people think raising taxes and sending more \nmoney to Washington is a godsend, and it has somehow taken care of all \nthe problems in this country, when I don't think too many people out \nthere would want Washington to be their own financial adviser when they \ncan't even count on Social Security to be there. I wanted to express \nmore concern and basically disappointment over what appears to be an \neleventh-hour attempt now by the President to force straitjacket \neducation policy on our Nation's schools and children.\n  The President brought this up a year ago in his State of the Union \nAddress. There has been no legislation or ideas brought to the floor on \nincreasing the size or putting more teachers into the classroom. \nEverybody can agree that education is probably one of the most \nimportant things that we need in this country. Again, I don't know if \npeople want to give that control over to Washington and have them \nhiring teachers, telling us who we can hire and fire in the classroom. \nThey would go from there to what the curriculum is going to be. Then \nthey would tell us what to teach the children and what books to read.\n  When you talk about revision of history and what we have heard here \non the budget issues alone, can you imagine what our textbooks are \ngoing to be like when we hear some apologizing for Christopher \nColumbus? Can you imagine the difference in the wealth and lifestyle of \nthis great country? In some of our textbooks, Christopher Columbus is \nbeing viewed as somebody who did things wrong. Sure, there were \nproblems back then, and there were new diseases brought to this \ncontinent. But to say now that we should be apologizing for what \nChristopher Columbus did, or maybe apologize for how this country ended \nWorld War II--nobody wanted to use the bomb, but to rewrite the stories \nof the Enola Gay and say America was somehow responsible for World War \nII, we didn't start the war. We had to find a way to end it. It was not \na pleasant way to do it, but it did save lives from the day-to-day \nfighting. There would not have only been thousands more American \nsoldiers who would have died, in addition to the thousands who died in \nWorld War II, but thousands more Japanese civilians would have been \nkilled as well.\n\n  Mr. President, President Clinton and others in Congress have decided \nto renew their one-size-fits-all argument that they know how best to \nspend education dollars for each and every student, in each and every \nschool in the country, from the inner city to rural classrooms.\n  Education for all is a top priority, as I mentioned. All of us have \nthe top priority of education for our children and grandchildren. That \npoliticians are using it today as a last-ditch political coverup, I \nbelieve, is beneath contempt. The central charge being made is that the \nRepublican-led Congress hasn't met the demands for increases in \neducation spending. This simply is not the case.\n  According to the Senate Budget Committee, in the last three budget \ncycles during which Republicans have controlled Congress, this Congress \nhas provided $79 billion, or 97 percent of the President's education \nrequests.\n  In other words, in 5 of the last 6 years, there has been less than a \n3-percent difference between the President's request for education \noutlays and what Congress has provided. And to suggest otherwise is \nnothing but pure politics.\n  As we have seen time and time again in Washington, it is very easy to \njust go out there and try to up the ante. When I say that, what they \nare trying to do out here is bribe the American people with your money. \nIn other words, they just want to take a little bit more of our money \nto Washington, raise your taxes, erode your tax bases, take more money \naway from your tax base to support your own local schools so they can \nup the ante out here in Washington, because Washington can't give you \nanything. It can't enrich your school districts until it takes \nsomething from you. So it has to take money from you to bring it to \nWashington and promise you something that they are going to give back, \nbut with a lot of strings--and by the way, a lot less money, because by \nthe time you support the buildings and bureaucracy here in Washington, \nyou are only getting pennies on the dollar back.\n  Somehow, they promise you something, but they don't tell you who is \ngoing to pay for it. Sure, some might be getting more money back than \nthey paid, but most Americans are going to pay more in taxes to get \nthis type of help from Washington. When you give that control to \nWashington, you as parents lose control at home over what decisions are \ngoing to be made, whether it is over teachers, curriculum, et cetera.\n  So upping the ante here, its easy for somebody to try to outbid the \nother, saying let's do $3 billion or $5 billion or $7 billion--it is \nall your money. So it is easy to up the ante so as to be able to \ncomplain that Congress isn't spending enough. We have seen this \npainfully played out, for example, in making emergency moneys available \nfor our Nation's farmers.\n  One tell-tale sign that the administration's proposals are for \n``show'' only is that they cannot be met without breaking the budget. I \nheard here a while ago that the spending bidding wars the President is \ntalking about right now is not going to break the budget, that it is \nall offset. I don't know where it is coming from. I haven't seen the \noffsets. The only offset I have seen is that it is going to come out of \nthe budget surplus.\n  Something in the neighborhood of $20 billion of surplus money is \nalready being spent by this administration. He is trying to twist the \narms of the Republican Congress to go along with this looming threat of \na possible Government shutdown, or saying we don't care about \neducation, or we don't care about the American farmer. But somehow \nRepublicans wanted to give a tax break because some of the surplus \nmoney is from larger revenues due to income growth. We say, if we are \noverbilling the American people, maybe we should give some money back. \nThey say, you can't do that, and they say they think about Social \nSecurity first. That tax cut would have been about $7 billion in the \nyear 1999. That was too much money to give $7 billion back, which would \namount to basically less than $1 a month per person in this country.\n\n  That is a huge tax cut--less than $1 a month--$7 billion? They \ncouldn't do that. But yet $20 billion of that surplus can be spent. And \nthey are saying, ``Well, we are not taking this out of the surplus; we \nare going to offset it.'' I would like to know where they are \noffsetting it, and, if they are offsetting it in some programs, I would \nlike to know where those programs are going to be able to get along \nwith less money, after all of this year trying to work out budgets \nthrough our committees. The President knows this.\n  The only offset proposal has been through increased tobacco taxes. \nThat is what we heard earlier this year. That is how the President was \ngoing to pay for 100,000 new teachers. That is how the President was \ngoing to pay for rebuilding new schools. And that, by the way, is the \nprerogative, the responsibility, the opportunity, of the local school \nboards and school districts. They should be doing this--not the Federal \nGovernment, because the Federal Government then has to make money from \nthem to give back to them. But, in the meantime, they lose a lot of \ncontrol and authority. But when there was no tobacco bill this year--\nagain, this is one of the radical liberal agendas that did not pass \nthis Congress that we have heard complaints about. Again, I am very \nproud to have voted against that piece of legislation. But there is no \nmoney there.\n  So, if there is no money from the tobacco legislation, now the \nPresident is saying we are going to have to dip into something else. \nBut it is going to come out of the surplus, and that is the extra money \nthat you have worked for, which Washington now has and won't give back. \nCongress has rejected that plan. The President has now proposed an \nalternative method of financing his proposal.\n\n[[Page S12381]]\n\n  Another giveaway as to the political nature of this last-minute \ndemagoguing is the plain fact that simply spending more money in \nWashington for the sake of spending more money does nothing to solve \nthe education problems in this country. I think the President should \npay attention to the fact that it is going to take a little more time \nand a little more effort to solve these problems than he has been \nwilling to devote in the past.\n  If this is such an important issue, which I think it is, I think we \nneed to have Congress to bring it before our committee. Let's sit down \nand debate it and lay it all out and see where the advantages are, how \nmuch it is going to cost and where the money is going to come from, \nrather than the President trying to again break arms and jam it into an \nomnibus budget bill. In fact, spending money blindly may ultimately do \nmore harm than good.\n  According to a recent article in the Washington Post,\n\n       The nation's largest study examining the use of computers \n     in schools has concluded that the $5 billion being spent each \n     year on educational technology is actually hurting children \n     in many cases because the computers aren't being put to good \n     use.\n\n  While I support teaching out kids to use technology, and computers \nare an important part of this, I do not believe high-tech classrooms \nare the only priority.\n  And, while spending great sums of money on technology-education is \nfeel-good politics for those who spend the money, it can come, as we've \nseen, at the expense of our kids.\n  Last year, the American Management Association found that two-thirds \nof managers said new employees had strong computer skills, but that \nonly 29 percent said the employees could write competently.\n  I am always reminded of a story, because I think it suggests some \nvery serious education problems in this country: A small school \ndistrict in northern Minnesota was being given an award because their \nstudents had ranked among the top in the scores that year. In the test \nscores out there, their students had ranked among the top. Somebody \ncame up, and while they were going through some of the records, they \nnoticed that this school district had some of the lowest costs per \npupil in the State. So the question was asked: ``How can you account \nfor having higher test scores when you have had some of the lowest \nspending per pupil year?'' The principal said, ``I don't know how to \nexplain it.'' He said, ``All we can basically do is offer our kids the \nbasics.''\n  In other words, they were teaching them to read, to write, and to do \narithmetic rather than the ``feel good'' diversity type programs that \nwe see teachers now hamstrung with today. They can spend less than half \nof their costs on the basics, because the Government dictates today \nalready preclude them from teaching their kids the basics.\n  When they talk about money in this country, that we are not spending \nenough money--we spend more on education; it is only second to health \ncare. About $450 billion a year goes to education. That is more than \nany country in the world spends per student per year. In fact, if you \nlook at the numbers, the United States spends nearly twice as much per \nstudent per year as any country in the world. Yet we rank 14 out of 14 \nof the industrialized nations in the world in test scores when it comes \nto math and sciences and the ability to write.\n  So, if other countries can spend less and get more, where is the \nproblem? The problem isn't the amount of money that we are spending on \neducation, it is how that money is being used. And now, to say if we \ncould only come back and throw some more money at it--I will give you \nan example. Back in the 1950s, if we adjusted to inflation today, the \nStates were spending an average of about $600 per student per year in \neducation. Today, 1998, we are spending well over $6,000 per student \nper year--from $600 in 1950 to over $6,000 today.\n  The District of Columbia spends over $10,000. In Minnesota, the city \nof Minneapolis spends over $10,000 per student and yet has some of the \nlowest test scores in the State.\n  So, again, is it the money? Or is it some of the ways that we are \nteaching our children, or some of the programs, or the time that our \nkids are being given to study the basics in order to learn?\n  I think the ones who really come out on the short end of this are the \nstudents. While we are up here debating all of this, saying that we \nneed all this curriculum, that we need all this money, that we need all \nthis stuff, our kids are graduating with some of the lowest test scores \naround the world, without the ability to compete in the next \ngeneration. They are the ones being shortchanged while a lot of this \ndebate is going on here. I think those problems show that our students \nare not learning the basics despite our spending efforts.\n  Over the last 30 years, as I have mentioned, we have increasingly \nspent more of the Nation's money on education. Nominal spending has \nrisen eightfold since 1969.\n  Furthermore, a recent Wall Street Journal article reports that in the \npast 45 years the average pupil-teacher ratio in this country has \nalready fallen by 35 percent. In the past 45 years, the student-teacher \nratio has fallen 35 percent. Yet, our test scores have fallen with it. \nThe SAT scores have stagnated, and the international tests have put \nthem at the bottom.\n  In Math and Science General Knowledge tests, United States students \nranked 16th out of 21 in science, behind Russia and Slovenia but ahead \nof Cyprus.\n  In math, United States students ranked 19th out of 21 countries, \nbehind Russia, Slovenia, Hungary, and Lithuania. America already \noutspends every other country per child on education, and ranked among \nthe bottom of all.\n  Clearly, simply spending more money is not the answer to better \nlearning. If it were, we certainly wouldn't have these sorts of test \nscores to show for it.\n  The answers to our education problems do not lie in ``wired \nclassrooms.'' No computer can take the place of a good teacher. \nInstead, I believe that the answers to learning are found in each and \nevery teacher-child relationship, in each and every classroom.\n  There is no amount of money that can replace a teacher who cares and \nwants to reach kids, and has the freedom to do so.\n  This freedom comes with the authority to make decisions based on \nlocal needs--not dictates from Washington, not more control from \nWashington, not more strings attached to the classrooms from \nWashington. I have continually supported plans which would return money \nand also return control from Washington to parents, to teachers, and to \nlocal school districts. After all, I think they know best how to spend \ntheir education dollars.\n  Plans such as the Education Savings and School Excellence Act would \nhave been an important step toward accomplishing this.\n  This bipartisan education reform legislation would have allowed low- \nand middle-income families to open education savings accounts to pay \nfor the particular education needs of their children--from textbooks to \ntutoring to tuition.\n  Unfortunately, for families and students, President Clinton vetoed \nthis legislation. There has been an agenda dealing with education in \nthis Congress this year. It has gone nowhere, because the President and \nthose Members on that side of the aisle --the Democrats--have disagreed \nand have stalled the efforts, or have vetoed it with the President's \nplan, claiming that it would divert resources from public education. \nThis is false. The Education Savings and School Excellence Act would \nnot have touched 1 cent of Federal spending for education--would not \nhave touched 1 cent of the surplus either. It would have come from \nparents being able to set aside more of their own money so that they \ncould decide how they wanted to spend it for their children's \neducation--whether they needed additional tutoring, or tuition to go to \na private or parochial school, or whatever the parent decided they \nneeded. But they vetoed that plan.\n  The reason the President vetoed this legislation--and I will be \ngenerous with this inference--is because he thinks he knows what is \nbest for each and every student if America.\n  But I would ask my colleagues to reflect on this for just a moment \nand to see if they aren't forced to come to the same conclusion: To \nthink that the U.S. Government should impose a rigid\n\n[[Page S12382]]\n\ngeneric formula on day-to-day decisions for all students is nothing \nshort of frightening.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank you very much for the time, and I hope we \ncan work out these questions in the remaining days. Some of the \nquestions now do not relate to the amount of money being spent on \neducation but is being narrowed down to who is spending it, who \ncontrols it. I think the Republicans have made it very clear that if \nthe money is to be spent, it should go to local school districts so \nthat the parents and the teachers and local officials can decide how \nthat money should be spent, not Washington. But on the other side, they \nwould rather have the money come here to Washington so they can \ndisperse it, so they can tell parents, teachers, local school districts \nand local officials how those dollars should be spent. I think \nAmericans would rather have those local options left to themselves \nbecause this is incrementalism at its best. If you let Washington get \nits foot in the door, the camel's nose under the tent, it is only going \nto be a matter of time before they want more and more control over \neducation in this country.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns).

Mr. President, over the past several days, the White \nHouse has bombarded the airwaves with rhetoric suggesting that \ncongressional Republicans have turned a deaf ear to the needs of our \nnation's students. Hearing all this, I have to say I feel like I have \nentered a parallel universe. Less than one week ago, I was standing in \nthat same White House listening to the President laud one of the most \nsignificant bipartisan achievements of the 105th Congress--enactment of \nthe Higher Education Amendments of 1998.\n  Lost in all the pre-election maneuvering is any recognition of the \nsolid record of accomplishment by this Congress on behalf of students \nfrom pre-school through graduate school. I would like to take a few \nminutes to review that record.\n\n\n           Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)\n\n  One of the first measures considered by the 105th Congress was the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Amendments of 1997. \nThe development of this legislation involved a level of cooperation \nwhich is virtually unprecedented--between Republicans and Democrats, \nHouse and Senate, and Congress and the Administration. The leadership \ndemonstrated by Senator Lott was critical to the success of this \neffort, as was the many hours of work by my colleagues on the Labor and \nHuman Resources Committee--particularly Senators Kennedy, Coats, \nHarkin, Frist, Dodd, and Gregg.\n  The result of this bipartisan effort is a law which strengthens our \nassistance to States for making a free appropriate public education \navailable to children with disabilities. Major principles underlying \nthe reauthorization bill included: placing an emphasis on prevention; \nbasing procedures and paperwork on common sense and accountability for \nresults; developing a coherent policy for dealing with disciplinary \nactions; and offering local school districts options for fiscal relief.\n  In addition, we have followed up words with action by providing \nsubstantial funding increases for IDEA. I was extremely disappointed \nthat the Administration's fiscal year 1999 budget included no increase \nfor special education funding for children with disabilities from 3 \nthrough 21 years of age--not even an adjustment for inflation. \nFortunately, due to the prodding of Senator Gregg and others, Congress \nhad increased special education funding by more than 60 percent over \nthe past two years. In fiscal year 1996, we provided about $2.3 billion \nfor IDEA state grants. That figure was increased to $3.1 billion in FY \n1997 and increased again to $3.8 billion in FY 1998. We expect to add \nat least another $500 million this year.\n\n\n                          Taxpayer Relief Act\n\n  Bipartisan cooperation also led to the inclusion of a substantial \ninvestment in education as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act signed into \nlaw last summer. This act contains 11 types of education tax breaks \namounting to $40 billion over 5 years--the most significant of which is \nthe HOPE Scholarship credit.\n\n\n                Emergency Student Loan Consolidation Act\n\n  Late last year, the President signed into law a measure designed to \nprovide relief to borrowers who were unable to consolidate their \nstudent loans due to the suspension of the Direct Loan consolidation \nloan program. On August 26, 1997, the Department of Education suspended \nits consolidation loan program in an effort to deal with the backlog of \n84,000 applications which had piled up prior to that time.\n\n\n                      National Science Foundation\n\n  This summer, Congress completed action on the first major reform of \nthe National Science Foundation in a decade. Approved unanimously by \nboth bodies of the Congress, this legislation responds to our Nation's \nchanging research and technology needs and provides $11 billion over \nthree years to ensure our continued world leadership in science and \ntechnology. As a result of leadership provided by members of the Senate \nLabor and Human Resources Committee, particularly Senators Kennedy, \nFrist, Dodd, and Collins, these funds will be used to support more than \n19,000 competitively awarded projects at over 2,000 colleges, \nuniversities, elementary schools, and high schools.\n  Through this authorization, we provided for the greatest investment \nin basic math, science, and engineering research in our Nation's \nhistory. An often overlooked feature of the measure is the dramatic \ninvestment being made to develop and strengthen our Nation's human \nresources.\n  The reauthorization bill reflects the critical need for greater \ninvestment in systemic education reform, professional development, \ncurriculum reform, as well as informal science education. It provides \nmore than $1.2 billion over three years to strengthen our nation's \ncapacity to teach math and science to secondary and elementary \nstudents. More than $300 million of these funds will be used to ensure \nthat our Nation's math and science teachers have the knowledge and \nskills they need to prepare their students. Another $300 million will \nbe used to support model efforts at systemic education reform. An \nadditional $800 million will be used to strengthen the quality and \navailability of math, science and engineering education at our nation's \ncolleges and universities.\n\n\n                  Adult Education and Family Literacy\n\n  Yet another example of the progress which can be made when partisan \ndifferences are set aside is legislation signed into law by the \nPresident this August, which supports programs that assist \neducationally disadvantaged adults in developing basic literacy skills, \nachieving high school equivalency certification, and learning English. \nThese provisions comprised the education component of comprehensive \nlegislation known as the Workforce Investment Act to which Senators \nKennedy, DeWine, and Wellstone made significant contributions \nthroughout the process.\n  The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act provides assistance for \nthose adults most in need of acquiring literacy skills. Of the \napproximately 4 million adults who annually receive services under this \nprogram, 75 percent usually come into the program with below 8th grade \nliteracy skills.\n  This legislation emphasizes the importance of coordinating adult \neducation programs with employment and training activities and family \nliteracy initiatives. It also establishes a comprehensive \naccountability system to assess the effectiveness of the activities \nundertaken by States and local communities. The establishment of \naccountability measures will enable the federal government to optimize \nits investment in adult education and family literacy activities. This \ninvestment stands at $385 million today.\n\n\n                          Higher Education Act\n\n  As I mentioned earlier, one of the most significant bipartisan \nachievements of this Congress is the Higher Education Amendments which \nwere signed into law last week. From the start of this process, in both \nthe House and Senate, the development of this legislation was a joint \nventure on the part of Republicans and Democrats. In the Senate, I \nworked closely with Senators Kennedy, Coats, and Dodd each step of the \nway. In addition, every single member of the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee--as well as many Members outside the committee--made positive \ncontributions to this measure.\n\n[[Page S12383]]\n\n  Since its inception in 1965, the Higher Education Act has been \nfocused on enhancing the opportunities of students to pursue \npostsecondary education. The grant, loan, and work study assistance \nmade available by this Act has made the difference for countless \nmillions in pursuing their dreams for a better life.\n  In the face of rising college costs, the 1998 amendments have \nprovided students with the lowest cost loans in nearly two decades. \nWith increasing concern about the quality of our nation's teachers, \nthis act will take giant steps in improving teacher preparation. And \nwith students, parents, and--frankly--Senators concerned about the \ndelivery of student aid, this act completely overhauls the federal role \nby placing it in the hands of a professional and accountable agency \nwithin the Department of Education.\n  I believe the lasting legacy of this reauthorization bill will be its \nprovisions dealing with teachers. At its foundation, it embraces the \nnotion that investing in the preparation of our nation's teachers is a \ngood one. Well prepared teachers play a key role in making it possible \nfor our students to achieve the standards required to assure both their \nown well being and the ability of our country to compete \ninternationally. In fact, the continued health and strength of our \nnation depends on our country's ability to improve the education of our \nyoung people. Integral to that is the strength and ability of our \nnation's teaching force. Without a strong, competent, well prepared \nteaching force, other investments in education will be of little value.\n\n\n           carl d. perkins vocational-technical education act\n\n  The story does not end here, as several other important education \ninitiatives are ``in the pipeline'' on the way to the President. Last \nweek, the House and Senate gave final approval to legislation designed \nto more fully develop the academic, technical, and vocational skills of \nsecondary and postsecondary students enrolled in vocational and \ntechnical education programs in order for the United States to be more \ncompetitive in the world economy.\n  This legislation is an important complement to the Workforce \nInvestment Act and benefitted from the same bipartisan teamwork which \nproduced that Act. The Workforce Investment Act streamlined and \nconsolidated a myriad of job training programs and also put into place \ntough accountability mechanisms. The 1998 Perkins reauthorization \nemphasizes the important balance between a strong academic background \nand a vocational and technical education system that reflects today's \nglobal economy.\n  There are presently between 200,000 and 300,000 unfilled positions in \nthe technology field. The reason for the difficulty in filling these \npositions is not because of low unemployment numbers, but because of \nthe lack of skilled workers. These positions require an excellent \nvocational education system and the ability to pursue further technical \neducation following high school.\n\n\n                         Reading Excellence Act\n\n  Also in line for signature by the President is the Reading Excellence \nAct. The purpose of this legislation is to improve both the reading \nskills of students and the instructional practices for teachers who \nteach reading, and to expand family literacy programs--including the \nEven Start program. States and local communities will work together as \na partnership in providing professional development activities to \nteachers and other instructional staff and in carrying out family \nliteracy efforts.\n\n\n                               Head Start\n\n  Under the leadership of Senator Coats, and with the assistance of \nSenators Dodd and Kennedy, we will also enact this Congress a \nreauthorization of the Head Start program. Recognizing the critical \nrole of the pre-school years in a young child's development, this \nlegislation expands the Early Head Start program for our youngest \nchildren in a manner which balances the desire to make this program \navailable to more children and families and the need to ensure that \nevery Head Start program meets the high standards of quality that we \nhave demanded.\n  The new evaluation and research provisions will provide much-needed \ninformation about how the program operates, help identify the ``best \npractices,'' and will guide the grantees, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, and Congress to continue the improvements in Head Start \nwhich began four years ago.\n\n\n                            Charter Schools\n\n  Finally, the President will soon be presented with the Charter School \nExpansion Act of 1998. Senators Coats and Lieberman are to be \nparticularly commended for their skill and persistence in forging a \nbipartisan alliance on behalf of this legislation. The purpose of this \nlegislation is to provide financial assistance for the planning, \ndesign, and initial implementation of new charter schools. This \nassistance will enhance the efforts of states and local communities to \nincrease the number of charter schools and will help meet the \nPresident's goal of having 3,000 charter schools by the year 2000.\n  In terms of education, I believe that the 105th Congress is among the \nmost productive in my memory. The actions we have taken this Congress \ntouch the lives of students of all ages--from youngsters in Head Start \nand Even Start, to special education students, to high school \nvocational students, to college undergraduates and graduate students, \nto adults in need of remedial education.\n  It is unfortunate that all of this work seems to have been forgotten. \nIt is also unfortunate that no one is acknowledging that congressional \nRepublicans stand ready to spend as much money on education as we have \noffsets to support.\n  Instead, an effort appears to be underway to convince the American \npublic that failing to fund an untested and unauthorized program to \nreduce class size should be taken as a sign of total neglect of \neducation by this Congress. The facts just don't support that \nconclusion. The number of teachers is not as important as the quality \nof teachers. On the Federal level we must focus on promoting and \nensuring quality. We don't necessarily need millions of new teachers--\nwhat we really need are millions of good teachers.\n  To hear the President and his advisers, hiring more teachers and \nreducing classroom size is the silver bullet which will solve the many \ndeficiencies now plaguing our elementary and secondary schools. What we \nshould all know by now is that there are no silver bullets when it \ncomes to assuring the quality of education.\n  Rather, the only way to achieve the goals we seek is through the \nconstant, day-to-day plugging away on behalf of the highest possible \nstandards in all our education endeavors. I believe that the Congress \nis doing its part and that we have the legislative record to back that \nup.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12382-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE CITIES OF BRISTOL, TENNESSEE AND \n                           BRISTOL, VIRGINIA\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Sanctions for failure to land or to bring to; sanctions for \n              obstruction of boarding or providing false \n              information.''.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent the committee amendments be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Committee amendments were withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3813\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Senator Snowe has a substitute amendment at the desk. I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for Ms. Snowe, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3813.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering S. 1259, \nthe Coast Guard Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 1998, 1999, and \n2000. Members of the Subcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries have been \nworking on this legislation for much of the past year. My substitute \namendment incorporates changes made to the bill since the Commerce \nCommittee reported it, and which enjoys strong bipartisan support. \nThese changes are based on comments that we received from a number of \nsenators.\n  The Coast Guard is one of our nation's most important agencies. It \naids people in distress, prevents injury and the loss of life, defends \nour oceans borders from the scourge of illegal drugs and other national \nsecurity threats, maintains the safety of our waterways, and performs \nmany other essential missions with a high degree of professionalism. My \nState of Maine has a 3,500 mile coastline, and the Coast Guard plays an \nindispensable role in the safety and economy of the many people who \nlive along the coast. The same is true for every other coastal state in \nthe nation.\n  In 1996, we enacted the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1996, which \nauthorized the Coast Guard through fiscal year 1997. The substitute \namendment before us today reauthorizes appropriations and personnel \nlevels for the Coast Guard through fiscal year 2000. In each of fiscal \nyears 1999 and 2000, it authorizes $100 million over the \nadministration's fiscal year 1999 for drug interdiction activities. \nThese increases will restore Coast Guard drug interdiction to the \nfiscal year 1997 level. The amendment also includes various provisions \nthat, among other things, are designed to provide greater flexibility \nto the Coast Guard on personnel administration, streamline the \ninventory management process, eliminate an unnecessary reporting \nrequirement, enhance the safety of marine transportation, and \nstrengthen Coast Guard law enforcement activities.\n  Several provisions of the amendment that are particularly important \nto people in Maine and other states deserve special mention. Section \n301 requires the Coast Guard to ensure that alcohol testing of vessel \ncrew members is conducted within 2 hours of marine accidents, unless \nsafety considerations prevent it. This section also increases the \nmaximum civil penalties for failure to adhere to alcohol/drug testing \nprocedures and for operating a vessel while intoxicated.\n  Section 310 requires the Coast Guard to issue a report identifying \nU.S. waters out to 50 miles that cannot currently be reached within 2 \nhours by a Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter. The report must \nidentify options to ensure that these areas can be covered by a \nhelicopter within 2 hours.\n  Section 313 authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to establish, \nin consultation with the International Maritime Organization, two \nmandatory ship reporting systems in Cape Cod Bay and the Great South \nChannel (east of Cape Cod). Ships entering these areas will have to \nreport to the Coast Guard so that the Coast Guard may track their \nmovements and provide them with information on whale sightings. The \nprovision is intended to protect against ship strikes of the highly \nendangered Northern right whale.\n  Title V of the bill contains S. 1480, the Harmful Algal Bloom and \nHypoxia Research and Control Act, a bill that I have sponsored with a \nnumber of senators on both sides of the aisle. The Commerce Committee \nrecently reported the bill with unanimous bipartisan support. It \ndirects the administration to develop plans for dealing more \neffectively with harmful algal blooms like pfiesteria and hypoxia, or \nthe dead zone, in the Gulf of Mexico. It also authorizes additional \nfunding for NOAA's research and monitoring activities on harmful algal \nblooms and hypoxia.\n  Mr. President, I wish to emphasize one very important point with \nrespect to these plans in title V, particularly the plan on Northern \nGulf of Mexico hypoxia. The language in its provision requires the plan \nto be developed in conjunction with the States. The intent of this \nlanguage is to ensure that the States play a substantial and \nconstructive role in each stage of the development of the plan, and \nthat their concerns and recommendations will be address by the \nadministration before a plan is completed. Finding creative and \nsensible solutions to the Gulf of Mexico hypoxia problem will not be \npossible without the advice and cooperation of the affected States.\n  This bipartisan bill reflects many months of painstaking effort and \ncompromise. It will help to ensure that the Coast Guard will be able to \nperform its critical missions over the next 2 years. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the bill before us \ntoday which would authorize the programs and activities of the U.S. \nCoast Guard for fiscal years 1998, 1999 and 2000.\n  Mr. President, Massachusetts with its hundreds of miles of coastline, \nunforgiving storms, active maritime and fishing industries, and \nthriving recreational boating population, needs the Coast Guard at full \nstrength. So does the rest of the nation.\n  That is why I am pleased to support the bill before us today. I would \nlike to describe some of the ways in which this bill addresses the \nchallenges facing the Coast Guard. Our nation's maritime navigational \ninfrastructure is of critical importance to a healthy economy. Over 95 \npercent of our nation's imports and exports are transported through our \ncoastal waters by commercial shipping. This bill authorizes funds for \nthe acquisition, construction, rebuilding, and improvement of aids to \nnavigation, shore and offshore facilities, vessels, and aircraft. In \naddition, I am extremely pleased that the bill authorizes necessary \nfunding which will extend the useful life of the LORAN-C System. While \nthe Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) has revolutionized \nprecise navigation by ships and aircraft, we must recognize that there \nare still millions who rely on LORAN-C.\n  One of the most important functions of the Coast Guard is to promote \nmarine safety and environmental protection. This bill calls on the \nSecretary to establish procedures to ensure that after a serious marine \nincident occurs, alcohol testing of crew members or other persons \nresponsible for the operation or other safety-sensitive functions of \nthe vessel or vessels involved in such an incident is conducted no \nlater than 2 hours after the incident occurs.\n  I am pleased to see included here a provision designed to protect \nright whales. I worked closely with the Coast Guard and others to \nensure that this bill included language that calls on the Secretary to \nimplement and enforce two mandatory ship reporting systems, consistent \nwith international law. One of these areas is located offshore of the \nCape Cod Bay and Great South Channel. Upon entry into one of these \nareas, ships will be made aware of right whale sightings in order to \nlower the possibility of collision with these marine mammals.\n  I am very pleased that this bill includes three land conveyances \nwhich transfer properties from the Coast Guard to Massachusetts \ncommunities: conveyance of communication station Boston Marshfield \nreceiver site; conveyance of Nahant Parcel, Essex County; and \nconveyance of the Coast Guard Loran Station Nantucket.\n  Mr. President, I am especially supportive of this bill's inclusion of \nlanguage which will relieve the hiring freeze on the Commissioned Corps \nof the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), first \nimposed following the 1995 National Performance Review. This provision, \nwhich I\n\n[[Page S12389]]\n\nam pleased to have sponsored, will guarantee consistent stewardship of \nthe NOAA Corps and the very important role the Corps plays in NOAA and \nto our Nation. This legislation will restore stability and renew the \ngood faith contract made with the men and women of the NOAA Corps by \nestablishing a minimum and maximum authorized strength for our nation's \nseventh uniformed service.\n  The NOAA Corps is an indispensable part of NOAA: a pool of \nprofessionals trained in engineering, earth sciences, oceanography, \nmeteorology, fisheries science, and other related disciplines. Corps \nofficers serve in assignments within the five major line offices of \nNOAA. They operate ships, fly aircraft into hurricanes, lead mobile \nfield parties, manage research projects, conduct diving operations, and \nserve in staff positions throughout NOAA. They operate the ships that \nset buoys used to gather oceanographic and meteorological data on \nunusual weather phenomena such as El Nino. They fly research aircraft \ninto hurricanes that record valuable atmospheric observations. They \nconduct hydrographic surveys along our nation's coast in order to make \nour waters safe for maritime commerce.\n  This legislation will establish staffing levels for the NOAA Corps \nthat will provide some assurance of long term viability. It is time \nthat we reaffirm our commitment to studying the earth's oceans and \natmosphere by insuring that the NOAA Corps is staffed at the \nappropriate level.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me again turn to the Coast Guard \nprovisions in this bill. The Coast Guard is essential to the safety and \nwell-being of citizens in every coastal state and in every state with \nnavigable waters. Today, over 50 percent of the U.S. population lives \nwithin coastal areas and directly benefits from the services the Coast \nGuard provides. But, indirectly, the Coast Guard, in the performance of \nits mission, is there to protect every American and every visitor to \nour coastal waters. In fact, more than two-thirds of the total budget \nfor the Coast Guard goes to operating expenses to protect public safety \nand the marine environment; to enforce fishery and other laws and \ntreaties; maintain aids to navigation; prevent illegal drug trafficking \nand illegal immigration; and preserve defense readiness. S. 1259 will \nmake management improvements and enhance law enforcement authority for \nthe Coast Guard, enhancing its ability to accomplish these missions. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to support S. 1259, the \nUnited States Coast Guard Authorization Act. As many of my \ndistinguished colleagues know, I have a great deal of admiration for \nthe Coast Guard, as well as for Coast Guard men and women that carry \nout critical missions for our country. Before going into greater detail \non the importance of the Coast Guard, I wish to discuss an amendment \nthat Senator Ford and I intended to offer to this bill, but have \nwithdrawn in order to address certain concerns raised by my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island, Senator Chafee. Our amendment would have eliminated \nthe unjustified use of strict criminal liability statutes that do not \nrequire a showing of criminal intent or even the slight negligence in \noil spill incidents.\n  Through comprehensive congressional action that led to the enactment \nand implementation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, commonly referred \nto as ``OPA90,'' the United States has successfully reduced the number \nof oil spills in the maritime environment and has established a \ncooperative public/private partnership to respond effectively in the \ndiminishing number of situations when an oil spill occurs. Nonetheless, \nover the course of the last eight years, the use of the unrelated \nstrict criminal liability statutes that I referred to above has \nundermined the spill prevention and response objectives of OPA90, the \nvery objectives that were established by the Congress to preserve the \nenvironment, safeguard the public welfare, and promote the safe \ntransportation of oil. Reasonable, measured refinements in federal law \nare urgently required to preserve the objectives of OPA90 by preventing \nthe unjustified use of strict criminal liability in oil spill \nincidents. Accordingly, I have been working with my distinguished \ncolleague from Kentucky, Senator Ford, and other members of the Senate \nto include legislation in this bill to enact such refinements.\n  As stated in the coast Guard's own environmental enforcement \ndirective, a company, its officers, employees, and mariners, in the \nevent of an oil spill ``could be convicted and sentenced to a criminal \nfine even where [they] took all reasonable precautions to avoid the \ndischarge''. With increasing frequency, responsible operators in my \nhome state of Louisiana and elsewhere in the United States who \ntransport oil are unavoidably exposed to potentially immeasurable \ncriminal fines and, in the worst case scenario, jail time. Not only is \nthis situation unfairly targeting an industry that plays an extremely \nimportant role in our national economy, but it also works contrary to \nthe public welfare.\n  Mr. FORD. As my colleague from Louisiana well knows, most liquid \ncargo transportation companies on the coastal and inland waterway \nsystem of the United States have embraced safe operation and risk \nmanagement as two of their most important and fundamental values. For \nexample, members of the American Waterways Operators (AWO) from \nKentucky, Louisiana, and other states have implemented stronger safety \nprograms that have significantly reduced personal injuries to mariners. \nTank barge fleets have been upgraded through construction of new state-\nof-the-art double hulled tank barges while obsolete single skin barges \nare being retired far in advance of the OPA90 timetable. Additionally, \nAWO members have dedicated significant time and financial resources to \nprovide continuous and comprehensive education and training for vessel \ncaptains, crews and shore side staff, not only in the operation of \nvessels but also in preparation for all contingencies that could occur \nin the transportation of oil products. As of today, more than 90 \npercent of the tugboats, towboats and barges owned and operated by AWO \nmember companies are in compliance with the AWO Responsible Carrier \nProgram (RCP), a program developed by the towing industry, on its own \ninitiative, to improve the overall safety, efficiency, and quality of \nits marine operations. The RCP, complemented by advanced training \nprograms such as the ground breaking wheelhouse resource management and \nsimulator training program for towboat operators, is greatly enhancing \nthe professionalism of mariners engaged in the transportation of oil \nproducts.\n  Mr. President, I know that the commitment to marine safety and \nenvironmental protection by responsible members of the oil \ntransportation industry from Kentucky and elsewhere is real. They \ncontinue to work closely with the Coast Guard to upgrade regulatory \nstandards in such key areas as towing vessel operator qualifications \nand navigation equipment on towing vessels. That commitment is \ndemonstrated by industry-driven safety initiatives like the Responsible \nCarrier Program mentioned above and the Coast Guard-AWO Partnership, \nwhich brings the leadership of the industry together with government to \nsolve marine safety and environmental protection problems.\n  Mr. BREAUX. through the efforts of AWO and other organizations, the \nmaritime transportation industry has achieved an outstanding compliance \nrecord with the numerous laws and regulations enforced by the Coast \nGuard. Let me be clear: responsible carriers, and frankly their \ncustomers, have a ``zero tolerance'' policy for oil spills. For \nexample, I am aware of a major marine transportation company \nheadquartered in Louisiana that has a record of having performed over \n5,300 liquid cargo transfer operations without spilling or \ncontaminating any of the almost 2.8 billion gallons it transferred over \na recent three year period. Additionally, the industry is taking spill \nresponse preparedness seriously. Industry representatives and operators \nroutinely participate in Coast Guard oil spill crisis management \ncourses, PREP Drills, and regional spill response drills. Yet despite \nall of the modernization, safety, and training efforts of the marine \ntransportation industry, their mariners and shoreside employees cannot \nescape the threat of criminal liability in the event of an oil spill, \neven where it is shown that they ``took all reasonable precautions to \navoid [a] discharge''.\n\n[[Page S12390]]\n\n  Mr. President, as you know, in response to the tragic Exxon Valdez \nspill, Congress enacted OPA90. OPA90 mandated new, comprehensive, and \ncomplex regulatory and enforcement requirements for the transportation \nof oil products and for oil spill response. Both the federal government \nand maritime industry have worked hard to accomplish the legislation's \nprimary objective--to provide greater environmental safeguards in oil \ntransportation by creating a comprehensive prevention, response, \nliability, and compensation regime to deal with vessel and facility oil \npollution.\n  Mr. FORD. As my colleague from Louisiana has most ably demonstrated, \nOPA90 is working in a truly meaningful sense. To prevent oil spill \nincidents from occurring in the first place, OPA90 provides an \nenormously powerful deterrent through both its criminal and civil \nliability provisions. Moreover, OPA90 mandates prompt reporting of \nspills, contingency planning, and both cooperation and coordination \nwith federal, state, and local authorities in connection with managing \nthe spill response. Failure to report and cooperate as required by \nOPA90 may impose automatic civil penalties, criminal liability and \nunlimited civil liability. As a result, the number of domestic oil \nspills has been dramatically reduced over the past eight years since \nOPA90 was enacted. Coast Guard statistics reflect that in 1990 there \nwere a total of 35 major and medium oil spills, seven of which were \nmajor spills. In 1997, as a direct result of OPA90, there were no major \noil spills and the number of medium spills had been reduced to eight. \nIn those limited situations in which oil spills unfortunately occurred, \nintensive efforts commenced immediately with federal, state and local \nofficials working in a joint, unified manner with the industry, as \ncontemplated by OPA90, to clean up and report spills as quickly as \npossible and to mitigate to the greatest extent any impact on the \nenvironment. OPA90 has provided a comprehensive and cohesive \n``blueprint'' for proper planning, training, and resource \nidentification to respond to an oil spill incident, and to ensure that \nsuch a response is properly and cooperatively managed.\n  OPA90 also provides a complete statutory framework for proceeding \nagainst individuals for civil and/or criminal penalties arising out of \noil spills in the marine environment. When Congress crafted this Act, \nit carefully balanced the imposition of stronger criminal and civil \npenalties with the need to promote enhanced cooperation among all of \nthe parties involved in the spill prevention and response effort. In so \ndoing, the Congress clearly enumerated the circumstances in which \ncriminal penalties could be imposed for actions related to maritime oil \nspills. In particular, OPA90 properly imposes criminal liability for \nnegligent violations and provides for punishment of up to one year \nimprisonment and/or fines between $2500 and $25,000 per day. The \npunishment for each knowing violation was increased by OPA90 to up to \nthree years imprisonment and/or fines between $5000 and $50,000 per \nday. Furthermore, OPA90 added and/or substantially increased criminal \npenalties under other pre-existing laws which comprehensively govern \nthe maritime transportation of oil and other petroleum products.\n  Mr. BREAUX. My colleague from Kentucky and I do not advocate nor do \nwe support any effort to change the tough criminal sanctions that were \nimposed in OPA90. The criminal sanctions under OPA90 properly follow \nthe traditional notion of what constitutes a criminal act in this \ncountry, namely, that a crime occurs when a knowing, intentional act is \ncommitted or when a party's conduct is so egregious that ``negligence'' \nhas occurred. These tough, comprehensive OPA90 provisions collectively \noperate as a major deterrent for oil spills and should not be changed.\n  However, responsible, law-abiding members of the maritime industry in \nLouisiana and elsewhere are concerned by both the justice Department's \nwillingness in the post-OPA90 environment to use strict criminal \nliability statues and the Coast Guard's increasing attention to \ncriminal enforcement in oil spill incidents. As you know, strict \nliability imposes criminal sanctions without requiring a showing of \ncriminal knowledge, intent or even negligence. These federal actions \nimposing strict liability have created an atmosphere of extreme \nuncertainty for the maritime transportation industry and Oil Spill \nResponse Organizations (OSROs) about how to respond to and cooperate \nwith the Coast Guard and other federal agencies in cleaning up an oil \nspill. Criminal culpability in this country, both historically and as \nreflected in the comprehensive OPA90 legislation itself, typically \nrequires wrongful actions or omissions by individuals through some \ndegree of criminal intent or through the failure to use the required \nstandard of care. However, Federal prosecutors have been employing \nother antiquated, seemingly unrelated ``strict liability'' statutes \nthat do not require a showing of ``knowledge'' or ``intent'' as a basis \nfor criminal prosecution for oil spill incidents. Such strict criminal \nliability statutes as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Refuse Act, \nstatutes that were enacted at the turn of the century to serve other \npurposes, have been used to harass and intimidate the maritime \nindustry, and, in effect, have turned every oil spill into a potential \ncrime scene without regard to the fault or intent of companies, \ncorporate officers and employees, and mariners.\n\n  The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.) provides \nthat ``it shall be unlawful at any time, by any means or in any manner, \nto pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, attempt to take, capture, or \nkill, . . . any migratory bird . . .'', a violation of which is \npunishable by imprisonment and/or fines. Prior to the Exxon Valdez oil \nspill in 1989, the MBTA was primarily used to prosecute the illegal \nactivities of hunters and capturers of migratory birds, as the Congress \noriginally intended when it enacted the MBTA in 1918. In the Exxon \nValdez case itself, and prior to the enactment of OPA90, the MBTA was \nfirst used to support a criminal prosecution against a vessel owner in \nrelation to a maritime oil spill, and this ``hunting statute'' has been \nused ever since against the maritime industry. The ``Refuse Act'' (33 \nU.S.C. 407, 411) was enacted 100 years ago at a time well before \nsubsequent federal legislation essentially replaced it with \ncomprehensive requirements and regulations specifically directed to the \nmaritime transportation of oil and other petroleum products. Such \nstrict liability statutes are unrelated to the regulation and \nenforcement of oil transportation activities, and in fact were not \nincluded within the comprehensive OPA90 legislation as statutes in \nwhich criminal liability could be found. With the prosecutorial use of \nstrict liability statutes, owners and mariners engaged in the \ntransportation of oil cannot avoid exposure to criminal liability, \nregardless of how diligently they adhere to prudent practice and safe \nenvironmental standards. Although conscientious safety and training \nprograms, state-of-the-art equipment, proper operational procedures, \npreventative maintenance programs, and the employment of qualified and \nexperienced personnel will collectively prevent most oil spills from \noccurring, unfortunately spills will still occur on occasion.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, to illustrate Senator Beaux's point, please \npermit me to present a scenario that highlights the dilemma faced by \nthe maritime oil transportation industry in Kentucky. Imagine, if you \nwill, that a company is operating a towing vessel in compliance with \nCoast Guard regulations on the Mississippi River on a calm, clear day \nwith several fully laden tank barges in tow. Suddenly, in what was \ncharted and previously identified to be a clear portion of the \nwaterway, one of the tank barges strikes an unknown submerged object \nwhich shears through its hull and causes a significant oil spill in the \nriver. Unfortunately, in addition to any other environmental damage \nthat may occur, the oil spill kills one or more migratory birds. As you \nknow, under OPA90 the operator must immediately undertake coordinated \nspill response actions with the Coast Guard and other federal, state, \nand local agencies to safeguard the vessel and its crew, clean up the \noil spill, and otherwise mitigate any damage to the surrounding \nenvironment. The overriding objectives at this critical moment are to \nassure personnel and public safety and to clean up the oil spill as \nquickly as possible without constraint. However, in the current \natmosphere the operator must take into\n\n[[Page S12391]]\n\nconsideration the threat of strict criminal liability under the \nMigratory Bird Treaty Act and the Refuse Act, together with their \nattendant imprisonment and fines, despite the reasonable care and \nprecautions taken in the operation and navigation of the two and in the \nspill response effort. Indeed, in the Coast Guard's recently issued \nenvironmental enforcement directive, the statement is made that ``[t]he \ndecision to commit the necessary Coast Guard resources to obtain the \nevidence that will support a criminal prosecution must often be made in \nthe very early stages of a pollution incident.'' Any prudent operator \nwill quickly recognize the dilemma in complying with the mandate to act \ncooperatively with all appropriate public agencies in cleaning up the \noil spill, while at the same time those very agencies may be conducting \na criminal investigation of that operator. Vessel owners and their \nemployees who have complied with federal laws and regulations and have \nexercised all reasonable care should not continue to face a substantial \nrisk of imprisonment and criminal fines under such strict liability \nstatutes. Criminal liability, when appropriately imposed under OPA90, \nshould be employed only where a discharge is caused by conduct which is \ntruly ``criminal'' in nature, i.e., where a discharge is caused by \nreckless, intentional or other conduct deemed criminal by OPA90.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. As the scenario presented by my colleague from Kentucky \ndemonstrates, the unjustified use of strict liability statutes is \nplainly undermining the very objectives which OPA90 sought to achieve, \nnamely to enhance the prevention of and response to oil spills in \nLouisiana and elsewhere in the United States. As we are well aware, \ntremendous time, effort, and resources have been expended by both the \nfederal government and the maritime industry to eliminate oil spills to \nthe maximum extent possible, an to plan for and undertake an immediate \nand effective response to mitigate any environmental damage from spills \nthat do occur. Clearly unwarranted and improper prosecutorial use of \nstrict liability statutes will have a ``chilling'' effect on these \ncooperative spill prevention and response efforts. Indeed, even if we \nwere to believe that criminal prosecution only follows intentional \ncriminal conduct, the mere fact that strict criminal liability statutes \nare available at the prosecutor's discretion will intimidate even the \nmost innocent and careful operator. With strict liability criminal \nenforcement, responsible members of the maritime transportation \nindustry and faced with an extreme dilemma in the event of an oil \nspill--provide less than full cooperation and response as criminal \ndefense attorneys will certainly direct, or cooperate fully despite the \nrisk of criminal prosecution that could result from any additional \nactions or statements made during the course of the spill response. \nConsequently, increased criminalization of oil spill incidents \nintroduces uncertainty into the response effort by discouraging full \nand open communication and cooperation and leaves vessel owners and \noperators criminally vulnerable for response actions taken in an effort \nto ``do the right thing''.\n  Mr. FORD. In the maritime industry's continuing effort to improve its \nrisk management process, it seeks to identify and address all \nforeseeable risks associated with the operation of its business. \nThrough fleet modernization, personnel training, and all other \nreasonable steps to address identified risks in its business, the \nindustry still cannot manage or avoid the increased risks of strict \ncriminal liability (again, a liability that has no regard to fault or \nintent). The only method available to companies and their officers to \navoid the risk of criminal liability completely is to divest themselves \nfrom the maritime business of transporting oil and other petroleum \nproducts, in effect to get out of the business altogether. Furthermore, \nstrict liability criminal laws provide a strong disincentive for \ntrained, highly experienced mariners to continue the operation of tank \nvessels, and for talented and capable individuals from even entering \ninto that maritime trade. A recent editorial highlighted the fact that \ntugboat captains ``are reporting feelings of intense relief and \nlightening of their spirits when they are ordered to push a cargo of \ngrain or other dry cargo, as compared to the apprehension they feel \nwhen they are staring out of their wheelhouses at tank barges'', and \n``that the reason for this is very obvious in the way that they find \nthemselves instantly facing criminal charges * * * in the event of a \ncollision or grounding and oil or chemicals end up in the water''. \nThese views were eloquently expressed as well by two tank vessel \nmasters in a recent House hearing on strict criminal liability for oil \npollution. Certainly, the federal government does not want to create a \nsituation where the least experienced mariners are the only available \ncrew to handle the most hazardous cargoes, or the least responsible \noperators are the only available carriers. Thus, the unavoidable risk \nof such criminal liability directly and adversely affects the safe \ntransportation of oil products, an activity essential for the public, \nthe economy, and the nation.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Therefore, Mr. President, despite the commitment and \neffort to provide trained and experienced vessel operators and \nemployees, to comply with all Coast Guard laws and regulations, to \nabide by the safety and other operational mandates of the AWO \nResponsible Carrier Program and other similar industry initiatives, and \nto provide for the safe transportation of oil as required by OPA90, \nmaritime transportation companies in Louisiana, Kentucky, and elsewhere \nstill cannot avoid criminal liability in the event of an oil spill. \nResponsible, law-abiding companies have unfortunately been forced to \nundertake the only prudent action that they could under the \ncircumstances, namely the development of criminal liability action \nplans and retention of criminal counsel in an attempt to prepare for \nthe unavoidable risks of such liability.\n  These are only preliminary steps and do not begin to address the many \nimplications of the increasing criminalization of oil spills. The \nindustry is now asking what responsibility does it have to educate its \nmariners and shoreside staff about the potential personal exposure they \nmay face and wonder how to do this without creating many undesirable \nconsequences? How should the industry organize spill management teams \nand educate them on how to cooperate openly  and avoid unwitting \nexposure to criminal liability? Mr. President, my colleague from \nKentucky and I have thought about these issues a great deal and simply \ndo not know how to resolve these dilemmas under current, strict \nliability law.\n\n  Mr. FORD. In the event of an oil spill, a responsible party not only \nmust manage the cleanup of the oil and the civil liability resulting \nfrom the spill itself, but also must protect itself from the criminal \nliability that now exists due to the available and willing use of \nstrict liability criminal laws by the Federal Government. Managing the \npervasive threat of strict criminal liability, by its very nature, \nprevents a responsible party from cooperating fully and completely in \nresponse to an oil spill situation. The OPA90 ``blueprint'' is no \nlonger clear. Is this serving the objectives of OPA90? Does this really \nserve the public welfare of our nation? Is this what congress had in \nmind when it mandated its spill response regime? Is this in the \ninterest of the most immediate, most effective oil spill cleanup in the \nunfortunate event of a spill? We think not.\n  Mr. BREAUX. To restore the delicate balance of interests reached in \nthe enactment of OPA90 almost eight years ago, I strongly believe that \nthe Congress should reaffirm the OPA90 framework for criminal \nprosecutions in oil spill incidents, and work to enact legislation that \nreasserts the role of OPA90 as the statute providing the exclusive \ncriminal penalties for oil spills. My colleague from Kentucky and I \nhave proposed such legislation that will ensure increased cooperation \nand responsiveness desired by all those interested in oil spill \nresponse issues, while not diluting the deterrent effect and stringent \ncriminal penalties imposed by OPA90 itself. My colleague from Kentucky \nand I are hopeful that we can work with Senator Chafee and other \nMembers of the Congress to ensure the passage of such reform measures \nto preserve the oil spill prevention and response objectives of OPA90.\n  Mr. President, another issue of great importance which is addressed \nin this legislation is the double hull alternative design study. \nSection 417 directs\n\n[[Page S12392]]\n\nthe Secretary of Transportation to coordinate with the Marine Board of \nthe National Research Council to conduct necessary research and \ndevelopment for alternative tanker designs to the double hull. If this \neffort utilizes technical performance standards it will undoubtedly \nenhance development designs such as the central ballast tanker system. \nThese, American designs, some of which have already passed rigorous \nscientific tests and meet or exceed international shipbuilding \nstandards, have not in my mind received appropriate attention. In my \nopinion, this may be due to inaccurate interpretation of Congress' \nintent which the Coast guard believes restricts any consideration of \nalternative designs to the double hull.\n  Let me be clear, I am not opposed to the double hull design. In fact, \nI believe there is a place for the double hull. However, to consider \nonly the double hull, while ignoring new, innovative technology which \nhas been developed since the passage of the Clean Water Act and OPA90 \nexhibits bad judgment and simply put is bad policy. It is estimated \nthat 8,000 tankers will have to be constructed or redesigned by 2015 to \nmeet the requirements of the petroleum industry. This equates to a ship \nbuilding program which the industry conservatively estimates to be \nworth $400 billion, all of which will be built by foreign shipyards if \nwe do not pursue alternative designs. For those who do not believe that \nU.S. shipyards can't compete--just look at what's happening right now. \nCurrently, there are two hundred double hull tankers under construction \nor contract around the world of which only two have been built in the \nUnited States, both of which lost money for the U.S. shipyard. In fact, \nI am told that the U.S. shipyard which built these two double hull \nships has refused to construct anymore. Without incorporating \ninnovative design and technology, our shipyards and U.S. workers will \nlose out to Japanese, Korean, Norwegian and other foreign yards and \nworkers.\n  Mr. President, this issue is about more than jobs. Being from \nLouisiana, I am intimately familiar with the importance of this issue \nfrom an environmental standpoint. I grew up on Louisiana's Gulf coast \nand know first hand how environmentally sensitive our wetlands and \ncoastlines are and also appreciate how important their health is to the \nlivelihood of the many people who live along the richest fishery in the \nworld. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that all of us in \nLouisiana, and I suspect just about all those who live along the Gulf \nCoast, are extremely concerned with the safety and reliability of oil \ntransport vessels in our waters. Innovative designs like the central \nballast tanker system will add a greater degree of safety in our waters \nan will further protect our sensitive and vitally important coastal \necosystem.\n  I am confident that the Secretary, in conjunction with the Marine \nBoard, the Coast Guard and industry leaders will pull together to \nconsider and eventually approve alternative designs to the double hull \nso our waters can be cleaner and safer and our shipyards and American \nworkers will successfully participate in tanker construction in the \nyears to come.\n\n  Mr. President, as I initially indicated, I have a great deal of \nadmiration for the U.S. Coast Guard. I therefore, stand here today in \nsupport of S. 1259 the United States Coast Guard Authorization Act.\n  The Coast Guard is essential to the safety and well being of the \ncitizens of my home state of Louisiana, as well as every other coastal \nState, every State with navigable waters and even several landlocked \nStates.\n  Using Louisiana as an example, with its hundreds of miles of \ncoastline, active maritime and fishing industries, and thriving \nrecreational boating population the Coast Guard must be at full \nstrength. The payback to our nation is unparalleled. For instance, \nevery year the Coast Guard:\n  Saves about 5,000 lives;\n  Conducts 65,700 search and rescue missions;\n  Responds to 11,680 hazardous waste spills;\n  Protects vital marine habitats from encroachment and pollution;\n  Maintains 50,000 aids to ensure maritime safety; and\n  Keeps $2.6 billion worth of drugs off U.S. streets.\n  In the Greater New Orleans area alone, the Coast Guard:\n  Conducted over 300 search and rescue missions;\n  Responded to 2500 pollution incidents;\n  Investigated nearly 700 marine casualties;\n  Conducted over 2700 vessel inspections; and\n  Seized hundreds of pounds of drugs (Marijuana and Cocaine).\n  In the event my distinguished colleagues aren't already amazed let me \ncontinue. More than two-thirds of the total budget for the Coast Guard \ngoes to operating expenses to protect public safety and the marine \nenvironment, to enforce fishery and other laws and treaties, maintain \naids to navigation, prevent illegal drug trafficking and illegal \nimmigrants, and preserve defense readiness. I believe it's our \nresponsibility to ensure that the Coast Guard has adequate resources \nfor its missions as it prepares for the next century. As I've outlined, \nthe resources we provide to the Coast Guard have a direct impact on our \ncommunities. The Coast Guard's Search and Rescue Program alone provides \na four-to-one return on their Operating Expenses Appropriation and only \nscratched the surface of what the Coast Guard does for America, \neveryday, around the clock. This pay-pack is unrivaled and can only be \nclaimed by a few agencies, including the Coast Guard.\n  Always serving as an example, over the past 4 years, the Coast Guard \non its own initiative to reduce overhead eliminated close to 4,000 \npositions and streamlined to save approximately $400 million per year. \nThis has resulted in the smallest Coast Guard since 1967, yet their \nworkload has grown substantially over the past 3 decades. Over the \nyears, we the Congress has continued to expand the Coast Guard's \nmission. The ``can-do'' attitude they continually display should serve \nas an example to us all. However, we can no longer force this proud \nmaritime service to do more with less.\n  I now call my colleagues to action. The Coast Guard's fiscal year \n1999 budget request contains the minimum funding necessary to sustain \nCoast Guard operations. As a co-sponsor of the Western Hemisphere Drug \nElimination Act, I strongly support increased counter-drug operations, \nbut I believe earmarks to increase them at the expense of several other \nCoast Guard missions inside a net reduction in operating expenses is \nnot possible.\n  It goes without saying how important the Coast Guard is to our \nNation. I urge my colleagues to assure all necessary funding be secured \nin the 1999 Transportation Appropriations Bill, expected on the floor \nany day now. Restoration of earmarks are paramount to avoid necessary \nloss of life and negatively impacting public safety. I urge my \ncolleagues to ensure the Coast Guard is provided a fiscal year budget \nvery close to the President's request.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \nCommerce Committee colleagues in supporting legislation to authorize \nthe U.S. Coast Guard. This agency enjoys widespread, bipartisan \nsupport--and for good reason. The Coast Guard has an important job and \ndoes it well. Last year alone, the Coast Guard conducted 12,449 \nfisheries enforcement boardings; prevented 103 thousand pounds of \ncocaine and 102 pounds of marijuana from reaching the streets; gave \nsafety instruction to 570 thousand recreational boaters; responded to \n13,654 reports of water pollution or hazardous spills; prevented \nproperty loss of $2.5 billion; and saved almost 5,000 lives.\n  The legislation before us today recognizes the vital contribution \nthat the Coast Guard makes to the war on drugs. It authorizes $100 \nmillion over the President's request in fiscal year (FY) 1999 and FY \n2000 for drug interdiction. This will allow the Coast Guard to conduct \nmore operations like the one carried out by the Coast Guard Cutter \nDallas in November of 1997. The Dallas, which is homeported in my \nhometown of Charleston, was participating in a joint surveillance \noperation with the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, and the \nColombian Navy. During the operation, the Dallas fired 25 warning shots \nin pursuit of a 40-foot boat spotted off the coast of Columbia and \nrecovered 1 of the 2 tons of cocaine netted in the operation.\n\n[[Page S12393]]\n\n  This bill authorizes a Coast Guard budget of $3.8 billion for FY \n1998, $4.07 billion for FY 1999, and $4.35 billion for FY 2000 covering \nsix appropriations accounts: (1) operating expenses; (2) acquisition, \nconstruction, and improvement of equipment and facilities; (3) research \nand development; (4) retired pay; (5) alteration and removal of \nbridges; and (6) environmental compliance and restoration. In addition, \nit authorizes $10 million in FY 1999 and $35 million in FY 2000 for \ncapital expenses related to LORAN-C navigation infrastructure.\n  S. 1259 also provides for end-of-year military strength and training \nloads and addresses a number of Coast Guard-related administrative and \npolicy issues. Among such issues, the bill provides for: authority to \nwaive severance pay for officers separated with an other than honorable \ndischarge; removal of the cap on warrant officer severance pay; use of \nfunds for awards programs and car rental for funerals; transfer of \nequipment to Coast Guard Auxiliary; arrest authority for Special Agents \nof the Coast Guard Investigative Service; and a prohibition on new \nnavigational assistance user fees through FY 2000.\n  In addition, the bill enhances the Coast Guard's safety and law \nenforcement missions. It includes provisions to: require alcohol \ntesting within two hours of a serious marine incident; assess national \nmarine transportation system needs; evaluate the use of emergency \nposition indicating beacons (EPIRBs) by operators of recreational \nvessels; and establish criminal penalties for the failure of a person \nto land an aircraft or heave to a vessel when ordered by a Federal law \nenforcement officer. At this point, I would like to highlight a few key \nprovisions of S. 1259.\n\n\n                            Georgetown light\n\n  S. 1259 would convey the only working lighthouse in South Carolina, \nthe Georgetown Light on North Island in Winyah Bay, to the South \nCarolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR). SCDNR owns the \nproperty surrounding Georgetown Light and uses it as a wildlife \npreserve. It has been brought to my attention that the Coast Guard \nwould like to deactivate the light inside of the lighthouse and replace \nit with a light on an existing tower. SCDNR and members of the \ncommunity would like to see the light inside of the lighthouse \nmaintained. But the Coast Guard is concerned that the only cost-\neffective way to maintain this light is through structural \nmodifications to the old lighthouse that could mar its historic \ncharacter. However, I am confident that the Coast Guard, SCDNR, \nhistoric preservation officials, and the local community will sit down \nand come to a mutually-agreeable solution for operating this aid to \nnavigation.\n\n\n                    Panama Canal Tonnage Calculation\n\n  At my request, the bill includes a provision to require the Panama \nCanal Commission to report on the methodology used to calculate tolls \ncharged to deck container vessels. The tolls currently charged to \ncontainer ships with on-deck containers are inconsistent with the 1969 \nInternational Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships (ITC 69). I am \nconcerned that the current tonnage calculation system might adversely \nimpact the traffic of containerized cargo through the Panama Canal. I \nwill continue to monitor the fee structure to ensure that it is fair \nand does not adversely impact East Coast ports such as Charleston.\n\n\n                   Navigational Assistance user fees\n\n  S. 1259 would prohibit the Secretary of Transportation from \nimplementing any new navigational assistance user fee until September \n30, 2000. Such a fee might discriminate inequitably among users of \nCoast Guard aids to navigation. While I am not sure that the Coast \nGuard would have the authority to impose such a fee, I am glad that we \ncould make the law clear on this point.\n\n\n                 Use of EPIRBs for Recreational Vessels\n\n  In the past year, we have heard several tragic stories of lives lost \nwhen recreational vessels sink off of our nation's coast. Some of these \nvessels were close to shore and within range of Coast Guard rescuers \nbut could not be located. They might have been found and tragedy been \naverted had the vessels been equipped with EPIRBs--devices which \nbroadcast a vessel's position. While non-profit organizations like \nBOAT/US have encouraged EPIRB use through education and rental \nprograms, more can be done. That is why I have included a provision to \nrequire the Coast Guard to evaluate and provide recommendations to \nstimulate the use and availability of EPIRBs by recreational vessels.\n\n\n                      Law Enforcement Enhancement\n\n  In 1790, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton ordered the \nconstruction of Revenue Cutters to stop smuggling and enforce tariffs. \nToday, the Coast Guard continues that mission, facing an increasingly \nsophisticated threat from illegal drug smugglers. Providing new \nauthority to deal with an old problem, S. 1259 contains Administration-\nrequested measures to enhance law enforcement. These measures establish \nsanctions (including seizure and forfeiture) for failure to land an \naircraft at the order of a federal officer enforcing drug or money-\nlaundering laws, and for obstructing boarding of a vessel by a Federal \nAviation Administration (FAA) revocation of aircraft or airman \ncertificates for such a violation, establish Coast Guard and Customs \nService air interdiction authority, and set civil penalties of $15,000 \nfor violations of that authority. In addition, this provision requires \nthat FAA establish conditions, based on observed conduct or prior \ninformation, for ordering a plane to land. These provisions are not \nintended to restrict or affect in any way the Federal Government's \ncurrent broad authority to conduct border searches. Rather, they should \nsafeguard innocent owners from concerns over unwarranted interference \nwith their operations. I am optimistic that the bill strikes an \nappropriate balance with the need to assure innocent citizens that they \nwill not be forced to land.\n\n\n                Vessel Identification System Amendments\n\n  The bill would make corrections to the Coast Guard's vessel \nidentification system to make a vessel titled in a state eligible for \nFederal documentation and to ensure that a preferred mortgage remains \npreferred if a state title is surrendered for another state title or \nfor federal documentation.\n\n\n National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Corps Officers\n\n  Finally, S. 1259 would set a floor on Corps officers of 264 and a \nceiling of 299 through FY 2003, designate a flag officer at the \nDirector of the Corps, and lift the hiring freeze on NOAA Corps \nofficers. The Corps has not been permitted to recruit new officers \nsince October 1994, and this methodical, de facto elimination of \npositions has continued without the oversight or approval of the \nCongress. While we have been discussing the status of this service, the \nnatural retirements and attrition of time have been slowly bleeding the \nstrength out of the NOAA Corps. The Corps stands below 245 members, \ndown 44 percent from its highest level of 439 in 1995. This provision \nis intended to settle the issue so that Corps officers and their \nfamilies are no longer in limbo and NOAA can focus on completing its \ncore missions.\n  Mr. President, over the past two centuries, the U.S. Coast Guard has \nbuilt an enduring reputation throughout the world for its maritime \nsafety, environmental protection, humanitarian, and lifesaving efforts. \nWe have all watched the valiant and often heroic work of Coast Guard \nseamen and officer as they rescue desperate refugees who have taken to \nthe seas in crowded and makeshift boats. Even in the remote regions of \nthe world, the Coast Guard is present, actively engaged in the \nenforcement of United Nations' embargoes against countries like the \nformer Republic of Yugoslavia and Iraq. The men and women of the Coast \nGuard respond with equal dedication during times of war and peace. I \nask my colleagues to recognize this service by joining me in supporting \nS. 1259.\n\n\n                 jones act waiver/camden iron and metal\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President I thank Senator Snowe, Senator McCain, \nand Majority Leader Lott for working with us to craft a compromise \nregarding the coastwise eligibility of Barge APL-60. This limited \ncertification will allow the barge to be used by Camden Iron and Metal \nin an important new Navy ship disposal initiative. Thanks to the \ndiligent efforts of Senators Lautenberg and Specter, initial funding of \n$7.5 million for this ship disposal initiative has been included in the \nFY99 defense appropriations bill. I\n\n[[Page S12394]]\n\nwould just like to clarify with the Senator from Maine that it is her \nunderstanding that this provision will apply to all work done by the \nbarge in connection with the initiative for as many years as the \ninitiative continues.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Yes, that it is my understanding.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I, too thank Senator Snowe, Senator McCain, Majority \nLeader Lott, and Senators Hollings and Breaux for their assistance on \nthis important economic development initiative. The program will \ninvolve the development of an environmentally sound method for \ndismantling the Navy's many decommissioned vessels. Camden Iron and \nMetal, a critical partner in this initiative, intends to transport \npieces of the Navy's ships on the barge from the shipyard to its \nfacility in Camden for further processing. It is a very important \nproject in the city of Camden and I am grateful for their help. I \nrecognize that discussions are under way with the House regarding the \nCoast Guard authorization and want to ask the chairman for a commitment \nto giving this provision priority consideration in those discussions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I will do every thing I can to ensure that this provision \nis in any final Coast Guard legislation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Again, I thank the Senator from Maine, Senator \nMcCain, the Majority Leader, as well Senators Hollings and Breaux.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Coast Guard \nReauthorization Act of 1998, 1999, and 2000. The Coast Guard is a \nbranch of the armed forces and a multi-mission agency. The Coast Guard \nis responsible for our national defense, search and rescue services on \nour nation's waterways, maritime law enforcement, including drug \ninterdiction and environmental protection, marine inspection, \nlicensing, port safety and security, aids to navigation, waterways \nmanagement, and boating safety. This bill will provide the Coast Guard \nwith funding and authority to continue to provide the United States \nwith high quality performance of its diverse duties through fiscal year \n2000. I commend the men and women of the Coast Guard who serve their \ncountry with honor and distinction.\n  This bill authorizes $100 million over the Administration's budget \nrequest in fiscal years 1999 and 2000 for drug interdiction activities. \nThis additional money will restore drug interdiction funding to \napproximately the same level which the Coast Guard spent on the war on \ndrugs in 1997. As the primary maritime law enforcement agency, the \nCoast Guard has played an essential role in our nation's war on drugs. \nThe Commandant of the Coast Guard serves as the Administration's drug \ninterdiction coordinator. With the leadership provided by the Coast \nGuard, several successful drug interdiction operations performed with \nother federal agencies have proven to be quite effective. In Operation \nFrontier Shield, 36,262 pounds of cocaine were seized off the coast of \nPuerto Rico, and in three months during Operation Frontier Lance, 2,990 \npounds of cocaine were seized off the coast of Haiti. Despite these \nsuccessful operations, the Administration has not provided for an \nactual increase in drug interdiction funding levels in its fiscal year \n1999 budget request. The funding included in this bill signifies the \nCommerce Committee's endorsement of the Coast Guard's continued role in \nthe war on drugs.\n  In addition to funding the important multi-missions of the Coast \nGuard, this bill makes a series of programmatic changes which will help \nthe Coast Guard operate in a more efficient and effective manner. I \nwill briefly highlight and explain several provisions contained in the \nbill. The bill gives the Coast Guard parity with the Department of \nDefense for severance pay. It gives the Coast Guard discretion in \nmaking decisions related to severance pay for officers being separated \nwith a less than Honorable Discharge and removes the existing cap on \nwarrant officer severance pay. In both instances, the Committee expects \nthe Coast Guard to implement this provision in a fair and uniform \nmanner.\n  The bill also prohibits a foreign-flag vessel which has been detained \nfor a violation of an international safety convention to which the \nUnited States is a party from carrying cargo sponsored by the United \nStates Government for one year after the violation. The Committee \nintends this penalty to be triggered in the case of serious violations \nof such conventions.\n\n  The bill authorizes the Coast Guard to establish seasonal helicopter \nsearch and rescue capability based in Westhampton, NY, from April 15 \nthrough October 15. Due to the discretionary nature of this provision, \nthe Committee fully expects the Coast Guard to continue to maintain its \ncomplete search and rescue mission based on need. By including this \nprovision, the Committee does not intend to extend any inference of \npriority for the establishment of such search and rescue capability in \na manner that contravenes meeting higher priorities.\n  The bill authorizes the Coast Guard to administratively convey excess \nlighthouses. In granting such authority, the Committee is focused on \nthe historic preservation of the lighthouses. However, the Committee \nexpects the Coast Guard to take factors, such as the protection of the \ntaxpayer, into consideration when making such an administrative \nconveyance. For example, if a conveyance is the source of a local \ncontroversy or would result in a waste of taxpayer dollars, the \nCommittee would anticipate that the Coast Guard would exercise its \ndiscretion and not make the conveyance.\n  The bill also provides an administrative process for obtaining a \nwaiver of the coastwise trade laws to allow vessels to commercially \noperate in the coastwise trade under certain conditions. The waiver \nauthority allows the Administration to process noncontroversial waiver \nrequests in a more expeditious manner than the Congress and improve the \nresponsiveness of the federal government in meeting the needs of many \nvessel-operating small businesses. I introduced this provision \nseparately as S. 661 and it was adopted by the Committee.\n  The bill includes S. 1480, the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia \nResearch and Control Act of 1998. This bill was adopted by the \nCommittee and provides funding for Federal research, monitoring, and \nmanagement activities to address harmful algal blooms and hypoxia on a \nnational scale.\n  The bill includes a provision which authorized the Commandant of the \nCoast Guard to recognize the community of Grand Haven, Michigan as \n``Coast Guard City USA''. The community has a long and lofty tradition \nof making the Coast Guard at home in Grand Haven. Senator Abraham, \nSenator Levin, and Representative Hoekstra worked tirelessly to secure \nthis recognition for Grand Haven. The bill contains discretionary \nlanguage because the Committee was concerned about possibly precluding \nany other community in the United States from attaining such \nrecognition under any circumstances.\n  This bill represents a comprehensive set of improvements which should \nenhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the day-to-day operation of \nthe Coast Guard. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude and that \nof the full Commerce Committee to staff who worked on this bill, \nincluding Clark LeBlanc, Sloan Rappoport, Jim Sartucci, Penny Dalton, \nJean Toal, Carl Bentzel, as well as Tim Cook, a Coast Guard fellow, who \nprovided valuable insight into life in the Coast Guard and how certain \nprovisions in the Coast Guard bill would benefit the men and women in \nuniform, and Stephanie Bailenson, a Sea Grant fellow, who helped \ndevelop the harmful algal bloom legislation and provided an essential \nscientific perspective on the bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would like to enter into a colloquy with my friend \nSenator McCain, who is the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, \nin order to clarify an amendment to the Coast Guard authorization bill. \nThis provision, which was adopted in committee as part of S. 1259, has \nthe unintended effect of raising serious safety concerns for general \naviation pilots. It would make it a criminal offense if a pilot \nknowingly disobeys an order to land, but there is no explicit \nrequirement for reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. It also \ncould make an aircraft owner responsible for paying thousands of \ndollars to reclaim their aircraft, even if they are totally innocent of \nany wrongdoing.\n\n[[Page S12395]]\n\n  As the Senator knows, I have been a pilot for over 40 years, and I \nunderstand that an ``order to land'' could be a dangerous and traumatic \nexperience for a pilot. In fact, the International Standards, Rules of \nthe Air, published by the International Civil Aviation Organization \nsays ``interceptions of civil aircraft are, in all cases, potentially \nhazardous.''\n  The provision was intended to provide additional authority to U.S. \nlaw enforcement officers to curtail maritime and aviation drug \nsmuggling near the border, which I'm sure all of us agree is a laudable \ngoal. However, because of the potential danger and immense burden to \npilots, I believe some relatively minor changes should be made to the \namendment.\n  With that in mind, I have drafted some changes to the language that I \nwould appreciate the House and Senate considering during their \ndeliberations. These changes will directly address the concerns of the \ngeneral aviation community without undermining the ability of law \nenforcement to track and stop pilots involved in illegal activity.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend, Senator Inhofe, for raising these \nissues. As he said, the goal of this amendment is to help U.S. law \nenforcement officers fight the war on drugs. The provision would make \nit unlawful for a pilot subject to U.S. jurisdiction to knowingly \ndisobey an order to land issued by an authorized Federal law \nenforcement officer. The provision does try to address the issues you \nraise by requiring that the FAA write the regulations to define the \nmeans by and circumstances under which it would be appropriate to order \nan aircraft to land. The regulations would include guidelines for \ndetermining when an officer may issue an order to land based on \nobserved conduct, prior information, or other circumstances.\n  Clearly, safety must be a primary consideration in the formulation \nand administration of these guidelines. Let me also assure the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma that the intent of this provision is not to allow for \nseizure of aircraft owned by people whose planes have been stolen, \nborrowed or rented and used illegally without the owner's knowledge. If \nthe general aviation community still has concerns, we will work with \nyou to make sure the issues involving safety and fair treatment of \ninnocent pilots are thoroughly considered. As we discuss the Coast \nGuard bill with the House, we will work with you and review the \nlanguage in this provision. I want to assure my friend that I will \ndiscuss all of your concerns and recommendations, and recommendations \nfrom other Senators with our colleagues in the House.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator. I appreciate his willingness to work \nwith me on this issue which is of great important to the general \naviation community.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, \nas amended, be considered read a third time and passed; that the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements relating \nto the bill be printed at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1722), as amended, was considered read the third time \nand passed.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today before we \nadjourn the 105th Congress to acknowledge significant legislation \naddressing women's health needs in the United States. I originally \nintroduced S. 1722, the ``Women's Health Research and Prevention \nAmendments of 1998,'' on March 6, 1998, with our Majority Leader, \nSenator Trent Lott, to increase awareness of some of the most pressing \ndiseases and health issues that confront women in our country. I am \ngratified that the Senate has moved to enact this legislation which \nwill reauthorize important women's health activities at the National \nInstitutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC).\n  We introduced this bill to create greater awareness of women's health \nissues and to highlight the critical role our public health agencies, \nthe NIH and CDC, play in providing a broad spectrum of activities to \nimprove women's health--including research, screening, prevention, \ntreatment, education, and data collection. The bill has enjoyed broad \nbipartisan support, which is a testament to the need to combat the \ndiseases affecting women and to maintain the crucial health services \nthat help prevent these diseases. Today we move from raising awareness \nof these important issues to acting upon them.\n  This bill includes valuable provisions which support basic and \nclinical research at the National Institutes of Health. Among other \nthings, these provisions reauthorize research on osteoporosis and aging \nprocesses in women; the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES) which was widely \nprescribed from 1938 to 1971 and has been shown to be harmful to \npregnant women and their children; and breast and cervical cancer. \nThese provisions also establish a new program focused on cardiovascular \ndisease--the number one cause of death in women. The reauthorization of \nthese research programs will help assure scientific progress in our \nfight against these diseases and will lessen their burden on women and \ntheir families.\n  At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the bill \nreauthorizes the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection \nProgram which provides for crucial screening services for breast and \ncervical cancers to underserved women. It is especially fitting that we \nenact this legislation today since October is Breast Cancer Awareness \nmonth. The American Cancer Society estimates that this year more than \n180,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and more than 40,000 \nwomen will lose their lives. These are not just statistics--they \nrepresent our mothers, sisters, aunts, and daughters. It is with them \nin mind that we pass this legislation today.\n  The bill also includes reauthorizations of data collection activities \nthrough the National Center for Health Statistics and the National \nProgram of Cancer Registries, the leading sources of national data on \nthe health status of U.S. women. These programs make significant \ncontributions to the health and well-being of women in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of our work on women's health. I would like \nto take this opportunity to thank our Majority Leader, Senator Lott, \nfor his leadership and support on this issue. I would also like to \nthank Anne Phelps and Zoe Beckerman of my staff for their hard work on \nthe reauthorization of these programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12396-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12397-S12398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROVIDING FOR CHANGE IN EXEMPTION FROM CHILD LABOR PROVISIONS OF FAIR \n                      LABOR STANDARDS ACT OF 1938\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, Senator Lugar has a substitute amendment \nat the desk, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for Mr. Lugar, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3818.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. 2116, the \nUSDA Information Technology Reform and Year-200 Compliance Act of 1998. \nThis legislation aims to centralize all year 2000 computer conversion \nand other information technology acquisition and management activities \nwithin the Office of the Chief Information Officer of the Department of \nAgriculture. Centralization is the most efficient way to manage the \ncomplex task of ensuring that all critical computer functions at the \ndepartment are operational on January 1, 2000. It is also a wiser and \nmore effective way to construct an information technology \ninfrastructure to enable USDA's hundreds of computer systems to \ninteroperate, which unfortunately they cannot now do.\n  The Department of Agriculture is charged with enormous \nresponsibilities and its year 2000 readiness is crucial. It has a \ndiverse portfolio of over 200 Federal programs throughout the Nation \nand the world. The department delivers about $80 billion in programs. \nIt is the fourth largest Federal agency, with approximately 30 agencies \nand offices. The department is responsible for the safety of our food \nsupply, nutrition programs that serve the poor, young and old, and the \nprotection of our natural resources. Since 40 percent of the non-tax \ndebt owed to the Federal Government is owed to USDA, the department has \na responsibility to ensure the financial soundness of taxpayers' \ninvestments.\n  The centralized approach to the year 2000 issue at USDA led to a lack \nof focus on departmental priorities. This approach resulted in a lack \nof guidance, oversight and the development of contingency plans. \nResponsibility for keeping the mission-critical information technology \nfunctioning should clearly rest with the Chief Information Officer. I \nam pleased that Secretary of Agriculture Glickman has pledged his \npersonal commitment to the success of year 2000 compliance and has made \nit one of the highest priorities for USDA.\n  The General Accounting Office has long chronicled USDA's history of \nproblems in managing its information technology investments. In August \n1993, USDA received authority to spend up to $2.6 billion on a project \ncalled Info Share. The goal of Info Share was to improve operations and \ndelivery of services by reengineering business processes and developing \nintegrated information systems. In August 1994, GAO warned that the \nacquisition of information technology without business process \nreenginering would be problematic. Ineffective planning and management \nresulted in USDA's wasting $100 million on Info Share before it was \nultimately disbanded.\n  An August 1998 GAO report warned that USDA's ongoing effort to \nmodernize information technology at its field service centers, faces \nsignificant risks. The department could spend more than $3 billion on \nthe project by 2011. The report revealed that USDA has not completed a \ncomprehensive plan for the modernization and lacks the project \nmanagement structure needed to manage a project of this magnitude. \nSpecifically, USDA has not assigned a senior-level official with \noverall responsibility, authority and accountability for managing and \ncoordinating the project to ensure it is completed on time and within \nbudget.\n  In March of this year before a House agriculture subcommittee and \nagain in May before the Senate Agriculture Committee, GAO testified in \nsupport of strong Chief Information Officer leadership at USDA. The \nInformation Technology Management Reform Act of 1996, the Clinger-Cohen \nAct, seeks to strengthen executive leadership in information management \nand institute sound capital investment decision-making to maximize the \nreturn on information systems. Consistent with provisions of that act, \nmore accountability and responsibility and responsibility over the \nsubstantial investments the department makes in information technology \nwere recommended by the GAO. The GAO also noted major weaknesses in \nUSDA's component agency efforts and testified that mitigating the risk \nof year 2000 disruptions requires leadership.\n  Last year, I introduced S. 805, a bill to reform the information \ntechnology systems of the Department of Agriculture. It gave the Chief \nInformation\n\n[[Page S12400]]\n\nOfficer control over the planning, development and acquisition of \ninformation technology at the department. Introduction of that bill \nprompted some coordination of information technology among the \ndepartment's agencies and offices. This revised legislation, which \nincludes input from the administration, is now needed to strengthen \nthat coordination and ensure that centralized information technology \nmanagement continues in the future.\n  This legislation requires that the Chief Information Officer manage \nthe design and implementation of an information technology architecture \nbased on strategic business plans to maximize the effectiveness and \nefficiency of USDA's program activities. Included in the bill is \nauthority for the Chief Information Officer to approve expenditures \nover $200,000 for information resources and for year 2000 compliance \npurposes, except for minor acquisitions. To accomplish these purposes, \nthe bill requires the secretary to transfer up to 10 percent of each \nagency's information technology budget to the Chief Information \nOfficer's control.\n  The bill makes the Chief Information Officer responsible for ensuring \nthat the information technology architecture facilitates a flexible \ncommon computing environment for the field service centers based on \nintegrated program delivery and provides maximum data sharing with USDA \ncustomers and other federal and state agencies, which is expected to \nresult in significant reductions in operating costs.\n  The bill requires the Chief Information Officer to address the year \n2000 computing crisis throughout USDA agencies, between USDA and other \nFederal, State, and local agencies and between USDA and private and \ninternational partners.\n  Mr. President, this is a bill whose time has come. Unfortunately, \nUSDA's problems in managing information technology are not unusual \namong government agencies, according to the General Accounting Office. \nI commend the attention of my colleagues to this bill designed to \naddress a portion of the information resource management problems of \nthe Federal Government and ask for their support of it.\n  Mr. BOND. I rise to engage the chairman of the committee in a \ncolloquy to clarify a provision of the bill. Mr. Chairman, Section 8 of \nS. 2116 requires the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer up to 10 \npercent of the information technology or information resource \nmanagement funds from each office or agency to the account of the Chief \nInformation Officer. Some of my constituents have expressed concern \nthat this transfer of funds may cause a reduction in the number of \nemployees in an office or agency. A scenario has been brought forth \nwhere an office or agency finds it necessary to reduce the number of \nits employees, using a variety of methods, to facilitate the transfer \nof funds. Would the chairman address this point?\n  Mr. LUGAR. At no point during deliberations with the Department of \nAgriculture was it ever envisioned the transfer of information \ntechnology funds would cause reductions in force or furloughs. In fact, \ngreat care was taken early in the process to exclude salaries and \nexpenses and intergovernmental payments from the calculations used to \ndetermine the amount necessary to adequately fund the development of an \ninformation technology architecture. This legislation does not \nauthorize reductions in force or furloughs. The information technology \narchitecture includes telecommunications, service center \nimplementation, and site licenses for computer software and hardware. \nAs introduced, the bill required a transfer of 5 percent of the \ninformation technology funds from each office and agency to the Chief \nInformation Officer. Five percent of those funds represented \napproximately $40 million. Further negotiations with the department \nresulted in a revision in the bill that permits the Secretary to \ntransfer up to 10 percent of the information technology funds. This \namendment gives the Secretary the flexibility he requested to adjust \ntransfers commensurate with the information technology architecture \nneeds of each office and agency. This transfer authority terminates on \nSeptember 30, 2003. I hope this addresses the Senator's concerns.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chairman for the clarification.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I also rise to engage the chairman of the committee in a \ncolloquy to clarify the provision of the bill. Mr. Chairman, I \nappreciate your response to the question from the Senator from \nMissouri. Workforce reductions at Farm Service Agency as well as other \nagencies within the U.S. Department of Agriculture have impacted the \nquality of services provided. Employees of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture have expressed concern that fund transfers authorized by \nSection 8 of S. 2116 would be made from an agency's Salary and Expenses \nbudgets and could result in additional workforce reductions. Given the \nincreasing workload at Farm Service Agency field offices in many \nStates, I feel that it is vital that this concern be addressed. Mr. \nChairman, is it your intention that fund transfers will be made in a \nmanner which does not jeopardize funds available for salaries?\n  Mr. LUGAR. As I noted in my earlier remarks, that is my intention. It \nis my hope that the Secretary will avoid such actions. If, however, the \nSecretary considers a reduction-in-force or furloughs, I expect that he \nwill first consult the committee before going forward with such \nactions.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chairman for his helpful remarks.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that the substitute amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3818) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill appear at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide a children's enrollment performance bonus; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n           the health care for america's children act of 1998\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, during last year's passage of \nthe balanced budget agreement, Congress achieved a great victory. We \ncreated a new $24 billion program to fund children's health--the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  Even with that historic effort, our work is far from finished. There \nare 10 million children in this country without health insurance. But \neven more troubling is that nearly half of these children are eligible \nfor Medicaid health coverage yet remain unenrolled.\n  This is the great tragedy of Medicaid. Barriers to enrollment like \ncomplicated application forms, inaccessible sign-up procedures, and \ndemeaning eligibility processes are preventing families from enrolling \ntheir kids. A recent report by the Agency for Health Care Policy and \nResearch (AHCPR) stressed the need for states to engage in outreach \nactivities to increase enrollment of Medicaid-eligible children. \nLikewise, President Clinton recently identified Medicaid outreach as a \nhigh priority of his administration.\n  The bill I am introducing today would go a long way toward getting \nthese children enrolled. This bill, the Health Care for America's \nChildren Act of 1998, would create an incentive program to reward \nstates who engage in outreach activities to enroll the 4.7 million \nuninsured children who are eligible for Medicaid. States who employ \neffective outreach activities like shortened and simplified \napplications, presumptive and continuous eligibility, and outstationing \nof eligibility workers in schools and day care centers, would be \neligible for a performance bonus.\n  State adoption of these outreach activities is critical to removing \nthe barriers to enrollment and ensuring that all eligible children get \nthe Medicaid health insurance to which they are already entitled. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), adoption of these \noutreach measures would increase the number of children enrolled in \nMedicaid by 700,000 each year after the year 2000. That means that by \nthe year 2007, we could have all eligible children covered.\n  Lack of health insurance can be devastating to the health status of \nchildren. Children without health insurance are four times more likely \nto go without needed medical or surgical care. And children without \nhealth care are less likely to grow up to be healthy productive adults, \nless likely to receive timely preventive care, and less likely to \nreceive treatment even for serious illnesses.\n  Unmet health care needs also translate into higher costs over the \nlong run. Uninsured children are more likely to need emergency room \ncare at twice the cost of office-based care. Each dollar invested in \nimmunization saves $7.40 in future medical costs.\n  Ensuring that children have access to health care is an investment in \nour future. Over 10 million uninsured children in this country is a \ncrisis. But it is a travesty that we have the means to cover almost \nhalf of these children and are failing to do so. In the words of Albert \nCamus (CAM-OO), ``perhaps we cannot prevent this from being our world \nwhich children suffer, but we can lessen the number of suffering \nchildren.''\n  Mr. President, I ask that the Health Care for America's Children Act \nof 1998 be included in its entirety in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2626\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Care for America's \n     Children Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over 10,000,000 children in the United States, 1 in 7, \n     lack health insurance coverage.\n       (2) Nearly half of those children (4,700,000) are eligible \n     for health benefits coverage through the medicaid program but \n     are not enrolled in that program.\n       (3) Children without health insurance coverage are 4 times \n     more likely to go without needed medical or surgical care.\n       (4) One out of 5 children who are uninsured for a year or \n     longer are missing all of their current immunizations.\n       (5) Children without health insurance are less likely to \n     have a family doctor, less likely to receive timely \n     preventive care, and less likely to receive treatment, even \n     for serious illnesses.\n\n[[Page S12403]]\n\n       (6) Uninsured children are more likely to need emergency \n     room care at twice the cost of office-based care.\n       (7) A recent report by the Agency for Health Care Policy \n     and Research (AHCPR) stressed the need for States to engage \n     in outreach activities to increase the enrollment of \n     medicaid-eligible children.\n       (8) Outreach activities like shortened and simplified \n     applications, presumptive and continuous eligibility, and \n     outstationing of eligibility workers in schools and day care \n     centers have been found to be effective in getting medicaid-\n     eligible children enrolled in the medicaid program.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the powers of the Secretary of the Treasury \nto regulate the manufacture, distribution, and sale of firearms and \nammunition, and to expand the jurisdiction of the Secretary to include \nfirearm products and nonpowder firearms; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n          firearms safety and consumer protection act of 1998\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I introduce the Firearms \nSafety and Consumer Protection Act of 1998. I am sure that this bill \nwill face opposition, but I am equally sure that the need for this bill \nis so clear, and the logic so unquestionable, that we will soon see \nhunters, law enforcement agents and other gun consumers fighting for \nthe passage of the legislation.\n  Mr. President, I have long fought against the gun injuries that have \nplagued America for years. We succeeded in enacting the Brady bill and \nthe ban on devastating assault weapons. And in the 104th Congress, even \nin the midst of what many consider a hostile Congress, we told domestic \nviolence offenders that they could no longer own a gun. These were each \nmeasures aimed at the criminal misuse of firearms.\n  But there is another subject that the NRA just hates to talk about--\nthe countless injuries that occur to innocent gun owners, recreational \nhunters, and to law enforcement. Every year in this country, countless \npeople die and many more are injured by defective or poorly \nmanufactured firearms. Yet the Consumer Product Safety Commission, \nwhich has the power to regulate every other product sold to the \nAmerican consumer, lacks the ability to regulate the manufacture of \nfirearms.\n  Amazingly, in a nation that regulates everything from the air we \nbreathe, to the cars we drive, the cribs that hold our children, the \nmost dangerous consumer product sold, firearms, unregulated. Studies \nshow that inexpensive safety technology and the elimination of flawed \nguns could prevent a third of accidental firearms deaths. Despite this \nfact, the Federal Government powerless to stop gun companies from \ndistributing defective guns or failing to warn consumers of dangerous \nproducts.\n  Ths gaping loophole in our consumer protection laws can often be \ndisastrous for gun users. To take just one recent example, even when a \ngun manufacturer discovered that it had sold countless defective guns \nwith a tendency to misfire, no recall was mandated and no action could \nbe taken by the Federal Government. The guns remained on the street, \nand consumers were defenseless. Time after time, consumers, hunters, \nand gun owners are each left out in the cold, without the knowledge of \ndanger or the assistance necessary to protect themselves from it.\n  For too long now, the gun industry has successfully kept guns exempt \nfrom consumer protection laws, and we must finally bring guns into line \nwith every other consumer product. Logic, common sense, and the many \ninnocent victims of defective firearms all cry out for us to act--and \nact we must.\n  To that end, I am introducing the Firearms Safety and Consumer \nProtection Act, legislation giving the Secretary of the Treasury the \npower to regulate the manufacture, distribution, and sale of firearms \nand ammunition. The time has come to stop dangerous and defective guns \nfrom killing American consumers. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill, and I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2627\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the deductibility of business and meal expenses for \nindividuals subject to Federal hours of service; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n              tax deductibility of business meal expenses\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, last year in the Taxpayer Relief Act \nof 1997, we included a provision to correct an unfair and unsound tax \npolicy of the Clinton administration concerning business meal \ndeductions. The 1993 Clinton tax increases included a reduction in the \npercentage of business meal expenses that could be deducted, from 80 \npercent\n\n[[Page S12406]]\n\ndown to 50 percent. The administration marketed this as an attack on \nthe ``three martini lunch,'' but the tax increase was in fact a big \nblow to the wallets and pocketbooks of working class Americans whose \njobs require them to be stranded far from home.\n  Workers who are covered by federal ``hours of service'' regulations--\nlong-haul truckers, airline flight attendants and pilots, long distance \nbus drivers, some merchant mariners and railroad workers--have no \nchoice but to eat their meals on the road. Their meal expenses are a \nnecessary and unavoidable part of their jobs. The Clinton \nadministration's business meal tax increase hit these occupations hard. \nFor the average trucker, making between $32,000 and $36,000 annually, \nthis tax increase might be greater than $1,000 per year. This is a lot \nof money to these hard-working taxpayers.\n  Congress addressed this inequity last year, passing a provision that \nwould gradually raise the meal deduction percentage back to 80 percent \nfor these workers. But a slow, gradual fix is not good enough. Today I \nam introducing a bill that would immediately restore the 80 percent \ndeduction for truckers, flight crews, and other workers limited by the \nfederal ``hours of service'' regulations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2628\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

REVOCATION.\n\n       The Secretary may revoke an endorsement issued under \n     section 502, after notice and an opportunity for public \n     comment, if the Secretary determines that the employment of \n     the vessel in the coastwise trade has substantially changed \n     since the issuance of the endorsement, and--\n       (1) the vessel is employed other than as a passenger \n     vessel, a small passenger vessel, or an uninspected passenger \n     vessel; or\n       (2) the employment of the vessel adversely affects--\n       (A) United States vessel builders; or\n       (B) the coastwise trade business of any person who employs \n     vessels built in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 504. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Transportation.\n       (2) Eligible Vessel.--The term ``eligible vessel'' means a \n     vessel that--\n       (A) was not build in the United States and is at least 3 \n     years of age; or\n       (B) if rebuilt, was rebuilt outside the United States at \n     least 3 years before the certification requested under \n     section 502, if granted, would take effect.\n       (3) Passenger vessel, small passenger vessel; uninspected \n     passenger vessel; passenger for hire.--The terms ``passenger \n     vessel'', ``small passenger vessel'', ``uninspected passenger \n     vessel'', and ``passenger for hire'' have the meaning given \n     such terms by section 2101 of title 46, United States Code.\n\n               TITLE VI--HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS AND HYPOXIA\n\n     SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Harmful Algal Bloom and \n     Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the recent outbreak of the harmful microbe Pfiesteria \n     piscicida in the coastal waters of the United States is one \n     example of potentially harmful algal blooms composed of \n     naturally occurring species that reproduce explosively and \n     that are increasing in frequency and intensity in the \n     Nation's coastal waters;\n       (2) other recent occurrences of harmful algal blooms \n     include red tides in the Gulf of Mexico and the Southeast; \n     brown tides in New York and Texas; ciguatera fish poisoning \n     in Hawaii, Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands; \n     and shellfish poisonings in the Gulf of Maine, the Pacific \n     Northwest, and the Gulf of Alaska;\n       (3) in certain cases, harmful algal blooms have resulted in \n     fish kills, the deaths of numerous endangered West Indian \n     manatees, beach and shellfish bed closures, threats to public \n     health and safety, and concern among the public about the \n     safety of seafood;\n       (4) according to some scientists, the factors causing or \n     contributing to harmful algal blooms may include excessive \n     nutrients in coastal waters, other forms of pollution, the \n     transfer of harmful species through ship ballast water, and \n     ocean currents;\n       (5) harmful algal blooms may have been responsible for an \n     estimated $1,000,000,000 in economic losses during the past \n     decade.\n       (6) harmful algal blooms and blooms of non-toxic algal \n     species may lead to other damaging marine conditions such as \n     hypoxia (reduced oxygen concentrations), which are harmful or \n     fatal to fish, shellfish, and benthic organisms;\n       (7) according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration in the Department of Commerce, 53 percent of \n     U.S. estuaries experience hypoxia for at least part of the \n     year and a 7,000 square mile area in the Gulf of Mexico off \n     Louisiana and Texas suffers from hypoxia;\n       (8) according to some scientists, a factor believed to \n     cause hypoxia is excessive nutrient loading into coastal \n     waters;\n       (9) there is a need to identify more workable and effective \n     actions to reduce nutrient loadings to coastal waters;\n       (10) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n     through its ongoing research, education, grant, and coastal \n     resource management programs, possesses a full range of \n     capabilities necessary to support a near and long-term \n     comprehensive effort to prevent, reduce, and control harmful \n     algal blooms and hypoxia;\n       (11) funding for the research and related programs of the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will aid in \n     improving the Nation's understanding and capabilities for \n     addressing the human and environmental costs associated with \n     harmful algal blooms and hypoxia; and\n       (12) other Federal agencies such as the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture, and the \n     National Science Foundation, along with States, Indian \n     tribes, and local governments, conduct important work related \n     to the prevention, reduction, and control of harmful algal \n     blooms and hypoxia.\n\n     SEC. 603. ASSESSMENTS.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Inter-Agency Task Force.--The \n     President, through the Committee on Environment and Natural \n     Resources of the National Science and Technology Council, \n     shall establish an Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal \n     Blooms and Hypoxia (hereinafter referred to as the ``Task \n     Force'').

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) United States agriculture, food safety, the health of \n     plants and animals, the economies of rural communities, \n     international commerce in food, and food aid rely on the \n     Department of Agriculture for the effective and timely \n     administration of program activities essential to their \n     success and vitality;\n       (2) the successful administration of the program activities \n     depends on the ability of the Department to use information \n     technology in as efficient and effective manner as is \n     technologically feasible;\n       (3) to successfully administer the program activities, the \n     Department relies on information technology that requires \n     comprehensive and Department-wide overview and control to \n     avoid needless duplication and misuse of resources;\n       (4) to better ensure the continued success and vitality of \n     agricultural producers and rural communities, it is \n     imperative that measures are taken within the Department to \n     coordinate and centrally plan the use of the information \n     technology of the Department;\n       (5) because production control and subsidy programs are \n     ending, agricultural producers of the United States need the \n     best possible information to make decisions that will \n     maximize profits, satisfy consumer demand, and contribute to \n     the alleviation of hunger in the United States and abroad;\n       (6) a single authority for Department-wide planning is \n     needed to ensure that the information technology architecture \n     of the Department is based on the strategic business plans, \n     information technology, management goals, and core business \n     process methodology of the Department;\n       (7) information technology is a strategic resource for the \n     missions and program activities of the Department;\n       (8) year-2000 compliance is 1 of the most important \n     challenges facing the Federal Government and the private \n     sector;\n       (9) because the responsibility for ensuring year-2000 \n     compliance at the Department was initially left to individual \n     offices and agencies, no overall priorities have been \n     established, and there is no assurance that the most \n     important functions of the Department will be operable on \n     January 1, 2000;\n       (10) it is the responsibility of the Chief Information \n     Officer to provide leadership in--\n       (A) defining and explaining the importance of achieving \n     year-2000 compliance;\n       (B) selecting the overall approach for structuring the \n     year-2000 compliance efforts of the Department;\n\n[[Page S12429]]\n\n       (C) assessing the ability of the information resource \n     management infrastructures of the Department to adequately \n     support the year-2000 compliance efforts; and\n       (D) mobilizing the resources of the Department to achieve \n     year-2000 compliance;\n       (11) the failure of the Department to meet the requirement \n     of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget that \n     all mission-critical systems of the Department achieve year-\n     2000 compliance would have serious adverse consequences on \n     the program activities of the Department, the economies of \n     rural communities, the health of the people of the United \n     States, world hunger, and international commerce in \n     agricultural commodities and products;\n       (12) centralizing the approval authority for planning and \n     investment for information technology in the Office of the \n     Chief Information Officer will--\n       (A) provide the Department with strong and coordinated \n     leadership and direction;\n       (B) ensure that the business architecture of an office or \n     agency is based on rigorous core business process \n     methodology;\n       (C) ensure that the information technology architecture of \n     the Department is based on the strategic business plans of \n     the offices or agencies and the missions of the Department;\n       (D) ensure that funds will be invested in information \n     technology only after the Chief Information Officer has \n     determined that--\n       (i) the planning and review of future business requirements \n     of the office or agency are complete; and\n       (ii) the information technology architecture of the office \n     or agency is based on business requirements and is consistent \n     with the Department-wide information technology architecture; \n     and\n       (E) cause the Department to act as a single enterprise with \n     respect to information technology, thus eliminating the \n     duplication and inefficiency associated with a single office- \n     or agency-based approach; and\n       (13) consistent with the Information Technology Management \n     Reform Act of 1996 (40 U.S.C. 1401 et seq.), each office or \n     agency of the Department should achieve at least--\n       (A) a 5 percent per year decrease in costs incurred for \n     operation and maintenance of information technology;

Mr. President, on behalf of the family and \nfriends of Joan D'Alessandro, I want to express gratitude for the \npassage of Joan's Law, a bill I introduced in October 1997, as a \nprovision in H.R. 3494, the Child Protection and Sexual Predator \nPunishment Act.\n  Twenty-five years ago, 7-year-old Joan D'Alessandro left her home in \nHillsdale, New Jersey to deliver Girl Scout cookies to a neighbor and \ndisappeared. Three days later, that neighbor, confessed to taking \nJoan's life and changing forever the lives of those who loved her. \nJoseph McGowan, a school teacher, had raped Joan, killed her, and \ndumped her broken, battered body in a ravine.\n  Although McGowan was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in state \nprison, the nightmare for the D'Alessandro family was far from over. \nFor the past 12 years, they have had to live with the very real \nprospect that their daughter's killer will walk out of jail one day a \nfree man. Already, McGowan has twice been eligible for parole and a New \nJersey appeals court recently ordered another parole hearing. No family \nshould have to suffer the tragedy of\n\n[[Page S12432]]\n\nthe loss of their child and then be forced to relive it again and again \nthrough parole hearings and appeals.\n  In response to their tragic loss, the D'Alessandro family has worked \ntirelessly at the state level for the enactment of Joan's Law, \nlegislation providing that a child molester who murders a child under \n13 in New Jersey will receive life in prison without the possibility of \nparole. Joan's Law is now on the books in New Jersey and I am proud \nthat we, in this Congress, are seizing the opportunity to enact \ncompanion federal legislation.\n  My original legislation states that any person who is convicted of a \nserious violent felony should be sentenced to either death or \nimprisonment for life when the victim of the crime is under 14 years of \nage and dies as a result of the offense. As included in Senator Hatch's \nsubstitute to the House-passed bill, the bill also contains a narrow \nprovision which allows the court to impose a lesser sentence in a case \nwhere the defendant has provided substantial assistance in the \nprosecution of another person. While I would have preferred Joan's Law \nto move forward as originally introduced, I understand and respect the \naddition of such a provision. It is a change that was made in \nconsultation with and with the approval of both the D'Allesandro family \nand the bill's House sponsor, Representative Bob Franks.\n  In am heartened by the swift passage of the Child Protection and \nSexual Predator Protection Act both in the Judiciary Committee and on \nthe floor. By including Joan's Law among the bill's provisions we have \nsent a strong message that our society will neither tolerate nor \nforgive the brutal acts of a criminal who takes a young life and \nensures that this murdere will never bring such harm and grief to \nanother family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12431-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12432-S12433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE CHARTER SCHOOLS EXPANSION ACT\n\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am happy to speak today in \nrecognition of the passage by unanimous consent of the Charter Schools \nExpansion Act, the bi-partisan bill. Senator Lieberman and I introduced \nthis bill last November to help further expand the charter school \nmovement which is so successfully providing new educational \nopportunities for children all around the country. This bill passed \nunanimously out of the Labor Committee and was unanimously approved by \nthe Senate.\n  This important bill builds upon the great success of the original \ncharter school legislation which Senator Lieberman and former Senator \nDurenberger introduced in 1994. It was Senator Durenberger's timeless \npromotion of charter schools that educated all of us to the promise and \nthe benefit of this important public educational reform initiative.\n  The Federal Charter School Grant Program provides seed money to \ncharter school operators to help them pay for the planning, design and \ninitial implementation of a charter school. Since the program's \ninception, the number of charter schools has tripled, with over 1100 \ncharter schools now operating in 33 States and the District of \nColumbia.\n  Charter schools are independent public schools that have been freed \nfrom onerous bureaucratic and regulatory burdens in order to pursue \nclear objectives and goals aimed at increasing student achievement. To \nincrease student achievement, charter schools are able to design and \ndeliver educational programs tailored to meet the needs of their \nstudents and their communities.\n  It is the individualized education available to students through \ncharter schools that makes this a desirable educational alternative for \nmany families. Charter schools give families an opportunity to choose \nthe educational setting that best meet their child's needs. For many \nlow-income families in particular, charter schools provide their first \nopportunity to select an educational setting which is best suited for \ntheir child.\n  Parents and educators have, in turn, given these programs \noverwhelmingly high marks. Broad-based studies conducted by the \nDepartment of Education and the Hudson Institute show that charters are \neffectively serving diverse populations, particularly disadvantaged and \nat-risk children, that traditional public schools have struggled to \neducate.\n  With results like these, it is no wonder that some of the strongest \nsupport for charter legislation comes from low-income families. Not \nonly do these parents now have real educational choices, but they are \nactually needed in the charter school environment for everything from \nvolunteering to coaching, fundraising, and even teaching. This direct \ninvolvement of families is helping to build small communities centered \naround the school.\n  Charter schools can be started by anyone interested in providing a \nquality education: parents, teachers, school administrators, community \ngroups, businesses and colleges can all apply for a charter. And, \nimportantly, if these schools fail to deliver a high-quality education, \nthey will be closed--either through a district or State's \naccountability measures or from lack of students. Accountability is \nliterally built into the charter school process--the school must comply \nwith the provision in its charter, and unhappy parents and students can \nleave if they are not satisfied.\n  Additionally, a survey conducted last fall by the National School \nBoards Association (NSBA) found that the charter movement is already \nhaving a positive ripple effect that is being felt in many local public \nschool districts. The NSBA report cites evidence that traditional \npublic schools are working harder to please local families so they \nwon't abandon them to competing charter schools, and that central \nadministrators often see charters as ``a powerful tool'' to develop new \nideas and programs without fearing regulatory roadblocks.\n  Several other studies have recently been released highlighting the \nsuccess of charter schools around the country. Among other things, \nthese studies have shown that charter schools have successfully met and \nsurpassed the standards outlined in their charters, attracted \nsignificant proportions of minority and low-income students, and have \nhigher parental approval rates than public schools.\n  The results of these studies point to important ways to improve and \nreinvent public education as a whole. The implications from the success \nof charter schools indicate that public schools should be consumer-\noriented, diverse, results-oriented, and professional places that also \nfunction as mediating institutions in their communities.\n  The purpose of this bill is to further encourage the growth of high-\nquality charter schools around the country. This bill provides \nincentives to encourage States to increase the number of high quality \ncharter schools in their State. To qualify for funding under this bill, \nStates must satisfy two criteria. First, they must provide for review \nand evaluation of their charter schools by the public chartering agency \nat least once every five years to ensure that the charter school is \nmeeting the terms of its charter and meeting its academic performance \nrequirements. And second, States meet at least one of three priority \ncriteria:\n  The State has demonstrated progress in increasing the number of high \nquality charter schools that meet clear and measurable objectives for \nthe educational progress of their students;\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n  To help ensure that the amount of the federal grants are proportional \nto the level of charter school activity in the State, this bill directs \nthe Secretary to take into consideration the number of charter schools \nin operation, or that have been approved to open.\n  During drafting of this bill, the single greatest concern I heard \nfrom charter school operators related to their ability to access their \nfair share of federal education funding. And so, to ensure that charter \nschools have enough funding to continue once their doors are opened, \nthis bill provides that charter schools get their fair share of federal \nprograms for which they are eligible, such as Title 1 and IDEA. The \nbill also directs States to inform their charter schools of any Federal \nfunds to which they are entitled.\n  This bill also increases the financing options available to charter \nschools and allows them to utilize funds from the Title VI block grant \nprogram for start-up costs.\n  Because it is so important that charter schools are held accountable \nin return for the flexibility they are given from Federal, state and \nlocal laws and regulations, this amendment includes\n\n[[Page S12433]]\n\nseveral significant provisions which strengthen accountability. First, \nunder the priority criteria, States must review and evaluate their \ncharter schools at least once every five years to ensure that they are \nmeeting the terms of their charter and their academic performance \nrequirements. They are rewarded for increasing the number of high \nquality charter schools that are ``held accountable in their charter \nfor meeting clear and measurable objectives for the educational \nprogress of their students.''\n\n  The definitions section of the bill also stresses accountability by \nrequiring a written performance contract with the authorized chartering \nagency in the State. These written performance contracts include \nclearly defined objectives for the charter school to meet in return for \nthe autonomy they are given. The performance objectives in the contract \nare to be measured by State assessments and other assessments the \ncharter wishes to use.\n  I am confident that this amendment will build on and contribute to \nthe success of the charter school movement. This bill stresses the need \nfor high quality, accountable schools which are given the autonomy they \nneed to provide the best educational opportunity for their students.\n  With the passage of this bill, a strong signal will be sent to \nparents and teachers all across this country that they are not alone in \ntheir struggle to improve education. We hope to ease their struggle by \nenabling new charter schools to be developed. More charter schools will \nresult in greater accountability, broader flexibility for classroom \ninnovation, and ultimately more choice in public education. I urge my \ncolleagues to increase educational opportunities for all children by \nsupporting this bill.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment and thank Senator \nLieberman for his tremendous leadership in the area of educational \nreform. He and I have worked closely on a number of issues over the \nlast several years, and I want to commend him, in particular, for his \nstrong support and leadership on issues concerning increasing \neducational opportunities for low-income children. He understands so \nclearly the fundamental importance of providing a high quality \neducation in a safe environmental of our neediest children. In addition \nto this charter schools bill, which will help to increase educational \nopportunities for low-income children, Senator Lieberman and I have \nworked closely for the last 4 years to gain support for publicly-funded \nscholarships for low-income children. I want to thank him for his \nunwavering commitment to this issue and his vitally important \nleadership. His efforts have done much to win bipartisan support for \nboth charter schools and low-income scholarships and I thank him for \nhis strong commitment to our country's neediest children. With the \npassage of this charter schools bill, Senator Lieberman and I have the \npleasure of seeing the first of our joint educational reform \ninitiatives move closer to becoming law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12432-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12433-S12434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  1998 WATER RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT ACT\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to make some remarks regarding S. 2131, the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act which passed the Senate by unanimous consent on October \n8, 1998.\n  I would like to first thank my colleague Senator Mack from Florida \nfor his partnership on our efforts to produce a WRDA bill that reflects \nthe needs of our State. I would also like to thank Senator Chafee, \nSentor Baucus, and Senator Warner for their leadership on this critical \npiece of legislation. The 1998 WRDA bill includes many key items for \nthe State of Florida, a few of which I would like to highlight today.\n  As you know, water issues in Florida include everything from coastal \nprotection to inland water quality management and from statewide \ndrought to statewide flooding. Our history dealing with water resources \nhas caused some of our own problems that we seek to correct today.\n  In the area of the Everglades and South Florida Ecosystem \nRestoration: The Everglades restoration project is the largest \nrestoration program in the world. This vast region, which is home to \nmore than six million Americans, seven of the ten fastest growing \ncities in the country, a huge tourism industry, and a large \nagricultural economy, also encompasses one of the world's unique \nenvironmental resources. Over the past 100 years, manmade changes to \nthe region's water flow have provided important economic benefits to \nthe region, but have also had devastating effects on the environment. \nBiological indicators in the form of native flora and fauna have shown \nsevere damage throughout south Florida.\n  The work of the Army Corps of Engineers is essential to this \nrestoration effort. The critical projects authorized in WRDA 1996 have \ndemonstrated substantial success. The South Florida Ecosystem \nRestoration Task Force, the Governor's Commission for a Sustainable \nSouth Florida, local sponsors, and the Army Corps have completed a \nreview of over 100 potential projects, narrowed the list to 35 and \nranked them in order of priority for accelerating the restoration of \nthe South Florida ecosystem.\n  In addition to this extension, the WRDA 1998 bill includes a $27 \nmillion authorization for the Hillsboro and Okeechobee Aquifer Storage \nand Recovery Project. This technology is presently used to create \nsubsurface reservoirs for drinking water. The Army Corps is considering \nthe use of Aquifer Storage and Recovery as a water storage technology \nfor use in implementation of the Restudy. Our action to authorize work \non this project will allow early evaluation of the viability of this \ntechnology.\n  Finally, the WRDA 1998 bill includes clarifying language that \nexpenditures by the state of Florida for land acquisitions in the \nCaloosahatchee River basin are eligible for Federal reimbursement if \nthey are identified as part of the restudy when it is released in July \n1999. Our action assures the State of Florida that acquired lands that \nbecome part of the restudy will be eligible for Federal reimbursement.\n  In the area of water supply: One of the unique aspects of the Florida \nwater system is that we frequently experience periods of drought and \nperiods of flooding. This is the nature of a system that has been \nmodified by human manipulation of natural flowways. In the State of \nFlorida, our growing population coupled with the need to protect our \nnatural systems has created a water quality challenge. From 1995 to \n1996, Florida added 260,000 new residents, or the equivalent of four \nnew Daytona Beaches. Between 1980 to 1995, Florida's public water \nsupply needs increased 43 percent more than double the national average \nof 16 percent. This shows no signs of slowing down. Today, Florida \ncontinues to grow at the rate of more than 800 people per day.\n  Many other States on the eastern seaboard face similar challenges. \nFor example, a recent article in New Jersey Monthly stated that New \nJersey leads the nation in the percentage of land mass that is \nclassified as having a high vulnerability for serious water quality \nproblems. According to the U.S. EPA, more than 66 percent of the State \nfalls into the most precarious category for water quality.\n  In addition, as early as 1983, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers study \nstated that deficits in water supply for the area in Virginia south of \nthe James River are projected to be as much as 60 million gallons per \nday by the year 2030. Ground water withdrawals have caused water level \ndeclines of as much as 200 feet in some areas. In the State of New \nYork, water levels in aquifers are predicted to decline by as much as \n18 feet and low flows in streams may be decreased by 90 percent in \nparts of Long Island.\n  In each of these cases, water supply is tied to water quality. \nProblems such as groundwater overpumping, damage of existing wetlands, \nand saltwater intrusion of aquifers can cause irreparable damage to our \nwater systems and surrounding ecosystems. For example, since 1906 \nwetland acreage in the State of Florida has shrunk by 46 percent \nresulting in a loss of both critical habitats and a key link in the \nreplenishment of our aquifers. The development of alternative water \nsources that will help to resolve these types of issues and will allow \nStates to provide for future water supply needs without sacrificing \nenvironmental protection is my goals.\n  The WRDA 1998 bill includes a requirement for EPA to study water\n\n[[Page S12434]]\n\navailability and make recommendations on the adequacy of our existing \nwater supply. The study will form the basis of future water supply \nprograms. The State of Florida is already taking the water supply issue \nseriously, and in 1998 alone has budgeted $75 million in regional and \nState funds for development of alternative water supplies. I am looking \nforward to working with my colleagues on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee during the next Congress to address the water quality \nand water supply needs of the State of Florida.\n  Together, these initiatives will protect the future of the State of \nFlorida by protecting our water resources that are so critical to our \nenvironment and our economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12433-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COPYRIGHT LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, in the closing days of the 105th \nCongress, the Senate passed two pieces of copyright legislation that \nwill have enormous impact. As Charles Dickens might say, it is the best \nof times and the worst of times for those who create the property that \nis protected by copyright.\n  First, the Senate passed S. 505, which extended the terms of \ncopyrights by 20 years, to life plus 70 years from life plus fifty \nyears. For a number of years, our trading partners and competitors have \nprotected their copyrights for the life of the author plus 70 years. \nUnder the rule of the shorter term, these nations protected American \ncopyrights for only the life of the author plus 50 years. The United \nStates is the world leader in copyright, and should afford the greatest \nprotection for copyrighted works of any nation, both to encourage \ncreativity that benefits all, and for our own national interest with \nrespect to the balance of trade.\n  The extension of copyright terms will be of enormous benefit to \nsongwriters and others who create copyrighted works. It will benefit \nthe public through enhanced creative activity, and the further public \nperformance of already existing works to be enjoyed by future \ngenerations.\n  But S. 505 contained a bitter pill to swallow, the so-called Fairness \nin Music Licensing Legislation. These provisions are terribly unfair to \nthose who create music. When a person profits from a public performance \nof music, he or she should fairly compensate the creator of that music \nthrough royalty payments. This is an elemental necessity for the \ncreation of music. To paraphrase Justice Holmes, if music did not pay, \nno one would write it. The average songwriter receives less than $5,000 \nper year in royalties, and the average restaurateur pays only a few \nhundred dollars a year to play music in his establishment, about 1% of \nrevenues. At the same time, the restaurateur uses music to create an \nambience that will cause people to come to his establishment, and to \nspend more time and money there than they would without the music.\n  But the restaurateurs, retailers, and others wanted something for \nnothing. The songwriters were even willing to help out the mom and pop \nrestaurants by exempting broadcast performances of their music in about \ntwo-thirds of the Nation's restaurants. But that was not good enough \nfor the music users, who had the House pass outrageous legislation that \namounted almost to stealing from the songwriters. A House that purports \nto defend property rights passed the most anti-property rights \nlegislation in many years.\n  We worked in the Senate to improve that House-passed bill. We \npreserved vicarious liability, a necessity to ensure that royalties are \npaid. We prevented retailers and restaurants from challenging their \nrates in any city they chose, which would have been an unacceptable \nburden on the ability of songwriters to protect their rights. We \neliminated provisions that would have enabled department stores to use \nmusic for free. In addition, we increased enforcement of payments \nbecause a judge can award double the licensing fees for up to three \nyears instead of current law's limits of statutory damages.\n  But I still have major concerns about S. 505, even with these \nchanges. Songwriters' property taken from them and used by others \nwithout payment. The exemptions are too generous, as they go well \nbeyond the interest of small establishments. In fact, the vast majority \nof songwriters are smaller business people than many of the \nestablishments that will be exempted from paying royalties by this \nbill.\n  At the same time, this bill runs counter to our international treaty \nobligations under the Berne Convention and the TRIPS Agreement. Those \ntreaties benefit Americans more than any other country. We have the \ngreatest interest in ensuring compliance by all signatory countries \nwith these treaties. Yet we have passed a bill that is inconsistent \nwith these treaty obligations. What will happen when foreign countries \ndo not live up to their promises to protect intellectual property, \nciting our own example of this legislation back to us? Songwriters may \nnot be the only losers; copyright protects computer software and other \nnon-performing arts creative material. Some of the companies who may be \nhurt by international retaliation may be member companies of \norganizations that insisted on the music licensing provisions.\n  Only time will tell if the World Trade Organization will find that \nthis bill violates international treaties that are binding on this \ncountry. But there is a good chance that these unfair music licensing \nprovisions will not be able to stand.\n  It became clear in the final days of this Congressional session that \nin order to obtain copyright term extension and the WIPO implementing \nlegislation, unfair music licensing legislation would have to be \nincluded. Although the music licensing provisions are considerably \nbetter than those contained in the House-passed bill, they are still \nunfair. However, the 20-year extension in copyright terms is a \nsignificant benefit to songwriters, and the WIPO Treaty implementing \nlegislation will assist creative artists in the digital age, as well as \nenhance worldwide protection of copyrighted materials. In implementing \nthis treaty, it is unfortunate that my colleagues have passed \nlegislation that violates our existing treaty obligations.\n  Mr. President, there are times when the bad has to be taken with the \ngood. The music licensing provisions are indefensible, but a necessary \ncost of obtaining very important legislation for the benefit of \ncreative artists. It should not have been this way. I am confident that \nthe music licensing issue is not yet over, and I regret the likely \nembarrassment that will ultimately fall upon this body when the \nlanguage it has passed is ruled to violate our treaty \nobligations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12434-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, on Saturday, I had a chance to talk about \nour good friend, Dale Bumpers. I'd like to take a few minutes to talk \nabout four other friends who will be leaving us at the end of this \nCongress.\n  Shortly after he left the White House, Calvin Coolidge was called on \nto fill out a standard form. After filling in his name and address, he \ncame to a line marked ``occupation.'' He wrote ``retired.'' When he \ncame to the next line, labeled ``remarks,'' he wrote ``Glad of it.'' I \nsuspect that our colleagues who are retiring at the end of this \nCongress are also ``glad of it''--at least in some small measure. But, \nin addition to relief, I hope they also feel a sense of pride--both for \nwhat they have accomplished here, and the dignity with which they have \nserved.\n  In a short time here, Dirk Kempthorne has made all of our lives a \nlittle better. Thanks in large part to him, the Safe Drinking Water Act \nis now the law. Senator Kempthorne has also reminded us of the \nimportance of state\n\n[[Page S12435]]\n\nand local involvement in our decisions. We will all miss him.\n  I had the good fortune to travel with Senator Kempthorne to the Far \nEast. As most of our colleagues know, as we travel we get to know one \nanother even better. I know him and I admire him and I wish him well in \nhis life after the Senate. I also applaud him for the nature with which \nhe has continued to work with all of us. He has a very conciliatory, \nvery thoughtful, a very civil way with which to deal with colleagues on \nissues. If we would all follow Dirk Kempthorne's example, in my view, \nwe would be a lot better off in this body. His manner, his leadership, \nhis character, his personality is one that we are going to miss greatly \nhere in the U.S. Senate.\n  We will also miss Dan Coats. With his thoughtful approach and \nuncompromising principles, Senator Coats has followed his heart above \nall else. And, as a result of his support of the Family and Medical \nLeave Act, millions of Americans are able to follow their hearts, too, \nand spend more time with their families when they need them most.\n  When Senator Coats announced his retirement in 1996, he said, ``I \nwant to leave (politics) when I am young enough to contribute somewhere \nelse * * * I want to leave when there is still a chance to follow God's \nleading to something new.'' Wherever Senator Coats and Senator \nKempthorne are led, we wish them both the best. I am confident that \nthey will continue to contribute much to their country and to their \nfellow citizens.\n  And we will surely miss our own 3 departing Senators.\n  Dale Bumpers, Wendell Ford and John Glenn are 3 of the sturdiest \npillars in this institution. They have much in common. They came here--\nall 3 of them--in 1974. For nearly a quarter-century, they have worked \nto restore Americans' faith in their government.\n  Their names have been called with the roll of every important \nquestion of our time. And they have answered that call with integrity \nand dignity.\n  They are sons of small town America who still believe in the values \nthey learned back in Charlestown, Arkansas; Owensboro, Kentucky; and \nNew Concord, Ohio. They are also modest men.\n  Perhaps because they had already accomplished so much before they \ncame to the Senate, they have never worried about grabbing headlines \nhere. Instead, they have been content to work quietly, but diligently--\noften with colleagues from across the aisle--to solve problems as \ncomprehensively as they can. They have been willing to take on the \n``nuts and bolts'' work of the Senate--what John Glenn once called \n``the grunt work'' of making the government run more efficiently.\n  They were all elected to the Senate by wide margins, and re-elected \nby even wider margins. And they all would have been re-elected this \nyear, I have no doubt, had they chosen to run again.\n  What I will remember most about each of them, though, is not how much \nthey are like each other they are, but how unlike anyone else they are. \nEach of them is an American original.\n  As I said, I've already shared my thoughts about Dale Bumpers. No \nSenator has ever had more courage than Dale Bumpers.\n  And no Senate Leader has ever had the benefit of a better teacher \nthan Wendell Ford.\n  No Leader has ever enjoyed such a loyal partnership as I have. No \nLeader has ever had a better friend and counselor.\n  For the past 4 years, Senator Ford has been my right hand and much \nmore. He is as skilled a political mind, and as warm a human being, as \nthis Senate has ever known.\n  Carved inside the drawer of the desk in which Wendell sits is the \nname of another Kentucky Senator, ``the Great Compromisor,'' Henry \nClay. It is a fitting match.\n  Like Henry Clay, Wendell Ford believes that compromise is honorable \nand necessary in a democracy. But he also understands that compromise \nis, as Clay said, ``negotiated hurt.''\n  I suspect that is why he has always preferred to try to work out \ndisagreements behind the scenes. It allows both sides to bend, and \nstill keep their dignity.\n  In 1991, Wendell's quiet, bipartisan style convinced a Senator from \nacross the aisle, Mark Hatfield, to join him in sponsoring the ``Motor \nVoter'' bill. Working together, they convinced the Senate to pass that \nlegislation. To this day, it remains the most ambitious effort Congress \nhas made since the Voting Rights Act to open up the voting booth to \nmore Americans.\n  Wendell Ford has served the Bluegrass State as a state senator, \nlieutenant governor, governor and United States Senator. His love for \nhis fellow Kentuckians is obvious, and it is reciprocated.\n  In his 1980 Senate race, Wendell Ford became the first opposed \ncandidate in Kentucky history to carry all 120 counties. In 1992, he \nreceived the highest number of votes ever cast for any candidate in his \nstate.\n  Throughout his years in the Senate, Senator Ford has also been a \ntenacious fighter for the people of Kentucky. He has also been a leader \non aviation issues, a determined foe of government waste and \nduplication, a champion of campaign finance reform, and--something we \nare especially grateful for on this side of the aisle--a tireless \nleader for the Democratic Party.\n  He chaired the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee for three \nCongresses, from 1976 through 1982. And, in 1990, Democratic Senators \nelected him unanimously to be our party whip, our second-in-command, in \nthe Senate--a position he still holds today.\n  We will miss his raspy and unmistakable voice, his good humor and \nwise counsel.\n  Finally, there is John Glenn. What can one say about John Glenn that \nhas not already been said?\n  In all these 24 years, as hard as he tried to blend in with the rest \nof us, as hard as he tried to be just a colleague among colleagues, it \nnever quite worked, did it?\n  I used to think that maybe I was the only one here who still felt \nawed in his presence. Two years ago, on a flight from China with John \nand a handful of other Senators and our spouses, I learned that wasn't \nso.\n  During the flight, we were able to persuade John to recollect that \nincredible mission aboard Friendship 7, when he became the first \nAmerican to orbit the Earth. He told us about losing all radio \ncommunication during re-entry, about having to guide his spacecraft \nmanually during the most critical point in re-entry, about seeing \npieces of his fiberglass heat panel bursting into flames and flying off \nhis space capsule, knowing that at any moment, he could be incinerated.\n  We all huddled around him with our eyes wide open. No one moved. No \none said a word.\n  Listening to him, I felt the same awe I had felt when I was 14 years \nold, sitting in a classroom in Aberdeen, South Dakota, watching TV \naccounts of that flight. Then I looked around me, and realized everyone \nelse there was feeling the same thing.\n  I saw that same sense of awe in other Senators' faces in June, when \nwe had a dinner for John at the National Air and Space Museum. Before \ndinner, we were invited to have our photographs taken with John in \nfront of the Friendship 7 capsule. I don't think I've ever seen so many \nSenators waiting so patiently for anything as we did for that one \npicture.\n  A lot of people tend to think of two John Glenns: Colonel John Glenn, \nthe astronaut-hero; and Senator John Glenn. The truth is, there is only \nJohn Glenn--the patriot.\n  Love for his country is what sent John into space. It's what brought \nhim to Washington, and compelled him to work so diligently all these \nyears in the Senate.\n  People who have been there say you see the world differently from \nspace. You see the ``big picture.'' You see how small and \ninterconnected our planet is.\n  Perhaps it's because he came to the Senate with that perspective that \nJohn has fought so hard against nuclear proliferation and other weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  Maybe because he'd had enough glamour and tickertape parades by the \ntime he came here, John chose to immerse himself in some decidedly \nunglamorous causes.\n  He immersed himself in the scientific and the technical. He looked at \ngovernment with the eyes of an engineer, and tried to imagine ways it \ncould work better and more efficiently.\n  As early as 1978, he called for Congress to live by the same \nworkplace\n\n[[Page S12436]]\n\nrules it sets for everyone else. More recently, he spearheaded the \noverhaul of the federal government procurement system, enabling the \ngovernment to buy products faster, and save money at the same time.\n  In 1974, the year he was elected to the Senate, John Glenn carried \nall 88 counties in Ohio. In 1980, he was re-elected with the largest \nmargin in his state's history. The last time he ran, in 1992, he became \nthe first Ohio Senator ever to win 4 terms.\n  As I said, I'm sure he would have been re-elected had he chosen to \nrun again. But, as we all know, he has other plans.\n  For 36 years, John Glenn has wanted to go back into space. On October \n29, he will finally get his chance. At 77 years old, he will become the \noldest human being ever to orbit the earth--by 16 years.\n  Many of us will be in Houston to see John and his Discovery crew \nmates blast off. If history is any indication, I suspect we will be \nwide-eyed once again.\n  In closing, let me say, Godspeed, John Glenn and Dale Bumpers, \nWendell Ford, Dirk Kempthorne and Dan Coats. You have served this \nSenate well. You are all ``Senators' Senators,'' and we will miss you \ndearly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12434-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the closing hours of the 105th Congress \nare fast approaching. I could not let this Congress end without coming \nto the Senate floor to address the tragedy in Kosovo. It is a human \ncrisis of immense proportion, and it poses an increasing threat to the \nUnited States and the global community.\n  The last several years have been marked by Yugoslavian President \nMilosevic's steady escalation of political repression and violence \nagainst the people of Kosovo. Acting at Milosevic's behest, Yugoslav \nforces have driven nearly 400,000 Kosovar Albanians from their homes. \nFourteen thousand homes and 400 villages have been razed. Over 700 \nKosovar Albanian men, women, and children have been killed.\n  Within the last several weeks our newspapers have been filled with \naccounts of atrocities committed by Milosevic's units against scores of \nunarmed civilians. Among the list of crimes documented by international \nobservers are politically motivated killings; massacres of women, \nchildren and elderly persons; torture; arbitrary arrest; detention \nwithout cause; denial of fair, public trial; and destruction of private \nhomes.\n  Further exacerbating this man-made crisis is the fact that winter is \nfast approaching, placing at peril the health and well being of tens of \nthousands of displaced persons who have managed to survive Milosevic's \ncruelties.\n  After watching this recent string of atrocities, the international \ncommunity was compelled to respond. On September 23, the United Nations \nSecurity Council adopted a resolution condemning the excessive use of \nforce by Milosevic's thugs and demanding that he cease military actions \nagainst civilians, withdraw his security units, facilitate the safe \nreturn of refugees and displaced persons to their homes, permit \nunimpeded access of humanitarian organizations to the people of Kosovo, \nand engage in meaningful negotiations on Kosovo's final status.\n  Diplomacy has been and should continue to be a major component of our \nresponse to this situation. But we must also acknowledge reality. The \nreality is that meaningful negotiations toward a settlement of Kosovo's \nstatus cannot take place in the current environment. Furthermore, words \nalone have never been enough to slow Milosevic and his henchmen. This \nwas demonstrated to the world all too painfully in Bosnia. Despite \nnumerous appeals from the international community to end his support \nfor the war in Bosnia, Milosevic repeatedly turned a deaf ear, and the \nhostilities continued unabated.\n  It was only after NATO carried out a series of airstrikes against \nmilitary forces supported by Milosevic that a cease-fire became \npossible.\n  The circumstances appear to be similar in Kosovo. And, if Milosevic \nfails to fully and immediately comply with the terms of the U.N. \nresolution, I believe the time has come for NATO to respond similarly.\n  The United States and our NATO allies must be prepared to carry out \nairstrikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia if such action is \ndetermined to be the only means of enforcing the U.N. resolution.\n  I say this for three reasons. First and foremost, continued \nrepression, violence, and instability in Kosovo directly threaten the \nnational security interests of the United States. Kosovo is a tinderbox \nin the heart of one of the most unstable and critical regions of the \nworld. Balkan history has clearly demonstrated that a spark in this \nregion can rapidly spread into a blaze that engulfs the world. We have \nalready seen refugee outflows into Albania and Macedonia. Two NATO \nallies, Greece and Turkey, with their competing regional interests, \ncould easily and quickly get enmeshed in this crisis if it continues \nand widens.\n  Second, the credibility of NATO, still our most important alliance, \nhangs in the balance. For nearly 50 years, NATO has been the \norganization most responsible for keeping the peace in Europe. NATO had \ngreat success in the years after World War II and the Cold War. Its \npost-Cold War utility was proven earlier this decade in Bosnia. What \nNATO does in Kosovo will go a long way toward determining this crucial \nalliance's role in the 21st century. A strong, unified NATO is still \nthe best insurance policy we have against large-scale conflict in \nEurope.\n  Third, as the west's history with Milosevic in Bosnia proves, if \nwords are to have the desired effect on his behavior, they must be \nbacked up with a credible threat to use force. Indeed, our recent \nexperience in Kosovo itself bears this out. In the past week or two, \nMilosevic has launched an effort to convince the world that he is fully \ncomplying with the requirements of the September 23 U.N. resolution. \nNot surprisingly, this behavior occurred precisely as the specter of \nNATO military action began to loom over him. In fact, there may only be \none way to achieve peace in Kosovo without the use of force. NATO must \ndemonstrate to Milosevic that it is prepared to use force to compel his \ncompliance. This is precisely the policy toward which this \nAdministration and our NATO allies appear to be moving.\n  Mr. President, in offering my endorsement for this approach, let me \nbe clear. If air operations and missile strikes against the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia are necessary to force Milosevic to the \nnegotiating table, the United States and our NATO allies should \ndemonstrate that we are prepared to pursue that option. Certainly we \nshould not give the Administration a blank check, but we must accept \nour responsibility as a world leader and acknowledge that stronger \nmeasures may be required. The Administration should continue to consult \nclosely with Congress every step of the way as events unfold.\n  Milosevic's atrocities have gone on too long. It's time for the \nUnited States to defend its national interests and help restore peace \nto this troubled region. It's time for the world to say no to the \ntorture and slaughter of innocent civilians in Kosovo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/12/senate-section/article/S12436-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECESS UNTIL 11 A.M.
