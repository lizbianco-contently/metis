Mr. President, the Senate will be in session today only \nfor the transaction of morning business. No rollcall votes will occur \nduring today's session of the Senate. On Monday, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the Interior appropriations bill. As announced, no \nrollcall votes will occur during Monday's session. The majority leader \nintends that the Senate conclude debate on the Interior bill by \nTuesday. As a consequence, Members are encouraged to contact the \nmanagers of the bill to schedule floor action on any possible \namendments on Monday or Tuesday.\n  As Members are aware, this is the next to the last appropriations \nbill remaining for Senate consideration, so Members' cooperation is \nappreciated in the scheduling of floor action as we attempt to conclude \naction on both the Interior appropriations bill and the District of \nColumbia appropriations bill next week. As a result of this policy, the \nnext rollcall vote will be a cloture vote on the substitute amendment \nto S. 830, the Food and Drug Administration reform bill, which will \noccur on Tuesday at 10 a.m. Under rule XXII, all first-degree \namendments to S. 830 must be filed by 1 p.m. on Monday. The majority \nleader thanks his colleagues for their attention.\n  Mr. President, as manager of the Interior appropriations bill, I have \nspoken to a number of my colleagues with interest in the National \nEndowment for the Arts to express my views and those of Senator Stevens \nand the majority leader that to the maximum possible extent, amendments \nrelating to the National Endowment for the Arts be presented and \ndebated on Monday. With a single exception, all of the Members who I am \naware of who may have such amendments have been contacted and have \nexpressed their cooperation. But for the information of all Members on \nboth sides of the aisle, Monday will provide a time at which the \nNational Endowment for the Arts can be debated at leisure without time \nconstraints or the interference of other matters.\n  So I do hope that those Members who have an interest in expressing \ntheir views on the subject will come to the floor of the Senate on \nMonday afternoon and let their views be known to other Members of the \nSenate.\n  This is not to say, of course, that other amendments will not be in \norder on Monday, as they will be. We are aware of the possibility of \namendments by Senators Helms and Ashcroft that would terminate the \nNational Endowment for the Arts in the way that the House of \nRepresentatives voted to do; additional amendments by Senator Helms \nwith respect to content restrictions; a potential amendment by Senator \nHutchinson of Arkansas, together with Senators Sessions and Abraham on \nblock granting most or all of the funds for the National Endowment for \nthe Arts; an amendment by Senator Hutchison of Texas to restructure the \ngrant process of NEA; an amendment by Senator Jeffords, as the chairman \nof the authorizing committee for the Endowment, to deal with the \ncommittee's authorization proposal as a part of this appropriations \ndebate; and the possibility that Senator Cochran may wish to clarify \nthe definition of arts education. That is not to say all these \namendments will, in fact, be adopted. It is not to say there are not \nothers. I\n\n[[Page S9244]]\n\nmay report that there seems to be more interest in debating this issue \nin a number of different guises than there is of any other part of the \nInterior appropriations bill. I, obviously, will be here for the day.

Madam President, I wanted to speak first today about \nthis Gorton amendment that we adopted yesterday as part of the Labor \nand Human Services appropriation measure.\n  The Senate approved that amendment by a narrow vote of 51 to 49. And \nthe effect of the amendment is to convert billions of dollars in \nFederal education funds into unrestricted block grants that go to \nschool districts, and with very few restrictions or accountability for \nhow the funding is spent. I think the amendment is extremely far-\nreaching, and it was a mistake by the Senate to go along with this \namendment. I hope very much that, in the final analysis in the \nconference, we can drop the amendment and send to the President a bill \nthat keeps intact the various programs that many of us have worked for \non both the Democratic and Republican side of the aisle for many years.\n  Let me just say, putting it in its baldest terms, that this amendment \nwould eliminate much of the U.S. Department of Education. That is a \nradical and a misguided effort, which does not have strong public \nsupport. This is an issue that was discussed in the last Presidential \ncampaign. It became clear, I believe, during the course of that \ncampaign and in the polling that was done throughout the campaign and \nsince, that the American public does not favor elimination of the \nDepartment of Education, either in a formal way or by the gutting of \nthe Department through an amendment such as this.\n  I have fundamental problems with the notion that there is no national \ninterest in helping parents and schools and students to compete in the \nworld economy. What we are saying is that the local schools in every \npart of this country can figure out how to prepare their students to \ncompete in the international marketplace if they have no help from \noutside. I disagree with that. It is not realistic to expect a local \nschool board to have at its disposal the resources and expertise that \nwe can develop at the national level and provide as assistance in the \neducational process.\n  So there is an honest disagreement here about whether we as a nation \ncan step up to this responsibility and assist States and local school \ndistricts, or whether we need to stay completely out of it. I feel very \nmuch that we need to provide assistance and expertise where we can.\n  The Secretary of Education, in a quotation in the morning paper, says \nvery clearly--this is Secretary Riley in the Washington Post:\n\n       Secretary Riley warned that the Senate's action, which he \n     called a ``back-door attempt to kill the Department of \n     Education'' would abolish many vital programs for students, \n     including Clinton's Goals 2000 grants for school reform.\n\n  Madam President, when you look at the roughly $12.5 billion in annual \nfunding for Federal education programs that would go into block grants \nunder this amendment, you see how broad-based this amendment is. Let me \njust go through the list so the people know what we are talking about \nhere.\n  First of all, there is the Goals 2000 program that, of course, has \nbeen somewhat controversial, but has been a great benefit to many \nschool districts in my State. I go to school district after school \ndistrict as I travel around New Mexico and talk to those school \ndistrict administrators and teachers and students about the Goals 2000 \nprogram. I find good support for it. I think they appreciate the \nfunding they have received and the assistance that the Federal \nGovernment provides. So it would be eliminated.\n  The School-to-Work Program. The education funds involved in the \nSchool-to-Work Program--not the Department of Labor funds, but the \nEducation Department funds--would be eliminated.\n  Education technology. This has been a concern of mine and of many \nSenators for many years now as to how do we get additional resources to \nour schools and to our school districts so that they can put in place \nthe various purchasing of hardware and software and training of \nteachers that is necessary for them to turn out a technologically \nliterate group of graduates at the end of the high school experience.\n  Star Schools Program, the regional technology education consortia, \nthe telecommunications demonstration programs that are in place around \nthe country, the challenge grants for technology innovation, technology \nliteracy challenge fund--all of these are specific initiatives that \nhave benefited my State significantly.\n  I think it would be a major error for us to eliminate the Federal \nfunds. Some will say we are not eliminating Federal funds, we are \ngiving a block grant to the school districts and if they want to spend \nthem on this, they can. The unfortunate reality is that a local school \ndistrict is under tremendous pressure. The school board members in my \nState are elected, as they are throughout most of the country. They are \nunder tremendous pressure at the local level to raise salaries, raise \nsalaries for school administrators, to build additional facilities, and \nto do a whole range of things. If we want funds to go to improve \ntechnological literacy and provide educational technology for our \nschools, we have to specify that is what the money goes for. Otherwise, \nthe reality is that it will be spent for other purposes.\n  So this Gorton amendment eliminates any requirement that any funds be \nspent for this purpose. I think that would be a major mistake. In my \nown State, we have received, this year, about $1.7 million in Federal \nfunds for educational technology. We are expected, this next year, to \nreceive $3.5 million in funds. The total, nationwide, is $425 million. \nI think this is money well spent. It is cost-effective. It is a cost-\neffective way for the taxpayers to try to assist in improving education \nat the local level.\n  Let me go through some of the others that are covered here. The \nEisenhower professional development State grants. These are funds that \ngo to assist teachers in getting additional training so that they can \nbetter teach and remain in the profession of teaching. The innovative \neducation program strategies under title 6. The safe and drug-free \nschools program. Again, in my State, I have gone to many schools and \nthey have been extremely appreciative that the safe and drug-free \nschools program has allowed them to hire counselors to work at the \nmiddle school level, so that when students are beginning to get into \ndifficulties with drugs or beginning to lose interest in school and \nbecome truant, they can have counselors there to be an early prevention \ndevice to keep those students involved. That safe and drug-free schools \nmoney would be eliminated under this amendment.\n  The magnet schools assistance. That, again, has been very helpful in \nmany school districts around the country. Education for homeless \nchildren and youth. Women's educational equity funding. Education for \nnative Hawaiians. Alaska Native education equity funding. Charter \nschools funding. Funding for Indian education. All of these are \nspecific programs that will not be funded if this amendment prevails. \nSo, clearly, I think we have a major problem. Bilingual and immigration \neducation programs are another example.\n  The key part of this amendment that I think is most objectionable is \nthat it creates an unmonitored windfall to local school districts that \nwould be used for any of a wide range of purposes. There would be no \noversight, no\n\n[[Page S9245]]\n\naccountability as to how any of the funds are spent. The various \npurposes that we have meticulously specified over the years as \npriorities for the Nation, those priorities will be put aside.\n  Let me mention one other program, Madam President, that I think is of \nparticular concern as to how it would fare under this amendment, and \nthat is title I. When I talk to elementary schoolteachers and \nadministrators in my State, the one Federal program that they \nconsistently point to and say ``thank you'' for sending the funds to \nthe State and to local districts, it is in this title I area. That is \nfunding for disadvantaged students. It makes a tremendous difference in \nmany of our schools. I think for us to--in an amendment here on the \nfloor, without hearings, without any comprehension of what we are \ndoing--just say we are going to eliminate title I, I think that is \nhighly irresponsible. I believe very strongly that we made a serious \nmistake when we went that way.\n  So there is no accountability if this amendment prevails. There is no \noversight by the Federal Government as to how these funds are spent if \nthis amendment prevails. We would cut State support networks out of the \npicture, also, if this amendment prevails. The Gorton amendment fully \nbypasses State educational agencies. In my State, our State educational \nagencies help to coordinate and monitor programs. Those are all \nbypassed under the amendment. Some people think that block granting \neducation funds might give local school districts more control or more \nfunding. The reality is that if we block grant these programs and \nbypass the entire State education network, we put a huge administrative \nburden on school districts, which very few of them are equipped to \nhandle at this point. About 6 percent of Federal funds is taken off the \ntop by States for administrative and technical expenses. I wish they \ndidn't have to take any expenses off. But I fear that we will see a \nduplication at the local district level that will soak up substantially \nmore than 6 percent of the total Federal funds if we bypass the \nnetworks that the States have set up.\n  In my own State, there is really no way to anticipate the total \neffect of this amendment. It is untried. Funding levels would basically \nbe determined by having each individual district conduct a self-\nreported census on its own of all school-age children in the district, \nweigh the district's funding according to each State's average per \ncapita income level. It is not difficult to guess that we won't do \nnearly as well in my State as some might think. Current formulas \nalready awarding money directly to the school district based on \nindividual community need would be scrapped and many communities would \nbe left to fend for themselves.\n  Madam President, in summary, let me just say that this amendment \nshould not become law. I am persuaded that if it remains in this bill, \nthe President will veto the bill, as he should.\n  I think this is the kind of irrational, unwise, misguided action \nwhich we sometimes get involved in here in the Senate when we don't \nhave active debate. There was not adequate debate on the Gorton \namendment. We have not had hearings in the Education Subcommittee of \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee on the Gorton amendment. If \nSenator Gorton and other sponsors of this bill want to pursue this \ncourse of action, I believe it should be put out as a piece of \nlegislation that we can have hearings on in the authorizing committee. \nI am fortunate to be a member of the Labor, Health and Human Resources \nCommittee which has worked long and hard over the years to authorize \nthe various Federal programs being eliminated with this amendment. I \nthink the proper course would be to have a full set of hearings on all \nof these programs, and determine which of them should be eliminated. If \nthe will of the Senate and the will of the Congress and the will of \nPresident is to eliminate some of them, then fine. But coming along \nwith this kind of an amendment absent hearings and absent adequate \ndebate I think is not the responsible way to proceed.\n  So I would join others here in objecting strenuously to the \nprovision. As Senator Dodd suggested yesterday on the floor, if the \nbill comes back from the appropriations conference with this provision \nin it, he would commit to filibuster against the 1998 appropriations \nbill. I hope very much that course is not required. But, obviously, I \nand many others would have to join him in that course of action, if \nthat amendment remains in the legislation.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator's time just expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 10 additional minutes as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to speak for a few minutes here \non the subject of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. My distinguished \ncolleague from Delaware, Senator Biden, spoke about it this week. He, \nof course, is the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee \nwhich is one of the key committees with responsibility over this \nsubject matter.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, as I understand it, is intended to \nbe sent by the administration to the Senate in the very near future. \nAnd I want to just reemphasize some of the points that Senator Biden \nmade, and highlight the importance of the treaty to our national \nsecurity and international peace.\n  In the wake of the cold war, our world remains a very dangerous place \nin which to live. When the United States and the Soviet Union were \nstill aiming thousands of nuclear warheads at each other during the \ncold war, all of us understood the danger that existed--perhaps only a \nhalf an hour away. But with the fall of international communism, the \nworld breathed a huge sigh of relief, and hoped that we could move into \na postnuclear age. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a major part of \nthe hope and a major part of what needs to be done in order to move \ninto that postnuclear age.\n  No greater threat to our national security or international peace \nexists than the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The potential damage \nthat such weapons could do remains no less a threat than the one that \nwe feared during the cold war. Think for a moment about the possibility \nof terrorists armed with nuclear weapons having been in the Tokyo \nsubway instead of terrorists there with nerve gas. Think of the \npossibility of terrorists having been in Oklahoma City with a small \nnuclear weapon instead of with the weapon that was there. Perhaps my \ncolleagues have read recent reports about the suitcase-sized nuclear \nweapons being unaccounted for in Russia. Whether these reports are true \nor not I recently had the chance to visit Russia and observe a model of \nthe nuclear weapons that existed there; the size of artillery shells. \nAnd I am told that is also a weapon that we have had in our own \ninventory at various times. Such miniature nuclear weapons are indeed, \nfeasible. They pose a realistic threat to the post-cold war world in \nwhich we live.\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a critical element in the \nspectrum of policies and actions that we need to take to prevent the \nspread of nuclear weapons of whatever size--prevent the spread of them \nto rogue nations, to terrorist organizations, to individuals bent on \nsome type of irrational destructive behavior. For countries that have \nno nuclear weapons, it is impossible for them to develop nuclear \nweapons and be confident that they will work without being able to test \nthem.\n  Senator Biden recently stated that the proof of this belief is \nmanifested by the current reluctance of Pakistan and India to sign the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty. These nations currently prefer to be \nable to test their weapons in order to ensure that they work--thereby \ndemonstrating their nuclear capability and supporting their foreign \npolicy goals. The danger of a nuclear conflict between these two \nnations and the potential impact such a war could have on the entire \nplanet should be very clear to everyone who serves here in the Senate.\n  But India and Pakistan, and other potential nuclear powers, will not \nstep\n\n[[Page S9246]]\n\nback from the nuclear brink if the United States and the other nuclear \npowers do not take convincing steps toward controlling, reducing, and \neliminating nuclear weapons through arms control treaties, specifically \nthrough the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  The recent seismic event that occurred off the coast of northern \nRussia reminds us of how important it is for the Senate to ratify and \nfor the world to implement this test ban treaty. In this case the \nexperts disagree among themselves about the exact nature of the event. \nArticle IV of the treaty will ensure that we could take steps to \nclarify whether or not that incident was a nuclear explosion or an \nunderground earthquake. But, without the treaty, the experts will \ncontinue to massage the data in search for definitive answers. With the \ntreaty, we could observe some answers directly through on-site \ninspection.\n  Without the treaty, potential nuclear powers might well conclude that \ntoday's superpowers are ignoring their promises to discontinue nuclear \ntesting--that, therefore, license exists for these nonnuclear powers \nwho have the ambition to become nuclear powers to proceed on their own \npath toward development of nuclear weapons with impunity. If we put \nthis treaty in place, those same potential nuclear powers would \nrecognize that current nuclear powers should be held accountable for \ntheir promises not to test nuclear weapons. With the treaty in place, \nthey would know that the commitment of today's nuclear powers to \nnonproliferation was a genuine commitment and one that we would abide \nby.\n  It serves the peaceful interests of the United States and the \npeaceful interests of countries throughout the world to take this \nimportant step to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and \neliminate nuclear testing. At the same time it serves the security \ninterests of this Nation to ensure that our nuclear weapons remain a \nviable deterrent force. The science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program \nthat we have in place today as part of our defense strategy is the \nmeans by which the United States can achieve this dual goal--the goal \nof a comprehensive test ban to ensure nonproliferation, and also a \nreliable nuclear deterrent force, should we ever need such weapons in \nthe future. I will be working hard, and I urge all my colleagues in the \nSenate both to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to ensure \nthat the Stockpile Stewardship Program is fully funded and implemented. \nThe Nation's prospects for a peaceful world and our national security \ndemand that we move ahead on world fronts.\n  I urge my colleagues to examine these and other important issues \nsurrounding the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty very carefully during the \ncoming months. I hope that we can have this treaty presented to the \nSenate in the next few weeks. I hope that we can begin the hearing \nprocess this fall. I hope that early next year we can act favorably \nupon it.\n  I have written a letter to the chairman and the ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee requesting that we hold hearings on this \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty at our earliest opportunity--hopefully, \nbefore we adjourn this fall. I look forward to that debate.\n  I am confident that the Senate will choose to ratify the treaty since \nit is so much in our national interest to do so and in the interests of \nworld peace, once we have all the facts.\n  Mr. President, I think it is essential that we spend some of our \nvaluable time between now and final adjournment this fall focused on \nthis treaty so that we can understand those facts and act responsibly \non this matter.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/12/senate-section/article/S9245-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9246-S9248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HIDDEN COSTS OF THE TOBACCO SETTLEMENT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 30 years ago this week, Senator Robert \nKennedy addressed the World Conference on Smoking and Health in New \nYork City on ways to address the mounting death rate attributed to \ncigarette smoking. He spoke to the conference about the difficulty of \nconvincing people, particularly the Nation's youth, that smoking can \nkill them. He emphasized the grim statistics of premature death and \nillness caused by smoking.\n  Today, 30 years later, little has changed. Over 400,000 Americans die \nfrom smoking-related diseases each year. In fact, in 1993, smoking was \nattributed to one in every five deaths--more than alcohol, car \naccidents, fires, homicides, suicides, drugs, and AIDS combined.\n  This chart, Mr. President, shows very accurately what the impact of \ncigarettes is in terms of the mortality of Americans--the red line \nbeing 418,000. These are all statistics from the Centers for Disease \nControl--from alcohol, 105,000; car accidents, 46,000; suicides, \n30,000, and so on. This is a very clear graph about the magnitude of \nthe impact of the use of cigarettes, of which 90 percent of smokers \nstart when they are children of 14 or 15 years of age. It is an issue \nthat must be addressed in any kind of agreement that this body is going \nto sanction or support.\n  One million young people between the ages of 12 and 17 take up the \ndeadly habit every year, 3,000 new smokers a day, and 90 percent of the \ncurrent adult smokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. \nIf nothing is done to reverse this trend in adolescent smoking, the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 5 million of \ntoday's children will die prematurely from smoking-caused illnesses.\n  Congress and President Clinton have a historic opportunity to protect \ncurrent and future generations from the scourge of nicotine addiction \nand tobacco-induced illnesses.\n  Study after study has shown that the most powerful weapon in reducing \nsmoking, particularly by the Nation's youth, is to raise the price of \ncigarettes. A $1.50 price increase, as Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler have \nadvocated, would have a double benefit. It would reduce youth smoking \nby more than half over the next decade and provide some compensation to \nthe Federal Government for the damage that smoking has done.\n  Most health economists agree that in addition to Medicaid, tobacco \nimposes a heavy toll, exceeding $20 billion a year, on numerous other \nFederal health programs, including Medicare, the Department of Defense \nhealth programs for military personnel, veterans health programs, and \nthe Federal employees health benefit programs.\n  To compensate the Federal Government fairly for these high costs, the \ntotal settlement would have to be more than doubled from its current \nfigure.\n  The State attorneys general have done a very impressive job in \nworking out the tobacco settlement, but their primary focus was on \nreimbursing the States for the States' participation in the Medicaid \nProgram. They did not have the responsibility to try to ensure the \nprotection for the Federal Treasury in terms of these other health-\nrelated programs--Medicare, the veterans programs and others.\n  If you evaluate those programs and the costs, as Professor Harris has \ndone in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and also \nbefore the Labor and Human Resources Committee, you would see that the \ncost of treating tobacco-related illnesses to Medicare alone are \napproximately $9.3 billion, and others have calculated the Medicare \ncosts to be substantially higher. Yet the proposed settlement provides \nnot a single penny to the Federal Government for the recovery of these \nexpenses.\n  As I mentioned, the State attorneys general have obtained a fair \nreimbursement under the pending settlement for the costs imposed on \nMedicaid. It would be unreasonable and irresponsible for Congress and \nthe Clinton administration to let Joe Camel and the Marlboro man off \nthe hook for the high costs imposed on Federal health programs.\n  Already this year the tobacco industry had the audacity to write a \nspecial-interest loophole in the budget legislation requiring the \nFederal Government to deduct the $50 billion amount generated by the \nincreased cigarette tax devoted to children's health from the\n\n[[Page S9247]]\n\namount the industry would pay under the tobacco settlement. I am \npleased that the Senate voted to repeal this flagrant provision earlier \nthis week, and I commend Senator Durbin and Senator Collins for their \noutstanding effort. But its surreptitious inclusion in the budget \nlegislation demonstrates that nothing has changed in big tobacco's \ncontinuing efforts to subvert reasonable legislation.\n  The Federal Government has the same claim for recovering health costs \nas the States that are suing the tobacco industry for billions of \ndollars in Medicaid expenses.\n  You could have a situation where one person was in a hospital bed \nunder the Medicaid Program, in the next bed a person might be under the \nMedicare Program, and in another bed somebody might be there under the \nVeterans' Administration health care program. All of the patients may \nhave the same kind of illness as a result of their addiction to \nnicotine.\n  The attorneys general looked out for the individuals who receive \nMedicaid. But certainly the taxpayers and the Medicare trust fund ought \nto be able to receive compensation for the costs to the Medicare \nsystem.\n  If the tobacco industry understood and agreed to compensation under \nMedicaid, it is difficult for me to see why they should not also agree \nto the compensation under Medicare, the veterans health care programs, \nor other health programs which are supported by the American taxpayers.\n  The tobacco companies admitted that cigarettes are deadly. They have \naccepted the necessity for broad new restrictions on cigarette \nmarketing and advertising. They have admitted their liability for \nbillions of dollars in compensation for tobacco-induced illnesses. \nHaving made these admissions and concessions, the industry can no \nlonger put up a smokescreen and maintain its past position of total \ndenial. Clearly, the tobacco industry should pay more and can pay more. \nGiven Joe Camel's deep pockets and the substantial toll that tobacco \nimposes on the Federal Government, doubling the final settlement is \nreasonable, justifiable, and affordable.\n  A doubling of the settlement would have a number of important public \nhealth benefits. I believe that the test ought to be what the impact of \nthe settlement will have on the public health of this nation, primarily \nin terms of youth smoking.\n  Mr. President, the doubling of the settlement would require that the \ntobacco industry increase the price of their products by about $1.50 to \ncompensate the Federal Government and the States for the costs of \nsmoking.\n  Professor Harris estimates that under the current settlement, \ncigarette prices would only rise by 62 cents a pack. Since teenage \nsmokers are very sensitive to price increases because of their lack of \nincome, a 62-cent price hike would reduce tobacco use by the Nation's \nyouth by only 18 percent over the next decade, which is significantly \nless than the settlement's requirement that teenage smoking drop by 58 \npercent in 10 years.\n  There have been extensive studies and extensive review of what has \nhappened when the price of cigarettes has gone up and what the impact \nhas been upon youth smoking.\n  We have also seen that, where the price has gone up and the tobacco \nindustry has redoubled their efforts in advertising, still young people \nwill go out and purchase cigarettes. There are studies that make the \nclear case that when you have a significant increase in the price of \ntobacco products and have effective advertising restrictions, you have \na dramatic impact in reducing teenage smoking. That ought to be our \nobjective, and it ought to be our objective at the beginning of the \nprocess, not at the end of the process.\n  The best estimates by those who have reviewed what the price increase \nought to be in order to discourage young people from purchasing \ncigarettes is at least $1.50 a pack. Such an increase would move us \nmuch closer to the objective which has been agreed to in the settlement \nof a reduction of 58 percent in youth smoking over the next several \nyears. With a $1.50 increase, the tobacco industry will be able to meet \nthese youth smoking reduction targets, and will at least partially \ncompensate Federal health care programs for their expenditures due to \ntobacco-induced illnesses.\n  Doubling of the settlement would also bring cigarette prices in the \nUnited States in line with other industrial nations. With a 62-cent \nincrease, cigarette prices in Europe will still be far higher than in \nAmerica. With the 62-cent increase, we are talking about the price in \nthe United States being $2.56 a pack. In Canada, it is $3.06 a pack. In \nGermany, it is $3.18 a pack. If we have a $1.50 increase, the United \nStates will be at $3.44. This figure is, in effect, doubling the amount \nof resources that would be paid by the cigarette companies.\n  This is the price increase recommended by Dr. Kessler and Dr. Koop, \nwhich would have a dramatic result in reducing teenage smoking. When \nyou look at that increase, even though it appears to be quite \nsignificant, it still puts a pack of cigarettes cheaper in the United \nStates than it would be in France, where it is $3.47 a pack, or in \nDenmark, where it is $4.75, or Ireland, at $4.94, or the United \nKingdom, at $5.27. We would still be in the lower range of the \nindustrialized nations of the world. The best estimate and review by \nthose who understand the workings of the tobacco companies believe that \nthey can afford that.\n  So, doubling the settlement amount would raise an additional $10 to \n$15 billion a year over the next quarter century to improve the health \nof the Nation's citizens or other important purposes. For example, we \ncould extend the recently enacted children's health insurance program \nfor low- and moderate-income working adults. We are talking about the \nsons and daughters of working families who are starting off as teachers \nor as police officers or social service workers--all starting out at \n$28,000 or $29,000 a year. We could also act on the new knowledge about \nthe important role of the first 3 years in a child's life by launching \nan initiative to transform the lives of millions of children. We have \nlearned dramatically in the last several years that early intervention \nhas a significant impact in building skills and confidence in young \npeople. With all of the research that has been done on the brain and \nearly development, we are finding out that children in those first \nyears have immense capacity for learning. We know the vacuum that is \nout there in so many different parts of America. There are children who \nare not being encouraged to expand their horizons. Even at the very \nearliest age, we ought to be about trying to find the ways that we can \nstimulate that early learning experience for children.\n  This is a matter of national importance. President Clinton has made a \nstrong commitment to improving the early years of children. We would \nhave an opportunity to really respond to that very, very important \nhuman need--the need that families are facing.\n  The tobacco industry can easily afford the $1.50 increase in prices. \nThere is broad support within the public health community for a price \nincrease as high as $2 a pack. Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler and the members \nof the commission have endorsed such an increase, and so has the \nAmerican Cancer Society.\n\n  Doubling the settlement payment is the right thing to do. It will \nprovide a fair measure of compensation to the Federal Government and \nthe American taxpayer for the hundreds of billions of dollars that \nsmoking-induced illnesses have cost us.\n  Robert Kennedy closed his speech 30 years ago with these words which \nare equally true today:\n\n       We must be equal to the task, for the stakes involved are \n     nothing less than the lives and the health of millions. . . . \n     But this is a battle which can be won.\n\n  Congress and President Clinton should accept nothing less than a \ndoubling of the tobacco settlement, and I urge my colleagues' support.\n  Mr. President, I think most of us would agree this Congress is going \nto be hard pressed this year to get about the business of resolving \nthis issue. But the tobacco settlement will be a matter of enormous \nimportance and consequence at the beginning of the next Congress. It is \nimportant that we begin to establish some parameters in which to \nconsider these various agreements. It is important to provide some \ncriteria by which we can judge whether the proposal is beneficial to \nthe country or whether it is a proposal that needs to\n\n[[Page S9248]]\n\nbe enhanced, as I believe this one does need to be.\n  So, this is a matter of enormous importance for the public health of \nthe American people for the future. We must make sure we are not going \nto involve the nation's children in the nicotine addiction which has \nbrought such tragedy and loss of life into so many families of this \ncountry. We can do something about it. It is a challenge for all of us, \nand I hope we are going to be up to the task.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, we Americans are very lucky. We live in \nthe most beautiful place on Earth. Our mountain chains, our Great \nPlains, our national parks, our coasts and forests are a heritage no \nother country can match. It is our responsibility, through this annual \nbill, to protect our heritage, to manage it so ranchers and the natural \nresource industry workers prosper and, as much as possible, to hand it \ndown to the next generation\n  At the same time, in this bill, we have a responsibility to keep our \npromise to our more than 500 Indian tribes and an opportunity to \nsupport and stimulate the creativity of our artists and authors. \nUnfortunately, this bill falls far short.\n  If we act now, in the coming debate--if we adopt some good \namendments, we can create a very good bill, something we can all be \nproud of and, just as important, something President Clinton can sign, \nso we are not just wasting our time over here. But if we fail to \nimprove this bill, we will have a bill that doesn't measure up and will \nnot become law.\n  Let me begin by saying that this bill is quite good in some areas. \nFor example, one of the West's real glories is its fishing. Norman \nMaclean spoke for quite a few Montana families when, in the opening \nlines of his book ``A River Runs Through It'' he writes, ``In our \nfamily, there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing.''\n  Today, this way of life is under threat. A parasite now found in many \nwestern rivers threatens the fish with whirling disease, and the \nInterior budget makes a commitment to protect these fish. It funds the \nFish Technology Center in Bozeman, MT, as well as the Creston fish \nhatchery in the Flathead Valley. As well, this bill contains crucial \nresearch dollars for the nationally recognized Wild Trout Research \nLaboratory at Montana State University. It also provides $1 million to \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to fund the western Montana project, \nwhich will acquire conservation easements to protect land in Montana's \nBlackfoot Valley, where Norman Maclean grew up, the basis for his book \nand movie, ``A River Runs Through It.'' These are just a couple of \nimportant projects that I believe help both Montana and the country.\n  I would like to address a few sections in this bill which I think \nmust be improved. The first crucial issue is the New World Mine. Of all \nour country's natural treasures, the finest might be Yellowstone \nNational Park. It is America's first national park, home to the world-\nfamous Old Faithful geyser, Yellowstone Lake and its wild trout, paint \npots, mountain streams, and America's only free-ranging buffalo herd.\n  Several years ago, a Canadian company filed a patent to mine land in \nthe mountains just north of Yellowstone Park. Such a mine, nearly 2 \nmiles in the air, would have been a permanent threat to the park's \nwater resources. Every generation of Montana children and every \nAmerican child would have lived with it. Last year, the Clinton \nadministration worked out an agreement to buy out the New World Mine, \nusing the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  Congress agreed to do that when we passed the balanced budget \namendment. I am very pleased that the Senate followed up with $700 \nmillion in new funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund; a wise \ninvestment in the conservation of our prized natural resources.\n  I am disappointed, however, that the House of Representatives failed \nto live up to its end of the bargain when they failed to appropriate \nthe necessary funds. I must say, I am disappointed that the Senate \nappropriated the money but then attached language requiring \nauthorization. There is no reason for that. The deal is done. It is \nfair to the company and it will protect the park forever. To add an \nextra hurdle to an already tortuous process is unnecessary, and, in \nfact, it is foolish, because it may put the whole New World Mine deal \nat risk. I will work in this debate to change that.\n\n\n                         gallatin land exchange\n\n  A similar, although less well-known, example is the Gallatin land \nexchange.\n  For 10 years, we have been working to complete this critical land \nexchange, protecting some very special wild land for future \ngenerations. In this bill, we can complete the acquisition, blocking \ndevelopment in sensitive wildlife areas, and preserving access for our \nsportsmen and outdoor enthusiasts who use our public lands. Instead, we \nshortchange and drag out the process with an appropriation of only $1 \nmillion, paying for only part of the exchange.\n  We must act swiftly, and decisively, if we are to preserve this \nspecial part of America. This exchange has broad public support in \nMontana. I call on my colleagues to provide the necessary commitment to \nthis exchange.\n\n\n                         native american tribes\n\n  I am also concerned with the portions of this bill which address our \nrelationship with native American tribes.\n  Section 120, for example, requires tribal governments to waive their \nsovereign immunity as a condition of receiving tribal priority \nallocations [TPA's]. These moneys fund local reservation programs, like \nhousing, adult vocational training, and law enforcement, all \ndesperately needed, and anyone who visits reservations can tell you \nthat. Anyone who has visited Indian country knows that reservations are \nnot always rich places and tribal governments don't have money to throw \naround. Section 120 would require tribes to choose between meeting the \nbasic needs of their members or defending against frivolous lawsuits. \nAnd I believe that is wrong.\n  Equally troublesome is section 118, which would require the more than \n500 federally recognized tribal governments to submit reports of \nbusiness income to the Bureau of Indian Affairs as a condition of \nreceiving TPA, since it is under the program I mentioned. Section 118 \nwould create more bureaucracy by requiring the BIA to analyze income \nrecords, compile reports, develop formulas for allocating TPA funds, \nand submit the formulas back to the Appropriations Committee. That is \nbad enough. But still worse is the breach of faith this provision \nimplies.\n  Mr. President, payments to tribes are the result of treaty \nobligations--I repeat, treaty obligations. The Federal Government \nagreed to make these payments in exchange for land and resources that \nthe tribes ceded. Section 118 violates both the letter and the spirit \nof our American treaty obligations. We have a basic idea in America \nthat you ought to keep your word, and that is a good ideas. We should \nkeep it here, too.\n\n\n                    national endowment for the arts\n\n  My final concern is the way that this Congress intends to treat the \nNational Endowment for the Arts, the NEA.\n  The NEA represents a modest, but very important, commitment to the \narts in America. In Montana, for example, NEA supports eight symphony \norchestras in cities like Billings, Bozeman, Butte, and Missoula. Over \n20 nonprofit art museums and galleries such as the Liberty Village Art \nCenter in Chester, the Jailhouse Gallery in Hardin, and the Hockaday \nCenter for the Arts in Kalispell. And nearly 20 performing arts groups \nlike Shakespeare in the Park and the Vigilante Players who tour \ncommunities all across Montana, from the towns to the most remote rural \nareas.\n\n  This is a great service. Through the work of NEA, children all over \nMontana come to understand our cultural heritage, meet and talk with \nartists and authors, and get an appreciation of much of the best and \nmost creative work Americans can do. It is a small investment but a \ngood one.\n\n[[Page S9249]]\n\n  Yet, every year we hear almost hysterical attacks against any \ncommitment to the arts at all. NEA has certainly picked a few clunkers, \nI admit, but nothing to justify the rhetorical flights that some of our \ncolleagues direct against it. The House this year, by one vote, \neliminated all commitment to the arts in America. I repeat, eliminated \nall commitment to the arts in America. That means a great loss for our \nchildren, and particularly those in rural America where there are no \noffsetting private resources to fund the arts.\n  I am hoping that the Senate will do better. I asked that the NEA be \nfunded at administration's request of $136 million. So far, the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee has seen fit to fund the NEA at \n$100 million. I believe that is a start, but I will oppose any actions \ntaken on the Senate floor to lower that funding level.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  As you can see, this bill needs a great deal of work, but we should \nsee that as an opportunity rather than a disappointment. This bill is \nour chance, this year, to protect America's natural heritage for our \nchildren. To give renewed vitality to our artistic and cultural life, \nand to show that, in relations with America's sovereign Indian nations, \nthat we are people who keep our word.\n  I commend the members of the Interior subcommittee for their hard \nwork. I know they have devoted a lot of time to dealing with these \ncontentious issues. They have done some good work. I applaud them for \nit. We can build on that as we debate the bill on the floor. I hope \nthat the result will be an Interior bill in which we can all take great \npride.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

DAVID SATCHER TO BE SURGEON GENERAL\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the nomination for the \nposition of U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health to \nbe made by the President of the United States today, which will be sent \nto Congress today for consideration.\n  Nearly 4 months ago, I, the only physician in the U.S. Senate, \npublicly called for the immediate nomination of a Surgeon General--\nspecifically, one who could rise above partisanship, rise above the \npolitical fray to be a reasoned and nonpartisan spokesman for public \nhealth. The reason was very simple, and I outlined it at that time, and \nthat is that the position of Surgeon General is one of recognition--a \nrecognized authority not just in this country, but throughout the \nworld. Second, it is a leadership position, leadership that can offer a \nclear, concise, consistent message. Third, I briefly made a point at \nthat time of the advantages of actually merging into this position of \nSurgeon General that position of Assistant Secretary for Health.\n  For the past year, I have served as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nPublic Health and Safety within the Senate Labor Committee. This \nparticular subcommittee oversees the statutory jurisdiction of the \nPublic Health Service. The Surgeon General oversees the administration \nof the eight agencies of the Public Health Service, and the Surgeon \nGeneral serves as the public's doctor, the Nation's doctor, the \nNation's physician, in advising the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. It is in this role that I feel even more strongly that we \nneed a Surgeon General to provide that clear, that loud, that visible, \nthat understandable voice to promote the health and the safety of our \ncitizens.\n  Like most Americans of my generation, I vividly remember that very \nfamous, well-known--and it's actually referred back to a lot today--\nSurgeon General's report back in 1964 warning of the dangers of \ncigarettes. Well, over 30 years ago now, we still point back to that \nsingle instance, that label, that stepping forth as a benchmark in \nwarning our children today, and others, about the dangers of smoking.\n  In the 1980's, Dr. C. Everett Koop woke America up to something that \nat that time was terribly misunderstood, and that was the emerging AIDS \ncrisis. He spoke with candor and realism that helped the American \npeople, helped people who saw him on television, who saw him in person, \nwho read his writings, separate fact from fiction about what at that \ntime was a very mystical, misunderstood disease.\n  Just last summer, the Surgeon General's office issued a significant \nreport demonstrating that moderate physical activity does indeed reduce \nthe risk of cardiovascular disease and some cancers. All of these \nreports were issued with no political agenda in mind--only the well-\nintentioned health of the Nation being the focus. We inevitably still \nface lingering public health problems, and we can only think about and \nimagine the new public health challenges that will face us--the current \nchallenges of AIDS, emerging infectious diseases--and, again, who knows \n3 years from now what new virus, bacteria, or resistance to bacteria \nwill be a threat to each of our children? There are issues like \nfoodborne illnesses, substance abuse, tobacco use by children, \nalcoholism.\n  We need to use the same approach today that we have used in the past. \nTo do so, I think it can be best accomplished by having a high-profile, \nexperienced official who speaks with authority and can educate all of \nus, the public, about the important link between illness and personal \nbehavior. Past experience shows that the uniformed position of the U.S. \nSurgeon General, with the right person in that position, can educate \nthe Nation on these key public health issues. During Surgeon General \nKoop's tenure, by educating the public on the dangers of smoking, adult \ntobacco use decreased 7 percent. More recently, we have witnessed, \nunfortunately, increased drug and tobacco usage among our youth over \nthe past years. Is it coincidental that during this same period the \nSurgeon General position has been vacant?\n  I think we as legislators, as trustees of the public, in many ways \nhave an obligation, a responsibility, to appoint a Surgeon General and \nto do it as expeditiously as possible, so that we can direct our \nattention to improving the public health.\n  Now, clearly, tough problems, whether it is smoking or alcoholism or \nfoodborne illnesses, a Surgeon General is not going to be able to fix \nthem alone. But what he or she can do is be that one voice. We all know \nhow important it is to have a simple message, a straightforward \nmessage, a concise message, a persistent message given by one voice--\nthat voice being the Surgeon General.\n  Dr. Koop I think summarized the position very well. He said that the \nSurgeon General is a position ``* * * high calling with an obligation \nto interpret health and medical facts for the public.''\n  I like the way Dr. Koop expressed it because, first of all, that is a \ncalling, and in many ways public service can be a thankless job. So it \nreally is a calling. But the obligation is one that the nominees must \ntake very seriously; and, that is to interpret the health and medical \nfacts for the public. We know that there is a tremendous amount written \ntoday, with the health advances, with the new discoveries. We just \nsimply need to look at the new genes being discovered today, the human \ngene projects. But when a person looks at the medical literature, how \ncan they interpret it? The Surgeon General can look at the reports, can \nassimilate the data, and help boil that down into a simple, crystal-\nclear message which can improve and affect the health of every \nAmerican.\n  Dr. David Satcher today is being forwarded to the Senate as the \nnominee for the position of U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant \nSecretary for Health. It will arrive in Congress today.\n  As a result, the Senate is asked to consider this nomination and to \neventually vote as to whether or not to confirm Dr. Satcher for these \npositions. I hope that my colleagues will consider this nomination \nbased on his qualifications and his ability--again, pushing \npartisanship and politics aside.\n\n[[Page S9250]]\n\n  Dr. Satcher is a family physician. He is an accomplished researcher \nand educator, and he has a very long truly distinguished record in \npromoting public health. I understand his goal is to improve the health \nof our Nation based on science, which is the essential role of the \nSurgeon General's office.\n  The confirmation process is, as all of us in this body have seen, a \nfascinating one as we subject our nominees to interrogation. But it is \ncritical that we interrogate in the right way--touch on the right \nissues, looking at the substance. It is very clear that we will not--\nand I as a physician very likely will not--agree with Dr. Satcher on \nevery particular issue and every particular policy. But what I am \nconfident of, in knowing Dr. Satcher, is that debate, that discussion, \nwill be based on rigorous and disciplined science--not on politics, and \nnot on rhetoric. That is what this position deserves, and that is what \nthe American people deserve.\n  Looking out for this Nation's public health, both domestically and \nabroad, is truly a daunting role. Simply the way I define it is that is \nthe public spokesperson for health for the United States of America. \nBut I am confident that Dr. Satcher will reclaim the integrity \nsurrounding that position that has historically been associated with \nthat position of Surgeon General.\n  The sort of questions that we need to look at as Dr. Satcher goes \nthrough the Senate confirmation process are things like: Does this man \nhave the commitment? Does he have the intelligence? Does he have the \ntraining, the honesty, and integrity to be the chief spokesperson for \nAmericans on matters concerning public health? And I also would like to \nadd--in no small part because I know Dr. Satcher is so strong here--it \nis critical that this person be able to articulate his views with \nclarity, with simplicity, and with dignity.\n  We have before us a man with a long record of demonstrated public \nservice. He currently serves as Director of the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention in Atlanta. In that role over the last several \nyears he has demonstrated those very qualities that I mentioned are \nimportant in this confirmation process. He has been a strong manager. \nHe has been an excellent spokesperson for public health. He has been a \nman of scientific integrity.\n  As a member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I am \ncommitted to the confirmation process and take very seriously the \nresponsibility of voting on this nominee. I approach this with a very \nopen mind and will continue to scrutinize everything that comes before \nthe committee as information is being made available to the committee \nby the administration.\n  I have the one advantage, in that Dr. Satcher spent approximately 11 \nyears in Nashville, TN, where I am from. I have been able to witness \nfirsthand his accomplishments, and have had a chance to go back and \nlook at many of his other distinguished qualifications.\n  I look forward to hearing his articulation of his goals, his \nstatements, and the testimonials of others about him as we go through \nthis confirmation process. This is a public process. It should be a \npublic process.\n  I look forward to meeting with Dr. Satcher personally next week to \ndiscuss with him the specifics of his plans as the next Surgeon \nGeneral.\n  As I mentioned, Dr. Satcher lived in Nashville. I consider him a \nTennessean from my hometown for about 11 years where he ran a very \nprominent historically black medical college--the Meharry Medical \nSchool.\n  Dr. Satcher has a knowledge of population-based medicine, \nepidemiology, family practice, and a broad understanding of our health \ncare system. He is widely respected by his peers in our community of \nTennessee, in Nashville, and across this country.\n  Mr. President, at this juncture I ask unanimous consent that letters \nof support from the Tennessee Medical Association, Vanderbilt \nUniversity Medical Center, and the Phoenix Healthcare Corp. be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Tennessee Medical Association,\n\n                                Nashville, TN, September 10, 1997.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: On behalf of the 6,800 members of \n     the Tennessee Medical Association, we take this opportunity \n     to offer our wholehearted support for your nomination of \n     David Satcher, MD, as the Surgeon General of the United \n     States. Dr. Satcher has ably proven his leadership \n     capabilities by serving as president of Meharry Medical \n     College in Nashville, Tennessee. During his tenure at \n     Meharry, he presented a strong voice in the Nashville \n     community as a public health advocate. I am especially \n     pleased to commend him to you for consideration in light of \n     his stellar leadership, unparalleled history of community \n     service, and sense of mission in the public health sector.\n       Over the last four years, he has only enhanced his position \n     as a leader in the medical community, and displayed his clear \n     commitment to disease prevention, by serving as the director \n     of the Centers for Disease Control. He will make an \n     outstanding spokesman for the nation's health and will be a \n     valued adviser to both you and Secretary Shalala.\n       Without reservation, we commend Dr. Satcher's nomination to \n     the U.S. Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and \n     encourage the full Senate to act responsibly and quickly to \n     confirm his nomination both as Surgeon General and Assistant \n     Secretary for Health.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             R. Benton Adkins, MD,\n     President, Tennessee Medical Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Vanderbilt University\n\n\n                                               Medical Center,\n\n                                Nashville, TN, September 11, 1997.\n     President Bill Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On behalf of Vanderbilt University \n     Medical Center, I wish to extend our strong support for the \n     nomination of Dr. David Satcher for the positions of \n     Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon General at the US \n     Department of Health and Human Services.\n       We believe Dr. Satcher is well qualified to fill these two \n     positions where his medical knowledge, executive experience, \n     and very real eloquence on behalf of the nation's health make \n     him uniquely suited. As director of the Centers for Disease \n     Control (CDC) he has lead the health community's effort to \n     increase childhood immunization, expand access to breast and \n     cervical cancer screening, and build a framework that will \n     better enable us to defend against the threats of infectious \n     diseases.\n       The announcement today of the nation's health vital \n     statistics are a strong indictor of a strengthened CDC under \n     Dr. Satcher's leadership. These statistics show a 26% decline \n     of mortality from HIV-AIDS between 1995 and 1996 for 25-44 \n     year olds; teen birth rate declining for the fifth straight \n     year; a new record low in the infant mortality rate; and \n     continued increase in the number of women obtaining early \n     prenatal care.\n       In addition, during Dr. Satcher's tenure at Meharry Medical \n     College he was an absolutely critical voice on behalf of \n     medical education and research, but even more importantly he \n     was a voice on behalf of the underserved and uninsured of \n     Middle Tennessee. We believe he will bring a perspective that \n     will well serve the medical community and the patients we \n     care for.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Harry R. Jacobson, M.D.,\n     Interim Vice Chancellor for Health Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Phoenix Healthcare Corp.,\n\n                                Nashville, TN, September 11, 1997.\n     President Bill Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am honored and pleased to write this \n     letter in support of Dr. David Satcher for Surgeon General \n     and Assistant Secretary for Health. I have known Dr. Satcher \n     since 1982 when he became President of Meharry Medical \n     College where I served as Vice President of Finance and \n     Business from 1973-1977. During his tenure at Meharry, we \n     worked very closely on a number of local community and health \n     care issues, including the merger of Metropolitan General \n     Hospital and Meharry Hubbard Hospital. Dr. Satcher and I, \n     during his tenure in Nashville, were also Deacons in First \n     Baptist Church--Capitol Hill and members of 100 Black Men of \n     Middle Tennessee.\n       Dr. Satcher is a physician-scholar with a strong public \n     health focus. Intellectually, Dr. Satcher will make an \n     excellent person for the position of Assistant Secretary for \n     Health which is responsible for health policy. His experience \n     and ability to articulate with passion on matters promoting \n     health and preventing disease, injury and premature death \n     makes him also capable of being the national physician, \n     Surgeon General of the United States. His thoughtful \n     presentations on health care matters and administrative \n     experience will enhance the health status of Americans \n     generally as he has done during his tenure at the CDC where \n     childhood immunization rates have increased from 55% in 1992 \n     to 78% in 1996. Finally, one could not get a person with \n     higher moral and ethical standards than Dr. Satcher.\n       I certainly hope that the nation will accept the services \n     of Dr. Satcher as Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for \n     Health. The country will be well served by a person of his \n     ability.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Samuel H. Howard,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, if I just look at these letters from \nVanderbilt\n\n[[Page S9251]]\n\nUniversity Medical Center, Dr. Harry Jacobson in one sentence describes \nvery well what his peers feel about Dr. Satcher.\n  I quote from that letter.\n\n       We believe Dr. Satcher is well qualified to fill these two \n     positions where his medical knowledge, executive experience, \n     and very real eloquence on behalf of the Nation's health make \n     him uniquely suited.\n\n  From the Tennessee Medical Association, talking about his tenure at \nMeharry--remember, he was there for 11 years--Dr. Benton Adkins, who is \nPresident of the Tennessee Medical Association, writes:\n\n       During his tenure at Meharry, he presented a strong voice \n     in the Nashville community as a public health advocate. I am \n     especially pleased to commend him to you for consideration in \n     light of his stellar leadership, unparalleled history of \n     community service, and sense of mission in the public health \n     sector.\n\n  In the third letter, Mr. Samuel Howard, chairman of Phoenix \nHealthcare Corp., who had known him well through working together at \nMeharry, says:\n\n       Dr. Satcher is a physician-scholar with a strong public \n     health focus.\n\n  Those are just samplings of the sort of recommendations by his \nassociates.\n  I urge my colleagues to focus on Dr. David Satcher's qualifications \nto hold the two positions of U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant \nSecretary for Health. As I mentioned, he is a family physician. He \nrespects the role of the family within the community. He is an \naccomplished scientist and researcher. He has a Ph.D. as well as a \nmedical degree. His Ph.D. is in cytogenetics--he allows science to \ndrive decisionmaking, not politics. He is a proven public health \nleader--an experienced public health leader--having served as Director, \nwhere he currently serves, of the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention in Atlanta, GA, which is that Health and Human Service \nagency responsible for promoting health and preventing disease, injury, \nand premature death, with 11 major branches and worldwide \nresponsibilities.\n  Mr. President, in closing, as a physician, I will have to say that \nultimately much of my feeling comes back to putting faith in the trust, \nwhich is a very vital part of the doctor-patient relationship. I look \nat this very similarly. The Surgeon General is the people's doctor. \nAnd, to be truly effective, Dr. Satcher must earn and maintain the \npublic's trust on health issues. Trust I think will be a large part of \nthis nomination. It was the main reason, if we look at failures, I \nthink that occurred in the past as related to this position.\n  From everything that I know of Dr. Satcher, he not only has the \nability to be a reasoned scientific voice but he has the ability to win \nthe trust of the American people.\n  I am fortunate to have known Dr. Satcher in his capacity as \nphysician, as a president of a medical school, and as the head of one \nof our great public health agencies.\n  I will work with my colleagues in the U.S. Senate in this nomination \nprocess, and I urge their full, fair, and expeditious consideration of \nDr. Satcher's nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of New Hampshire). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/12/senate-section/article/S9249-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE VICE PRESIDENT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to say a few words this morning \nabout the Vice President of the United States--a man with whom most of \nus in this Chamber have served either in the House or here in the \nSenate.\n  Right now, the bright glare of the public spotlight is on Al Gore. I \nthink all of us know that public spotlight can sometimes be very harsh \nand unforgiving. Sometimes it can distort. But I don't believe the \nfrenzy of the moment is going to diminish the achievement of two \ndecades.\n  Al Gore has spent 21 years in public life--and it has been a \ndistinguished 21 years by any standard. Before his career in the \nCongress, he was an investigative reporter for the Nashville \nTennessean. Prior to that time, he was a student at Vanderbilt's \nDivinity and Law Schools. And prior to that, he served this country \nhonorably during the Vietnam war.\n  People sometimes make a caricature of Al Gore's reputation for \nseriousness and honesty. But the truth of the matter is that Al Gore \nearned that reputation by immersing himself totally in his \nresponsibilities as a lawmaker.\n  In the House, he mastered the subtleties of the arms control debate \nand made internationally recognized contributions to stabilizing the \nnuclear arms race. In the Senate, he devoted himself passionately to \nprotecting the environment. He was one of the first in this body to \nappreciate the potential of Federal Government supercomputers and the \nbackbone that ultimately became the information superhighway. There's \nevery likelihood that he will be remembered as a parent of the internet \njust as his own father is remembered as one of the founders of the \nInterstate Highway System.\n  By almost all accounts, Al Gore has been the most influential and \neffective Vice President in modern American history. His Reinventing \nGovernment Program has literally revolutionized the executive branch \nagencies, reducing the size of bureaucracies, cutting out red tape, and \nbuilding a more business-like paradigm for the delivery of vital \nservices to the American people.\n  That litany of achievement is real and familiar. I only run through \nit to give some sense of proportion to the charges that are now \ndominating the news. And my point is simple: we know Al Gore in this \nChamber. The American people know him. The hearings we've had here in \nthe Congress have revealed nothing to alter what we know. And I don't \nbelieve that insubstantial charges based on ambiguous law are going to \ncount for anything against Al Gore's solid and unambiguous record of \npublic service.\n  I'm confident that, ultimately, a dispassionate and fair-minded \nAmerican people will put the issues raised in the last campaign in \ntheir proper perspective. And I'm equally confident that, at the end of \nthe day, Al Gore's reputation for public service and integrity will \nemerge absolutely intact.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/12/senate-section/article/S9251-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

DAVID SATCHER TO BE SURGEON GENERAL\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend President Clinton for his \nannouncement today of his nomination of Dr. David Satcher to be Surgeon \nGeneral and Assistant Secretary for Health.\n  David Satcher is an excellent choice for these important positions. \nAs Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the \nlast 4 years, he has ably led that agency which is responsible for \nprotecting health and preventing disease, injury, and premature death. \nHe is uniquely\n\n[[Page S9252]]\n\nqualified to become the Nation's foremost spokesman on health issues.\n  In 1992, under Dr. Satcher's leadership, the CDC launched and \nimplemented a successful childhood immunization initiative. Before the \ninitiative, only a little more than half of the Nation's children--55 \npercent--were immunized. Now, 78 percent are immunized. As a result, \nvaccine-preventable childhood diseases are at record lows.\n  Dr. Satcher has also led CDC efforts to strengthen the Nation's \ndefenses against infectious diseases and food-borne illnesses. We rely \non the CDC to provide a rapid response to outbreaks of disease and \nprotect public safety. Under Dr. Satcher, CDC has begun to implement a \ncomprehensive strategy on infectious diseases and plays a key role in a \nnew early warning system on food-borne illnesses.\n  Dr. Satcher was previously a member of the faculty of the UCLA School \nof Medicine and the King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles. For 2 \nyears, he served as interim dean of the Drew Postgraduate Medical \nSchool. He also served as professor and chairman of the department of \ncommunity medicine and family practice at the Morehouse School of \nMedicine in Atlanta.\n  For over a decade, from 1982 to 1993, Dr. Satcher served as president \nof Meharry Medical College in Nashville, the Nation's largest private \nhistorically black institution for educating health care professionals \nand biomedical researchers.\n  At the CDC, he has combined a proven track record of leadership and \neffectiveness that make him an excellent choice to be Surgeon General \nand Assistant Secretary for Health, and I urge the Senate to move \nexpeditiously to confirm him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/12/senate-section/article/S9251-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/12/senate-section/article/S9252-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9252]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. DURBIN:\n       S. 1172.

A bill for the relief of Sylvester Flis; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                       PRIVATE RELIEF LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation on \nbehalf of Mr. Sylvester Flis, a permanent resident alien from Poland, \nnow living in Chicago. This bill would grant immediate citizenship to \nSylvester by waiving the mandatory 5-year waiting period required of \nall permanent residents wishing to become U.S. citizens. Out of great \nrespect for what U.S. citizenship stands for and the privileges it \nbestows, the Senate has rarely granted this kind of request, and only \nin cases that it deems to be uniquely compelling. After hearing \nSylvester's story, I am confident my colleagues will agree with me that \nthis request fulfills this high standard and is therefore deserving of \ntheir support.\n  Sylvester entered this country as a permanent resident in July 1994 \nafter learning that his grandmother, by virtue of having been born in \nNew Haven, CT and being a U.S. citizen, could sponsor her family to be \nin the United States. He now lives in Chicago with his parents, Czeslaw \nand Lucja, his sister, Anna, and brother, Ireneusz.\n  Like many young Eastern Europeans who grew up during the final years \nof Soviet domination, Sylvester, now 23 years of age, is eager to take \nadvantage of the opportunities offered by his new found freedom. He \ncurrently takes English classes and is working toward his GED, general \nequivalency diploma. Sylvester works for his uncle's carpentry business \nand hopes to eventually find a job in electronics, which is what he \nstudied as a student in Poland. Like the millions of immigrants who \nhave preceded him, Sylvester has left behind the security of friends \nand familiar surroundings to come to the United States to share his \ntalents and make our Nation a stronger one.\n  Two things, however, make Sylvester very different from most \nimmigrants. First, he suffers from a disease known as spina bifida. \nSpina bifida is the failure of the spine to close during the first \nmonth of pregnancy. This results in varying degrees of paralysis, loss \nof sensation in the lower limbs, difficulty with bowel and bladder \nmanagement, and learning disabilities. As a result of his condition, \nSylvester is confined to a wheelchair.\n  The second thing that distinguishes Sylvester from most immigrants is \nthat he is a world class athlete. Despite his condition, Sylvester has \ndeveloped into one of the top sled hockey players in the country. I \nimagine most of you are unfamiliar with sled hockey, as was I until I \nbecame familiar with Sylvester's story. Sled hockey is a variation of \nregular hockey that is played by disabled individuals on a regulation \nrink. Sled hockey has all the same rules as regular hockey except that \nplayers use sleds, rather than ice skates, to maneuver around the ice.\n  Last Spring, Sylvester competed with the United States National Team \nin international sled hockey competitions in Sweden and the United \nKingdom. He hopes to compete with the United States in the 1998 \nParalympics in Nagano, Japan next March. The Paralympics are an \ninternational athletic competition for individuals with mobility \ndisabilities held every 4 years. They begin soon after the completion \nof the regular Olympic Games and are held in the same city and country \nas the Olympics. Sylvester is considered a lock to make next year's \nteam.\n  To make that dream a reality, however, Sylvester needs to be a U.S. \ncitizen by the end of this coming January, which is when the final team \nwill be selected. While the International Olympic Committee allows \nParalympians to represent countries with which they have permanent \nresidency, the U.S. Olympic Committee [USOC] has very strict rules \nwhich require citizenship for all U.S. competitors. Sylvester was \neligible to participate with the United States team in Europe last \nSpring because those competitions were not sponsored by the USOC. By \ngranting Sylvester citizenship and waiving the mandatory 5-year-waiting \nperiod, he will be eligible to compete for the United States in Japan. \nWithout a waiver, Sylvester would become a citizen in July 1999, which \nwould be too late for the 1998 games. Poland will not be competing in \nsled hockey at these games, making the United States team Sylvester's \nonly chance to participate in this once-in-a-lifetime event.\n  As I mentioned at the outset, Sylvester is more than just a good \nathlete who wants to compete for the United States. He is a young man \nof tremendous character who has worked hard to become part of our \ncommunity. I've spoken to several people who have worked with Sylvester \nand they all attest to his work ethic, his character, and his \nenthusiasm for helping others. This spirit is best demonstrated by the \nactive role he has played in the Chicago community to help other \ndisabled individuals overcome the obstacles they face in their daily \nlives. His volunteer activities include teaching sled hockey at the \nChicago Park District to disabled and nondisabled individuals. He also \nvolunteers with Wheelchair Dance Chicago, an organization that, as the \nname suggests, helps disabled individuals learn to dance. Through his\n\n[[Page S9253]]\n\nassociation with the Spina Bifida Association, Sylvester has provided a \npositive role model to those with disabilities who wish to excel.\n  Being disabled can be hard. It's even harder when you live in an \nunfamiliar country where you have to learn a new language. Sylvester \nhas overcome these obstacles to not only build a new life with his \nfamily in the United States, but to become an accomplished athlete and \na valuable part of his community. He is a true American success story. \nThe waiving of the mandatory waiting period for Sylvester would grant \ncitizenship to a young man who has much to offer our country, both \ninside the rink and out.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1172\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. GRANT OF NATURALIZATION TO SYLVESTER FLIS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, Sylvester Flis shall be naturalized as a citizen of the \n     United States upon the filing of the appropriate application \n     and upon being administered the oath of renunciation and \n     allegiance in an appropriate ceremony pursuant to section 337 \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n       (b) Deadline for Application and Payment of Fees.--\n     Subsection (a) shall apply only if the application for \n     naturalization is filed with appropriate fees within 1 year \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bond, Mr. \n        Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Graham, Mr. Reid, Mr. Kempthorne, \n        Mr. Thomas, Mr. Allard, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Grassley, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1173. A bill to authorize funds for construction of highway safety \nprograms, and for mass transit programs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n               the intermodal transportation act of 1997\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I note, of course, the presence on the \nfloor of the distinguished Senator from Montana. I don't suggest he \nremain, but I am about to praise him at great length for his \nparticipation in the drafting of a very important piece of legislation \nentitled ``A bill to authorize funds for construction of highways, for \nhighway safety programs and for mass transit programs, and for other \npurposes.''\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, the Senator who \nnow has the floor has led the way in developing a very balanced, very \nfair way to spend our highway dollars over 6 years. My staff has worked \nlong, long hours along with his staff and that of Senator Chafee. I \nwant all Americans to know just how much I appreciate the very, very \nhard work of the Senator from Virginia who has led the way among the \nthree of us in developing, I think, a terrific bill. I compliment him, \nand I want all Virginians to know all that he has done, as well as all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. As the distinguished \nranking member of our Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator \nBaucus was instrumental from the very beginning. I think his presence \nand his comments reflect the truly bipartisan nature in which we, the \nmembers of the committee, have forged this bill. Indeed, under the \nleadership of our distinguished chairman, the senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland, we have been able to achieve this piece of legislation, which \nalthough receiving, understandably, early criticism from some few \nquarters, those quarters are fewer than I had anticipated. I thank my \ndistinguished colleague. I shall have further comments about his \ncontribution as I proceed, Mr. President.\n  I should also like to acknowledge the presence on the floor of the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida. He, Mr. Graham, has been \ninstrumental from the very first in working this bill toward a balanced \npiece of legislation which we feel it represents. I was extraordinarily \nheartened by the fact that nine members of our committee have joined \nand I think others will soon join as cosponsors. Our list of cosponsors \nnow as of the introduction totals some 12, in addition to Senator \nChafee and Senator Baucus.\n  Mr. President, also it is traditional around here to acknowledge the \nparticipation of staff, and all too often that is done at the end. I \nwant to do it at the very, very beginning, because the contribution of \nthe staff in the preparation of a 400-page bill, a copy of which I will \nmomentarily have in my hands and present to the Senate--400 pages--you \ncan imagine the staff was absolutely instrumental.\n  We have the staff director, Mr. Jimmie Powell, Dan Corbett, Kathy \nRuffalo, who works for Senator Baucus, Tom Sliter, Linda Jordan, Ellen \nStein, and, above all, my distinguished chief counsel of the \nsubcommittee, Ann Loomis. This is my 19th year in the Senate, and I say \nunequivocally, Mr. President, I have never seen an individual work \nharder on a piece of legislation than Ann Loomis, proudly of the \nCommonwealth of Virginia.\n  We go into the final review by the Senate, which is scheduled, I \nbelieve, in the last week, according to Senator Lott who is very \nenthusiastic about the Senate moving forward expeditiously on this \nbill, in September, or thereabouts. So we will consider it at that \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I introduce the Intermodal Surface Transportation Act \nof 1997. There have been many names given to this. There was ISTEA \nwhich was passed by the Congress in 1991. I think for simplicity I will \nrefer to this as ISTEA II, as I am sure there will be an ISTEA III and \nan ISTEA IV. There is no more important function of the Congress of the \nUnited States than to address our transportation needs. So there will \nbe a succession of bills, but I am hopeful that this bill, which is of \n6-year duration, in contrast to the House of Representatives which is \n3, will, again, sequentially follow on from ISTEA I as ISTEA II.\n  This 6-year bill represents a hard-fought set of negotiations. Again, \nI most sincerely express my appreciation to the leadership and the \nwisdom contributed by our distinguished chairman, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. \nBaucus, the ranking member of the committee and also the ranking member \nof the Subcommittee on Transportation--which was given the principal \nresponsibility for drafting the bill--of which I am privileged to be \nthe chairman, together with Mr. Baucus in his dual capacity as ranking \non the subcommittee.\n\n  Balance and fairness, those are the two words that will enable the \nsupporters of this piece of legislation to have it passed by the \nSenate--those two words--because those are the principal goals that I \nsought and others who worked so hard on this bill, and also to preserve \nthose parts of ISTEA that have served the Nation well.\n  In 1991, ISTEA represented a landmark piece of legislation, unlike \nanything that had ever been passed in the history of the United States, \nother than perhaps the significance of the original interstate system. \nBut ISTEA I was landmark. It embraced the need for an intermodal \nconcept. It embraced the need to preserve our environment as we, \nindeed, paved America to meet our transportation needs. Therefore, I \nwould like to recognize the principal author of that bill, Senator \nMoynihan, the senior Senator from New York. He has been referred to as \n``the father of ISTEA.'' His duties on the Finance Committee did not \nenable him to have as active a role as I am sure he wished to have had \nin the preparation of this bill, and he also recognized in the passage \nof these 6 years that there are other factors that have come to the \nforefront that were going to guide ISTEA II. But nevertheless, I think \ntoday in the New York press, it is reported that ``Senator Moynihan \nstates New York has been treated fairly.''\n  I thank ``the father of ISTEA'' for that first statement because it \ncomes from one who is well informed as to this Nation's requirements on \ntransportation. In his capacity as a senior member, indeed ranking \nmember, of the Senate Finance Committee, he will have a very active \nrole in fulfilling that committee's responsibility with respect to this \nbill, as will two other committees: The Banking Committee and the \nCommerce Committee. So this legislation eventually embraces the work of \nfour Senate committees.\n  This bill addresses the unique transportation needs in the different \nregions of the country. The congestion needs of the growing South, the \naging infrastructure needs of the Northeast and,\n\n[[Page S9254]]\n\nindeed, the unique, the very unique requirements of, we call them the \nWestern States, primarily those in the Northwest corridor of the United \nStates--Montana, Wyoming. Mr. Thomas, a member of our committee, and \nMr. Kempthorne were very active, together with Mr. Baucus, in bringing \nto the forefront the special requirements of those States.\n  It was the judgment of myself and Mr. Baucus that we should have a \nhearing, which we indeed did, hosted by Mr. Baucus, in Idaho with \nofficials both from Montana and Idaho testifying before our committee. \nI learned things like, given the extensive mileage and the sparse \nsettlement of houses, farms and cities and factories, the shoulders of \nthose roads need some special attention; the speeds at which they \ntravel are somewhat different than in other parts of America.\n  So the rural West--I think they look with pride on still being \nreferred to as ``rural.'' In my few moments of vacation, I tried to \nspend a little time in that region, but it is one of the most well-\npreserved, most magnificent parts of our great country. This \ntransportation bill takes into consideration their special needs, their \nspecial environmental concerns so that America can continue to enjoy \nthe bountiful natural resources we have in that part of the country.\n  So I am pointing out that we very carefully took into consideration--\nand I shall not further enumerate--all of the unique parts of each of \nour 50 States, and particularly as they are located in certain \ngeographic locations. We have carefully preserved the principles of \nISTEA. We have proven so successful by hard experience, practical \nexperience, practical application in our several States.\n  Examples. Ensuring that transportation contributes to preserving our \nenvironment. The President of the United States acknowledged some \nmonths ago in a speech that this piece of legislation--not referring to \nthe specific bill, although I hope this bill meets the requirements of \nthe administration. Indeed, I have, just moments ago, finished another \nlengthy conference with the Secretary of Transportation who visited my \noffice. And we talked about the President's desire to make sure that \nthis legislation preserved the best parts of ISTEA as it related to the \nenvironment and, indeed, built on that foundation. And I think, Mr. \nPresident, largely under the leadership of Senator Chafee, we have done \nthat.\n  But that is an example of how we took the best of ISTEA and preserved \nit in this bill. We built upon the shared decisionmaking that was in \nISTEA I between the Federal, State, and local governments, and most \nimportantly ensuring that the public, I mean right down to townhall \nmeeting, the public continues to participate fully in the \ntransportation planning process.\n  The experience, over 6 years, of ISTEA I has shown that local \ngovernments contribute positively to setting transportation priorities. \nI look forward to working with my own local governments and projects of \nsignificance to them. For example, I have spent so much of my life down \nin the rural part of Virginia, primarily in the Middleburg, Upperville \nareas.\n  I first started down there working on farms in the middle 1930's. I \nremember the farms did not even have tractors, and it was all horses. \nBut through the years this small section of my State has been able to \npreserve the qualities of this rural community. We have Route 50, which \nis a winding road. It was actually an oxcart road cut by the need to \nmove west from Alexandria, which was a major port, surprisingly a major \nport on the east coast at one time, and Georgetown. And they gathered \nthere and then moved on ``westward ho'' down Route 50.\n  Route 50 winds and twists through the lovely hills and the valleys \nand crosses the streams. We want to somehow keep that for future \ngenerations, keep it in place. There are some people with considerable \nvision as to how to do it, yet still meet the needs for modern \ntransportation. Anyway, I hope to incorporate in this bill certain \nlegislative provisions which will foster the ability of the local \ngovernments and local leaders to preserve the best, not only in the \ncommunity in which I grew up through these many years, but elsewhere in \nAmerica.\n  Also of profound importance to the Greater Metropolitan Washington \narea is the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. In this legislation, we have more \nthan doubled the administration's $400 million proposed level of \nfunding for the bridge to $900 million, thereby elevating the \nsignificance of the bridge. We have however provided that before any \nfunds can be spent on construction of the bridge, either an authority \nor agreement between Maryland, Virginia, or the District of Columbia \nmust be made as to who will take title of the bridge.\n  We have also carefully preserved those principles of ISTEA which have \nagain a proven record of success, an absolute proven record of success.\n  The heart of this piece of legislation again is fairness and balance. \nThere is no more dramatic provision to document that goal than the \nequitable fair funding of return of the tax dollars.\n  ISTEA failed--and I have to criticize ISTEA--it failed to provide \nfunding to our States based on current data that measured the extent \nand the use of our transportation system. It contained five equity \nadjustments, yet still the formula did not equitably treat all States \nwith the fairness based on their contributions to the highway trust \nfund.\n\n  Our bill today ensures balance and fairness. This one does what we \npossibly set out to do--I will attribute the best of intentions to the \ncrafters of ISTEA I--but I assure you the drafters of ISTEA II have \nlocked in a formula, predicated on modern, up-to-date factors, and it \ncannot be twisted and bent or changed in such a way as to deny to every \nState a 90-cent return on each dollar of taxes sent from a State to \nUncle Sam's Treasury in the highway trust fund wherever the depository \nmay be in Washington, DC.\n  Our bill today ensures this balance and fairness. Every State will \nreceive a minimum return of 90 percent of their contributions to the \nhighway trust fund. This guarantee is very different from the so-called \n90 percent minimum allocation in ISTEA I. This is a real guarantee, not \nto be readjusted by any further actions. I would not have supported \nanything that did not give every State a minimum guarantee of 90 cents \non the dollar.\n  Mr. President, we have listened to our colleagues and made our best \nattempt to be fair. Either this bill succeeds on the doctrine of \nfairness or it will fall victim to politics, not Republican versus \nDemocrat politics for this is a bipartisan bill. You need only look at \nthe list of cosponsors. You only need to heed the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana. No, it will not fall victim to \npolitics as we recognize them, but will fall victim to literally civil \nstrife between big States, industrial States, small States, and the \nwhole thing can be torn apart, and I doubt that Humpty Dumpty could \never be put back together again if they pull this apart in a way that \nany Senator could stand on the floor and say each State is treated \nequally and gets 90 cents back on the tax dollar.\n  I ask my colleagues, who understandably have concerns about this \nlegislation, to consult with their respective highway officials. STEP-\n21 was put together, again, as a consequence of a group of these well-\nexperienced individuals in a number of States; Stars 2000, likewise, \nwhich was put together by a number of expert highway officials in the \nseveral States. They understand the problems. I hope that our \ncolleagues will seek the advice and counsel of their respective highway \nofficials before they decide exactly what they are going to do on this \nbill.\n  At the outset, again, my highest priority was to improve the mobility \nof people and goods. The biggest threat to the United States today \ncomes from the growing competition around the world, all throughout the \nworld. It is a one-world market. While we sleep the other half are \nbusily engaged in their activities. Those economic activities are to \nmeet us at our very doorsteps with competition in their products and in \ntheir services. It is an extraordinary world in which we live today \ncompared to just a decade ago.\n  How do we compete in this market? America very much wants to keep our \nwages, our lifestyle, our environment at the very best. The standards \nof those factors in other nations in many instances are far less. Those \npriorities are not sought by the central governments, indeed, the \ngovernments of those States. So what do we do?\n\n[[Page S9255]]\n\n  How do we beat the marketplace sale on a pair of blue jeans \nmanufactured in the Far East versus a pair of blue jeans manufactured \nin the United States? Well, I have a dramatic experience I remember. I \nwent to my State to a blue jeans plant, and I talked to the workers. I \nwatched them make a quality product that would match any product in the \nworld, in fact, in my judgment, is better. I may have a slight \nprejudice. It was better.\n  But I asked them, ``How do you beat the low wages, the marginal \nenvironment, and lifestyle in faraway lands, but when your product \nreaches the store shelf right beside them is a product from a foreign \nland?''\n  He said, ``Come with me.''\n  We went to the back of this plant where every hour big trucks backed \nup and loaded on the products. He said, ``We get an order in in the \nmorning. That order is filled. And overnight it is delivered right to \nthe store's shelf.''\n\n  We can beat them because of America's transportation system. And that \nis what this bill, Mr. President, is designed to do, to thrust America \nahead in the competitive economic market by virtue of a modern, \nefficient transportation system, to cut down the time of Mr. and Mrs. \nAmerica behind the wheel getting to their place of work, getting to the \nschool to drop off the children, and returning safely at home. Every \nminute wasted behind that wheel in gridlock is a wasted moment from \nwork, from family, and such leisure time as we may have.\n  This bill is directed to make America more competitive in that one-\nworld market. How do we achieve these goals? We streamline ISTEA's five \nprograms into three programs: The National Highway System, NHS; the \nSurface Transportation Program; STP; and the Congestion Mitigation and \nAir Quality Program, CMAQ. Those are the three.\n  By condensing five into three, we build in efficiencies. We have \ngiven more authority to the Governors, to the various highways and \nboards and commissions. We have given more authority down to the boards \nof supervisors and to the mayors and to other local authorities to make \nthe decisions that are best for their community, nevertheless, \nmaintaining the Federal focus on our most important network of roads, \nthe National Highway System, which indeed now embraces the historic \ninterstate system.\n  While I started with a goal of a 95 percent return for every State--I \nsee on the floor my good friend, the Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham]. \nHe will address this momentarily because he was a real fighter, not \nonly in ISTEA I but throughout the drafting of this bill. It had been \nour hope to reach 95 cents, but we soon recognized that we could not do \nit if we were to build a successful coalition and to properly recognize \nthe individual requirements of certain geographic regions of the United \nStates, primarily the Western States.\n  They require certain augmentation of their financial status under \nthis legislation because they recognize from experience, not only on \nthis bill but on other bills, that when western interests go into a \nconference between the House and the Senate, they have far fewer \nMembers of the House of Representatives from those States.\n  It goes back to the very fundamental principle, Mr. President, the \nvery fundamental principle that when our forefathers laid down this \nGovernment and fashioned this Republic, the oldest surviving democratic \nform of republic on Earth today, the United States with its \nConstitution and Bill of Rights, when they fashioned that, they \nrecognized letting the States have equal representation in the Senate \nbecause in the House of Representatives that representation is \nrecognized by virtue of the population.\n  So we strengthened the financial position of the Western States, \nrecognizing historically that strength has been diminished from the \nSenate position as a consequence of fewer Members in the House.\n  We are going to hold and protect our Western States in this bill. \nThat is why we had to drop from 95 cents to the 90 cents.\n  Many, many of the donor States are now recognizing that 90 cents is \nan enormous increment from where they were. In my State, we got 79 \ncents on the dollar. There is relative joy in my State as we move to \n90, and indeed, six donor States got a small fraction or so above 90 as \na consequence of a small application of the formula, not through \nselectivity.\n  This bill will use the most currently available data to achieve a \nfair distribution fund. That will include factors that represent the \ndivergent transportation needs of our Nation. There will be no \nsurprises. We will use lane miles which represent the extent of our \nhighway network, vehicle miles traveled or VMT's, which measure the \nvolume of traffic on the system, bridge measurement based on the number \nof structurally deficient and capacity limited bridges, and diesel fuel \nconsumption that represents the freight traffic.\n  I look forward to continuing the Senate's work on this vital \nlegislation and am proud today to have brought to the Senate a \nbalanced, fair, and solid proposal. This highway transportation \nproposal, in terms of spending is second in size only to the defense \nbill, and its significance to the American economy is similar. The \nbottom line is this bill is a regionally balanced, multidimensional \nplan that will establish transportation policy for the 21st century. It \ncarves a big role for public input, respects the environment, and in a \nbroader sense empowers States and local governments.\n  We have at long last abandoned the archaic measurements of postal \nroute mileage and other outdated measurements used in ISTEA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1173\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the \nIntermodal Transportation Act of 1997, a comprehensive, 6-year measure \nto reauthorize the Nation's Federal aid-highway, highway safety, and \nother surface transportation programs. I am particularly pleased to be \ndoing so with 10 of my colleagues from the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, Senator Warner and Senator Baucus, Senators Bond, Thomas, \nKempthorne, Reid, Graham, Smith, Allard, Inhofe; as well as Senators \nDorgan, Harkin, and Grassley. As you can tell from the list of names I \njust read, this bill truly represents a consensus effort, with \ncosponsors from all regions of the country and from both sides of the \naisle.\n  This legislation is the product of well over a year of hard work and \ncareful negotiation. Some say that it has taken a long time to get to \nthis point, but we had three very different proposals--all \ncommendable--to coalesce into one unified plan that we can rally \naround. We also could not put together a serious proposal before we \nknew the amount of money we had for transportation under the budget \nagreement.\n  The result of these efforts, the Intermodal Transportation Act of \n1997\n\n[[Page S9295]]\n\n[ITA], provides $145 billion over the next 6 years to keep our Nation's \ntransportation system up and running. This bill preserves and builds \nupon the laudable goals of ISTEA--intermodalism and efficiency. More \nimportant, it does so in a manner that: First, stays within a balanced \nbudget; second, enhances highway and driver safety; and finally, \nprotects the environment.\n  First, I want to stress that the Intermodal Transportation Act is \nfiscally responsible and fiscally innovative. In my view, the most \nimportant aspect of this bill is that it works within the context of a \nbalanced budget. This is essential. On America's highways, you get to \nwhere you are going by staying within the lines and playing by the \nrules. That should be our guide when it comes to the budget as well.\n  To maximize limited Federal funds, strategic investment in \ntransportation is critical. Forty years ago, it made sense for the \nNation to build an interstate highway system. Today, however, we must \nbe more creative. Simply building more roads and highways is no longer \na workable solution. We must carefully plan and allocate our limited \nresources.\n  The bill before us includes a number of innovative ways to finance \nour formidable transportation needs. It establishes a federal credit \nassistance program for surface transportation. The provision is \nidentical to S. 986, the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and \nInnovation Act, which I introduced in the Senate earlier this year. \nThis new program leverages limited Federal funds by allowing up to a \n$10 billion Federal line-of-credit for transportation projects, at a \ncost to the Federal budget of just over $500 million. The bill also \nprovides tools, such as the State Infrastructure Bank Program, to \nenable States to make the most of their transportation dollars.\n  Second, this legislation substantially increases the Federal \ncommitment to safety. I am very concerned about the safety of our \nNation's highways, and I am particularly alarmed by the escalating \nincidence of highway motor vehicle injuries and fatalities. In the \nUnited States alone, there are more than 40,000 fatalities and 3.5 \nmillion automobile crashes every year. Between 1992 and 1995, the \naverage highway fatality rate increased by more than 2,000 lives, while \nthe annual injury rate increased by over 380,000. We must work \nvigorously to reverse this trend, and this bill will help us do so. The \nfunds set-aside for safety programs such as hazard elimination and \nrailway-highway crossings under this bill totals $690 million dollars \nper year, almost a 55-percent increase over the current level.\n  Often, it is a safety belt that can make the difference between \nsaving a life and becoming another tragic statistic. The bill \nestablishes a new State safety belt incentive program, rewarding those \nStates that increase their seat belt use rate or take other measures to \npromote seat belt use. It provides an average of $83 million per year \nfrom the highway trust fund to pay for the new incentives program.\n  The ITA establishes a new program that, through economic sanctions, \nencourages States to enact laws and minimum penalties for repeat drunk \ndriving offenders. The bill also establishes a new border \ninfrastructure and safety program to address safety concerns that have \nresulted from NAFTA, such as deteriorating roads and bridges in our \nborder States. I can assure you that safety is an uncompromising \npriority of the legislation before us.\n  Third, the Intermodal Transportation Act upholds ISTEA's strong \ncommitment to preserving and protecting our environment. As valuable as \ntransportation is to our society through the movement of goods and \npeople, it takes a heavy toll on the Nation's air, land, and water. The \ncosts of air pollution that can be attributed to cars and trucks range \nfrom $30 to $200 billion per year. Passenger cars alone account for \nalmost 30 percent of the Nation's total oil consumption.\n  ISTEA provided States and localities with tools to cope with the \ngrowing demands on our transportation system and the corresponding \nstrain on our environment. I am proud that the bill before us increases \nfunding for ISTEA's key programs to offset transportation's impact on \nthe environment.\n  The bill before us provides an average of $1.18 billion per year over \nthe next 6 years for the CMAQ, or Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality \nImprovement, Program. That's an 18-percent increase over the current \nfunding levels for transit improvements, shared ride services, and \nbicycle and pedestrian facilities, to help fight air pollution.\n  Highway construction can be a destructive impact on a community and \nits surrounding environment. To redress some of the damage highways \nhave done in the past, the bill increases funding for enhancement \nactivities to $552 million per year, a 24-percent increase over the \ncurrent law. Enhancement money can be used for a variety of projects, \nsuch as billboard removal, historic preservation, and the Rails-to-\nTrails Program.\n  We must recognize that caring for our precious natural heritage and \nexpanding transportation infrastructure can go hand in hand. The bill \nestablishes a new wetlands restoration pilot program. The purpose of \nthe program is to fund projects to offset the loss or degradation of \nwetlands resulting from Federal-aid transportation projects. It also \nestablishes a new pilot program to integrate transportation, \ndevelopment and the environment, and to preserve communities.\n  When it was enacted in 1991, ISTEA expanded the focus of national \npolicy, transforming what was once simply a highway program into a \nsurface transportation program, dedicated to the mobility of passengers \nand goods. And it recognized, for the first time, that the individual \ntransportation modes function best as a cohesive and interrelated \nsystem.\n  Admittedly, the transition from old policies and practices to those \nembodied in ISTEA has not always been easy. The two complaints we have \nheard time and again from the States are that ISTEA's program structure \nis too complicated and its formulas are not fair. The bill before us \nwill carry forward ISTEA's strengths but it also will correct ISTEA's \nweaknesses, and provide a responsive transportation program to take us \ninto the next century.\n  The Intermodal Transportation Act addresses the concerns of the \nStates by making the program easier to understand and by providing real \nflexibility to States and localities. It reduces the number of ISTEA \nprogram categories from 5 to 3, and it includes more than 20 \nimprovements to reduce the redtape involved in carrying out \ntransportation projects. The bill also expands the eligibility of NHS \nand surface transportation funds to passenger rail, such as AMTRAK, and \nintelligent transportation systems.\n  Moreover, the Intermodal Transportation Act significantly reforms the \nISTEA funding formulas to balance the diverse needs of the various \nregions of the Nation. It guarantees 90 cents back for every dollar a \nState contributes to the highway trust fund. Fortynine of the fifty \nStates share in the growth of the overall program. The bill also \nrecognizes the diversity and uniqueness of the country and all of its \ntransportation needs.\n  By making the surface transportation program more responsive to all \nregions of the country, this bill will ensure that the laudable goals \nof the original ISTEA--intermodalism and efficiency--are upheld. \nFinding the right solutions to address all of our needs requires \nstrategic and comprehensive approaches to transportation policy.\n  Before I conclude, I want to give a special thanks to Senators Warner \nand Baucus for their hard work and determination in developing this \nlegislation. It has not been easy, and we still have a long way to go. \nBut I look forward to working with the other members of the Environment \nand Public Works Committee and all Members of the Senate, as well as \nthe House leadership, to enact a bill this year that will take the \nNation's transportation system into the 21st century.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, let me start by thanking the chairman of \nthe committee and the chairman of the subcommittee for their fine work \non this bill. Their efforts have produced a bill that will build upon \nand improve the current transportation bill, ISTEA.\n  The bill we will introduce shortly is a good bill. It is a balanced \nbill. It is a national bill. And while it may not be everyone's idea of \nthe perfect bill, it is a solid start for the Senate debate.\n\n[[Page S9296]]\n\n  When we began developing the legislation, I had three principal \ngoals. I am pleased that this bill meets all three:\n  First, the bill is fair to all regions of the country. It recognizes \nthe diverse transportation needs of all regions of this country--\nWestern States, Southern States and Northeastern States. And it \nincludes programs and funding to meet those needs.\n  Second, the bill streamlines today's complex transportation programs \nwhile still retaining the integrity of ISTEA.\n  We have consolidated funding categories--yet maintained funding \nrequirements for all portions of the transportation system, including \ninterstate highways and our bridges.\n  Third, the bill gives State and local officials back home greater \nflexibility to deliver transportation services efficiently.\n  I also am pleased that the bill retains an emphasis on the National \nHighway System, which includes the Interstate System. These are the \nmost important roads and bridges in the country and they deserve the \npriority this bill gives them.\n  Finally, we have retained important programs on air quality and \nenhancements.\n  The chairman rightly points out that the bill does not bust the \nbudget. Under the bill, spending for transportation will increase \nsubstantially over the next 6 years. Yet it is consistent with the \nbudget resolution.\n  But as I have said before, I believe those levels are too low. They \nsimply cannot meet today's very real transportation needs. So as we \nmove forward in the Senate, I hope we can identify ways to attain a \nmore appropriate level of funding.\n  In conclusion, this bill will keep our economy growing, while it \nimproves the safety of our roads and bridges, and protects our \nenvironment.\n  I look forward to moving this bill through the Senate and I again \nthank my colleagues for their hard work on this measure.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to join my \ngood friend and colleagues, Senator Baucus and Senator Warner, in \ndiscussing the legislation that was introduced or will be introduced \ntoday, and was presented yesterday, the Intermodal Transportation Act.\n  Mr. President, I will discuss some of the substantive provisions of \nthis which have caused me to give it enthusiastic support, but I would \nlike to comment in a preliminary manner about the way in which this \nlegislation was developed.\n  In a sense, this legislation has been in the course of development \nsince we adopted the current Highway Transportation Act in 1991. It has \nbeen a course of development both by those who had high expectations \nand those such as myself who had apprehensions about the 1991 enactment \nand have been monitoring it closely to see what lessons we might learn \nfrom that experience to apply to now the next 6-year reauthorization of \nthis important national legislation.\n  This close scrutiny has particularly drawn the attention of those who \nhave responsibility for the management of our highway systems at the \nState and local level, and it is appropriate that it should have that \nclose scrutiny. Most of the responsibility for the construction, the \nmanagement, the operation of our highway and bridge system is at the \nState and local level. Those officials represent a unique source of \ninsight and wisdom as to what our national policy should be, and those \nresources of wisdom and insight have been applied in the development of \nthe legislation that today is being introduced.\n  I will also comment about the bipartisan spirit in which this has \nbeen developed. Senator Warner spoke about the many months in which we \nworked together in attempting to develop some principles that would be \nsound for America and would represent a fair and balanced program for \neach of the States of America. The fact that we are at the point of \nintroducing this legislation, with almost every region of the country, \nalmost every difference in the country from States that are mature, \nStates that are rapidly growing, States that have peculiar climactic \nconsiderations that impact their highway system, large States, small \nStates, States from every corner of the geography of America, Members \nof the U.S. Senate representing those States have now come together \nbehind this legislation. That is in the best spirit of a democracy, \nseeking consensus behind a plan which will then have the confidence and \nsupport of the American people.\n  I want to particularly commend Senator Warner, Senator Baucus, and \nSenator Chafee for their leadership on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee for taking all the principle, ideas, and suggestions and now \nputting them in the form of this legislation with strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Let me talk briefly, Mr. President, about some of the reasons I am \nsupporting this legislation. First, I am doing it as a strong supporter \nof a balanced budget. It would be easy to have a highway bill which \nwould satisfy everyone's needs if there was an unlimited amount of \nmoney to be spent in that area of national responsibility. The fact is, \nthere is not an unlimited amount of money to be spent in that area or \nin any other of our national responsibilities. We have committed \nourselves to a policy of fiscal prudence, and to balance the Nation's \nbudget by the year 2002. It would be the height of irresponsibility, \nwithin less than 2 months of having congratulated ourselves on having \npassed a balanced budget agreement, to then bust that agreement by \npresenting a highway bill which was substantially beyond the limits \nthat had been prescribed in the balanced budget as our Nation's \nallocation for highway and bridge construction. I am pleased that this \nlegislation complies with the balanced budget agreement.\n  Second, I am pleased that this legislation will bring fundamental \nfairness and integrity to the allocation of our national resources for \nsurface transportation among the 50 States and among the communities of \nAmerica.\n  We have had a system in the past which has utilized a number of \nfactors that were increasingly irrelevant and frequently outdated in \nterms of their ability to determine relative need among the States in \nterms of highway and bridge construction. As an example, the current \nlegislation that we are using in 1997 has the factor of census--where \nare the American people--and one of the considerations as to where the \nAmerican people's transportation dollars should be allocated among the \n50 States in order to best meet national needs.\n  The difficulty is that the census that is used in that formula is the \n1980 census, 17 years out of date. For a rapidly growing State like \nmine, that is a punishing provision. For some States, where the \npopulation has been stable or even declining over that 17-year period, \nit creates an unwarranted bonus.\n  One of the principles of this bill in terms of fairness is that a key \ncentral indicator of highway need is the amount of highway transactions \ncollected within that State for Federal purposes. All motorists across \nthis land pay the same number of pennies per gallon of motor fuel \npurchased for Federal highway purposes. Therefore, there is a \nrelationship between how much individual States collect for that \nFederal highway motor fuel tax and what the relative demand on the \nsystem is. People buy gasoline and other motor fuels because they will \ndrive their vehicles. They tend to drive the vehicles relatively close \nto the point of purchase of that motor fuel. So, assessing how much tax \nis collected is a very strong indicator of where the need for the \ntransportation services resides.\n  So this bill essentially says that 90 cents of every dollar will be \nreturned to the State at the point of collection. If a particular State \ncollects $100 million a year of Federal motor fuel tax, it can be \nassured it will get back at least $90 million to meet the needs that \nwere generated by those persons who purchased their motor fuel and paid \nthat Federal tax. This is a very significant departure from our \nprevious surface transportation acts.\n  To put this in the context of my State of Florida, a large, fast-\ngrowing State, since 1991 we have averaged receiving not 90 cents, but \nless than 78 cents per year of our Federal motor fuels tax. That has \nresulted in an average per year return to our State of $768 million. \nWhen this legislation goes into effect for the next 6 years at a \nsomewhat higher annual level of return, because as the country grows \nand as the economy expands more motor fuel is purchased, therefore, \nmore taxes are\n\n[[Page S9297]]\n\npaid, but primarily because we will be moving from 78 cents to 90 cents \nof every dollar returned, our State is projected for the next 6 years \nto receive an average of $1 billion a year in Federal highway funds. \nThat will allow my fast-growing State and its 15 million residents to \nbe able to much better meet the needs of maintaining the system that is \nin existence and expanding the system in order to meet the demands of a \ngrowing population and an expanding economy.\n  Third, Mr. President, this legislation balances national needs and \nState and local needs. Some would argue, and I think with considerable \npersuasion, that what we ought to do is to have the National Government \nsubstantially back away from a Federal highway program, repeal \nsubstantial amounts of the Federal motor fuel tax and let the States \nmake a determination as to whether they want to pick up that tax and \nlevy it now as a State tax and use those funds directly for State \npurposes.\n  Frankly, moving toward the 90 cents on the dollar program to assure \nfundamental fairness is a major step toward that type of a turnback \nphilosophy. But this legislation continues to recognize that there is \nan important national role in transportation. If I want to drive my car \nfrom Miami Lakes, FL, to the home State of our Presiding Officer, I \nhave to drive through many States. It is, therefore, important to me \nthat each one of those States has a safe and efficient highway system \nto allow me to achieve my destination of mobility from one part of \nAmerica to another. That is a national need for which we all have an \ninterest and a responsibility. I believe that this legislation balances \nthose two desires to place as much responsibility and freedom of action \nand determination of priorities at the State and local level out of a \nbelief that it is there that there is the best ability to assess what \nthe real needs are, while still maintaining a sufficient national role \nto assure that we have national mobility across this great continent. I \nbelieve that the legislation that we introduce today strikes that \nappropriate balance.\n\n  A fourth aspect of this legislation is simplification and \nstreamlining. As Senator Warner discussed, this legislation will reduce \nthe number of categories in which the Federal Government provides \nhighway and bridge funds to the States and local communities. It will \nmake it easier for the public, easier for people in our communities and \nStates, easier for us here in the Congress to understand the system, \nbecause it will be more simplified. We will get greater efficiency out \nof the funds derived. There should be lessened administrative costs \nbecause there will be fewer programs to maintain and monitor. \nIncreasing the ability of people in our communities and in our States \nto make their transportation decisions should be and is a key priority \nof this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I close by discussing a final point, which is a point \nat which I suggest that we need to be totally candid with the American \npeople. I voted against ISTEA in 1991 and stated that one of my reasons \nfor voting against it was the fact that in all probability, at the end \nof the 6-year period of that legislation, our roads and bridges would \nbe in worse shape than they were in 1991. I am sad to report that the \nU.S. Department of Transportation has issued reports which indicate \nthat my prophecy was correct, that we had lower levels of maintenance \non our highways, we have more bridges in need of serious repair, we \nhave not maintained sufficient capacity in order to meet the needs of a \ngrowing economy and a growing American population.\n  I regret to say that I am afraid the same prophecy can be made about \nthe legislation that we are about to pass, and that is a serious \ncommentary. It speaks to the level of our commitment to transportation \nas an important national priority. Transportation is not being singled \nout. We are doing an inadequate job in almost every area of our \nNation's infrastructure. One of those areas in which I am particularly \nconcerned is educational infrastructure. All over the country we see \nolder schools crumbling because of lack of adequate maintenance and \nrepair and rehabilitation. All over the country, we see children going \nto classrooms that don't have the kind of access to modern technology \nthat an education at the end of the 20th century requires. We see \nstudents in portables and inappropriate educational facilities because \nthere have not been the resources to keep pace with building the new \nclassrooms that the expanding student populations require. So what we \nare encountering in our transportation system is replicated in our \neducation system, also in water and sewer and other basic community \nhealth services. I hope that, as part of this debate on transportation \nin 1997, we will use this as a means of stimulating a national \nawareness to the fact that we have a much greater job to do in terms of \nbuilding the basic systems upon which our people, our society, our free \nenterprise economic system depend.\n  Having said that, there is a glimmer of hope in this legislation \nrelative to the total adequacy of funds for transportation. While \nrecognizing that the traditional means of funding transportation--so \nmuch money from the National Government through a Federal program, \nsupplemented by additional funds from State or local sources--while \nthose traditional sources are not likely to be adequate in order to \nmaintain our current system and meet the needs for expansion, this \nlegislation does call for some new opportunities for creativity and \ninnovation and encouraging nontraditional funding to come into \ntransportation--particularly, funding from the private sector.\n  We started several years ago with a plan that encouraged States to \nset up State banks to engage in various forms of innovative financing--\npublic-private partnerships, encouragement to early acquisition of \nhighway corridors in order to lower the cost of right-of-way \nacquisition--a whole series of innovative ideas at the State level, \nwith Federal support, in order to stretch our available dollars further \nso that we have a better chance of meeting the total demands that would \nbe made upon transportation as one important part of our infrastructure \nobligations.\n  This legislation builds on those past provisions. It expands the \nStates' ability to set up those State-based infrastructure banks. It \nalso will create a new Federal innovative financing program to work \nwith the States where they have projects that will benefit by these \nkinds of new means of financing transportation and involving the \nprivate sector. I think that is going to be an absolute key if we are \ngoing to meet our obligation to future generations in terms of \nmaintaining a transportation system that will give us the economic \ncapabilities to sustain our global position as well as provide the \nmobility that the American people require for their own day-to-day life \nexperiences.\n  So, Mr. President, I am enthusiastic about the legislation that we \nare introducing today. I believe it represents a significant step \nforward in terms of accepting our national responsibility and doing it \nin a fair and balanced manner. I applaud those who have joined in this \neffort and look forward to this Senate passing this legislation at the \nearliest possible date so that before we recess for 1997, we can say as \none of our accomplishments for this year that we have passed a \nsignificant national transportation policy and have that policy in \nplace for the next 6 years, and we can get on with the business of \nbenefiting by that new policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/12/senate-section/article/S9252-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9297-S9298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 22\n\n  At the request of Mr. Moynihan, the names of the Senator from West \nVirginia [Mr. Rockefeller], the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. \nLautenberg], and the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] were added as \ncosponsors of S. 22, a bill to establish a bipartisan national \ncommission to address the year 2000 computer problem.\n\n\n                                 S. 389\n\n  At the request of Mr. Abraham, the name of the Senator from Montana \n[Mr. Burns] was added as a cosponsor of S. 389, a bill to improve \ncongressional deliberation on proposed Federal private sector mandates, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 781\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Wyoming \n[Mr. Thomas] was added as a cosponsor of S. 781, a bill to establish a \nuniform and more efficient Federal process for protecting property \nowners' rights guaranteed by the fifth amendment.\n\n[[Page S9298]]\n\n                                 S. 852\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the names of the Senator from West \nVirginia [Mr. Rockefeller] and the Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts] \nwere added as cosponsors of S. 852, a bill to establish nationally \nuniform requirements regarding the titling and registration of salvage, \nnonrepairable, and rebuilt vehicles.\n\n\n                                S. 1113\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the name of the Senator from Hawaii \n[Mr. Inouye] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1113, a bill to extend \ncertain temporary judgeships in the Federal judiciary.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 51\n\n  At the request of Mr. Helms, the name of the Senator from California \n[Mrs. Feinstein] was added as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 51, a concurrent resolution expressing the sense of Congress \nregarding elections for the legislature of the Hong Kong Special \nAdministrative Region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/12/senate-section/article/S9297-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       DeWINE AMENDMENT NO. 1134\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DeWINE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (H.R. 2107) making appropriations for the Department of the \nInterior and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n1998, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, I supported the amendment offered \nthis week by my colleagues, Senators Durbin and Collins, to eliminate \nthe tax credit for tobacco companies contained in the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997.\n  I am amazed at the inventiveness of the process that resulted in this \nlittle known provision becoming law. The tax credit was not included in \neither the balanced budget or taxpayer relief bills that were first \nconsidered in the House and Senate. It was not included in the final, \nconference version of the 1,056-page Balanced Budget Act that the \nSenate approved on July 31. Instead, it was added to the Balanced \nBudget Act by means of an amendment quietly slipped into the final, \nconference version of the 809-page Taxpayer Relief Act, that the Senate \npassed just hours later on the same day.\n  This $50 billion giveaway was never discussed or reviewed in an open, \npublic forum, but was added at the eleventh hour, in a conference \nmeeting behind closed doors. This is not the way the Congress should \nconduct the people's business.\n  Not only did this unnecessary and undeserved multi-billion-dollar tax \ncredit bypass the normal and appropriate procedures of both Houses of \nCongress, it also ignored the good intentions of both the Senate and \nHouse to provide health care to our Nation's children. This tax break \nwould give the tobacco industry a share of the $50 billion raised from \nincreased tobacco excise taxes, instead of protecting those funds to \nfund new children's health care initiatives. This tax break would \nbenefit the tobacco industry by shortchanging an important and widely \nsupported public health initiative.\n  The overwhelming vote to repeal this unwarranted tax credit \ndemonstrates clearly that the majority in the Senate did not intend to \ngive a $50 billion tax break to tobacco companies, instead of providing \nfunds to meet the health care needs of approximately 10 million \nuninsured children in our country. Congress intended to, and did, \ngradually raise the tax on tobacco products by 15 cents, to provide \nmuch-needed funds for health insurance for uninsured children.\n  I am very concerned that the tobacco tax credit provision that was \ninserted into the Balanced Budget Act was an attempt by some to begin \ndrafting tobacco liability settlement legislation before Congress has \nhad an opportunity to carefully review the proposed settlement. The \nprovision the Senate voted to repeal would have credited a portion of \nthe increased tobacco excise taxes toward liability payments the \ntobacco companies could be required to make under legislation \nimplementing the settlement. Clearly, this is inappropriate since \nCongress is still conducting a thorough examination of the settlement \nand has not reached a consensus on this matter.\n  While Congress continues to examine the multibillion-dollar \nlitigation settlement between the tobacco industry and several States, \nwe need to remain mindful that the most important aspect of these \ndiscussion is public health, particularly the welfare of our children. \nBy approving the Dubin-Collins amendment and repealing the tax break to \ntobacco companies, Congress sent a clear message to the American public \nthat their health and well-being is the priority in the complex tobacco \nsettlement discussions. Supporting the Durbin amendment returns $50 \nbillion to the general Treasury while protecting the $24 billion \nnecessary for funding the children's health care initiative.\n\n  We need to carefully examine utilizing the funds returned to the \ntreasury as financial support for various public health initiatives. \nParticularly, we need to discuss using these funds for developing \ninitiatives which would provide our children with the appropriate \nguidance and information regarding the potential health dangers \nassociated with tobacco products. It is imperative that we create \neducational campaigns which utilize a variety of tools including \nadvertisement, special events, and public service campaigns. By \ndisseminating the appropriate information to the public, specifically \nchildren, we could significantly raise awareness on the perils \nassociated with smoking.\n  History demonstrates that anti-smoking campaigns, particularly on \ntelevision and the radio can serve as strong disincentives for smoking. \nDuring the late 1960's, the Federal Communications Commission mandated \ntelevised antismoking messages to counter the tobacco advertising which \nwas filling the television airwaves. Anti-smoking advertisements and \npublic service announcements caused a decline in the number of smokers \nin the country. However, in 1971, the FCC implemented a ban on radio \nand television advertisement. Since implementation of that ban, \nantismoking campaigns have also declined.\n  As chairman of the Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over \nmany aspects of the tobacco settlement, I have already held one hearing \non the settlement and fully intend on holding more hearings in the near \nfuture. Specifically, I intend to hold a hearing regarding the impact \nof television and radio messages in the antismoking campaign. I believe \nit is important to hold a hearing which examines the role of various \nmedia in the campaign to raise public awareness regarding the dangers \nassociated with tobacco products, especially for the Nation's children.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we continue to give all aspects \nof the proposed tobacco settlement careful and coordinated \nconsideration. At the same time, we need to remain mindful that a very \nimportant goal of any settlement ought to be the protection of the \nhealth and welfare of our children and the general public.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/12/senate-section/article/S9300-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9300-S9301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   RECOGNITION OF SEAN P. ALLERTON, BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA, TROOP 189\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize Sean P. Allerton, a member of the Boy Scouts \nof America's Troop 189 in New Orleans, LA. In 1992, the 102d Congress \namended the Constitution of the United States of America by ratifying \nthe 27th amendment. In doing so, thousands of Government textbooks and \neducational tools throughout the country became outdated. American \ngovernment students around the world were retrieving information in \nlibraries, in classrooms and in textbooks that reported the \nConstitution as only having 26 amendments.\n  Sean Allerton recognized this lack of current information, and as his \nEagle Scout project, decided to rectify the problem. He called upon \nnumerous organizations and individuals in the New Orleans area to \nsponsor his goal of getting 6,600 copies of the new Constitution \ndistributed to every American government and civics student in New \nOrleans. On August 21 of this year, he received a letter and a check \nfrom State District Court Judge Lloyd J. Medley, Jr., who believed in \nthe importance of Sean's project and donated the financial backing to \ncarry it forth.\n  On September 17, mayor of New Orleans Marc Morial will hold a press \nconference to congratulate and thank\n\n[[Page S9301]]\n\nSean on his endeavor, and to distribute the new copies of the \nConstitution to the students of New Orleans. I, too, would like to send \nwords of support and thanks from the 105th Congress to Sean P. \nAllerton, for reminding us of the value of service and the patriotism \nthat strengthens this country's heart. Thank you, Sean.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/12/senate-section/article/S9300-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CONTINUING THE FOOD ANIMAL RESIDUE AVOIDANCE DATABANK PROGRAM\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of S. \n1153, introduced by my colleague Senator Baucus, which will continue \nthe Food Animal Residue Avoidance Databank [FARAD] Program.\n  Although the recent E. coli scares are unfortunate, they present a \ngood opportunity for the Senate to act on the issue of food safety. \nPublic interest in the safety of our food supply is high, and the call \nfor consumer awareness has never been greater. The FARAD Program stores \nand disseminates information on drug, pesticide, and environmental \ncontaminant residue. This information allows veterinarians and \nproducers to avoid problems with contaminated meat and helps ensure the \nintegrity of our Nation's food supply. Producers and veterinarians can \naccess FARAD information over the telephone, through e-mail, or even \nthrough two sites on the Internet, putting valuable data at everyone's \nfingertips. Information is also available in print material, such as \nFARAD's compendium on available drugs and the FARAD Digest column in \nthe Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. \nUnfortunately, a lack of funding has prevented FARAD's directors and \nemployees from updating the databank. FARAD must contain complete and \ncurrent data in order to continue protecting American consumers. And \nthat's the bottom line. The public must be confident that the food on \ntheir plate is safe. I hope that my colleagues will support consumer \nawareness and support the FARAD Program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/12/senate-section/article/S9301-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "12", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BRAILLE LITERACY\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, Helen Keller, the moving spirit \nfor the American Foundation for the Blind and many in the visually \nhandicapped community, once said, ``. . . when I hold a beloved \n[braille] book in my hand my limitations fall from me, my spirit is \nfree.''\n  During the recent reauthorization of the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act it was my pleasure to work with the American \nFoundation for the Blind, the National Federation of the Blind, the \nAmerican Council of the Blind, and other groups to include a provision \nfor the teaching of braille for all blind or visually impaired students \nfor whom it is appropriate as part of the IEP process. Because of this \nchange which is now in law, every blind or visually impaired child will \nsoon have the chance to experience the same freedom enjoyed by Helen \nKeller.\n  Most children who are blind or visually impaired benefit from \nspecialized instruction in braille to enable them to participate \nequally with their sighted peers in school and ultimately to compete in \nthe workplace. Additionally, for those who cannot use print, braille \nprovides an excellent means for reading confidential information, \nmaking notes at meetings and giving presentations, recordkeeping, \nlabeling information files, performing household management functions, \nand ease of studying and reviewing critical information.\n  Over 57,000 students, as of 1996, were registered with the American \nPrinting House for the Blind and over 500 students from New Mexico are \nregistered. Mr. President, I am pleased to report that in my State, \n2,500 braille books were circulated by the New Mexico State Library for \nthe Blind and Physically Handicapped, the Regional Library for the \nBlind in Santa Fe, in fiscal year 1996.\n  The mission of the American Foundation for the Blind is to enable \npersons who are blind or visually impaired to achieve equality of \naccess and opportunity that will ensure freedom of choice in their \nlives. I am delighted that the braille provisions of the recently \nreauthorized Individuals With Disabilities Education Act will help all \nchildren who are blind or visually impaired to achieve this \ngoal.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.
