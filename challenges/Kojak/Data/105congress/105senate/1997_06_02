Mr. President, the Senate will be in session today for a \nperiod of morning business to give Senators an opportunity to speak.\n  At 2:30 the Senate will resume consideration of S. 4, the Family \nFriendly Workplace Act. I encourage any Senator who intends to offer an \namendment to this legislation to be prepared to offer the amendment \nduring today's session. Any votes ordered on amendments offered today \nwill be set aside with the possibility of votes occurring on those \namendments after 5 p.m. today.\n  In addition, a cloture motion on S. 4 will be filed today. Therefore, \nthe Senate can expect a vote on cloture on S. 4 to occur on Wednesday \nmorning.\n  As a reminder to all Senators, tomorrow from 9:30 until 12:30 a.m. \nthe Senate will honor the services of our President pro tempore, \nSenator Thurmond, the longest serving Member of the Senate. I encourage \nall Senators to participate in this important tribute on Tuesday \nmorning.\n  For the remainder of the week Senators can anticipate Senate action \non the concurrent budget resolution, the supplemental appropriations \nconference report, and possibly the adoption of legislation.\n  As Members are aware, this is the first week of a 4-week legislative \nperiod prior to the Fourth of July recess. The Senate has a number of \nimportant issues which need to be considered prior to that next recess. \nWe anticipate action on the budget reconciliation bills, both on the \nspending side and the tax cut bill.\n  The DOD authorization should be ready, and the chairman of the \ncommittee has asked that we try to reserve\n\n[[Page S5158]]\n\ntime in the latter part of June to do that, if at all possible.\n  Product liability legislation is pending, as well as various \nappropriations bills, including the legislative branch, foreign ops, \nand Treasury-Postal Service as they become available.\n  So we are looking at those three appropriations bills that we would \nlike to be able to finish in the Senate before we go out for the Fourth \nof July recess.\n  As all Members know, this is not an exclusive list that the Senate \nmay consider. There are other issues that are pending legislatively and \nexecutive matters as they are cleared. For instance, I understand the \nnational missile defense legislation has cleared the Armed Services \nCommittee. That is an issue that we may be able to take up before the \nFourth of July period.\n  Therefore, I encourage all Members to adjust their schedules for a \nbusy month of Senate work. That could very well include some votes on \nMonday afternoons late and evenings on Friday. But later on this week, \nprobably tomorrow, we will try to give Senators some clear idea of what \nMondays and Fridays they should expect to be in session. At a minimum, \nthe Friday that we are scheduled to go out for the Fourth of July \nrecess--that would be Friday, June 27--is clearly one that we will \nlikely have to be in session to complete our work on reconciliation \nbills.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/02/senate-section/article/S5157-6", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MEASURE READ FOR THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 867\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, it is privilege to take this opportunity \nto commend Superintendent Bill Shields for his 32 years of \ndistinguished leadership in the National Park Service. His service has \nbeen renowned in many different aspects of the park system, and every \nregion of the country is in his debt.\n  One of the biggest challenges Bill has faced has been managing \nnational parks in urban settings. In fact, Bill spent the majority of \nhis career in urban park environments, and he has met special needs of \nthese parks with great skill, wisdom, and understanding. As \nsuperintendent of Rock Creek Park, he had jurisdiction over 95 separate \nlocal parks which are prized by communities throughout the Washington \narea. He has skillfully balanced the needs of the parks with the needs \nof the general public and park neighborhoods. With parks such as \nMeridian Hill and Montrose and Dumbarton Oaks, he has dealt with many \ncomplex issues with diplomacy and exceptional judgment.\n  Bill Shield's retirement after 32 years with the Park Service will be \na great loss. But because of his guidance and leadership, many parks in \nthe Nation, and especially in the Nation's Capital, will be enhanced \nand preserved for future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/02/senate-section/article/S5158-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXTENSION OF TIME FOR MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to \nstand and speak on behalf of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. It is a \nway of helping people resolve tensions that exist between the home \nplace and the workplace. Most American families encounter two basic \ntensions. One is the tension that is financial, that drives both adults \nin the family, if there are two adults in the family, into the \nworkplace; certainly if there is only one adult in the family, that one \nadult has tremendous pressure to be in the workplace. The other \npressure which exists for most American families is the social pressure \nthat comes when you have all of the adults in the family in the \nworkplace. You have tension between the workplace and the home place.\n  How in the world are we going to be able to meet the needs of the \nhome, when people are not at home when they are needed the most--\nparticularly when there are times when their presence is very, very \nimportant. For example, when someone is getting an award, or when \nsomeone needs to speak to the counselor or with a teacher at school, or \nwhen someone needs to go to the doctor. Most families understand that \nwhen you have this kind of a need you should have the opportunity to be \naway from work. If both adults in the family are involved in the \nworkplace it makes it very tough to do.\n  There are times when certain conditions will justify the use of what \nis known as family and medical leave. The Family and Medical Leave Act \nwas passed by the U.S. Congress and it allows people to take time off \nwithout pay. But I have found in my family, and I am sure most \nAmericans have found as well that when you take your child to the \ndoctor, that is not a time when you can go without pay. That is a time \nwhen you actually need all the resources you can get. To put people in \nthe position of having to take a pay cut in order to go see the teacher \nabout a problem at school or to watch the student get an award at \nschool or to be able to take a child to the doctor--to ask a parent to \ntake a pay cut in a setting like that is to make a parent make a choice \nthat we should not be asking a parent to make.\n  Fortunately, there already exists in this culture a clear model of a \nsystem that can work, that works effectively and works very well. It is \nin the Federal Government. Legally, all Federal employees have the \nability to have what is called flexible working arrangements. They can \ntake time off with pay later if they have earned that time off by \nworking more hours earlier. They can arrange their schedule to work a \ncouple hours extra one week and take a couple hours off the next week. \nAs a matter of fact, Federal workers have the ability to take advantage \nof the scheduling option which allows them to work 45 hours one week, \n35 hours the next week. That way they have every other Friday off. Of \ncourse, that is really a tremendous boon to people who need to be able \nto do things during the normal working hours, whether it is to go to \nthe motor vehicle registration place to get the\n\n[[Page S5159]]\n\ncar plates renewed or to take a child to a doctor or go see a child get \nan award or confer with a teacher at the high school--those kinds of \ndays that can be scheduled flexibly for Federal employees have worked \nwell to solve problems for Federal employees.\n  Unfortunately, what is standard operating procedure for people who \nwork for the Federal Government turns out to be outright illegal for \npeople in the private setting. Let me give an example. If you work for \na Federal agency and you want to go see your daughter get an award on \nMonday afternoon next week you can say to the boss this Friday, ``I \nwould like to work a couple extra hours and then I can take off early \nnext Monday.'' Now, your boss can let you work 2 hours this week and \nyou can take the 2 hours off next week, that is fine, you can see your \ndaughter get the award. For a private employer to do that is violating \nthe law. It is against the law for a private employer to be able to \ncooperate with his or her employee in such a setting.\n\n  Now that really shocks most of us to think it is against the law for \nan employer to help an employee in that respect, but it is the truth. \nSimilarly, if the private employer says if you would really like every \nother Friday off we will let you work 5 days at 9 hours a day, that \nwould be 45 hours one week, and then the next week you only have to \nwork 35 hours and you can do that by working 4 days, take the fifth day \noff the second week, that private employer, to pay a person the \nstandard wages for doing that, is in violation of the law. Now you \nmight add, ``Gee, this is astounding. That should not be against the \nlaw.'' It is against the law in the private sector. It is not against \nthe law for Federal Government employees.\n  What is interesting is when you talk to Federal Government employees, \nthey endorse this system overwhelmingly. The General Accounting Office, \nwhich is the Office which makes assessments about how well Government \nis functioning and what works and what does not work--too often they \nfind out what does not work--they made a study of this particular \nproposal and the way this works in the Federal Government. It was \namazing that at a 10-to-1 ratio, Federal Government employees said this \nis something that really helps, this is something we like. This is \nsomething we want. This works. Not only did the employees say it was \nsomething that helped, that they wanted, that worked, the employees \nalso were found by the General Accounting Office to be more productive, \ntheir morale was higher, and, obviously, those are the kinds of things \nwe would like to extend all across our economy.\n  Now, private, hourly paid workers in America are deprived of these \nbenefits. It is just that simple. It is against the law. People say, \nhow in the world did we get a law that would make it against the law \nfor an employee and an employer to cooperate in this way? Well, back in \nthe 1930's on the heel of the Great Depression, when only 2 out of \nevery 12 mothers of school-age children were in the work force, a law \nwas created that set up the Fair Labor Standards Act. This act gave \nsome important protections to American workers. However, it also made \nthese kinds of adjustments, this kind of workplace flexibility illegal. \nThe world is so different now than it was then, it is almost impossible \nto imagine. Instead of 2 out of 12 mothers of school-age children being \nin the workplace, it is 9 out of 12 mothers of school-age children \nbeing in the workplace. So we flipped the statistics totally but we are \nstill operating with the same approach--not totally operating that way. \nWe changed it for Government workers.\n  Of course, Government workers are not the only people that have \nflexible schedules. The people in the boardrooms have flexible \nschedules. The boss never seems to have trouble with his salary if he \ntakes time off to play golf, let alone to see a child at school. People \non salary, the managers and the supervisors--as a matter of fact, the \nmajority of American citizens--have flexible scheduling. It is \nestimated about 66 million people have flexible scheduling and only 59 \nmillion who are the hourly paid working people of America do not have \nthe ability for flexible schedule. It is no wonder that the Pugh \nFoundation said that 81 percent of the working mothers said, ``We need \nflexible working arrangements for the private sector.'' Obviously, that \nwould be a great help to them.\n  It would be a great help, they believed, because they think that is \nwhat would help them. When you look at Federal workers who have had \nthis plan--now, for well into the 1970's--the 1980's and the 1990's, \nthey say at a 10 to 1 ratio, ``This is the best thing since sliced \nbread. This is something that is very important to us.''\n\n  So, we are talking about a proposal which would extend to workers and \nworking families the capacity to harmonize these competing demands \nbetween the workplace on the one hand and the home place on the other \nhand. I might add that I believe we are going to continue to have lots \nof people working outside the home in America. As a matter of fact, I \ndo not know that America could be very competitive in the world economy \nif we did not. These two-parent families where both parents are working \noutside the home and the single-parent family where the only parent is \nworking outside of the home are part of the muscle and fiber of the \nAmerican economy. We cannot do without them. The truth of the matter is \nwe need to find ways to help them harmonize the competing demands. They \nneed more time and more flexibility.\n  What is interesting about the Federal system is that it allows you to \nearn your time off by earning a little bit at one time and taking it \noff at another time. These flexible working arrangements give workers \nthe ability to take time off without having to take a pay cut. Now the \nfamily and medical leave provisions are good, they are fine, they are \npart of the law right now, but if you take time off under the family \nand medical leave provisions you lose pay, and when you lose pay that \nway it is not only not good for you, it is not good for the country.\n  Let me just talk to you about what happens in the family and medical \nleave situations where they have taken time off. Now, the family and \nmedical leave Commission stated that the method that hourly employees \nused to recover lost wages when taking family and medical leave is that \n28.1 percent borrowed money. So, families had to go in debt to meet \ntheir needs. And 10.4 percent, 1 out of every 10 hourly workers who \ntook time off under family and medical leave had to go on welfare \nbecause of the money they lost. 41.9 percent, almost 42 percent, 4 out \nof every 10 people, deferred paying their bills. Now, most Americans do \nnot like not paying their bills. People would rather have the \nflexibility of keeping their payments on time and on schedule. It is \ncheaper when it comes to the interest you are paying, finance charges, \nand the like. Yet we put people in a situation where 41 percent put off \npaying their bills, over 10 percent went on welfare, and another nearly \n30 percent had to borrow money. I think it is far preferable to be in a \nsituation where we allow people to have the flexibility of taking time \noff with pay instead of taking time off without pay.\n  Now, there seems to be some developing consensus about the idea that \nthere should be some capacity for comptime. Comptime is one of the \nitems in this bill. It merely is the right to say to your employer, ``I \nwould rather be given some time off with pay later on than be paid for \novertime.'' We know that the law requires that you be paid for overtime \nat time and a half. This bill would allow a person to say, ``I would \nlike to take time and a half off with pay later on, instead of being \npaid time and a half for the overtime.'' People are shocked to learn it \nis against the law now to say I would like to have some time off later \non instead of being paid time and a half now--time off with pay later \non.\n  Interestingly enough, the comptime part of this bill only addresses a \npretty narrow group of American citizens because the number of people \nwho get regular overtime in our culture is pretty low. As a matter of \nfact, in the 1996 Current Population Survey, women who work on an \nhourly basis--and there are 28.9 million women who are paid on an \nhourly basis in this country--only 4.5 percent of them said they get \novertime work in a typical work period. Even if you multiply that by \nfive times, say you get up to 20 percent, you are dealing only with one \nout of every five women in the work force who would qualify for using \ncomptime as a way of assuaging some of these tensions.\n\n[[Page S5160]]\n\n  Since this system is a voluntary system for both employers and \nemployees, it is very easy to say that we will just move ourselves \nbeyond comptime--not to say it is not valuable, that it wouldn't be \nimportant, that it wouldn't be wonderful to have. But if we give \nourselves the capacity for flexible working arrangements, where \nespecially people could schedule over a 2-week period instead of a 1-\nweek period to average out the 40-hour week, indeed, people do have \nsome of these benefits who are not traditionally the recipients of \novertime.\n  Another thing that stuns me is the fact that most of the people who \nget overtime are men. Overtime typically focuses on industries that are \nmale dominated. There are about two men getting overtime for every \nwoman that is getting overtime. So even if you are talking about the \nfact that overall, on balance, you might be entitled to a third of all \nthe hourly workers who get some type of regular overtime, or enough of \nit to make a difference to help compensate meeting the demands of their \nfamily and the home place and the workplace, one-third really is really \nnot addressing the problem of what we ought to address. We need to \naddress this problem in a way which is comprehensive.\n  So having flexible working arrangements for the entire population, \nand not just focusing the opportunity to assuage attention on those \nindividuals who are regularly recipients of the opportunity for \novertime, is very important. That is why the flextime part of this bill \nis important. If we really want this bill to address the needs of \nwomen, of which only 4.5 percent get overtime in any typical workweek, \naccording to the 1996 Current Population Survey, we really ought to \nmake sure that we do more than just have comptime legislation, that we \nhave flextime legislation as well.\n  President Clinton and many Democrat Senators have voiced support for \nflextime, the central idea within the Family Friendly Workplace Act. \nPolls show that the vast majority of Americans favor flexible work \nschedules. They want legislation that would give them parity with \nFederal Government workers.\n  Incidentally, comptime is available to every State local government \nworker. The Federal law makes it available as well.\n  People would like to have legislation that would give them the \nopportunity to choose scheduling options that would help their \nfamilies.\n  Penn and Schoen, the President's own pollsters, have reported that 75 \npercent of America wants the choice of comptime.\n  Last month's Money magazine published a poll revealing that 64 \npercent of the public overall, and 68 percent of the women, would \noccasionally prefer time off in lieu of overtime if they have a choice.\n  Nothing in this bill would make someone forever choose that it had to \nbe one way or another. You could maintain the opportunity to have \novertime pay most of the time when you had overtime, but you could on \noccasion say, ``I would really prefer to take this time and a half off \nlater than to have the time and a half in pay.''\n  From the remarks we hear from the Democrats, I think they say they \nwant the same thing. I believe they do have an appreciation for the \nneed of workers in this setting.\n  If this is really the case, if everybody wants flextime, some have \nspecific difficulties with this bill, I hope that Senators would come \ndown and offer amendments. We are at a point where we need to begin to \nwork out, fine tune, and develop a bill which will result in the \nworkers of this country having the benefits which all of us believe \nthey need and want.\n  According to all the accounts I have heard, people want this bill on \nboth sides of the aisle. The President has been heralding the benefits \nof flextime for the last 2 years. In his State of the Union Address, as \npart of his campaign, and as recently as the last several weeks, he \nspoke very favorably, saying that flexible working arrangements are \nvery important. Mrs. Clinton has made statements on national television \nover and over again.\n  Now we have a situation where we have gridlock in the \nNation's Capital. I think it is time for us to break that impasse. I \nthink it is time to work out this measure. It is time for individuals \nwho say they have objections to the bill to come to the floor and offer \nthose kinds of compromises that would adjust the bill so as to make it \nacceptable.\n\n  We want a bill. The Democrats have said they want a bill. I think it \nis time to work together and to work out Senators' concerns here on the \nSenate floor in the process in which the Senate is best served to \nundertake, and where the Senate works at its best, it works to the \nbenefit of the American people.\n  So let's work together and hammer out our concerns on the Senate \nfloor. If Senators dislike specific provisions or language in the bill, \nI say come down and offer your suggestions, your amendments. Let's make \nsure that we don't allow this bill to be one which fails to move \nbecause none of us is willing to consider change. Let's try to say that \nsince we all want this, let's move it forward, place it before the \nSenate, and ask the Senate to act in its wisdom on proposals and \namendments so that the will of the Senate might work out the will of \nthe people.\n  This particular opportunity we have is a good one. It is one which I \nbelieve can really benefit the working people of this country and will \nhelp us as a nation as we move into the next century.\n  If the studies of the GAO were correct, and 10-to-1 people think that \nthis is a good system when they have had a chance to live under it, and \nthe morale goes up and the productivity goes up, this is a policy that \nis a win-win situation and should be extended to all workers. It is a \npolicy change which should be considered high on the agenda of the \nSenate, not on one party or the other, but high on the agenda of the \nAmerican people and should, therefore, be high on the agenda of the \nSenate.\n  Let's work together. Let's come to the floor. Let's make proposals \nfor amendments. Let's work out our differences so that we can respond \nto the President, who said he wants to have a measure that addresses \nthis issue, and let's find a way to do it in a way which will benefit \nthe people of this country.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to talk for 5 to 7 \nminutes just to augment the remarks of my colleague, the Senator from \nMissouri, who has done yeoman's service on this issue.\n  Senator Ashcroft has worked on this issue for probably 6 months now, \ntrying to educate people on the importance of allowing this stress \nrelief valve to be passed into law in America. I commend him for it. \nWhat he said was very, very important because, in fact, the question I \nget asked when I am home and talking about this bill is, ``Why is it \nnecessary to have a law? Why can't people go in and ask their boss to \ntake time off on Friday afternoon to see their children's soccer game \nand make it up on Monday?''\n  Most people in this country believe that you can do this already. The \nbiggest surprise is that 60 million hourly workers in this country do \nnot have this option. They do not have this option because the U.S. \nCongress in 1938 passed a law when only 10 percent of the women, the \nmothers in this country, worked. It said you have a 40-hour workweek, \nand employers and hourly employees cannot violate the 40-hour workweek \nunless you pay time and a half for overtime work. Federal employees \nhave the ability to go in and say, ``I would like to work 38 hours this \nweek and 42 hours next week.'' Salaried employees have the same option. \nBut 60 million hourly employees--the ones who need flexibility the \nmost--are not able to do it because of a law passed in 1938 when 10 \npercent of the mothers in this country worked. Today, two-thirds of the \nworking women in this country have school-age children.\n  When I talk to my friends who still have school-age children, they \nsay what they need more than anything else is time. They need time more \nthan they need money. They need time with their children more than \nanything else. The stress of not being able to go to the football game \nor the soccer game is what hurts them the most.\n  So why wouldn't we give them the ability to go in and talk to their \nemployer and have the flextime or the comptime that was described so \nably\n\n[[Page S5161]]\n\nby the Senator from Missouri? Why wouldn't we do that? It is just good, \nold-fashioned, common horse sense. That is what it is. The people out \nin the country know that. They can't even believe we are talking about \nit. Only inside the beltway in Washington, DC, would it be a question \nthat two adults would be able to sit down and say, ``I would like to \nwork 38 hours this week and 42 hours next week, or I would love the \nability to work 2 extra hours 4 days a week and take Friday off,'' as \nFederal employees are able to do. People want the ability to manage \ntheir own time without taking a pay cut.\n  You know when the President talks about flextime, he is talking about \nnonpaid time. We don't want a person to have to forego the mortgage \npayment or the car payment. We want people to be able to budget, to \nknow, ``This is what I am going to have for spending, this is what I am \ngoing to have to spend, this is my budget, and I do not want to give up \nthe 2 hours of pay. But if I can keep on an even keel with my budget \nand be able to have the flexibility in time, that is what I need most \nin the world right now.''\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Texas \nare going to try to make sure that the 60 million employees in this \ncountry who are not now able to sit down with their employer and ask \nfor their flextime or this comptime do, in fact, have that ability. \nThat is what this is about.\n  The Senator from Missouri came up with the idea that we should \nfinally, once and for all, since 1938, come into the real world. And \nthe real world is that two-thirds of the working women in this country \nhave children in school. They need relief.\n  So the Senator from Missouri and I are going to try to give it to \nthem by enacting flextime and comptime so people can work their normal \nhours or have the flexibility to change their hours but keep their \nsalaries constant. And it is always at the option of the employee to \nsay, ``I would rather have time or I would rather have money.''\n  That is something that the Senator from Missouri was very careful to \nmake sure in his bill that be protected. That is the right of the \nemployee to say, ``No, I do not want time-and-a-half time; I want time-\nand-a-half money.'' That should be the right of the employee. But if \nthe employee says, ``Oh, thank goodness. What I really want to do is to \ngo to my child's soccer game on Friday afternoon, and now I can go and \nask my employer for that time off and make it up next week and not have \nto worry about the car payment,'' that is what we are trying to do. \nThat is the simple fact. It is why this bill is necessary. And I \ncommend the Senator from Missouri for working to make this happen.\n  Why we are having so much trouble getting this bill on the floor for \ndebate is because it is being filibustered on the other side, which I \ndon't understand. I don't know why the unions would be against it. This \ndoesn't interfere with union contracts. If there is a closed shop, a \ncontract shop, a union shop, then this law isn't in effect. The union \nis able to do the negotiating.\n  But if there isn't a union, why should Government be in the way of \nallowing people the ability to have that time with their child at their \nsoccer game or their football game or their Little League Baseball \ngame? Big brother Federal Government should not be in the way, nor \nshould big brother unions be in the way, because this does not affect \nunion contracts. But there are a lot of people in those 60 million \nhourly employees who do not have a union contract that also are \nprecluded by law from this flexibility. And, Mr. President, we don't \nthink it is right. We want to do something about it.\n  That is what the Ashcroft bill does for the working people of this \ncountry.\n  I hope that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will allow \nus to get this bill on the floor. Stop filibustering it. Stop \nstonewalling. Let us get this bill on the floor. Let us have the \ndebate. Let us have the amendments. Whatever is appropriate we will \nwork with if we can just get it on the floor. Right now, for the last 4 \nweeks, 5 weeks, we have just been trying to get the Democrats to agree \nto let us bring it up. It is being filibustered. The time has come for \neverybody to stand up and say, OK, I will put my amendments out there. \nWe will vote them up or down. But let us let the working people of \nAmerica, the 60 million hourly employees, have the same opportunities \nas Federal employees, State employees, and salaried employees to be \nable to take off 2 hours on Friday afternoon and make it up on Monday.\n  That is what this bill is about, and I hope that our colleagues will \nallow us to debate it and pass it and give this stress relief valve to \nthe working people of America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we start off today on this issue, I \nremind our colleagues and friends, there was really no effort on \nanyone's part to delay the consideration of this legislation. If you go \nback and review the amount of time we have taken on the legislation, \nyou will find no more than 4 or 6 hours of debate in total on the \nSenate floor.\n  We are being faced now with the bill is being brought up this \nafternoon with a cloture motion. We have already been notified there \nwill be no time tomorrow morning as the Senate will pause to pay \ntribute to an outstanding Senator, our good friend and colleague, \nSenator Thurmond, who has had a long record in the Senate. We also know \nthat we will be displaced tomorrow afternoon should the budget report \ncome back before the Senate.\n  So we are in a situation where this legislation is put in the \nChamber, pulled back, put in, pulled back, put in, and then a cloture \npetition is filed. We had a series of amendments that were offered in \nthe Labor Committee. These amendments have been filed on the floor as \nwell. I will address the purposes of these amendments later. We voted \non this bill in the committee, and there was no effort to delay. There \nwere only, I believe, six or eight amendments, and I think there have \nbeen just about that number that Senators on this side of the aisle \nhave filed on the legislation. So we should be under no illusion that \nthere is any interest in undue delay on the measure.\n  Madam President, it is very difficult to disagree with the needs of \nthe parents in the situations described by my good friend and colleague \nfrom Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, or my friend from Missouri, Senator \nAshcroft. They discuss cases where the parent needs a little extra time \nfor the meeting with the schoolteachers or for the dental appointment \nor for other kinds of activities. We are all in agreement on the \nimportance of those needs.\n  But that is not what this bill is all about. That is what the Federal \nemployees protections are all about, which we support, but that is not \nwhat this legislation is all about. I will just take a few minutes to \nreview what this bill provides.\n  I would think reasonable people could say that we should not abolish \nthe 40-hour workweek, which has been in effect for nearly 60 years to \nprotect workers from exploitation--that is why it was put into effect. \nWe all understand the need to look at the new global economy and \nconsider new programs, but I do not think we ought to get away from old \nvalues. The old values were that 40 hours of hard work for men and \nwomen in this country is enough over the course of the week if workers \nare going to have any time at all for their families. If employees need \nto work overtime, they should be compensated at time-and-a-half in \norder to provide additional income for the family, particularly because \nthey are going to be denied the opportunity to be with that family.\n  So, if we are going to abolish the 40-hour workweek, I think we need \nto understand where we are going. That has been a protection for many, \nmany years. If we are going to abolish overtime pay in a 2-week period, \nas this bill does, I think we ought to be able to discuss that. I think \nit is fair to review once again who really has the whip hand in \ndeciding whether that worker is going to be able to get time off to \nparticipate in that teacher conference or see that school play. Is it \nthe employee? Or can the employer just say, no, you are not going to be \nable to do that. Then what recourse is available to that employee? You \nwould think that two people sitting down would be able to work out an \naccommodation so that one person would be able to go to\n\n[[Page S5162]]\n\nthat teacher conference, but if the employer is able to say, no, you \ncannot go, how does that benefit the employee? There is virtually no \nhindrance to that employer simply saying, well, you are just not \ngetting off next week or the week after for that basketball game or for \nthat teacher conference. There is no remedy. If the employee had the \ndecision, then we would be talking about an entirely different bill.\n\n  That is not what is before us in S.4. That is not what is before us. \nThat is why I think we ought to be cautious when we talk about ending \nthe 40-hour workweek, when we talk about ending any premium pay for \novertime with the flexible credit hours in this legislation, and when \nwe skew the decisionmaking process in favor of the employer rather than \nthe employee. It seems to me that we ought to examine this and try to \naddress it. That is what I want to speak about this afternoon, about \nthe different amendments that have been advanced and which I hope will \nbe included in the bill. Then I hope the legislation will move forward. \nI would like just to mention those this afternoon to the Senate.\n  Prior to the recess, the sponsors of S. 4 attempted to invoke \ncloture, and they failed badly, not by one or two votes but by seven \nvotes. Every Democrat opposed cloture because the provisions of S. 4 \nare clearly hostile to working men and women. Two courageous \nRepublicans broke with their party and joined with us in opposing \ncloture. That vote should have sent a strong signal to the Republican \nleadership that their bill contains provisions which are unacceptable \nto a great many Senators.\n  Those 47 Senators who opposed cloture will not allow the advocates of \nS. 4 to eliminate the 40-hour workweek. Those Senators will not allow \nthe sponsors of S. 4 to impose a pay cut on American workers, and that \nis what this legislation is really all about. Those Senators will \ninsist upon a comptime bill which is fair to working men and women, one \nwhich allows employees--employees--to make the real decisions and \nchoices.\n  Whether we take 1 more cloture vote or 10 more cloture votes, the \nresult, I believe, will be the same. It should be clear to all Senators \nthat the extreme provisions of S. 4 will never be approved by the \nSenate and they will never become law.\n  That is why many of us had hoped by now the advocates of S. 4 would \nhave moved away from their extreme position toward a more moderate, \nreasonable comptime proposal.\n  The real debate in the Senate has never been about whether workers \nneeded more flexible schedules. All 100 Senators could concur in that \ngoal. What this debate has been about is how best to provide that \nflexibility, how to design a system which genuinely empowers workers \nrather than enhancing the control of their bosses. It is time to turn \nto the real issues. What are the standards by which we should evaluate \na comptime proposal? I think it would be useful if we could establish \nfairness as the criterion and then make the decision as to what \nlegislation advances that goal. I believe there are certain basic \nquestions of fairness which should be asked about each of the pending \ncomptime proposals. Does the proposal prevent an employer from \ndiscriminating in allocating overtime work between those workers who \nchoose time off and those who choose overtime pay? Will it reduce the \npay of employees who are currently working overtime and want to \ncontinue to receive overtime pay? Is the proposal designed to ensure \nthat those workers who choose comptime actually get a net increase in \ntime off to spend with their families? Does the plan protect employees \nwho use comptime from any reduction in their health or retirement \nbenefits? Does the legislation contain strong penalties to deter \nemployer misconduct in the operation of the comptime program? Is the \nvalue of an employee's accrued comptime protected if the employer \nshould become insolvent?\n\n  The answers to these questions will tell us whether a particular \nversion of comptime will truly empower workers. The Republican bill \nflunks this simple test. S. 4 does not give the workers real choices. \nIt gives the employer the final say on when employees can use their \naccrued comptime. It will result in a pay cut, and it jeopardizes the \nhealth and retirement benefits of many workers. It will not even \nguarantee that those who use comptime get a net increase in the amount \nof time off they have to spend with their families. And the Ashcroft \nbill would abolish the 40-hour workweek, one of the most fundamental \nprinciples of American labor law for nearly 60 years.\n  Fortunately for American working men and women, there is a comptime \nproposal which passes this fairness test. The Democratic comptime \nproposal offered by Senator Baucus, Senator Kerrey, and Senator \nLandrieu guarantees the genuine employee choice, which the Republican \nbill fails to provide.\n  The substitute corrects the most serious defects in the Ashcroft \nbill. It incorporates many of the ideas proposed by the Democratic \nmembers of the Labor Committee as amendments during the markup. \nUnfortunately, each was rejected on a party line vote. Let me highlight \nthe key improvements.\n  First, the 40-hour week is preserved. This bedrock principle would be \neliminated by the Republican bill. The Democratic alternative preserves \nthe 40-hour workweek and ensures that every hourly employee who works \nmore than 40 hours will receive time-and-a-half in either pay or \ncomptime. If the real purpose of comptime legislation is to provide \nemployees with the option of additional time off in lieu of extra pay, \nit should not reduce the historic standard of compensation for overtime \nworked. The Republican bill would result in both lower pay and less \ntime off for workers than the Democratic alternative. It is easy to see \nwhich piece of legislation is truly family friendly.\n  Second, the Democratic proposal makes it illegal for employers to \ndiscriminate in allocating overtime work. Employers would have to make \novertime work equally available to those employees who want to receive \novertime pay and those who want to receive comptime. This is an \nessential protection for workers who have been receiving overtime pay \nand need the money. Nearly half of the hourly workers earn $16,000 a \nyear or less; 80 percent of them earn less than $28,000. Overtime pay \non average constitutes 10 or 15 percent of their annual income. Their \nfamilies need those dollars to make ends meet. The Republican bill \nwould allow an employer to offer all the overtime work to those \nemployees who choose comptime and none to those who choose extra pay. \nIn many businesses, S. 4 would mean the end of overtime pay. Such \ndiscrimination is terribly wrong, yet the Ashcroft bill would allow it. \nThe Democratic alternative makes this discrimination illegal, and it is \neasy to see which legislation is truly family friendly.\n  On that point, we offered an amendment in the committee to try to \naddress that issue and it was rejected on a straight party line vote.\n  (Mrs. HUTCHISON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, thirdly, any creditable proposal to \ndeal with employees' desire for more time off to spend with their \nfamilies must ensure the employee can take the time when he or she \nneeds it most. A working mother needs a particular day off so she can \naccompany her child to a school event or doctor's appointment, not a \nday when it is convenient for her boss. Nothing in the Republican \nproposal requires the employer to give her the day she requests. He can \ndeny her request and she has no effective recourse. The Democratic \nalternative provides for real employee choice in using accrued \ncomptime.\n  If the time off is needed to care for a sick child or other family \nmember, the employee has an absolute right to take the time. When the \ntime is being used for other reasons, the employee can take the time if \nhe or she has given 2 weeks notice and the absence will not cause \nsubstantial and grievous injury to the business. The difference between \nthe Democratic and the Republican positions on this crucial issue is \ndramatic. Under the Democratic plan, employees can take the time when \nthey need the time, and it is easy to see which proposal is truly \nfamily friendly.\n  We saw the resistance of our Republican friends to the very modest \namendment of our friend and colleague, Senator Murray from the State of \nWashington, that said let's just have a 24-hour guarantee that a\n\n[[Page S5163]]\n\nmother or father who is working would be able to take up to 24 hours to \ngo to a parent-teacher conference or go to a school event--just 24 \nhours. That was rejected. And why? The reason it was rejected, I \nbelieve, is because it provided for the employees' protection.\n  You can say all you want that this legislation leaves it up to the \nemployee, but the fact is, it does not. If those who support S. 4 say \nthat it does, we have the clarifying language to make sure it does do \nthat. But they resisted that in the markup; they resisted the very \nreasonable proposal of the Senator from Washington for a 24-hour period \nover the course of a year. That would have given the discretion to the \nemployee. Republicans resisted it because, under their proposal, the \nemployer is going to be the one who makes that decision. That, I \nbelieve, is a very important and significant difference.\n  Fourth, if employees are really going to be able to increase the \namount of time spent with their families, comptime hours must count as \nhours worked. The way the Ashcroft bill is drafted, if an employee uses \nearned comptime to take Monday off, she can still be required to work \n40 hours during that week. The boss can require her to work on Saturday \nand not even have it count as overtime.\n  I want my colleagues to understand that the boss can say, ``OK, you \ncan take comptime off on Monday,'' and then can say, ``Well, you will \nwork on Saturday,'' and not even have it count as overtime pay. That \ncan be 48 hours during that one week. Of course, the bill eliminates \nthe 40-hour workweek in any event, so there are any number of hours \nthat employees can be forced to work. Or, the employer can require the \nemployee to work 10 hours a day Tuesday through Friday and not have it \ncount as overtime. Thus, under the Republican comptime scheme, she \nwould not even gain extra time to be with her child. The hours gained \non Monday would be lost by Saturday. There would be no net benefit in \ntime off to the employee. This absurd result is due to the fact that \nthe authors of S. 4 have refused to count hours of comptime as hours \nworked. That little change, comptime as hours worked, would avoid that. \nWe offered that as an amendment. It was rejected. My Republican \ncolleagues rejected an amendment to give the employees the ability to \nmake the decision about the time off. My colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle rejected our amendment to count comptime hours when used \nas hours worked, which would provide that protection from exploitation. \nThat was rejected by the supporters of S. 4. Thus, the employees using \nthe comptime will enjoy no increase in their free time. Our Democratic \nalternative provides that protection. Again, it is easy to see which \nproposal is truly family friendly.\n  The Baucus-Kerrey-Landrieu legislation corrects a number of other \nflaws in S. 4 as well. It shows how hollow the promise of the Ashcroft \nbill really is. This debate has never been about whether employees \nneeded the option of more time off. We all agree, as I mentioned \nearlier, that they deserve more time to spend with their families. The \ndebate has always been about how to make that opportunity real. It is \nabout how to truly empower workers, not how to give increased control \nto their bosses. The Democratic alternative achieves the goal of \nempowering workers; the Republican bill falls dramatically short.\n  Madam President, with those kinds of alterations or changes, we would \nhave legislation that would be out of here in very short order. It \nseems to me that if we are going to do what is the stated purpose of \nthis legislation--to give the employees the power to be able to make \nthose decisions, to make sure they are protected in terms of hourly \npay--then we need to provide those protections. We need to prevent \ndiscrimination against workers where the employer says, ``I'm always \ngoing to give overtime work to Jimmy here because he always takes the \ncomptime, and I'm not going to give any to Sally because she always \ntakes the overtime and I don't want to pay that out.'' We just need to \nprovide some protection so we don't have that kind of discrimination.\n  These are basic elements of protection for employees. Every one of \nthese proposals that I have mentioned provides additional power to the \nemployee. As I understand it, having listened to the debate, giving \nemployees some power is the primary reason at least some say they \nsupport this legislation.\n  I think it is important to emphasize the extent of flexibility in the \n40-hour workweek at the present time. If employers--and this is today--\ngenuinely want to provide family friendly arrangements, they can do so \nunder current law. The key is the 40-hour week. Normally, employees \nwork five 8-hour days a week, but more flexible arrangements are \npossible. Employers can schedule workers for four 10-hour days a week \nwith the 5th day off and pay them the regular hourly rate for each \nhour. No time-and-a-half is required. They can arrange a work schedule \nof four 9-hour days plus a 4-hour day on the 5th day so they can have \nFriday afternoons off, again without paying a dime of overtime. That \ncan be worked out today without a dime of overtime.\n  Under the current law, some employees can even vary their hours \nenough to have a 3-day weekend every other week. Once again, the \nemployer does not have to pay a dime of overtime. That flexibility is \ntotally legal under current law.\n  Employers can also offer genuine flextime. This allows employers to \nschedule an 8-hour day around core hours of, say, from 10 to 3. Let \nemployees decide whether they want to work from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. or \nfrom 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. This is a very popular option for Federal \nemployees. This, too, costs employers not a penny more. But only a tiny \nfraction of employers use these or many other flexible arrangements \navailable under the current law. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found \nthat only 10 percent of hourly employees are allowed to use these or \nother flexible schedules. Only 10 percent. We hear S. 4's proponents \nsay, ``Let's give them half the day off on Friday, let's give them more \nflexibility during the course of the week, let's let them have an extra \nday off every other week''--all that is possible today, without a dime \nof overtime. You know something? Only 10 percent of employees are \npermitted to do that at the present time. Current law offers a host of \nfamily friendly flexible schedules, yet virtually no employers provide \nthem.\n  Madam President, this bill has a different purpose, and that, I \nsuggest, is to cut workers' wages. Employer groups unanimously support \nit. Obviously, it is not just the small businesses which wish to cut \npay and substitute some less expensive benefit instead. I have here, \nwhich I will have printed in the Record, a letter signed by 9 to 5, \nNational Association of Working Women; American Nurses Association; \nBusiness and Professional Women; National Council of Jewish Women; \nNational Women's Law Center; and the Women's Legal Defense Fund. These \nhave been the organizations, during the time I have been in the Senate, \nthat have fought for gender equity, gender fairness, pay equity, \nnondiscrimination against women. They have been the ones who have \nfought for the increase in the minimum wage, day care programs, \nexpansion of Head Start--the whole range of different family friendly \nprograms. They are on record in each and every one of them. This is \ntheir conclusion in reviewing this legislation:\n\n       We believe that passage of S. 4, the Family Friendly \n     Workplace Act, fails to offer real flexibility to the working \n     women it purports to help while offering a substantial \n     windfall to employers * * *\n       Nearly half of the workforce is women and the number of \n     women working multiple jobs has increased more than four fold \n     in the last 20 years. S. 4 would affect hourly workers and \n     most hourly workers are women. The majority of minimum wage \n     workers are women. Many of these women depend on overtime \n     pay. Many of them want more control of their schedules, not \n     less. Without strong protections for workers, the comp time \n     bill will cut women's options and women's pay.

Those employees received over \n$100 million for those violations, in the last year alone. That is what \nis really happening in the workplace.\n\n       Because employees do not control when and if they use their \n     comp time, they are essentially being asked to gamble on the \n     chance that they will be able to take time when it is as \n     valuable to them as overtime pay * * *\n       Women want flexibility in the workplace, but not at the \n     risk of jeopardizing their overtime pay or the well-\n     established 40-hour work week.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord this letter I just referred to.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  American Nurses Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 30, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott and Senator Daschle: The undersigned \n     national organizations represent many of the working women of \n     today. We believe passage of S. 4, the Family Friendly \n     Workplace Act, fails to offer real flexibility to the working \n     women it purports to help while offering a substantial \n     windfall to employees. We urge you to delay consideration \n     until a real solution can be found which truly meets the \n     needs of working women and families.\n       Nearly half of the workforce is women and the number of \n     women working multiple jobs has increased more than four fold \n     in the last 20 years. S. 4 would affect hourly workers, and \n     most hourly workers are women. The majority of minimum wage \n     workers are women. Many of these women depend on overtime \n     pay. Many of them want more control of their schedules, not \n     less. Without strong protections for workers, the comp time \n     bill will cut women's options and women's pay. For example: \n     someone pressured into taking comp time when she really wants \n     or needs overtime pay is taking an involuntary pay cut; \n     supporters argue that S. 4 is voluntary and the employees \n     have a ``choice,'' yet working women, who have for decades \n     faced subtle (and not-so-subtle) forms of discrimination, are \n     all too familiar with the potential consequences of not going \n     along with the employers' wishes: isolation, intimidation and \n     even retaliation; and because employees do not control when \n     or if they can use their comp time, they are essentially \n     being asked to gamble on the chance that they will be able to \n     take time when it is as valuable to them as overtime pay.\n       S. 4 must be defeated. Women want flexibility in the \n     workplace, but not at the risk of jeopardizing their overtime \n     pay or the well-established 40 hour work week.\n           Sincerely,\n     9 to 5, National Association of Working Women,\n     American Nurses Association,\n     Business and Professional Women,\n     National Council of Jewish Women,\n     National Women's Law Center,\n     Women's Legal Defense Fund.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this isn't just my own conclusion. The \nobservations made today reflect a wide range of different groups, those \ngroups primarily that have been fighting for the working men and women \nof this country. The groups opposing this bill include not only the \nLeague of Women Voters, but the National Women's Political Caucus, the \nNational Council of Senior Citizens, the National Council of Churches, \nand the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund. The list goes on \nand on, for these reasons: this bill, S. 4, gives the ultimate decision \nto the employer rather than the employee.\n  This isn't Federal employees where the employee has the right to take \nthe time off. This is a different arrangement which, under any fair \nreading, would give the employer the control. Without the protections \nthat I have mentioned, this would be the result.\n  We have to ask today whether we want to risk abolishing the 40-hour \nworkweek, effectively abolishing overtime pay for workers who are on \nthe lower rungs of the economic ladder. Some 60 percent of those \nworkers earn $16,000 a year; 65 percent of them have no college \neducation. In so many instances, they are working not just one job but \ntwo or three jobs in order to make ends meet. Those are people who are \nstruggling at the bottom rung of the ladder and depend upon the \novertime just to get those resources to be able to try to bring up a \nfamily. Sure, they would like to spend more time with their family and, \nsure, they ought to have some opportunity to do that. We support that. \nBut we are going to make sure that when that judgment is made, that \nthat employee is the one who is going to make the judgment, not the \nemployer because they want to see a pay cut for hard-working Americans.\n  That is basically what the issue is before us in the U.S. Senate. \nWithout these kinds of protections that we have talked about today, \nthat would be the result, a significant pay cut for those that are \nworking on the bottom economic rungs of the ladder. That is wrong. That \nis unfair.\n  The measure that has been introduced by the Democrats as a substitute \nprovides protections to deal with those issues. But we have been unable \nto be able to get acceptance of that proposal. Therefore, we stand in \nopposition to S. 4.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Madam President, it is with a great deal of \nenthusiasm that I rise to voice support for S. 4, I think the aptly \nnamed ``Family Friendly Workplace Act.'' I think that is exactly what \nthis bill does. It provides some friendliness in the Fair Labor \nStandards Act for the employees, for the workers in this Nation.\n  I want to compliment and commend the Senator from Missouri for his \nleadership on this issue. I know of no one in this body more committed \nand more dedicated to the American family than the Senator from \nMissouri. And he demonstrated that I believe in his sponsorship and his \nchampioning of this cause and this bill.\n  This bill will give American workers the flexibility to take paid \ntime off for any reason by simply working those hours in advance, paid \ntime off. I know there are many in this body who have worked hard for \nfamily and medical leave. That is unpaid family medical leave. Most in \nthe U.S. Senate voted for the Family and Medical Leave Act, the unpaid \nFamily and Medical Leave Act. Therefore, it puzzles me that so many of \nthose who championed family and medical leave on a voluntary and unpaid \nbasis will now oppose this legislation which will provide workers paid \ntime off for any reason by simply working those hours in advance.\n  It would make it possible, this bill, for modern families to \nharmonize the ever-increasing demands of family life and the workplace. \nMany employers have done their best to try to build some flexibility \nunder the current law. And they have found themselves repeatedly in a \nvirtual straitjacket.\n  This legislation will provide them that much-needed flexibility to \nwork with and on behalf of those whom it is their best interest to \nhelp, their employees, their own workers. This is an issue which has \nbeen recognized by those on both sides of the aisle as being crucial to \nthe future of the American family in this country. Mothers need to be \nable to leave work early to attend parent-teacher conferences or \nwhatever else may be important to the welfare of their families. \nFathers need to be able to take off work early to go coach their \nchildren's Little League team or some other worthy activity that will \nbenefit their families.\n  S. 4 amends the Fair Labor Standards Act that applies to private-\nsector employees. That is those employees currently not eligible for \ncomptime or flexible work programs. The individuals that I am referring \nto hold hourly positions such as clerical workers, mechanics, other \nlow- or mid-level jobs that provide the backbone of our work force. The \nvery individuals who need flexibility the most are those who currently \nare denied it under the current law.\n  The Labor Department recently concluded a report to the Nation and to \nPresident Clinton entitled ``Working Women Count.'' Hundreds of \nthousands of working women were surveyed and the results speak volumes \nabout the priorities of these women in the work force today. The No. 1 \nissue for these women was how difficult it is to balance work and \nfamily obligations.\n  Their concerns are exactly what S. 4 is designed to address, how to \ncontinue meeting their responsibilities at work while also meeting \ntheir responsibilities at home to their families.\n\n[[Page S5165]]\n\n  Why do we need a bill like the Family Friendly Workplace Act? The \ncurrent laws dealing with the workplace were developed in the 1930's. \nThere are some who feel content. They feel that those 1930 laws, as \nwell-intended as they were, should be set in concrete forever, never \namended, never changed except to make periodic changes in the minimum \nwage.\n\n  But the fact is, life in America has changed dramatically in the last \n60 years. The structure and the composition of the typical American \nfamily has changed dramatically in the last 60 years. And it is time \nthat we reflected those changes in the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  In 1940, just 2 years after the passage of the Fair Labor Standards \nAct, 67 percent of all American families were comprised of a husband \nthat worked outside the home and a wife that did not. More than two-\nthirds of American families fit that basic model in 1940, just 2 years \nafter the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act, and only 9 percent \nof families had two working spouses. Today that is no longer the case. \nNot only is it no longer the case it is just about the reverse, it is \njust about the opposite of that.\n  By 1995, only 17 percent of families had husbands that worked while \nthe wife stayed at home. In 1995, only 17 percent had that kind of \nclassic Ozzie and Harriet household. Only 17 percent fit that model 2 \nyears ago. In addition, almost 70 percent of single women headed \nfamilies with children.\n  So again, I point out, Madam President, the Department of Labor's own \nstudy revealed that the No. 1 issue women wanted to bring to the \nPresident's attention is the difficulty of balancing work and family \nobligations.\n  Recent polling data reflects that 81 percent of women support \nflextime proposals, and 31 percent of women who work full time say the \nability to work flexible hours is the single most important policy \nreform that could be instituted in the workplace to ease this dilemma, \nthis struggle of balancing a family and work pressures, to reduce \nstress, and to increase productivity.\n  So, 8 out of 10 women support the concept of this bill championed by \nSenator Ashcroft of Missouri. Nearly one out of three put flextime at \nthe very top of the list of workplace reforms that will provide help to \nthe family.\n  I know I have been talking mostly about how this bill will benefit \nwomen in the work force. But it is not just women who feel so strongly \nabout this issue. A poll conducted by Penn & Schoen Associates showed \nthat most Americans prefer options in compensation for working \novertime. They want options, they want more flexibility.\n  In fact, 75 percent favor allowing employees the choice of getting \ntime and a half either in wages or as time off, 75 percent favor that. \nMadam President, 57 percent would take time off instead of being paid \nif that option were made available to them. Not by coercion. I heard \nthat word. Not by pressure. I heard that word. But they voluntarily \ndesire that option and would take it were it made available to them.\n  Then Money magazine recently conducted a poll which concluded that 64 \npercent of Americans and 68 percent of women would rather have their \novertime in the form of time off rather than cash wages. Madam \nPresident, the evidence is overwhelming, the American people want more \nflexibility in their work schedules.\n  This bill provides it. The Family Friendly Workplace Act guarantees \nall Americans the right to have this flexibility. Unfortunately, many \nmisconceptions have been perpetrated about what this bill actually \ndoes.\n  Let me just set the record straight on what I believe are some gross \nmischaracterizations of this legislation. The single most important \nthing that the American worker needs to know about the Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act is that its provisions are completely--completely--\nvoluntary.\n  As I was listening to debate here on the Senate floor I was turning \nthrough the bill. It is always helpful to read the bill. I believe the \nlanguage is very plain and unequivocal:\n\n       An employer that provides compensatory time off under \n     paragraph 2 to an employee shall not directly or indirectly \n     intimidate, threaten, or coerce or attempt to intimidate, \n     threaten or coerce any employee.\n  So the most important thing to remember is that the provisions of \nthis bill are entirely completely voluntary. No employer can force a \nworker to take time off rather than overtime pay. In fact, S. 4 imposes \ncriminal and civil penalties on employers who attempt to coerce or \nintimidate their employees into taking time off in lieu of overtime \npay. Those penalties are increased. Flexible time can only be initiated \nat the employee's request. So worker protections would really be \ngreater under this legislation than under current law. And it is, I say \nagain, totally--totally--voluntary.\n  Another misconception is that workers would only be able to take the \ntime off at the discretion of their employers. S. 4 allows an employee \nto take time off within a reasonable period after making the request as \nlong as their absence would not unduly disrupt the employer's \noperations.\n  This standard has been used since 1985 for Government employees. It \nhas resulted in very few disputes, and most notably has won rave \nreviews from these Federal workers who have had this option made \navailable to them. They have not seen themselves as the pawns of \nmanagement. They have not seen themselves abused, but rather they have \nseen this as an option that they wanted to take advantage of. They have \napproved of it. It has worked admirably. It has won rave reviews.\n  It is interesting to note that Federal employees have enjoyed a \ncompensatory time-off option since 1945, and flexible work schedules \nsince 1978, while private-sector employees must still operate under the \nrules established almost 60 years ago.\n  Furthermore, the comptime and flextime provisions of the bill are \ncompletely voluntary and do not affect collective bargaining \nagreements.\n  Some would like to portray this bill as a coercive attempt to \nundermine the unions. Nothing could be further from the truth. S. 4 is \na bill that recognizes the importance of one particular union, and that \nis the union of family, a mother, a father, children, and the \nrelationship that they have to their employer. And this bill will \nenhance that contractual agreement. It will enhance that union that \nexists within family. It will put a modicum of flexibility and \nreasonableness into labor law and into workplace management.\n  So let me just say, in concluding my remarks, there are two things I \nthink are absolutely essential to remember. No. 1, it is voluntary. I \nam so tired of hearing the words ``pressure'' and ``intimidation'' and \n``coercion'' because the language of this bill is absolutely plain and \nclear that that is not only not tolerated, it is illegal, whether it is \nimplied or otherwise, and the sanctions and the penalties are actually \nenhanced over current law.\n  The second thing that I urge my colleagues to remember is not only is \nit voluntary, but it is tried and it is proved and has been successful. \nFederal employees have enjoyed this, and it is high time that we gave \nthe workers of America the same benefits that Federal employees have \nenjoyed for years. And it is voluntary. You cannot coerce it. It is \nabsolutely and totally voluntary and it has been proven it works. It is \ntime we extend those benefits to others.\n  This bill takes a giant step in altering the all-too-obvious dilemma \nAmerican workers presently face in trying to balance family and work \nresponsibilities. I urge my colleagues to put families first and \nsupport S. 4.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I was very interested in the comments \nthat the good Senator was making, saying this is a completely voluntary \nprovision. Let me point this out. If an individual worker says, ``Well, \nif I'm going to work overtime, I want my time and a half. And, \ntherefore, since the system is completely voluntary, I'm not going to \nsign up for the comptime. I'm not going to sign up for flextime. I'm \ngoing to maintain the 40-hour week, and anybody who thinks that this is \ngoing to allow discrimination just doesn't understand it because I'm \ngoing to be able to maintain my rights.''\n\n  Well, that is a wonderful rhetorical statement, but it just does not \ntake into account what is happening out in the workplace. Because you \nhave Johnny over here who says, ``I'm going to\n\n[[Page S5166]]\n\nmaintain my rights, I'm not going to let the employer decide when I can \ntake comptime or flextime. I'm going to take the overtime pay after 40 \nhours a week.'' The employer says, ``OK, if you do that, I'm going to \ngive the work to Bill and Harry over here. So you, Johnny, you're not \ngoing to get any overtime work because Bill and Harry are going to take \ncomptime and they're going to take flextime. So you'll never get \novertime work as you get today.''\n  That is the reality of the workplace. You can stand up here all day \nlong--and I have heard Senators say, ``This is completely voluntary, \nbecause if I don't want to participate I don't have to. I'll be \nprotected by the 40-hour week. I'll be able to get my overtime.'' But \nthat does not reflect what is happening out there in the workplace \ntoday.\n  You have the three workers. He says, ``I'm going to stick with the \n40-hour week. And I want my overtime pay.'' The others say, ``I'll do \nthe flextime. I will not take the overtime,'' The flexible credit hour \nprovision provides what they call straight time, which means they will \nwork overtime but they will still get paid the same amount they got for \nthe first 40 hours. That is in the bill. Or the next one says, ``I will \ntake that in comptime and I will take that time off next week.''\n\n  Now, who is the employer going to choose when it comes to awarding \novertime work? What the Democrats said is, ``OK, if you are going for \nthese programs, we want a provision in there that you will not \ndiscriminate against that person who needs the overtime pay.'' Were the \nRepublicans willing to take that? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. The \nRepublicans claim that workers are going to be able to make a decision \non their own, without coercion. But the fact is that they are going to \nbe discriminated against in the workplace because they are not going \nalong. When we tried to remedy that situation with an amendment, the \nRepublicans said no.\n  Now, I find it difficult to believe that this is really voluntary and \nit really will not affect those workers who do not want to participate. \nOf course it will affect those workers. They will have their pay cut \nbecause they will never get the overtime work. Those who need the \novertime pay the most will never be assigned overtime work again. They \nwill be hurt the worst.\n  That is why we are trying to bring in that provision, so we will not \ndiscriminate. This bill allows that. I think it demonstrates what the \nbill's real purpose is.\n  This is, basically, Madam President, about reducing overtime pay. \nThat is the testimony we had before the committee. The National \nFederation of Independent Business, one of the prime organizations that \nsupports this told our committee that ``Small businesses can't afford \nto pay overtime.'' That was the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses's explanation of why they support this bill.\n  Who are the people affected by this legislation? To understand the \nreal-world impact of the bill, you have to look at the workers \ncurrently depending on overtime pay to make ends meet. Forty-four \npercent of those who depend on overtime earn $16,000 a year or less. \nMore than 80 percent have annual earnings of less than $28,000 a year. \nThat is, 80 percent of them earn less than $28,000 a year. A single mom \nwith two children, $28,000 a year. That is at the top level of those \nwho are working overtime. These are people who need every dollar they \ncan earn just to make ends meet, men and women supporting families.\n  If this bill passes, many will lose the overtime dollars they need so \nbadly. Employers will give all the work to the employees who agree to \ntake the comptime. There will not be overtime work for those who insist \non being paid.\n  Under the Ashcroft bill, discrimination in awarding overtime work \nwill be perfectly legal. Does anyone honestly believe it will not \nhappen? Does anyone honestly believe if the employer has the choice \nbetween paying someone 1\\1/2\\ times or paying someone in flexible \ncredit hours, which is straight time, does anybody believe the employer \nwill not choose the less expensive option?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If you mean for the question to be totally rhetorical, \nI would not. But I believe there are reasons in the bill which indicate \nthat such coercion would not exist. First, I do not think it is \nautomatic that it costs an employer less to have an employee to accept \ncomptime and have to maintain books for the compensatory time and also \nhave the cash available for an employee to be paid the compensatory \ntime at the worker's option.\n  If you look at the bill on page 15, it says, ``Prohibition of \nCoercion,'' and it says, ``shall not directly or indirectly intimidate, \nthreaten, coerce or attempt to do so,'' and again on page 39, ``an \nemployer shall not directly or indirectly intimidate, threaten, coerce \nor attempt to do so.''\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could, please tell me where coercion is defined in \nthe bill. I would be interested.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Page 40--thank you for asking--definition: ``The terms \nintimidate, threaten or coercion include promising to confer or \nconferring any benefit, such as an appointment, promotion, or \ncompensation, or affecting or threatening to affect any reprisal such \nas deprivation of appointment, promotion, or compensation.'' It seems \nto me that is exactly what you are talking about.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, it is not. Are you are saying that the definition of \ncoercion includes discrimination in the award of overtime work, or are \nyou saying that the issue of coercion is different from the issue of \ndiscrimination?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. No, what I am saying----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Do you agree that you can have discrimination without \ncoercion?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Not under the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Then why do you not add the word ``discrimination''? If \nyou added that this afternoon, that would be real progress. I think \nthere is a difference between coercion and discrimination. Without \ncoercing somebody, I can say I will not give overtime work to that \nperson. That is not coercing that person, as I interpret it. That is \ndiscriminating against that person because they will not take comptime \nor they will not go along with the flexible credit hours, which is \nstraight time. I call that discrimination, not coercion.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Sure.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. This defines intimidation, and it says it includes \n``promising to confer or conferring any benefit such as appointment,'' \nwhich means to appoint the person to do the overtime, or promotion, or \ncompensation, to give a person a benefit, which the overtime is clearly \na benefit. That is the whole thrust of your argument.\n  If you do that, your discrimination qualifies as intimidation under \nthe definition on page 40. But maybe we can clarify this with an \namendment. That is one of the reasons I have said I would welcome \nMembers to come to the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I would be more than glad to offer that amendment this \nafternoon to make that clear, and we could accept that this afternoon \nand move ahead. I would consider that very important.\n  With all respect to the Senator, I find an important difference in \nthe definitions of coercion and discrimination. If the Senator believes \nthat other parts of the bill's definition of coercion somehow prohibit \ndiscrimination, and therefore employers cannot discriminate, perhaps we \ncould clarify that issue by using those words, discrimination. If we \ncould achieve that, we would have made very important progress. I \noffered an amendment to accomplish precisely this. My amendment made it \nunlawful for an employer ``to qualify the availability of work for \nwhich monetary overtime compensation is required upon the request of an \nemployee for acceptance of compensatory time off in lieu of monetary \novertime pay.'' So if you are willing to include those words, I think \nwe would have made some very important progress. That is one of the \nimportant improvements that we are trying to achieve.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am happy to try to work together with our staffs to \nsee if we can meet a mutual understanding of language. It is not my \nintent to draft a measure that would allow the employer to withhold the \nbenefit of additional\n\n[[Page S5167]]\n\novertime or opportunities from an individual based upon their \ncommitment to take either comptime as opposed to paid time or paid time \nas opposed to comptime. The decision should be neutral.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the Senator's position on that. I do feel \nthat has to be spelled out in the legislation because of the types of \nindustries that we have been talking about here, for those individuals \nworking in those industries have been subject to a great deal of \nexploitation, as the Senator knows--I will not take the time now, \nbecause I mentioned it earlier--both in terms of meeting minimum wage \nstandards and also in terms of overtime standards. We are talking about \nhundreds of thousands of workers every single year.\n\n  I certainly appreciate what the Senator says about his desire to make \nsure that the legislation is not going to lend itself to exploitation. \nIt is my own experience, and I think the experience of many others, \nparticularly those people who are working in those working conditions, \nthat there would be, in too many instances, a contrary result. I am \nsure there will be many employers who would not abuse this system, but \nI think we need to provide those kinds of protections. We will welcome \nthe chance to work on this.\n  I was addressing, Madam President, the overtime provisions. I will \nnot be long. It does reflect the vulnerability of these individuals in \nthe work force. We are talking about these individuals who do not have \nthe protection of any of the unions and are subject to, in too many \ninstances, harsh working conditions.\n  As I mentioned, the people who will be hurt the most are the most \nvulnerable workers. Fifty-six percent have only a high school diploma \nor less. You know how hard it is to get ahead, no matter how hard you \nwork, without more education. Millions who rely on overtime earn only \nthe minimum wage. Sixty percent of them are women. One-third of them \nare the sole breadwinner in their families, and 2.3 million children \nrely on parents who earn the minimum wage, parents who hope their \nchildren will not get sick because they cannot afford a doctor and \ncannot afford the health insurance.\n  Interviews conducted by the Women's Legal Defense Fund demonstrate \nthe sacrifice American women make in support of corporate flexibility, \nsuch as a waitress who is involuntarily changed to a night shift \ndespite the fact she has no child care for evening hours. One working \nmom says, ``My life feels I am wearing shoes two sizes too small.'' \nThousands of these workers already work two jobs to make ends meet, and \nthey need to work every hour they can.\n  Let me give a few examples of these people: 400,000, half of them \nwomen, work two jobs in the food service industry; 200,000 are cleaning \nand building maintenance workers. These are classic low-wage jobs. \nThese employees really need the money they earn from overtime.\n  We discussed in our committee how the new economy, Madam President, \nwas creating two categories of workers. The highly educated people are \ndoing well, but those with limited education are struggling, and it is \nincreasingly difficult for them to earn a good living. They depend on \novertime. Their jobs are hard, but they perform them with dignity and \ncommitment. They are doing their best to provide for their families. We \ncannot pass a bill to allow employers to cut the pay those workers \nreceive now.\n  Madam President, I think if we were to go across the face of this \ncountry, we would find that most workers feel they are working longer \nhours. They are working longer hours than they were 20 years ago, about \n200 hours a year more than they were working 20 years ago. Most of them \nfeel they are working longer, they are working harder, and they are not \nmaking much progress toward reaching the American dream.\n  I saw the National Association of Business Economists was talking \nabout poll results that for the first time found that more than half of \nthe American people believe that the future for their children is not \ngoing to be as good as their own standard of living. We have always, as \na country and a society, believed that future generations were going to \nhave better opportunities for success, and there are a variety of \nmeasures that impact the well-being of those workers. Obviously, there \nare wages, the key element; the education of their children; decent \nhealth care; whether they will have any kind of pension system down the \nroad. Of course, very, very few of these workers, ever have any kind of \npension. That does not exist for the kind of workers we are talking \nabout here today. The challenges they are facing in terms of inner \ncities, of rural communities, in terms of safety and security, \nwondering about the air they breathe, the water they drink, all of \nthose issues are out there. They are facing an extraordinarily \nchallenging time for themselves and for their families, working harder \nand not getting very far ahead.\n  Now we are asking them to roll the dice on legislation. Will we offer \nthem legislation that will abolish what protection those workers have \nunder the 40-hour week, and allow employers to tell them they will work \n60 hours 1 week and 20 hours the next? Or will we give workers the \nright to decide whether they want to work longer and maybe get that \nadditional money, maybe not see their children as much, but at the \nleast offer their children a better quality of life? Sixty hours of \nwork in one week--where are workers going to get the day care under \nsuch a schedule? Where are they going to be during that week if their \nchild gets sick? How does it help them to work 20 hours the next week?\n\n  The key to this legislation is very clear. What is the power of the \nemployee? Is the employee going to be making the judgment, as provided \nin the Democratic alternative bill, as to when that time can be taken \noff? Or is it going to be the employer who will choose, as S. 4 \nprovides? The Ashcroft bill says that, when an employee has accrued the \ncomp time and wants to use it, the employee ``shall be permitted by the \nemployer of the employee to use it within a reasonable period of \ntime.''\n  Does that mean workers are going to be guaranteed the ability to go \nto that school meeting next Monday afternoon, or go to the dentist a \nweek from Wednesday, or go to that school play, or go to that athletic \nevent in the middle of next week? It says, ``shall be permitted by the \nemployer of the employee to use such time within a reasonable period \nafter making the request, if the use of the time does not unduly \ndisrupt.'' What is unduly disrupt? The employer says, ``I have to get \nthose products out to the market. We can't have you leaving in the \nmiddle of next week.'' That is the end of the story. Is there any \nopportunity for this employee to say, ``Wait a minute; let someone \nelse, a neutral person, make a decision on this?'' Absolutely not. The \nemployer makes that judgment. It is stated here.\n  If the employer makes that judgment that the employee's use of \ncomptime will unduly disrupt, he will give the time off 3 weeks from \nnow rather than the time when that individual wants and needs it. Those \nare the provisions of the legislation. It does not give the choice to \nthe employee.\n  That is the dramatic difference between this bill and the bill that \nhas been proposed by the Democrats. The Democratic alternative would \nprovide for the employee to be able to take that time. It would \nguarantee that workers could take that time if they needed it to take \ncare of a sick child or a family member. That is an absolute right. And \nwhen the time is being used for the other reasons; that is, the ball \ngame, the parent-teacher conference, the employee can take the time off \nif she has given at least 2 weeks notice and the use of the time will \nnot cause grievous injury to the business. That is the difference.\n  Are we going to risk abolishing the 40-hour week, or are we willing \nto give the employee greater flexibility to be able to do the kinds of \nthings that have been identified which parents want to do and need to \ndo for their children's upbringing? That is the basic question.\n  I think we ought to at least be able to consider the Democratic \nalternative before we obtain cloture. I understand that we would not be \nable to consider the Democratic alternative prior to cloture.\n  It is my understanding that we will be having a cloture motion filed \nthis afternoon.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S5168]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, we may or may not be able to have the \ncloture motion filed this afternoon. But to make a difference in terms \nof working out some of these measures, I would be pleased to see the \ncloture motion held over until Tuesday so that the cloture vote could \nbe held until Thursday.\n  I think it is important for us to get together and work on this \nmeasure. It is important for us to understand that we agree that \nfamilies need more time. I believe we have an agreement that we want \nworkers to have a real choice and a choice that is meaningful to \nworkers.\n  That is one of the reasons we put the second level of choice into the \nbill. We allow a worker to choose to say, ``I would like to have this \nas comptime instead of overtime pay.'' But we put a second choice into \nthe bill that says any time after the worker has said that they want it \nas comptime and not as pay later, the worker can say, ``I change my \nmind. I will take that as pay.'' That is to avoid any potential \ncoercion or abuse.\n\n  But the idea that an employer might say we are only going to let \novertime go to people who will choose compensatory time, or even to say \nwe are only going to let overtime go to employees who are going to \nchoose to be paid because they don't want to mess with the hassle of \nkeeping the overtime--if the employer wants to participate at all, the \nemployer shouldn't be able to intimidate the employee's choice in this \nmatter.\n  One of the things that I think I would like to point out that the \nSenator from Massachusetts has raised is that he wants this to be \nsomething that helps families. He talks about the need to help \nfamilies. But the kinds of items that they are proposing that deal only \nwith comp time and don't deal with flexible working arrangements like \nthe Federal employees have or don't deal with anything like the Federal \nemployees have, maybe we will address the needs of at best maybe a \nthird of the employees. I think we are forgetting the data from the \n1996 current population survey, which indicated that only 4.5 percent--\nthat is one out of every 25 women--who work by the hour have overtime \nin a typical workweek. That means, yes, in a typical work period and in \na week's time. But say you get four times or five times that 4.5 \npercent that get it over the course of time so that they would be able \nto build up some comptime, they are still talking about 20 percent of \nthe women in the culture who are working in those hourly jobs.\n  If you have 28.8 million women working in hourly jobs and you are \nonly going to help 5 to 6 million of them, we have not done much in \nthis bill. We need to address the problems that inure to the families \nof all of the workers, not just the ones that get regular overtime. The \nmen are in a little bit better shape in our culture. They get more of \nthe overtime than the women do. There are about two men getting \novertime for every woman getting overtime.\n  But if we do nothing more than pass the comptime part of this bill, \nwe are going to leave behind too many men and too many women. We need \nto have flexible working arrangements on a broader level to meet the \nneeds of the families, the families with children, that do not have \nregular overtime. They get sick. Children in families that do not have \nregular overtime get awards--they have parent-teacher conferences.\n  Of course, in one respect it is important to say that, if you have \ncomptime or flextime under this bill, you don't even have to have \nchildren to benefit. If you want to go fishing and your boss can agree \nthat it does not unduly disrupt the business' purposes, you can swap \nthe time off, and especially if you schedule to take every other Friday \noff.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts talked about the fact that there are \ncertain ways in which flexible benefits can inure under the current \nsituation. He says that only a tiny fraction of the employers provide \nflexible work schedules. That is because they are unworkable. It is a \nsimple matter of fact.\n  The flexibility outside of S. 4 is limited to arranging 40 hours of \nwork in a 7-day period. Exchanging hours from week to week is not \npermitted, even if the employee requests such an arrangement. For \nexample, an employee who wants to work 45 hours in one week in exchange \nfor only working 35 in another in order to attend a child's soccer game \nor to take the child to a doctor or to go fishing makes the employer \nagree to pay 5 hours of overtime for the longer workweek. Most \nemployers can't do that.\n  Sally Larson, a human resource professional at TRW, tesified before \nthe Employment and Job Training Subcommittee that her company \ninstituted a program where hourly workers would take every other Friday \noff. She also stated it took a team of lawyers a year to change over \ntheir payroll systems and to make sure that the program complied with \nFederal law.\n  Most hourly workers aren't working in settings like that where they \nwork for an employer who can have a team of lawyers that go through \nthat kind of enterprise. Small businesses--or any business, for that \nmatter--should not have to hire a team of lawyers in order to \ncooperate.\n\n  The point is that current law is unworkable. It is obviously not in \nbroad utilization. It doesn't happen. We need something better.\n  The fact is that the system which we are promoting, the system which \nwe are offering to the American public, is not an untried system. It is \na system that has been place in the Federal Government since 1978. \nThrough the last years of the 1970's, all through the decade of the \n1980's, now well through the 1990's, we have had the system in place.\n  I have been in the Senate now going on 3 years. I have yet to have a \nsingle Federal employee come and complain to me about this system. \nThere is no bill pending in the U.S. Congress that would change this \nsystem. This is a benefit. It is a clear, unmistakable benefit. It is \nsomething that workers use. They subscribed to the flexible working \narrangements benefits so aggressively early on that it has provided \nsome difficulty in getting people to work on Friday. It has taken \ncooperation and some scheduling. But that has happened.\n  There is much talk about the fact of the suggestion that we are \nwithout protections in this bill. But the bill which I have proposed \nfor private industry has many protections which are not included in the \nbill which relates to the public. What I find amusing is that many of \nthe people who are most aggressive in their opposition to this bill for \nprivate industry were sponsors of the bill which does not have the \nprotections for people who work for the Government.\n  Look at this.\n  ``Workers can be required to participate in compensatory time as a \ncondition of employment.'' This goes to the comptime bill for State and \nlocal workers. ``Can be required to participate.'' Under my bill it is \nstrictly voluntary, and cannot be required.\n  The very sponsors of the bill which are complaining, saying there is \nnot enough volunteer choice here, cosponsored the bill for State and \nlocal employees which allows them to be required to participate as a \ncondition of employment. Under the State and local law, which was \nsponsored by the same opponents of the bill currently, ``management can \ndecide whether a worker must use comp time.'' Not so. ``Workers cannot \nbe coerced into using their comp time. Penalties are doubled for direct \nor indirect coercion'' under our bill.\n  It is important that people have choice. If someone were to try to \ncoerce a worker into using comptime, the worker would have to do but \none thing: Say, ``I want the money,'' because we allow for that second \nchoice. Until you actually use comptime under S. 4, you have the right \nto cash that time in at any time.\n  So you want the money? Just say you want the money. This is a \nstructural opportunity. This structural capacity to take the money \nmitigates against coercion.\n  ``Comptime is paid in cash only when a worker leaves the job.'' Under \nSenate 1570, Public Law 99-150, you have to quit if you are a State \ngovernment employee in order to get your pay in cash. We didn't think \nthat was enough protection. We thought that workers ought to have a \ndifferent protection than that. ``Comptime must be cashed out on the \nrequest of the employee,'' and ``must be cashed out at the end of the \nyear.''\n\n[[Page S5169]]\n\n  I just raise these issues as a means of saying that our effort is to \nmake this measure one which will provide a basis upon which people can \nspend time with their families, can arrange their work schedules, can \nmeet these competing demands of the workplace and the home place. And \nwe have sought to place not only legal inhibitors to coercion in the \nbill, we have also sought to put structural things in the bill--the \nright of the worker to cash out, just to say I want the money; I am \nentitled to it; give me the time-and-a-half, I want to take my money \ninstead of leaving the hours in the bank. That right is there all the \ntime. It never is extinguished.\n  The only way the right of the worker--there are two ways the right of \nthe worker to get that money out is extinguished. Two ways. The first \nis if the worker takes time off with pay. You would not expect to take \ntime off with pay and get paid time and a half for overtime. You cannot \nhave your cake and eat it.\n  The second way you do not have a right to cash out your employment is \nif you are going to get cashed out at the end of every year. At the end \nof every year the employer must give out the money. He cannot carry it \nover as comptime. So if the worker cannot be forced to take it as \ncomptime and at the end of the year the employer must give it out as \ncash, then the employer does not have any real incentive to try to get \npeople to work without, by saying they will take comptime instead of \npaying them overtime. A business is going to have to hold the cash \nready to pay it out at the end of the year, hold it ready to pay it out \nat the employee's request, at any time the worker says I have decided I \nwant the money instead of cash.\n  As I said to the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. President, I hope we \nwill be able to work to provide further assurance that we do not intend \nfor employers to be able to coerce or intimidate. This is a measure \nwhich I think would really affect people where they live. I have been \ngetting lots of letters from people around the country. This one says:\n\n       I'm writing this letter in regard to S. 4, the Family \n     Friendly Workplace Act. I ask that you support the bill as I \n     think it would be of great benefit to all the citizens of \n     this country. Time and again parents relate to me--\n\n  And this comes from a public school principal--\n\n     parents relate to me that they cannot come to school for \n     conferences or other meetings because they have to work. This \n     bill would seem to allow some flexibility in the workplace.\n\n  The principal knows the value of parents being able to come and \nparticipate in the child's education.\n  She also goes on to say:\n\n       I'm also the child of an elderly parent who needs constant \n     care. Many of my baby boomer friends are in the same \n     situation of caring for parents. A family friendly workplace \n     would relieve some of the worry and frustration of this \n     situation. Thank you for your time.\n\n  Here is a letter from a 25-year-old single mother of twin 2-year-old \ndaughters--A 25-year-old single mother of twin 2-year-old daughters. \nNow, this is the definition of having your hands full.\n\n       Recently I heard of your Family Friendly Workplace Act. My \n     employer, located in Carthage, MO, does not allow a flexible \n     work schedule or overtime. My understanding of this act is \n     that I would be able to have flexibility in my work schedule, \n     giving me the opportunity to make up work hours lost because \n     of illness in the family and doctor appointments.\n\n  She is right there. The employer would have the option of doing that.\n\n       As a 25-year-old single mother of twin 2-year-old \n     daughters, the Family Friendly Workplace Act would be \n     extremely beneficial to my situation.\n\n  Listen to her situation.\n\n       My children were born with a congenital heart disease and \n     they need to attend checkup appointments on a 3-month basis \n     with a cardiologist. These appointments have to allow a full \n     day since our specialist is in Springfield, MO, and \n     especially because both of my children attend the \n     appointments. Also, since my children have a heart \n     disease, they need special attention if they are ill. As a \n     single mother, it's very difficult to lose any days \n     financially.\n\n  Let me read that again.\n\n       As a single mother, it is very difficult to lose any days \n     financially.\n\n  Let me interrupt this letter for a moment. Now, you might say, well, \nthis woman can take time from Family and Medical Leave. I think she \ncould qualify for the serious medical problems that Family and Medical \nLeave may cover. But Family and Medical Leave makes you take the time \noff without pay. So here is this single mother, with twin 2-year-old \ndaughters with congenital heart disease, having to make regular doctor \nappointments and having to take a pay cut in order to take her kids to \nthe doctor, and she says:\n\n       My understanding of this act is that I will be able to have \n     the flexibility in my work schedule giving me the opportunity \n     to make up work hours lost because of illness in the family \n     and doctor appointments.\n\n  I can understand her desire to make those things up.\n\n       As a single mother--\n\n  She goes on to say--\n\n     it's very difficult to lose any days financially. The \n     opportunity to make up lost workdays would be incredibly \n     helpful. The Family Friendly Workplace Act would give me the \n     opportunity to take time off from work without the loss of \n     pay because of those days my children are ill or need to \n     attend a doctor's appointment.\n       Thank you for taking time to read my letter and your \n     consideration of the many working parents who would \n     appreciate such an act. Please go forward with the Family \n     Friendly Workplace Act.\n\n  Absent the Family Friendly Workplace Act, people like that have to \ntake family and medical leave, which is time off without pay.\n  Now, before the current occupant of the Chair came in, I went to the \nReport of the Commission on Family and Medical Leave. The Commission \nreport stated in order to make up for the pay cuts that people have to \nendure because they are not allowed to make up their salaries, they are \nnot allowed to bank flextime and they are not allowed to have banked \ncomptime--here is how they make up for those losses--28 percent have to \nborrow money; over 10 percent went on welfare when they took family and \nmedical leave; 42 percent put off paying bills.\n  Do you know what putting off paying your bills does for you? It \nincreases your payments. The interest goes up. You are paying for a \nlonger period of time. And it just occurs to me that we should not put \npeople in the position of having to take a pay cut in order to be a \ngood mom or dad in America. We should have a situation where we can \ngive people the option of working some time in advance and then using \nthat time, or when they have overtime required of them, putting that \ntime in a bank so they can take time and a half off at some later date. \nIt seems to me that makes a lot of sense.\n  Now, I do not understand how it is that those who oppose this bill \nsay this is a bill for a pay cut. This is not a pay cut. This is a way \nfor you to work time in advance so that when you need to take time off \nlater, you do not have to have a pay cut. You do not have to take \nFamily and Medical Leave time, which is unpaid leave. You can take \nflextime off or comptime off, or you could just cash in your flextime \nor comptime and have the money that you had earned earlier there to \nsustain you when you would be gone.\n  So the suggestion that this is a bill which provides for pay cuts I \nthink ignores the real facts of life. The real fact of life is that \nwhen you have your 25-year-old mother, single mother of twins going to \nthe doctor under Family and Medical Leave, she takes a pay cut. And \nthat pay cut is never restored. But if she had the ability to have \nflexible working arrangements, that would be a pay cut which she would \nnot have to endure.\n\n  I believe we do have a lot of agreement here. We agree that American \nfamilies need the opportunity for flexible working arrangements. S. 4 \nprovides the potential of flexible working arrangements to all the \nworkers in the culture.\n  Because the suggestions from the other side only address people who \ntraditionally work overtime, you are only talking about a third of the \npeople in the culture there. I think we ought to find a way to help all \nAmericans balance the needs that they have between their families and \nthe workplace, and we ought to look very carefully at the data from the \n1996 Current Population Survey which indicates that only 4.5 percent, \n4.5 percent of the private sector working working women report getting \nregular overtime. Even if you multiply it 4 or 5 times, get it up to 20 \npercent, get it up to 25 percent, multiply it by seven times or eight \ntimes,\n\n[[Page S5170]]\n\nget it up to 32 percent, you are still ignoring two-thirds of the \nindividuals in that population.\n  I think it is time for us to provide a way to accommodate the needs \nof families that respects all of the families in the United States of \nAmerica and does so without requiring them to take a pay cut, because, \nin my judgment, we should not be asking people to take pay cuts. We \nshould be providing people with ways that they can sustain their income \nand sustain their families in the same situation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I listened with great interest to my friend and \ncolleague. I will be glad over the evening to examine further that 4 \npercent of the workers, if I quote the Senator right, who regularly get \novertime and are women. We debated the increase in the minimum wage \nlast year going from $4.25 an hour up to $5.15 an hour, and we found \nout that two-thirds of them were women. I cannot believe that these are \nnot individuals who are working the overtime. Maybe we have a semantic \ndisagreement, but it is difficult for me to believe at this time that \nonly 4 percent of the overtime is being made by women in this country.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield for that.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The data which I cite was that only 4.5 percent of the \nworking women reported that they get overtime in a regular work period. \nThat is the data in the Current Population Survey.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have heard that and I will try to review over the \nevening what we have in terms of those regularly working overtime, how \nthose matters are defined, because it is virtually impossible for me to \nbelieve that the majority of the hourly workers are not women in our \nsociety. It is just very, very difficult. And that the majority of \novertime hours worked is not worked by women.\n  Now, Mr. President, I am someone who was here strongly in support of \nthe Family and Medical Leave Act. I supported the leadership that was \nprovided by my friend and colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, who \nis the real leader on this issue. When we proposed that legislation, we \ntried to start out with a limited program that provided pay for people \nwho used family and medical leave. Every other industrialized country \nin the world provides paid leave. We were absolutely stopped in our \ntracks by Republican opposition. Now we hear on the floor this \nafternoon, can you imagine, that someone who uses family and medical \nleave is going to have to go on welfare to use it. I wish we did \nprovide some financial help when workers use leave for the type of \nfamily emergency that the Senator has pointed out. Every other \nindustrialized society provides that kind of reimbursement. But we met \ntotal Republican opposition to that proposal. And American workers do \nnot get paid family and medical leave.\n  It is difficult for me to understand, with all respect to my \ncolleague, why it is worth more to that worker to work for compensatory \ntime so that they will be able to take the time off, should they be \ngiven the chance to use it, in looking after a sick child rather than \ngetting time and a half and putting the money in their pocket and \nhaving it in their pocket when that medical emergency happens. It seems \nto me that ought to be the choice that people would want to have. The \nSenator is saying, well, we are giving them a new opportunity. They can \nwork and not even put that money in their pocket. I don't find that \nvery convincing.\n\n  Mr. President, as the Senator has pointed out, we have mentioned \nFederal employees a number of times. I will just read the statute \ngoverning Federal employees. In this instance, the statute refers to \nflexible credit hours. In the Federal program, ``Credit hours means \nflexible schedule which are in excess of the employee's basic . . . and \nwhich the employee elects to work.'' The employee elects to work.\n  In the Senator's bill, it is the employer and the employee who \njointly designate hours. That is a big difference. I am all for Federal \nemployees making the decision, but I am not for S. 4, which provides \nthat the time off shall be permitted by the employer instead of the \nemployee. That is what it says. Time off shall be permitted by the \nemployer instead of the employee, for the employee to use within a \nreasonable period of time after making the request. The example that \nwas given by Senator Ashcroft is actually protected by the Democratic \nsubstitute bill.\n  In the substitute bill, it provides that if the time off is needed to \ncare for a sick child or other family member, the employee has an \nabsolute right to take the time. Put that in your bill, I say to the \nSenator; put that in your bill. Put it in this afternoon; put it in \nright now. We just heard that story. Put it in right now. Put in the \nother provision on nondiscrimination that you mentioned. \nDiscrimination, is it the same as coercion? Yes, it is; no, it isn't. \nPut in those words. Put in now just what I read here from my amendment; \nput that right in. If the time off is needed to care for a sick child \nor other family member, the employee has an absolute right to take the \ntime. That is not in the Ashcroft bill. That is not in the Ashcroft \nbill, and he cannot stand up on the floor of the U.S. Senate this \nafternoon and say it is.\n  So that parent out there who may be listening to this debate, read \nwhat is in the bill. You don't have the guarantee under his bill to use \nthe time for your desperately ill children. You do under the Democratic \nalternative. It is written right in there. If the time off is needed to \ncare for a sick child or other family member, the employee has an \nabsolute right to take the time. When the time is being used for other \nreasons, the employee can take the time if he or she has given 2 weeks \nadvance notice and the absence will not cause grievous injury to the \nbusiness. The presumption is in favor of the employee. That is not in \nthe Ashcroft bill.\n  That is the essence of this, after all is said and done, Mr. \nPresident. Those are really essential parts: whether we are going to \nrisk abolishing the 40-hour week, and the dangers that will take place \nwithout specifying that the employer cannot discriminate against those \nworkers who refuse to play ball with the employer, and that makes the \ndecision primarily a decision to be made by the employer. I think that \nis really the essence of the difference in our approaches.\n  I commend my colleagues on our side for studying this issue, for \nproviding the protection for all employees, giving the employee the \nkind of protections that they need to assure that comp time hours when \nused will be considered hours worked so they are not going to be \nshortchanged at the end of the week. These are the kind of protections \nthat exist for Federal employees. That protection was in our amendment. \nThat was rejected. That was rejected by our Republican friends in the \nmarkup. We have offered it. We will offer it again. We will have a \nchance to do that.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the chance for this debate and \ndiscussion. The conditions affecting working families in this country \nare enormously important. We have seen the assaults that have been made \non the earned-income tax credit.\n  We have seen the assaults that have been made with regard to \nincreasing the minimum wage.\n  We have seen assaults made in terms of some of the education programs \nin the last Congress.\n  And we have seen the assaults made in terms of the pay that goes to \nthose who work in the construction trades, who average $28,000 a year, \nprotections in terms of the prevailing wage not being undermined.\n\n  These are all working families in this country. It doesn't seem they \nhave too much protection. They have, in many instances, too little. I \nbelieve that this proposal will substantially reduce the amount of \novertime that is paid to workers who are willing to work hard, play by \nthe rules, and try to make that little extra money to be able to \nprovide for their families.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my colleague from \nMassachusetts for engaging in this debate. I think it is important to \ndo that, to refine what we are talking about, to learn what works and \nwhat won't work and learn where we might need to modify what we are \ndoing. I am eager to\n\n[[Page S5171]]\n\nhave amendments offered by those individuals who want to change this \nproposal, and I think we will be getting to that very shortly, and I am \ngrateful.\n  I just point out that he indicated that the situation with the mother \nof twin 2-year-old daughters would be covered under the Democratic \nproposal. Her company doesn't provide for overtime. Her company just \ndoesn't ask people to work overtime, and the Democratic proposal simply \ndoesn't address the needs of the vast majority of individuals in the \ncountry who don't get overtime. I think we need to do that. There are \nlots of companies who just don't do it. They can't afford for their \nlabor costs to go up by 50 percent by having overtime, so they hire \nenough workers, schedule enough people, pay enough benefits.\n  But this young mother says, ``My company doesn't schedule overtime.'' \nSo the only way for her to have the capacity to develop the ability to \nserve her daughters without taking a pay cut would be if we had some \nkind of flextime proposal similar to the one offered in the U.S. \nGovernment to Federal employees. It has worked well here. As a matter \nof fact, 10 to 1 the workers say it is very, very good. The General \nAccounting Office, which assesses whether things work or don't work in \nthe Federal Government, indicate because people have the kind of \nflexibility they need, these workers in the Federal Government are more \nproductive and their morale is better. I think that would be the same \nkind of thing in which private employers would want to engage. They \nwould want to help their workers be more productive, have better \nmorale, and extend to them the same kind of benefits that are available \nto Federal employees.\n  You may just say all the various things you want to say about this, \nbut there are a couple key facts. It is totally voluntary, and not only \ndo you have your first choice, but you have your second choice. If you \nchoose to bank some hours and then you choose to cash them in later, \nyou can cash them in. So your first choice is whether or not to put \nhours in the bank instead of taking the pay. But any time later, before \nyou take the hours off, you can cash them in. That is choice No. 2. \nThis isn't a plan that is just characterized by choice, this is a plan \ncharacterized by choice squared. This is two choices, and I believe in \nthis case two choices are better than one because they provide \ninsurance.\n  Second, it is a plan which would give people an opportunity to take \ntime off without taking a pay cut, and that is something that we need. \nIt is a plan that would deal with all the work force in the country, \nnot just the few who regularly get, or with some frequency get, \novertime pay. In my judgment, those are very important components, and \nI think given the fact there is substantial agreement about the needs--\nand I don't think anybody will come to us and really say the needs are \nfocused only on people who get overtime in their work--it is pretty \nclear that people who don't get overtime, their kids have problems, \nthey have the needs for the parent-teacher conferences, just like other \nfolks, and I think it is time now to work together.\n  I hope the amendments will begin to be brought to the floor, and we \nwill vote on these amendments. I am not in favor of curtailing the \namount of time available to this bill. I think we ought to run this \nthrough the series of proposals, and the Senator has been kind enough \nto mention a number of them, that apparently will be coming forth. \nFrankly, we are going to be working this evening and into the day \ntomorrow to try and make sure if there are misunderstandings or \nclarifications that can be the basis for agreements, that we will \nprovide those. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, before yielding the floor, I thank my \ncolleague for a very positive and constructive approach on this \nlegislation. We certainly want to try and find out what possibilities \nthere are, but he certainly has indicated a willingness to consider \ndifferent alternatives, and I thank him very much for the interesting \ndebate and for his willingness to try and find common ground. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 4, the Family \nFriendly Workplace Act. I was proud to be an original cosponsor of this \nbill when it was introduced. I commend Senator Ashcroft, for his \nleadership as the principal author of the bill, and Chairman Jeffords, \nfor guiding it through the Labor and Human Resources Committee.\n  In a word, this bill is about freedom. Mothers, and fathers and their \nfamilies, need more freedom in the workplace--more flexibility in \nbalancing the demands of work and family.\n  What has the Federal Government all too often given them instead?\n  Rules and regulations that are rigid, arbitrary, and one-size-fits \nall.\n  Increasingly over the last 60 years, Federal employment law has \nreflected the paternalistic attitude of a government that thinks it \nknows more about work-and-family needs than do the families and workers \nthemselves.\n  The apologists of the failed regulatory state will argue that freedom \nis something granted to the people by the Government; and that freedom \nis a zero-sum game. For instance, you can't give employees more \nflexibility without creating an entitlement at the expense of the \nemployer.\n  They will offer amendments to this bill next week, asking us to \nimpose more legal straitjackets on workers and employers. We should \nreject those amendments and opt, instead, for freedom for our workers \nand their families.\n  This bill shows how Government, in its zeal to regulate, has failed \nour families; and how maintaining basic labor standards, while adding a \nlittle dose of freedom and flexibility, will create a win-win situation \nfor employees and employers.\n  This bill does not create a right or grant an entitlement. It does \nnot take away from a single worker or employer. It simply removes an \nobvious example of overkill--of the Government acting as the national \nnanny. It gives back to workers and their families some of the freedom \nthat was taken away when an earlier Congress went too far in regulating \nthe workplace.\n  This bill restores employee choice in an area where, for most private \nsector workers, the Government had taken it away from them. It allows \nthe employee to arrange flexible work schedules to meet important \nfamily needs. It allows the employee the choice between one kind of \novertime compensation or another. The employee will still receive time-\nand-a-half compensation for overtime. Only now the employee will have \nthe freedom to negotiate when and how.\n  The apologists of the regulatory state want to expand Federal control \nover the lives of workers and their families:\n  They want the Federal Government, increasingly, to become the \npersonnel manager for every workplace, and the collective bargaining \nagent for every worker.\n  They want the Federal Government to decide a family's priorities for \ntaking time off. But what qualifies Washington, DC, to choose a parent-\nteacher conference, yes; but the school science fair, no? Dentist \nappointment, yes; but going to the DMV, no? Some kinds of elder care, \nyes; versus other kinds, no?\n  And you have to take a pay cut if you take their Government-approved \nleave, because the entitlement mandated under the Family and Medical \nLeave Act is unpaid leave.\n  They want Congress to say to employers with 25 to 49 workers: In 1993 \nwe thought you were a small business. In 1993 we said you didn't have \nthe economies for scale to afford federally mandated leave. Now we \nthink you're a big business and we want to run your employees' benefit \npackage.\n  Public employees have the freedom and flexibility that this bill \nwould extend to private sector workers. Flextime and comptime have \nworked for public employees. These arrangements are overwhelmingly \npopular with the workers who have been eligible for them.\n  Now is the time to pull back a little on the long arm of big brother. \nNow is the time to give back some of the workplace freedom that \nprevious Congresses took away.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5172]]\n\n                            DISASTER RELIEF\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was interested in listening to the \ndebate of my colleagues, and this is, indeed, an important issue and it \nis very important to understand what are the facts, what precisely is \nbeing proposed and how exactly will it affect workers in our country. I \nexpect in the coming days that we will hear a great deal more about \nthis, see amendments and have votes. We already had one cloture vote on \nthis issue as the Presiding Officer knows. I came to the floor, \nhowever, just to visit a few moments about the disaster relief bill, \nthe supplemental appropriations bill that we will be dealing with this \nweek in Congress.\n  As my colleagues know, the Congress left for a Memorial Day recess, \nwhich was all of last week, without having passed the supplemental \nappropriations bill or the disaster bill, as we refer to it, because \nthe legislation contains a substantial amount of money to respond to \nthe disasters that occurred in our part of the country; namely, the \nblizzards and the flooding and the fires that occurred in North and \nSouth Dakota and Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, I spent all of last week in North Dakota. Most \nAmericans, having watched for a couple of weeks the disaster that \noccurred, especially along the Red River Valley and most especially in \nGrand Forks, ND, and East Grand Forks, MN, remember the images of the \nmassive flooding that occurred that caused the evacuation of a city of \n50,000 people on the North Dakota side of the border and the evacuation \nof 9,000 people from East Grand Forks on the Minnesota side of the \nborder.\n  The American people saw this flood that consumed the Red River \nValley, a small red river which flows north became a lake 150 miles \nlong by nearly 20 and 30 miles wide in parts of it. Of course, \nchanneling it through the communities of Wahpeton, Fargo, and \neventually Grand Forks was successful until it got to Grand Forks, and \nthen the dikes breached and the town of Grand Forks and East Grand \nForks became almost totally flooded and both communities were totally \nevacuated.\n  In the middle of that evacuation, a fire broke out in downtown Grand \nForks and destroyed 11 of the larger buildings in downtown Grand Forks, \nND. Firefighters were fighting fire in water that was terribly cold, \nwater up to their chest, standing in the streets, trying to fight fires \nin nearly three city blocks in downtown Grand Forks, ND.\n  The story is well known that the folks in Grand Forks and East Grand \nForks left town, many of them with only the shirts on their backs. They \nwere housed in aircraft hangars at the Grand Forks Air Force Base, \n4,000 people originally sleeping on cots and hangars at the Air Force \nbase, and people all around the region taking families in, living with \nrelatives, doing all the things necessary because they have lost their \nhomes and had to find somewhere to go.\n  That occurred weeks ago, and the Congress began working on a disaster \nrelief bill. President Clinton went to Grand Forks and East Grand Forks \nin the middle of the flooding. I went with President Clinton on that \nvisit. He proposed $100 million in community development block grants \nand other substantial aid through FEMA and other Federal agencies. We \nadded to that.\n\n  And my colleagues here in the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, \nconstructed a disaster relief bill that was very significant and very \nimportant for the recovery of that region. Regrettably, the Congress \nwas not able to agree on the bill and left for the Memorial Day recess.\n  Among the areas in this legislation that caused some difficulty is an \namendment dealing with a Government shutdown issue that has nothing to \ndo with this bill but nonetheless will engender a Presidential veto. \nThe President has already indicated he could not sign a bill even a \ndisaster bill if it included a controversial amendment like this. So, \nthat is where we left it as we left town about a week and a half ago.\n  I was in Grand Forks, ND, last week. And here is an editorial from \nthe Minot Daily News that describes what I saw as well. It talks about \nthe biggest mess in history in North Dakota.\n  Garbage is almost everywhere--talking about Grand Forks--thousands of \npiles several feet high--crumbled drywall and brickwork, water-damaged \nappliances and furniture and anything else that could be hauled out to \nthe curb and beyond. Streets that were once wide enough to accommodate \ntwo-way traffic and a row of parked cars are now so narrow as to permit \nonly one vehicle at a time.\n  What I saw in Grand Forks, which is a very pretty city, was every \nsingle street of that community lined with garbage, having been pulled \nout of all of these homes that were inundated, basements, first floors, \nand in some cases the entire homes inundated by flood water. And now it \nis all taken out to the curb as they are starting to try to clean up.\n  I was down in one part of Grand Forks where I had previously traveled \nby Coast Guard boat where the homes were totally submerged in water. \nAnd our boat was going at the top of the home level on water. I was \nback there last week, and the water is gone and these homes are totally \ndestroyed--600 of them in this area, 600 homes totally destroyed having \nbeen totally under water and the homes were picked up off their \nfoundation and set back. I saw a home sitting on top of a car, a home \ntaken completely off its foundation by the flood water, and then put \nback down on top of an old Ford car.\n  But you go up and down the street, and what you saw was carnage, \nhomes completely destroyed. And the folks who lived there are folks \nwho, in many cases, have lived there many years and are now wondering \nwhat to do.\n  There was a man and his wife in their seventies standing in the front \nyard surveying this home they lived in. And I walked across the street \nand visited with them a bit and asked, ``How long had you lived in this \nhome?'' ``Forty-three years,'' they told me. And the woman said, ``In \n43 years we never even had a drop of water in our basement.'' And now \nof course the home is totally destroyed. ``What will you do?'' I asked \nher. ``We are living in a little recreation vehicle, one of these \nlittle travel trailers that has been provided, but we have no idea what \nwe will do next--no idea. No idea where we will live.''\n  They have no idea when their house will be bought out to be part of \nthe flood line, the new floodway that is being created in Grand Forks; \nthey have no idea what will be paid for this house in order to create \nthe floodway. ``We don't know what our future is going to be.'' But \ninterestingly enough, these folks still had that spirit I guess that \nexists up in the Scandinavian areas of North Dakota.\n  I put my arm around the shoulders of this wonderful woman and finally \nsaid at the end, ``How are you doing?'' She said, ``Oh, pretty good, \npretty good.'' They lost their home of 43 years, but she said she's \ndoing ``pretty good''. Well, I know they are going through a lot of \ndifficulty, as are most families, thousands and thousands of families \nin Grand Forks and East Grand Forks.\n  Alice Hoglo owned a home on Dike Street in East Grand Forks for 56 \nyears. She is now living with relatives waiting to see what is going to \nhappen to her home. And her home is nearly completely destroyed.\n  And 90-year-old Ann Sticklemyer, she has said she is now going to be \na renter. She has not rented for decades, but of course now she has \nlost her home and is going to have to find a place to rent. But there \nis nowhere to rent. There are no homes available to rent, no apartments \nto rent, nothing available for housing in Grand Forks.\n  The list goes on, and it is endless of the families and the people \nwho are struggling now to try to figure out: What do you do after the \nflood has come and gone? Where do we live? What do we do? I mean, when \nI was there on a boat in downtown Grand Forks surveying the damage in \nGrand Forks, that was one thing because the water then was so high that \nyou could not possibly walk in it, but now the water is gone and all \nyou have is this wreckage--hundreds and hundreds of homes totally and \ncompletely destroyed and families who previously lived in those homes \nnow have nowhere to live. Oh, some are living with relatives, some are \n100 miles or 200 miles away living in a motel. Some are living with \nstrangers who invited them in. But they have nowhere to live.\n  And so the city of Grand Forks and the city of East Grand Forks \nstruggle now to try to figure out, how do you put all this back \ntogether? How do you restart a business community that is\n\n[[Page S5173]]\n\nshut down? How do you build a new downtown when the new floodway will \nprobably take several critical blocks of your downtown area? How do you \ndo all of that?\n  Well, you do it with the resources that were in this disaster bill, \nthe hundreds of millions of dollars of community development block \ngrants and other things that will allow people to get back on their \nfeet and allow cities to begin planning to buy out homes in the \nfloodway, to help provide some grants, yes, to homeowners to fix up \ntheir homes and to restart their business.\n  When Congress left without passing the disaster bill, some said it \ndid not matter. But the folks in Grand Forks were very upset. And here \nis a Grand Forks editorial. Every day the top of their editorial page \nhas this: ``8 Days Since Congress Let Us Down.'' How much longer will \nit be before Congress gets to work and passes a disaster bill? The next \nday: ``9 Days Since Congress Let Us Down.''\n  Congress is not going to let Grand Forks and East Grand Forks down. \nThese resources are going to be made available. But it is urgent they \nbe made available now. It is urgent that Wednesday, when we go to \nconference, that we strip out the controversial provisions of this \nlegislation and that we pass the legislation, pass the emergency \nportion of the legislation, at least, clean and get it to the President \nfor signature so the help can be flowing to people who need it.\n  Another headline in the Grand Forks Herald, ``Along the Dikes Lives \nare Still on Hold.'' And it talks about these folks who have no idea \nwhat their tomorrow is going to be because the resources that are \nneeded in order to make the buyouts and to develop the new floodways \nand so on are not available at this point because the legislation has \nnot yet been passed.\n  I just hope that on Wednesday when the conference committee convenes, \nthat the conference committee and all of the conferees will decide that \nwe ought not in any way impede, delay, or derail the disaster bill. We \nhave not in the past, and we should not now.\n  I wish the disaster bill had been enacted by Congress before Congress \nbroke for the Memorial Day weekend and the week that we took off. That \nwas not possible regrettably. I think the decision to go home without \npassing the disaster portion of that bill was a mistake. But those who \nmade that decision apparently felt comfortable with it. I do hope now \nthat this Wednesday when the conference committee reconvenes that it \nwill decide to enact this legislation, do it cleanly, do it without \nadding additional burdens to it that would engender a Presidential \nveto, and then make that critically needed relief available to the \npeople who so desperately need it.\n  While I am on this subject, let me end with one other point. In the \nSenate, on a bipartisan basis, we have had enormously helpful support \nfrom Senator Stevens, Senator Byrd, Senator Lott, Senator Daschle, on a \nbipartisan basis. We have had strong support and unwavering support \nfrom virtually all of the subcommittee chairs and the ranking members \nof the Appropriations Committee. And for that we are most appreciative. \nWe know that we cannot do in alone.\n\n  North Dakotans, who were dealt a very severe blow by having nearly 3 \nyears worth of snow fall in 3 months on North Dakota, causing a massive \namount of flooding, a 500-year flood on the Red River, and causing the \ncomplete evacuation of very large cities, we know that we cannot solve \nthese problems alone. And we are very thankful for the bipartisan \nsupport we have had in the Senate to address these issues.\n  I again urge all of those who come to conference in the middle of \nthis week to join us in and pass this bill and do it cleanly and \nquickly so that the people of Grand Forks are able to rely on the \nresources in this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/02/senate-section/article/S5158-5", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5173-S5174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE OKLAHOMA CITY TRIAL AND THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make one additional comment on \nanother matter. I notice the Senator from Idaho is waiting for the \nfloor. I will not be lengthy, but I do want to make a comment on \nanother unrelated issue.\n  I and the American people have learned this afternoon that the trial \nin Denver, CO, the Oklahoma City bombing trial, has concluded \napparently with a guilty verdict on all counts, having been brought \nagainst Timothy McVeigh. There are many in this country, myself \nincluded, who from time to time have been critical of the judicial \nprocess feeling that in one case or another or in one circumstance or \nanother the judicial system has let us down.\n  In fact, I think most Americans probably felt that way following the \nO.J. Simpson trial, that somehow the judicial system did not work quite \nright, and understand why people feel that way and, as I said, I have \nfrom time to time joined them thinking that some things just do not \nseem right in the judicial system.\n  But it seems to me that the decision in the Denver courtroom today \nshould say to all of us that the judicial system in this country does \nwork, the message today in that courtroom was a message that seems to \nme that those who commit heinous acts of terror will be brought to \njustice in this country. And I wanted to simply say, having heard of \nthis verdict as most Americans have today, that I would credit and \ncompliment the men and women who most Americans will never know who \nundoubtedly spent a lot of time and energy and effort and hours working \non this case, to bring this case to a courtroom that results in a \nguilty verdict.\n  I can recall the day that I heard of this bombing. I was walking into \na school in Minot, ND, to speak to a convocation at the school, and I \nhave heard the reports of the bulletins on the radio that there had \nbeen this bombing at the courthouse in Oklahoma City. And I did not \nknow until later the full consequence of it. But I will never, I \nsuspect, in my lifetime, forget the picture of the fireman cradling the \nlifeless body of that young child, a victim of that disaster, that \nheinous act of terror, a disaster, but also obviously a deliberate \nheinous act committed against innocent civilians. And I felt the same \nrage I suppose most Americans do and did about that kind of senseless \nkilling.\n  I hope that the verdict today in that courtroom in Denver is a \nverdict that says to all those in this country who believe they are \nabove the law, who believe that acts of terror somehow will work, that \nthis country will not countenance terror, this country will hunt down \nand prosecute vigorously those who commit terror against Americans and \nagainst all citizens.\n  I did want to simply take this moment to say that I suspect that \nthere was an enormous amount of effort and work expended by a lot of \nfolks to bring this trial to a successful conclusion and I, as one \nSenator, say thank you to the law enforcement community, and thank you \nto all of those who participated in restoring the faith of the American \npeople in the justice system.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that \nthe emergency declared with respect to the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), as expanded to address the actions \nand policies of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the \nterritory that they control within the Republic of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, is to continue in effect beyond May 30, 1997.\n  On December 27, 1995, I issued Presidential Determination No. 96-7, \ndirecting the Secretary of the Treasury, inter alia, to suspend the \napplication of sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia \n(Serbia and Montenegro) and to continue to block property previously \nblocked until provision is made to address claims or encumbrances, \nincluding the claims of the other successor states of the former \nYugoslavia. This sanctions relief, in conformity with United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution 1022 of November 22, 1995 (hereinafter the \n``Resolution''), was an essential factor motivating Serbia and \nMontenegro's acceptance of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in \nBosnia and Herzegovina initialed by the parties in Dayton on November \n21, 1995, and signed in Paris on December 14, 1995 (hereinafter the \n``Peace Agreement''). The sanctions imposed on the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) were accordingly suspended \nprospectively, effective January 16, 1996. Sanctions imposed on the \nBosnian Serb forces and authorities and on the territory that they \ncontrol within the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina were subsequently \nsuspended prospectively, effective May 10, 1996, also in conformity \nwith the Peace Agreement and the Resolution.\n  Sanctions against both the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \nMontenegro) and the Bosnian Serbs were subsequently terminated by \nUnited Nations Security Council Resolution 1074 of October 1, 1996. \nThis termination, however, did not end the requirement of the \nResolution that blocked funds and assets that are subject to claims and \nencumbrances remain blocked, until unblocked in accordance with \napplicable law. In the last year, substantial progress has been \nachieved to bring about a settlement of the conflict in the former \nYugoslavia acceptable to the parties. Elections occurred in the \nRepublic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as provided for in the Peace \nAgreement, and the Bosnian Serb forces have continued to respect the \nzones of separation as provided in the Peace Agreement. The ultimate \ndisposition of the various remaining categories of blocked assets are \nnow being addressed, beginning with the unblocking of five Yugoslav \nvessels located in various United States ports effective May 19, 1997.\n  Until the status of all remaining blocked property is resolved, the \nPeace Agreement implemented, and the terms of the Resolution met, this \nsituation continues to pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary \nthreat to the national security, foreign policy interests, and the \neconomy of the United States. For these reasons, I have determined that \nit is necessary to maintain in force these emergency authorities beyond \nMay 30, 1997.\n                                                  William J.

President Bush took additional measures to prohibit \ntrade and other transactions with the Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia \nand Montenegro) by Executive Orders 12810 and 12831, issued on June 5, \n1992, and January 15, 1993, respectively.\n  On April 25, 1993, I issued Executive Order 12846, blocking the \nproperty and interests in property of all commercial, industrial, or \npublic utility undertakings or entities organized or located in the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) (the ``FRY \n(S)''), and prohibiting trade-related transactions by United States \npersons involving those areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina \ncontrolled by the Bosnian Serb forces and the United Nations Protected \nAreas in the Republic of Croatia. On October 24, 1994, because of the \nactions and policies of the Bosnian Serbs, I expanded the scope of the \nnational emergency by issuance of Executive Order 12934 to block the \nproperty of the Bosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the \nterritory that they control within the Republic of Bosnia and \nHerzegovina, as well as the property of any entity organized or located \nin, or controlled by any person in, or resident in, those areas.\n  On November 22, 1995, the United Nations Security Council passed \n(``Resolution 1022''), immediately and indefinitely suspending economic \nsanctions against the FRY (S). Sanctions were subsequently lifted by \nthe United Nations Security Council pursuant to Resolution 1074 on \nOctober 1, 1996. Resolution 1022, however, continues to provide for the \nrelease of funds and assets previously blocked pursuant to sanctions \nagainst the FRY (S), provided that such funds and assets that are \nsubject to claims and encumbrances, or that are the property of persons \ndeemed insolvent, remain blocked until ``released in accordance with \napplicable law.'' This provision was implemented in the United States \non December 27, 1995, by Presidential Determination No. 96-7. The \nDetermination, in conformity with Resolution 1022, directed the \nSecretary of the Treasury, inter alia, to suspend the application of \nsanctions imposed on the FRY (S) pursuant to the above-referenced \nExecutive orders and to continue to block property previously blocked \nuntil provision is made to address claims or encumbrances, including \nthe claims of the other successor states of the former Yugoslavia. This \nsanctions relief was an essential factor motivating Serbia and \nMontenegro's acceptance of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in \nBosnia and Herzegovina initialed by the parties in Dayton on November \n21, 1995 (the ``Peace Agreement'') and signed in Paris on December 14, \n1995. The sanctions imposed on the FRY (S) and on the United Nations \nProtected Areas in the Republic of Croatia were accordingly suspended \nprospectively, effective January 16, 1996. Sanctions imposed on the \nBosnian Serb forces and authorities and on the territory that they \ncontrol within the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina were subsequently \nsuspended prospectively, effective May 10, 1996, in conformity with \nUNSCR 1022. On October 1, 1996, the United Nations passed UNSCR 1074, \nterminating U.N. sanctions against the FRY (S) and the Bosnian Serbs \nin light of the elections that took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina on \nSeptember 14, 1996. UNSCR 1074, however, reaffirms the provisions of \nUNSCR 1022 with respect to the release of blocked assets, as set forth \nabove.\n  The present report is submitted pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1641(c) and \n1703(c) and covers the period from November 30, 1996, through May 29, \n1997. It discusses Administration actions and expenses directly related \nto the exercise of powers and authorities conferred by the declaration \nof a national emergency in Executive Order 12808 as expanded with \nrespect to the Bosnian Serbs in Executive Order 12934, and against the \nFRY (S) contained in Executive Orders 12810, 12831, and 12846.\n\n  1. The declaration of the national emergency on May 30, 1992, was \nmade pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the \nConstitution and laws of the United States, including the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), and section 301 of title 3 of \nthe United States Code. The emergency declaration was reported to the \nCongress on May 30, 1992, pursuant to section 204(b) of the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1703(b)) and the \nexpansion of that national emergency under the same authorities was \nreported to the Congress on October 25, 1994. The additional sanctions \nset forth in related Executive orders were imposed pursuant to the \nauthority vested in the President by the Constitution and laws of the \nUnited States, including the statutes cited above, section 1114 of the \nFederal Aviation Act (49 U.S.C. App. 1514), and section 5 of the United \nNations Participation Act (22 U.S.C. 287c).\n  2. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), acting under \nauthority delegated by the Secretary of the Treasury, implemented the \nsanctions imposed under the foregoing statutes in the Federal Republic \nof Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and Bosnian Serb-Controlled Areas \nof the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina Sanctions Regulations, 31 \nC.F.R. Part 585 (the ``Regulations''). To implement Presidential \nDetermination No. 967, the Regulations were amended to authorize \nprospectively all transactions with respect to the FRY (S) otherwise \nprohibited (61 FR 1282, January 19, 1996). Property and interests in \nproperty of the FRY (S) previously blocked within the jurisdiction of \nthe United States remain blocked, in conformity with the Peace \nAgreement and UNSCR 1022, until provision is made to address claims or \nencumbrances, including the claims of the other successor states of the \nformer Yugoslavia.\n  On May 10, 1996, OFAC amended the Regulations to authorize \nprospectively all transactions with respect to the Bosnian Serbs \notherwise prohibited, except with respect to property previously \nblocked (61 FR 24696, May 16, 1996). On December 4, 1996, OFAC amended \nAppendices A and B to 31 C.F.R. chapter V, containing the names of \nentities and individuals in alphabetical order and by location that are \nsubject to the various economic sanctions programs administered by \nOFAC, to remove the entries for individuals and entities that were \ndetermined to be acting for or on behalf of the Government of the \nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). These assets \nwere blocked on the basis of these persons' activities in support of \nthe FRY (S)--activities no longer prohibited--not because the \nGovernment of the FRY (S) or entities located in or controlled from \nthe FRY (S) had any interest in those assets (61 FR 64289, December \n4, 1996). A copy of the amendment is attached to this report.\n  On April 18, 1997, the Regulations were amended by adding a new \nsection 585.528, authorizing all transactions after 30 days with \nrespect to the following vessels that remained blocked pursuant to the \nRegulations, effective at 10:00 a.m. local time in the location of the \nvessel on May 19, 1997: the M/V MOSLAVINA, M/V ZETA, M/V LOVCEN, M/V \nDURMITOR and M/V BAR (a/k/a M/V INVIKEN) (62 FR 19672, April 23, 1997). \nDuring the 30-day period, United States persons were authorized to \nnegotiate settlements of their outstanding claims with respect to the \nvessels with the vessels' owners or agents and were generally licensed \nto seek and obtain judicial warrants of maritime arrest. If claims \nremained unresolved 10 days prior to the vessels' unblocking (May 8, \n1997), service of the warrants could be effected at that time through \nthe United States Marshal's Office in the district where the vessel was \nlocated to ensure that United States creditors of a vessel had the \nopportunity to assert their claims. Appendix C to 31 CFR, chapter V, \ncontaining the names of vessels blocked pursuant to the various \neconomic sanctions programs administered by OFAC (61 FR\n\n[[Page S5176]]\n\n32936, June 26, 1996), was also amended to remove these vessels from \nthe list effective May 19, 1997. A copy of the amendment is attached to \nthis report.\n\n  3. Over the past year, the Departments of State and the Treasury have \nworked closely with European Union member states and other U.N. member \nnations to implement the provisions of UNSCR 1022. In the United \nStates, retention of blocking authority pursuant to the extension of a \nnational emergency provides a framework for administration of an \norderly claims settlement. This accords with past policy and practice \nwith respect to the suspension of sanctions regimes.\n  4. During this reporting period, OFAC issued seven specific licenses \nregarding transactions pertaining to the FRY (S) or assets it owns or \ncontrols. Specific licenses have been issued (1) to authorize the \nunblocking of certain funds and other financial assets previously \nblocked; (2) for the payment of crews' wages, vessel maintenance, and \nemergency supplies for FRY (S)--controlled ships blocked in the \nUnited States; and (3) to authorize performance of certain transactions \nunder pre-sanctions contracts.\n  During the past 6 months, OFAC has continued to oversee the \nmaintenance of blocked accounts and records with respect to: (1) \nliquidated tangible assets and personality of the 15 blocked United \nStates subsidiaries of entities organized in the (S); (2) the blocked \npersonality, files, and records of the two Serbian banking institutions \nin New York previously placed in secure storage; (3) remaining tangible \nproperty, including real estate; and (4) the 5 Yugoslav-owned vessels \nrecently unblocked in the United States.\n  5. Despite the prospective authorization of transactions with the FRY \n(S), OFAC has continued to work closely with the United States \nCustoms Service and other cooperating agencies to investigate alleged \nviolations that occurred while sanctions were in force.\n  Since my last report, OFAC has collected six civil monetary penalties \ntotaling nearly $39,000 for violations of the sanctions. These \nviolations included prohibited imports, exports, contract dealings, and \npayments to the Government of the FRY (S), persons in the FRY (S), \nor to blocked entities owned or controlled by the FRY (S).\n  6. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from November 30, 1996, through May 29, 1997, that are directly \nattributable to the declaration of a national emergency with respect to \nthe FRY (S) and the Bosnian Serb forces and authorities are estimated \nat approximately $400,000, most of which represents wage and salary \ncosts for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely centered in \nthe Department of the Treasury (particularly in OFAC and its Chief \nCounsel's Office, and the United States Customs Service), the \nDepartment of State, the National Security Council, and the Department \nof Commerce.\n  7. In the last year and a half, substantial progress has been \nachieved to bring about a settlement of the conflict in the former \nYugoslavia acceptable to the parties. UNSCR 1074 terminates sanctions \nin view of the first free and fair elections to occur in the Republic \nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, as provided for in the Peace Agreement. In \nreaffirming Resolution 1022, however, UNSCR 1074 contemplates the \ncontinued blocking of assets potentially subject to conflicting claims \nand encumbrances until provision is made to address them under \napplicable law, including claims of the other successor states of the \nformer Yugoslavia.\n  The resolution of the crisis and conflict in the former Yugoslavia \nthat has resulted from the actions and policies of the Government of \nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), and of the \nBosnian Serb forces and the authorities in the territory that they \ncontrol, will not be complete until such time as the Peace Agreement is \nimplemented and the terms of UNSCR 1022 have been met. Therefore, I \nhave continued for another year the national emergency declared on May \n30, 1992, as expanded in scope on October 25, 1994, and will continue \nto enforce the measures adopted pursuant thereto.\n  I shall continue to exercise the powers at my disposal with respect \nto the measures against the Government of the Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), and the Bosnian Serb forces, civil \nauthorities, and entities, as long as these measures are appropriate, \nand will continue to report periodically to the Congress on significant \ndevelopments pursuant to 50 U.S.C. 1703(c).\n                                                  William J.

The program is authorized by title V of the Trade \nAct of 1974, as amended.\n  Pursuant to title V, I have determined that Cambodia should be \ndesignated as a least developed beneficiary developing country under \nthe GSP program because it has taken steps to improve worker rights and \nthe protection of intellectual property. I have also determined, as a \nresult of the 1995 Annual Review of petitions for changes that three \nproducts should be added to the GSP list of eligible products and that \nthe competitive need limits on 22 products should be waived. As a \nresult of a review of 1996 imports of GSP products, I have determined \nthat de minimis limits on 79 products be waived and 11 products, whose \nimports no longer exceed the program's competitive need limits, should \nbe redesignated as GSP eligible. Finally as a result of certain \nprovisions of the legislation enacted in August 1996 reauthorizing GSP, \nI am granting GSP eligibility to an additional 1,783 articles not \npreviously included under GSP, provided that they are imported directly \nfrom the least developed beneficiary developing countries.\n  This notice is submitted in accordance with the requirements of title \nV of the Trade Act of 1974.\n                                                  William J.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Arizona; to\n\n[[Page S5179]]\n\n     the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                     House Concurrent Memorial 2005\n\n       Whereas, agriculture in the State of Arizona represents a \n     $6.2 billion industry; and\n       Whereas, wheat production, a $90 million industry in \n     Arizona, plays an important role in maintaining the fertility \n     and efficiency of Arizona's soils; and\n       Whereas, Arizona wheat producers have developed a $35 \n     million durum wheat seed industry that supplies customers \n     around the world; and\n       Whereas, the discovery of the Karnal bunt fungus in Arizona \n     in March 1996 has affected not only Arizona's wheat industry \n     but all of the state's related agricultural commodities, \n     including livestock and dairy; and\n       Whereas, while Karnal bunt affects grain quality, it does \n     not present a direct risk to human health or livestock; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Agriculture has \n     implemented a quarantine on the state of Arizona, restricting \n     the interstate movement not only of wheat but also of other \n     regulated articles such as wheat conveyors, grain elevators \n     and related equipment; and\n       Whereas, nine other states have discovered Karnal bunt \n     spores in their wheat and have not been quarantined to the \n     extent that Arizona has been; and\n       Whereas, the American Phytopathological Society has stated \n     its opposition to a ``zero tolerance'' requirement for Karnal \n     bunt seed spores, suggesting that Karnal bunt is a minor \n     disease that can be effectively managed without the use of \n     quarantines. The Society believes that this and similar \n     diseases can be satisfactorily controlled by seed-treatment \n     chemicals, resistant varieties and the use of cultural \n     practices; and\n       Whereas, the United States cannot declare itself as free of \n     Karnal bunt for international trading purposes as long as \n     even a single state reports the presence of this disease. A \n     finding of Karnal bunt in any state could unfairly result in \n     the restriction of all wheat from the United States, even \n     that produced and imported from an unaffected area of the \n     nation.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       1. That the Congress of the United States instruct the \n     United States Department of Agriculture to establish \n     reasonable, science-based standards by which wheat growers in \n     the United States can market wheat and other grain products \n     that contain Karnal bunt.\n       2. That the United States Department of Agriculture sponsor \n     an international meeting of scientists to evaluate the \n     management of Karnal bunt and other fungi and to reevaluate \n     international policies on the use of quarantine that inhibit \n     free trade.\n       3. That the Secretary of State of the State of Arizona \n     transmit copies of this memorial to the President of the \n     Senate of the United States, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives of the United States, the Secretary of the \n     United States Department of Agriculture and each Member of \n     the Arizona Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-53. A joint resolution adopted by legislators of the \n     State of Wyoming; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \n     and Forestry.\n       Whereas, the market concentration of the top three (3) beef \n     packing processing companies has increased dramatically from \n     just thirty-three percent (33%) of the market in 1978 to over \n     eighty percent (80%) of the market in 1996, which has \n     resulted in record low prices for Wyoming cattle producers \n     while consumer prices have steadily increased in relation to \n     the quality of product available; and\n       Whereas, over time this situation has continued to \n     intensity resulting in an alarming loss of input to the \n     overall economy of Wyoming of over two million eight hundred \n     thousand dollars ($2,800,000.00) per day; and\n       Whereas, this trend towards concentration and vertical \n     integration of the livestock industry threatens free \n     enterprise and the independence of Wyoming's and the nation's \n     livestock producers, as well as the economic vitality of the \n     communities and states dependent upon the livestock industry; \n     and\n       Whereas, federal antitrust law is founded on economic \n     principles of preserving competitive markets and a social \n     policy that small business should be preserved; and\n       Whereas, federal antitrust laws, if enforced, ensure that \n     individual businesses do not dominate shares of individual \n     markets to the point of harming the public, including \n     consumers, producers and workers; and\n       Whereas, free competitive markets foster innovation and \n     efficiency, promote free enterprise and public confidence, \n     and are beneficial not only to the general population but to \n     the security of the nation as well: Now, therefore be it \n     Resolved that:\n       Section 1.\n       (a) That Congress direct the Federal Trade Commission, the \n     Packers and Stockyards Administration of the United States \n     Department of Agriculture (U.S.D.A.), the Commodity Futures \n     Trading Commission and the United States Attorney General to \n     enforce existing law to:\n       (i) Prohibit packing processing firms from owning or \n     controlling their live animal inventory needs beyond seven \n     (7) days prior to pickup or delivery; and\n       (ii) Require packing processing firms to report daily the \n     quantity of animals purchased, the kind, quality and \n     respective purchase prices; and\n       (iii) Require packing and processing firms to report weekly \n     the quantity of all products sold as to kind, quality and \n     respective price received for each market category, carcass, \n     boxed, restaurant, export, byproduct, pharmaceuticals, etc.; \n     and\n       (iv) Require meat wholesalers and distributors to report \n     weekly the quantity of product sold, the kind, quality and \n     respective price received for each market category, carcass, \n     boxed, restaurant, export, tripe, byproduct, etc.; and\n       (v) Prohibit packing and processing firms from speculative \n     ``short'' selling of commodity future contracts; and\n       (vi) Require packing processing firms to divest themselves \n     of producing capacity exceeding twenty percent (20%) of total \n     production share; and\n       (vii) Initiative monthly reporting by the U.S.D.A. of the \n     retail value of all meat and meat products and market \n     categories, grocery sales, governmental and institutional \n     sales, catering and restaurant sales, export sales, etc.; and\n       (viii) Lift the federal ban on federal equivalent state \n     inspected meats for interstate commerce; and\n       (ix) Require meat and meat products to have country of \n     origin and processor identification labels; and\n       (x) Require permanent country of origin identification of \n     imported livestock; and\n       (xi) Require all imported or domestic meat, poultry and \n     seafood products subject to the same inspection, testing and \n     labeling process and standards; and\n       (xii) Research for implementation of a value based pricing \n     structure for the live cattle that reflects the premium \n     obtained by the packer processors from the high quality meat \n     products demanded by the consumer in today's market.\n       Section 2.\n       (a) That the legislature hereby formally requests Wyoming's \n     Congressional Delegation to:\n       (i) Take whatever measures are needed to ensure \n     implementation, enactment and enforcement of the items listed \n     in section 1 of this act, and help to coordinate and \n     facilitate the efforts among relevant federal agencies, \n     including the U.S.D.A., the United States Department of \n     Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and the Commodity \n     Futures Trading Commission; and\n       (ii) Introduce and support federal legislation which would \n     protect producers from retaliation by packing processing \n     firms on account of any statement made by producers to USDA \n     officials or to law enforcement agencies or in a public forum \n     regarding practices or actions of the packing processing \n     firms; and\n       (iii) Instigate full scale investigations at the federal \n     level of activities and practices within the USDA and other \n     responsible agencies concerning the gathering, reporting and \n     interpreting of agricultural commodities supply data, and \n     what effects these reports historically have had upon the \n     cash and commodities futures markets.\n       Section 3. That the Secretary of State of Wyoming send \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States, the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House \n     of Representatives of the United States Congress, each member \n     of the Wyoming Congressional Delegation, the Secretary of the \n     United States Department of Agriculture and the Federal Trade \n     Commission, the United States Department of Justice and the \n     Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-54.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Arizona; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                     House Concurrent Memorial 2002\n\n       The state of Arizona and the state of Sonora should adopt \n     resolutions encouraging their respective congresses to \n     allocate more federal monies for:\n       1. Implementation of recommendations resulting from the \n     Nogales unified port management and expedited processing at \n     international crossings pilot projects.\n       2. Highway projects that enhance the linkage of the CANAMEX \n     corridor.\n       3. Port facilities and supporting infrastructure projects \n     that are necessary to improve traffic flow across the border \n     between Arizona and Mexico.\n       4. Binational transportation planning activities; and\n       Whereas, four hundred twenty-four thousand eighty-three \n     commercial vehicles crossed the border between Arizona and \n     Mexico from January 1995 through December 1996 and commercial \n     vehicle traffic is conservatively estimated to increase by \n     ten per cent annually over the next few years with further \n     implementation of the North America Free Trade Agreement; and\n       Whereas, the December 1993 Arizona border infrastructure \n     needs assessment conducted by the Arizona department of \n     transportation estimates that eight hundred fifty million \n     dollars are needed to fund intermodal transportation projects \n     over the next ten years to handle increased commercial \n     traffic as a result of the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement; and\n       Whereas, a 1996 port facilities needs assessment study \n     conducted by the Arizona department of transportation \n     identified three million five hundred thousand dollars in \n     short-term and eighteen million dollars in long-term port \n     facilities projects that are needed to keep pace with the \n     increase in commercial and pedestrian traffic at ports of \n     entry along the border between Arizona and Mexico; and\n       Whereas, during the winter season eighty per cent of the \n     agricultural products coming into the United States are \n     brought through Nogales, Arizona ports of entry; and\n       Whereas, in support of the federal unified port management \n     pilot project, the Arizona legislature appropriated seven \n     hundred fifty thousand dollars to fund a state unified port \n     management project at the Nogales, Arizona port entry that is \n     schedule for completion by July 1, 1997; and\n       Whereas, an expedited processing at international crossings \n     pilot project is being implemented at the Nogales, Arizona \n     port of entry to expedite commercial traffic utilizing state-\n     of-the-art electronic technology and computer systems and is \n     scheduled for completion by November 1997; and\n       Whereas, the three million dollars that the Arizona \n     department of transportation receives each year in federal \n     monies does not adequately cover the department's cost in \n     conducting its required state transportation planning and \n     research activities or the increased demand on the department \n     to fund binational planning activities that are needed to \n     develop a cohesive and coordinated transportation system \n     between Arizona and the border states of Mexico.\n       Whereas, your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       1.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the \n     State of New Jersey; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation.\n\n                       Assembly Resolution No. 9\n\n       Whereas; recent tragic events have reemphasized the \n     importance of keeping our nation's airports secure, and the \n     Assembly Transportation and Communications Committee held a \n     public hearing on airport security matters which highlighted \n     several areas where action should be taken to improve airport \n     security; and\n       Whereas; although the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) \n     is responsible for overseeing all security-related matters at \n     this country's airports, responsibility for implementing \n     airport security is fragmented among airline carriers, \n     airport owners and operators and local police leading to a \n     lack of uniform security procedures; and\n       Whereas; airline carriers are responsible for developing \n     and implementing security procedures and protocols such as \n     passenger\n\n[[Page S5182]]\n\n     and baggage screening, employment standards for screening \n     personnel, controlling access to airplanes, ensuring \n     integrity of cargo and baggage, and performing security \n     inspections of aircraft; and\n       Whereas; the FAA should require criminal background checks \n     and fingerprint records for all airport and airline employees \n     who have access to secure areas and Congress should enact \n     legislation to provide airports and airlines with the \n     necessary authority to conduct such background checks where \n     airports and airlines do not currently have the authority to \n     do so; and\n       Whereas; since airport employees are critical to the effort \n     of ensuring safer air travel, there should be uniform \n     training requirements for all baggage handlers and security \n     officers employed at airports, regardless of who employs \n     them; and\n       Whereas; aggressive, proactive testing of existing security \n     systems and proactive security measures must be implemented \n     at all airports to guard against lapses and complacency that \n     could lead to tragedy; and\n       Whereas; although the Gore Commission has recommended \n     expanded use of bomb-sniffing dogs and the federal government \n     has made some funds available for that purpose, that funding \n     is so inadequate that it will provide only four bomb-\n     sniffing dogs for the three major airports operated by the \n     Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and funding for \n     this program must be increased; and\n       Whereas, the FAA is developing other security measures such \n     as better screening of cargo and mail and blast-resistant \n     containers for cargo, which measures must be implemented as \n     soon as possible; and\n       Whereas, it is altogether fitting and proper and in the \n     public interest for this House to call upon Congress and the \n     FAA to take immediate action to improve airport security; \n     now, therefore,\n       Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. The United States Congress and the Federal Aviation \n     Administration are urged to take immediate action to increase \n     airport security, including: placing responsibility for \n     development and implementation of airport security under one \n     agency to provide for a uniform system of airport security; \n     requiring criminal background checks and fingerprint records \n     for all airport and airline employees who have access to \n     secure areas; implementing uniform training requirements for \n     all baggage handlers and security officers employed at \n     airports, regardless of who employs them; implementing \n     aggressive, proactive testing of existing security systems \n     and proactive security measures; increased funding for the \n     bomb-sniffing dog program; and speeding development and \n     implementation of other security measures such as better \n     screening of cargo and mail and blast-resistant containers \n     for cargo.\n       2. duly authenticated copies of this resolution, signed by \n     the Speaker of the General Assembly and attested to by the \n     Clerk thereof, shall be transmitted to the presiding officers \n     of the United States Senate and House of Representatives, \n     each member of Congress elected thereto from New jersey and \n     the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-66.

Thus, BLM would have law \n     enforcement authority for activities on private lands \n     adjacent to and upstream from BLM lands; and\n       Whereas, the proposed rules would give BLM authority to \n     preempt state laws over motor vehicles on BLM lands when the \n     state laws are less restrictive than the proposed rules or \n     when a state does not have laws covering the areas included \n     in the BLM proposed rules; and\n       Whereas, the rules would prohibit the diversion, transport \n     or removal of any water resources that are owned or reserved \n     by the United States and administered by BLM unless BLM gave \n     prior authorization. This would prohibit states that own \n     water that is reserved to the federal government and \n     administered by BLM from constructing dams, transporting \n     water or removing water resources.\n       Wherefore your memorialist, the House of Representatives of \n     the State of Arizona, the Senate concurring, prays:\n       1.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Washington; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial 4005\n\n       Whereas, The area south of the Saddle Mountains in Grant, \n     Franklin, and Adams counties, Washington, known as the \n     Wahluke Slope, is one of the most productive argricultural \n     areas in the Pacific Northwest; and\n       Whereas, the need for a large security and control zone \n     around the Department of Energy's Hanford control zone on \n     Wahluke Slope caused the forced relocation of citizens of \n     Hanford, White Bluff, Wahluke, and the surrounding \n     agricultural lands that had been settled prior to 1900; and\n       Whereas, Due to the decommissioning of all the production \n     reactors along the Hanford Reach opposite the Wahluke Slope, \n     and with the overall change of the Department of Energy's \n     Hanford mission from plutonium production to environmental \n     restoration, the need for a large security and control zone \n     no longer exists; and\n       Whereas, The Wahluke Slope's topography and its proximity \n     to the Columbia River make the area unique in terms of the \n     economic feasibility or irrigation development; and\n       Whereas, Prior to its inclusion in the Hanford control \n     zone, the Bureau of Reclamation purchased over twenty-seven \n     thousand acres of the Wahluke Slope with the intent of future \n     development in the Columbia Basin Project; and\n       Whereas, The balanced development of this land would \n     achieve the long-awaited completion of irrigation on the \n     Wahluke Slope and improved wildlife and recreational \n     opportunities; and\n       Whereas, Based on current land prices, the sale of land to \n     private owners could potentially cover a great deal of the \n     cost of constructing water delivery systems, due to the \n     suitability of topography and nearby water supply; and\n       Whereas, Resulting property tax and income tax revenues \n     from this new farm land would be an immediate and significant \n     benefit; and\n       Whereas, Farmland development would result in millions of \n     dollars in capital investment for farm equipment of all \n     kinds, the great majority of its manufactured in the United \n     States by American workers; and\n       Whereas, The vast majority of crops presently raised on the \n     Wahluke Slope have potential for export to the Pacific Rim \n     and other nations; and\n       Whereas, Other than small grains, the crops grown on the \n     Wahluke Slope are completely driven by the free-market \n     economy and are not subsidized or supported by the federal \n     government; and\n       Whereas, Broad support exists for the preservation of the \n     natural beauty and topography of the Hanford Reach, including \n     protecting the White Bluffs from sloughing into the Columbia \n     River, prohibiting dredging and damming, and providing for a \n     one-quarter mile buffer zone on both sides of the river \n     including even wider zones depending on the terrain; and\n       Whereas, The Wahluke Slope contains significant areas of \n     land not suitable for farming, but that are ideally suited \n     for wildlife habitat and recreational uses; and\n       Whereas, The United States can no longer afford to hold \n     idle public lands of this potential;\n       Now, Therefore, Your Memorialists respectfully pray that, \n     except for needed buffer zones, the present boundaries of the \n     Department of Energy's Hanford control zone on the Wahluke \n     Slope be reduced to the area south of the Columbia River \n     and that the Wahluke Slope presently under the custody and \n     control of the Department of Energy be transferred in \n     total to the counties of Grant, Franklin, and Adams for \n     the purpose of returning the land to its former \n     agricultural use, as well as for wildlife and recreational \n     areas along the Hanford Reach.\n       Be it resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable William J.

Sec. Sec. 869 \n     et seq.) which, if it had been enacted, would have included \n     affordable housing as a public purpose for which public lands \n     may be disposed of in any manner to governmental bodies and \n     to nonprofit corporations; and\n       Whereas, during the 104th session of Congress, \n     Representative John Ensign joined Senator Bryan in \n     introducing the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of \n     1996, which, if it had been enacted, might have provided \n     additional opportunities for the acquisition of land in the \n     Las Vegas Valley to be used to provide additional sites for \n     affordable housing; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the Nevada Legislature supports the efforts of \n     Senator Bryan and Representative Ensign in this regard and \n     urges the Nevada Congressional Delegation to continue to \n     bring this issue before Congress; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Congress of the United States is hereby \n     urged to adopt an amendment to the Recreation and Public \n     Purposes Act which would include affordable housing as a \n     public purpose for which public lands may be disposed of in \n     any manner to governmental bodies and to nonprofit \n     corporations; and be it further\n       Resolved, That if Congress does not adopt such an amendment \n     to the Recreation and Public Purposes Act, that Congress is \n     hereby urged to enact legislation that would allow the sale \n     of public lands to local governments and to nonprofit \n     corporations at a price that is less than the fair market \n     value of the land so that affordable housing projects may be \n     developed; and be it further.\n       Resolved, That the chief clerk of the assembly prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage and approval.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-77.

Enormous energy and expense are \n     directed to finding means to reduce the volume of solid \n     waste, to utilize limited landfill space safely and \n     efficiently, and to incorporate other means of disposing of \n     waste without endangering air, soil, or water. In spite of \n     great progress, there remain serious long-term unresolved \n     issues involving solid waste; and\n       Whereas, since there are limited disposal options, there is \n     considerably demand for landfill space and other disposal \n     facilities. In response to this situation, solid waste is \n     often transported across local, state, and even international \n     boundaries for storage or disposal away from where the solid \n     waste is generated. Communities in Michigan are dealing with \n     this reality today; and\n       Whereas, the potential problems of imported solid waste are \n     many. Even areas with ample storage capacity or facilities \n     now will face shortages in the future, leaving a local \n     problem of how to handle solid waste. Eventual problems with \n     a landfill site or other facility will not be handled by an \n     out-of-state or out-of-country party. The burdens will be \n     borne by those in the area importing solid wastes. Given the \n     nature of our delicate environment, especially in Michigan, \n     the ultimate risks are not restricted to the specific local \n     unit of government; and\n       Whereas, since states will bear the responsibility and face \n     the consequences when and if solid waste landfills or other \n     facilities encounter problems, it is essential that states be \n     empowered to regulate this activity. Measures in Congress \n     have proposed extending authority to the states to deal with \n     this issue, an approach that is long overdue; now, therefore, \n     be it\n\n[[Page S5185]]\n\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to authorize states to regulate the flow of solid \n     waste from other states or another country; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-85. A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of the \n     State of New Jersey; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n       Whereas, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \n     Act of 1991 (ISTEA), signed into law by the President in \n     December 1991, is a six year program authorized to provide a \n     total of $155 billion for highway and mass transportation \n     purposes; and\n       Whereas, ISTEA has provided significant, annual federal \n     funds to New Jersey and all other states to help develop a \n     strong, globally-competitive economy and to improve the \n     mobility, safety and well-being of our nation's residents; \n     and\n       Whereas, our state, regional and national transportation \n     systems still face growing travel demand, inadequate \n     capacity, ``bottlenecks,'' and awkward connections between \n     different forms of transportation; and\n       Whereas, the need to continue and accelerate improvements \n     to our transportation systems is absolutely vital for \n     economic growth, to address safety and environmental \n     concerns, and to reduce the costs and disruptions that an \n     inefficient transportation system imposes on our residents; \n     and\n       Whereas, a federal role of providing leadership and long-\n     term funding remains essential if a smooth, seamless highway \n     and mass transportation system is to be achieved and then \n     maintained; and\n       Whereas, a direct federal role is also especially important \n     to the viability of AMTRAK, and an annual, financial \n     commitment acknowledging such federal role must be \n     reemphasized by the President and Congress if our national \n     railroad is to reach the status, importance, and efficiency \n     of national railroads in other competitive, economically \n     developed countries; now, therefore,\n       Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. The President and the Congress of the United States are \n     urged to reauthorize [ISTEA] the federal Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), prior to its \n     expiration in October 1997, for a period of time and a level \n     of funding that are no less than current ISTEA authorization \n     levels and providing that New Jersey's share of that funding \n     is no less than its current ISTEA share. Timely \n     reauthorization of ISTEA is paramount if states are to \n     continue, without interruption, their efforts to improve and \n     enhance the effectiveness of our nation's state, regional, \n     and national transportation systems.

Solutions in small, \n     densely populated eastern states may not make sense in the \n     west. One size does not fit all, so the federal government \n     should refrain from mandating solutions.\n       Be it further resolved, That the Secretary of State send a \n     copy of this resolution to the Director of the Montana \n     Department of Transportation, the President of the United \n     States, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     and each member of the Montana Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-87.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 38\n\n       Whereas, though Texans are faced with pressing surface \n     transportation needs that require immediate attention and \n     revenue to remedy existing problems and to keep pace with \n     growing demands, the state continues to lose money each year \n     under the current federal funding formula that requires the \n     state to contribute more to the national Highway Trust Fund \n     than it is apportioned back; and\n       Whereas, the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \n     Act of 1991 (ISTEA) was created to sustain and enhance a \n     strong national surface transportation network through the \n     National Highway System and to expand other programs to \n     ensure that states' transportation plans are intermodal, \n     environmentally sound, and energy efficient; and\n       Whereas, since its passage, however, funding provisions \n     contained in the ISTEA have traditionally benefited some \n     states at the expense of others, inflicting a heavy penalty \n     that, in Texas alone, has cost this state millions of dollars \n     that could have been used to repair and augment the Texas \n     highway system; and\n       Whereas, the expiration of ISTEA on September 30, 1997, and \n     the disparity in the current apportionment of highway funds \n     have prompted a coalition of more than 20 states, including \n     Texas, to join together to develop the Streamlined \n     Transportation Efficiency Program for the 21st Century (STEP \n     21); while acknowledging the need for a broadly focused \n     national surface transportation policy, the program \n     recognizes that the surface transportation needs of each and \n     region differ greatly and promotes a simplified federal \n     surface transportation program that would significantly \n     benefit mobility and the national economy while giving each \n     state more flexibility to respond to diverse local needs; and\n       Whereas, currently before Congress in the form of the ISTEA \n     Integrity Restoration\n\n[[Page S5187]]\n\n     Act, the STEP 21 program seeks to revise the apportionment \n     adjustment formula to ensure that all states receive at least \n     a 95 percent return on tax payments made to the Highway Trust \n     Fund while continuing to provide an adequate level of funding \n     for states with special circumstances; it would further \n     provide states with more autonomy to respond to their \n     specific state and local transportation needs, would \n     consolidate and streamline various federal highway programs, \n     and would distribute new program funds using simplified, \n     objective criteria; and\n       Whereas, the STEP 21 proposal would bring more Texas motor \n     fuels tax dollars back to the state, giving state officials \n     greater control over where available surface transportation \n     funds should be spent and providing them with the flexibility \n     to use funds from various sources to meet Texas' \n     transportation needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the 75th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby respectfully urge the Congress of the United States to \n     support the passage of the Steamlined Transportation \n     Efficiency Program for the 21st Century (STEP 21); and, be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the 75th Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby encourage the members of the Texas delegation of the \n     Congress of the United States to cosponsor the ISTEA \n     Integrity Restoration Act; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all the members of the Texas congressional \n     delegation with the request that this resolution be \n     officially entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial \n     to the Congress of the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-91.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n       Whereas, for over one hundred years, Dalton, Massachusetts \n     has been the home of Crane and Company the producer of high \n     quality currency paper; and\n       Whereas, the product manufactured at Crane and Company has \n     been of outstanding grade, produced by an experienced work \n     force, under the direction of a superior management and \n     within the guidelines of the free enterprise system; and\n       Whereas, Crane and Company has abided by all the \n     appropriate business practices established by the United \n     States Bureau of Engraving and Printing; and\n       Whereas, U.S. Treasury officials have now proposed a \n     procedure that encourages foreign companies to unfairly \n     compete against Crane and Company by offering a subsidy of \n     United States tax dollars which, if implemented, could \n     potentially harm the economic structure of western \n     Massachusetts; and\n       Whereas, Crane and Company, a family owned business, has \n     been built by the traditional method of hard work and \n     diligence, with private capital and investment, and has, \n     since its inception, given generously to the community; now \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Massachusetts Senate hereby calls upon \n     the Secretary of the United States Treasury to suspend any \n     programs or actions that promote or provide for the \n     subsidizing of foreign industries for the purpose of \n     manufacturing United States currency paper; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be transmitted \n     forthwith by the clerk of the senate to the President of the \n     United States, the presiding officers of each branch of \n     Congress and the Members thereof from this Commonwealth, the \n     Secretary of the United States Treasury and the Governor of \n     the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-99. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 365\n\n       Whereas, the states of Connecticut, New York, Indiana, and \n     California have established public/private long-term care \n     partnerships; and\n       Whereas, these partnerships encourage the purchase of \n     approved long-term care insurance policies by offering \n     purchasers enhanced asset protection under the Medicaid \n     program; and\n       Whereas, under such a partnership program, if a \n     policyholder requires long-term care and eventually exhausts \n     his or her private insurance benefits, the policyholder is \n     permitted to keep more of his or her assets while still \n     qualifying for Medicaid coverage; and\n       Whereas, the 1993 Session of the General Assembly requested \n     a study of the advantages of public/private partnerships to \n     encourage the purchase of long-term care insurance in an \n     attempt to formulate an innovative program to slow the growth \n     of Medicaid funding for long-term care; and\n       Whereas, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 \n     includes a provision, Sec. 13612 (a) (C), that discourages \n     additional states from implementing such partnerships by \n     requiring states to make recovery from the estates of persons \n     who had enjoyed enhanced Medicaid asset protection, making \n     the asset protection provided by such partnerships only \n     temporary; and\n       Whereas, the removed of Sec. 13612 (a) (C) would allow \n     additional states to establish asset protection programs for \n     individuals who purchase qualified long-term care insurance \n     policies without requiring states to recover such assets upon \n     a beneficiary's death; and\n       Whereas, the removed of Sec. 13612 (a) (C) would make such \n     partnerships much more attractive to potential participants, \n     especially if they are motivated by a desire to pass some of \n     their assets on to their children; and\n       Whereas, having long-term care insurance reduces the \n     possibility that persons will spend down to Medicaid \n     eligibility levels; and\n       Whereas, long-term care insurance, by reducing the Medicaid \n     expenditures for policyholders, helps states control Medicaid \n     costs; now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Delegates concurring. \n     That Congress be urged to repeal Sec. 13612 (a) (C) of the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit a \n     copy of this resolution to the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the \n     Congressional Delegation of Virginia in order that they may \n     be apprised of the sense of the General Assembly in this \n     matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-100.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth\n\n[[Page S5191]]\n\n     of Massachusetts; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n       Whereas, targeted business incentive programs have \n     proliferated into a counterproductive economic War Between \n     the States and now form the cornerstone of State-sponsored \n     ``economic development'' policies; and\n       Whereas, these programs fail to promote healthy and \n     equitable statewide economic growth and, in reality, result \n     in States engaging in economic warfare by moving businesses \n     from one location to another both within and between States, \n     with no significant economic benefit in the aggregate; and\n       Whereas, America's future in the global economy lies within \n     its educational, industrial, technological, and research \n     capabilities throughout the entire fifty States; and\n       Whereas, disarmament of wasteful programs can be achieved \n     through a combination of new State and Federal policies; and\n       Whereas, States would be better off providing a less \n     burdensome tax climate for all businesses and a quality \n     educational system geared to providing an adequately trained \n     and ready work force, support for research and development, \n     and a quality transportation system, along with other high-\n     quality traditional Government services; and\n       Whereas, efforts are currently under way in the United \n     States Congress to identify and eliminate federally funded \n     programs that are used by the States to escalate this \n     economic warfare: Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Massachusetts House of Representatives \n     urges the Congress of the United States to embrace and \n     support efforts in the United States Congress such as H.R. \n     1842 and other legislative initiatives that will begin to \n     mitigate this economic warfare: And be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be forwarded by \n     the Clerk of the House of Representatives to the Presiding \n     Officer of each branch of the Congress, and to the members \n     thereof from this Commonwealth.\n       POM-109. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia; to the Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 415\n\n       Whereas, the federal government distributed almost $229 \n     billion in grants to state and local governments in federal \n     fiscal year 1995; and\n       Whereas, Virginia received approximately $3.5 billion in \n     federal grants in federal fiscal year 1995; and\n       Whereas, Virginia's receipt of federal grants on a per-\n     capita basis is the lowest of any state in the country and \n     has been for five consecutive years; and\n       Whereas, many federal grants are awarded using mathematical \n     formulas that may be disadvantageous to the Commonwealth; and\n       Whereas, the United States General Accounting Office last \n     prepared a catalogue of federal grant formulas in 1987; and\n       Whereas, an updated catalogue of federal grant formulas is \n     vital for Virginia to better understand and address its \n     receipt of federal grant moneys: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates, the Senate concurring, \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged to direct the \n     General Accounting Office to update its 1987 catalogue of \n     federal grant-in-aid formulas as soon as possible; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the members of the Congressional \n     Delegation of Virginia, and the Director of the Virginia \n     Liaison Office in order that they may be apprised of the \n     sense of the General Assembly of Virginia in this matter.\n       POM-110. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia; to the Committee on \n     Governmental Affairs.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 228\n\n       Whereas, the federal government was granted carefully \n     limited powers by the states through the ratification of the \n     Constitution of the United States; and\n       Whereas, the 10th Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States specifies that ``the powers not delegated to \n     the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it \n     to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to \n     the people''; and\n       Whereas, the framers of the Constitution recognized that \n     the separation of powers is essential in protecting the \n     rights of the people and extends not only to the three \n     branches of the federal government, but also to the \n     relationship between the federal government and state \n     governments; and\n       Whereas, the three branches of the federal government have \n     by many actions usurped powers reserved by the Constitution \n     of the United States to the states and the people, thus \n     severely unbalancing the relationship between the federal \n     government and the state governments; and\n       Whereas, the federal judiciary has not taken any action to \n     control these unwarranted assumptions of power by the federal \n     government; and\n       Whereas, less federal preemption means states can act as \n     true laboratories of democracy, developing novel social and \n     economic policies without intruding into the affairs of the \n     rest of the nation; and\n       Whereas, in order to restore the balance of power between \n     the federal government and state governments as intended by \n     the framers of the Constitution of the United States, the \n     federal government must carefully consider, and be \n     accountable for, the constitutional boundaries of its \n     jurisdiction; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Delegates concurring, \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged to enact \n     legislation that would require Congress to cite the \n     constitutional authority for all proposed laws; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the enabling legislation enacted by \n     Congress contain the following provisions:\n       1. To require Congress to state explicitly the extent to \n     which the proposed section of any new law preempts any state, \n     local, or tribal law, and if so, to provide the reasons for \n     such preemptions;\n       2. To prohibit federal agencies from promulgating rules or \n     regulations (i) that preempt or otherwise interfere with \n     state and local powers without expressed statutory authority \n     and (ii) that do not give states notice and an opportunity to \n     be heard in the rule-making process; and\n       3. If clause 3 of Section 8 of Article I of the \n     Constitution of the United States is cited as the \n     constitutional authority for the proposed law, to require \n     Congress to report a list of factual findings establishing a \n     substantial nexus between the regulatory effect of the \n     proposed law and interstate commerce; and, be it\n       Resolved finally, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     and the members of the Congressional Delegation of Virginia \n     in order that they may be apprised of the sense of the \n     General Assembly in this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/02/senate-section/article/S5178-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            REPORT OF COMMITTEE SUBMITTED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of May 23, 1997, the \nfollowing reports of committees were submitted on May 28, 1997:\n\n       By Mr. MURKOWSKI, from the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources, with an amendment in the nature of a substitute:\n       S. 210.

A bill to designate the United States courthouse at 200 South \nWashington Street in Alexandria, Virginia, as the ``Martin V.B. \nBostetter, Jr. United States Courthouse''; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\nTHE MARTIN V.B. BOSTETTER, JR. UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE DESIGNATION ACT \n                                OF 1997\n\n   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to \ndesignate the U.S. Bankruptcy Courthouse, at 200 S. Washington Street \nin Alexandria, VA the ``Martin V.B. Bostetter, Jr. United States \nCourthouse.''\n  I authored previous legislation which is now law, authorizing the \ntransfer of the Albert V. Bryan U.S. Courthouse building name from 200 \nS. Washington Street to the new Alexandria U.S. Courthouse. Since that \ntime the old Albert V. Bryan Courthouse has remained nameless, while \nstill serving the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. I can think of no better \nperson to name the bankruptcy court after than Chief Judge Bostetter \ngiven his long service to the bankruptcy court in Alexandria.\n  Chief Judge Bostetter is currently the Chief Judge for the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia. He was appointed to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in \n1959, and appointed Chief Judge on February 1, 1985. He has the longest \ntenure on the bench of any bankruptcy judge in the country, a record he \nwill probably hold for sometime.\n\n[[Page S5192]]\n\n  Born in Baltimore, MD, on March 11, 1926, Judge Bostetter, has spent \nmost of his life in Virginia. He attended Mount Vernon High School in \nFairfax County, VA, and, after serving in the U.S. Navy during World \nWar II, attended the University of Virginia where he obtained his B.A. \nDegree in 1950 and his law degree LL.B. Degree in 1952.\n  I might add that I attended the University of Virginia Law School \nentering in 1949, then serving in the Korean war and returning for \ncompletion of my degree in 1953, 1 year after Judge Bostetter.\n  Since 1952, Chief Judge Bostetter's entire legal career has occurred \nwithin an 8 block radius of Old Town Alexandria. He began his practice \nof law in the city of Alexandria, and, in 1953 he was appointed special \nassistant to the city attorney, serving in the capacity of city \nprosecutor. Judge Bostetter resigned that position in 1957 to become \nassociate judge of the municipal court of the city of Alexandria, where \nhe served for a period of 2 years, resigning in 1959.\n  In 1959, Chief Judge Bostetter set up the first Bankruptcy Court in \nAlexandria at 200 S. Washington St.--the very building which he now \noccupies as Chief Judge of the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia 38 years later.\n  Over the last 38 years Judge Bostetter has seen the work of the \nBankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia grow from 9 \nfilings per month to more than 2,600 filings per month and its \npersonnel requirements increase from 1 clerk to three divisions with 5 \nfull time judges and an administrative staff of 90 employees. The \nAlexandria Division where Judge Bostetter serves now has 2 full time \njudges, 22 employees and averages 790 filings per month. During much of \nhis career, Judge Bostetter has, by necessity, handled this \nincreasingly heavy case load of approximately 2\\1/2\\ judges.\n  During his tenure as a bankruptcy judge, Chief Judge Bostetter has \nbeen a dedicated and loyal public servant serving the people of \nVirginia faithfully with honor, integrity and distinction. Chief Judge \nBostetter has fulfilled his duties as a bankruptcy judge with a strong \nsense of fairness and pragmatism while at the same time adhering to the \nconstraints imposed by the Bankruptcy Code and related caselaw. In \naddition, Chief Judge Bostetter has set very high standards for the \nlawyers who practice before him making those lawyers better prepared \nand more effective advocates for their respective clients' interests.\n  Mr. President, in addition to being an accomplished jurist, Judge \nBostetter has also held several other distinguished positions. In 1957, \nhe was appointed by the city of Alexandria as one of the original \ncommissioners to serve on the Juvenile Detention Commission for \nNorthern Virginia and served as its chairman from the inception of the \ncommission until 1974. In 1959, the Alexandria Junior Chamber of \nCommerce awarded him the Distinguished Service Award as the \n``Outstanding Young Man of the Year 1959,'' and the Kiwanis Club of \nAlexandria designated him as an honorary member for his civic \ncontributions to the city. In 1960, he was nominated by the Alexandria \nJunior Chamber of Commerce as 1 of the 10 outstanding men of the United \nStates for his work on the Juvenile Detention Commission.\n  Along with his responsibilities as a bankruptcy judge, Chief Judge \nBostetter served as a member of the Committee on Court Administration \nof the Judicial Conference of the United States from July 1, 1982, \nuntil it was dissolved by reorganization of the Judicial Conference in \n1987. On October 16, 1984, he was elected by the Judicial Conference of \nthe United States to the Board of Directors of the Federal Judicial \nCenter, serving in that position until September 1987. He is a former \nmember of the Transition Advisory Committee on Bankruptcy to the \nDirector of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. In 1986, he \nwas appointed by Chief Justice Warren Burger as chairman of a committee \nto expand and improve the educational programs for all bankruptcy \njudges. Justice Rehnquist, upon assuming the position of Chief Justice \nof the United States, reappointed Chief Judge Bostetter to continue as \nchairman of that committee until his term expired in 1989. In addition, \nChief Judge Bostetter was appointed to the State-Federal Judicial \nRelations Committee of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1991.\n  In addition to his significant public service as a judge, Chief Judge \nBostetter has a strong record of civic contributions as well. He has \nserved as president of the Alexandria Bar Association, president of the \nAlexandria Junior Chamber of Commerce, president and chairman of the \nBoard of the Alexandria Sertoma Club, president of Alexandria Mental \nHealth Association, and has also served on the boards of the Alexandria \nHospital Corporation, the Alexandria Mental Health Clinic, the \nAlexandria Community Chest, and the Alexandria Boys' Club.\n  Mr. President, I can think of no better tribute to Judge Bostetter \nthan to name the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, at 200 South Washington Street, \nAlexandria, VA the Martin V.B. Bostetter, Jr. U.S. Bankruptcy \nCourthouse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

THURMOND submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                               S. Res. 95\n\n       Whereas the Parachute Test Platoon was authorized by the \n     War Department on June 25, 1940, to experiment with the \n     potential use of airborne troops;\n       Whereas the Parachute Test Platoon was composed of 48 \n     volunteers who began training in July 1940;\n       Whereas the Parachute Test Platoon performed the first \n     official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940;\n       Whereas the success of the Parachute Test Platoon led to \n     the formation of a large and successful airborne contingent \n     serving from World War II until the present;\n       Whereas the 82d Airborne Division was the first Airborne \n     Division that was organized following the successes of the \n     Parachute Test Platoon and the early airborne training \n     program and has continued in active service since its \n     creation;\n       Whereas the 82d Airborne Division Association exists to \n     continue and foster that special esprit de corps among fellow \n     paratroopers, to perpetuate the memory of the 82d Airborne \n     Division troopers who fought and died for our Nation, and to \n     further the common bond among all members of the airborne \n     community; and\n       Whereas the 82d Airborne Division Association, during the \n     52d year of existence and at the 50th Annual Convention, \n     adopted a resolution to perpetuate the memory of the \n     Parachute Test Platoon's ``Jump Into History'' on August 16, \n     1940: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates August 16, 1997, as ``National Airborne \n     Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the Federal, State, and local administrators and \n     the people of the United States to observe the day with \n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit today a Senate \nresolution proclaiming August 16, 1997, as ``National Airborne Day.''\n  On June 25, 1940, the War Department authorized the Parachute Test \nPlatoon to experiment with the potential use of airborne troops. The \nParachute Test Platoon, which was composed of 48 volunteers, performed \nthe first official Army parachute jump on August 16, 1940. The success \nof the platoon led to the formation of a large and successful airborne \ncontingent that has served from World War II until the present.\n  The 82d Airborne Division was the first airborne division to be \norganized. In a 2-year period during World War II, the regiments of the \n82d served in Italy at Anzio, in France at Normandy--where I landed \nwith them--and at the Battle of the Bulge. During this tumultuous \nperiod in our Nation's history, these brave soldiers served with \ndistinction, as they have done for 55 years. It is only fitting that we \nhonor them.\n  I urge you to join with me in sponsoring National Airborne Day to \nexpress our support for the members of the airborne community and also \nour gratitude for their tireless commitment to our Nation's defense and \nideals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/02/senate-section/article/S5193-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5193-S5194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n TRIBUTE TO THE NEW HAMPSHIRE DELEGATES ATTENDING A NATIONAL SUMMIT ON \n                              VOLUNTEERISM\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the New Hampshire delegates who represented the Granite \nState at the National Summit on Volunteerism in Philadelphia from April \n27 through April 29. The 3-day summit focused on the challenges facing \nour Nation's children and youth, and encouraged Americans to dedicate \ntheir time and talents to communities and children. It was organized on \nthe suggestion that America's young people have access to five \nfundamental resources. These resources include an ongoing relationship \nwith an adult, safe places during nonschool hours to learn, a healthy \nstart, a skill through effective education, and the opportunity to give \nback through community service.\n  I would like today to honor the individuals from my State who gave \ntheir time and energy so our children can remain safe and strong.

They are experienced in creating \nopportunities for others to contribute to solutions, and have a record \nof getting things done. Above all, they are trusted by others in their \ncommunity and for that they can be very proud.\n  The summit proved to be beneficial. The representatives from New \nHampshire combined their efforts with delegates from Delaware. They \ncame up with creative plans to bring adults and college students into \nManchester's public schools together to help establish a mentoring \nprogram. The New Hampshire delegates will meet again in the summer to \nreview this proposal and the other ideas they collected and decide how \nto use them.\n  I commend the New Hampshire delegates on their willingness to help \nmake the Granite State a better place to live, and to ignite the spirit \nof volunteerism to provide a strong foundation for America's youth. New \nHampshire is fortunate to be blessed by their leadership and \ndedication. I applaud them for their outstanding work, and am proud to \nrepresent all of them in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/02/senate-section/article/S5193-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HEALTH CARE PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on May 23, I introduced \nlegislation designed to maintain rural communities' access to hospital \ncare.\n  Today many rural Americans live in fear that they may lose access to \nlocal and regional hospital care. In these rural areas, where serious \naccidents, often related to farm equipment, are a constant threat. \nAccess to an emergency care hospital within 35 miles can mean the \ndifference between life and death. The ability to be referred to a \nmajor regional hospital for more specialized care can be of like \nimportance. Congress must recognize the special needs of rural America \nand work to meet them. This bill is a step in the right direction.\n  The Rural Health Care Protection Act of 1997 focuses on providing \nsupport of sole community hospitals and rural referral centers. Sole \ncommunity hospitals [SCH's] are hospitals located at least 35 miles \nfrom other hospitals and are often the sole source of emergency care or \nimpatient services in their areas. There are currently 728 SCH's in 46 \nStates. There are 11 in my home State of Iowa. Rural referral centers \n[RRC's] are relatively large and specialized rural hospitals which \nreceive referrals from community hospitals throughout a region. There \nare currently 142 RRC's in 39 States, including 5 in Iowa.\n  This legislation contains four proposals designed to help keep these \ncare centers operating. First, the act would give SCH's the option of \nchoosing an updated fiscal year 1994-95 base year for Medicare funding \ninstead of the outdated based years which they must currently use. \nSecond, the act would permanently grandfather as an RRC any hospital \nthat has previously qualified as an RRC. Third, the act would exempt \nthe RRC's from the statewide rural wage index threshold for geographic \nreclassification. Finally, the bill would allow rural hospitals that \nmeet the reclassification criteria to be reclassified as urban \nhospitals for purposes of disproportionate share hospital [DSH] payment \nadjustments.\n  This bill would help ensure that rural Americans maintain access to \nthese essential care centers. I ask my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to join me in support of this measures. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/02/senate-section/article/S5194-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JUNE 3, 1997\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Therefore, Senators \ncan expect rollcall votes throughout tomorrow's session of the Senate \nas we make progress on this important legislation.\n  A cloture motion was filed this evening on the pending amendment to \nS. 4, and therefore Members can anticipate a cloture vote on Wednesday \nmorning.
